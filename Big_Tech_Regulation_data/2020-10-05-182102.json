EDT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please sit down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I want to thank you all for being here a very special day, a very important day. Many of you are friends, and many of you are friends that I don't know what you look like, but I know what you sound like (laughter) which, I guess, is probably more important. Right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I want to thank you. And it's a terrific it's a terrific day to be together. And, if you look, you're in a very famous place. We all work very hard. And I don't know if you call it \"influence,\" I don't know if you call it \"power,\" but whatever it is, we're in the White House. And we're going to stay in the White, and we're going to get our agenda done and completed beautifully. (Applause.)</p><p>So I'm thrilled to welcome you here. And we're all working very hard. And I don't know if you know, but we just did 27,000 on the Dow. That's the highest in history. We're up a couple of hundred points today. (Applause.) The highest in history for those of you that like the stock market.</p><p>But the stock market means jobs. I view it as jobs, and I view it as 401(k)s. A lot of people say, \"Oh, the rich people are getting rich.\" But if you look at the numbers, the greatest impact, proportionately, is blue-collar workers in what's happened, in this miracle that's happening. (Applause.)</p><p>And people with 401(k)s, they're up 72 percent and 67 percent. And the wife or the husband whoever is responsible the other one says, \"You're a genius. You're a great financial investor.\" (Laughter.) \"Darling, you're up 77 percent this year.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>So a lot of good things happened. A lot of people are happy. And I think, really, everybody is happy; some people just aren't willing to admit it. Does that make sense? (Laughter.)</p><p>So this is a historic day. Never before have so many online journalists and influencers and that's exactly what you are; you're journalists and you're influencers come together in this building to discuss the future of social media.</p><p>Each of you is fulfilling a vital role in our nation. You're challenging the media gatekeepers and the corporate censors to bring the facts straight to the American people. And that's what you're doing you're going right to the people.</p><p>Possibly, we wouldn't be here right now. I asked somebody, \"What do you think I'd do without social media? Would I be here?\" Because I said, \"I think so.\" (Laughter.) But they weren't so sure. (Laughter.) I have to say that; you know that. I'm not sure I believe that, but I have to say it.</p><p>But you communicate directly with our citizens without having to go through the fake-news filter. It's very simple. Together, you reach more people than any television broadcast network by far not even close.</p><p>We're delighted to be joined at this summit by someone you know very well: our Senior Advisor for Digital Strategy and somebody that's been working for me for a long time, for many years, Dan Scavino. Where is Dan? (Applause.) Stand up. Come here. Great job.</p><p>So, long before we were even doing this, he was at a club running a club and other businesses. And he was okay at doing it. (Laughter.) Not the greatest. I wouldn't say the greatest. (Laughter.) But you know what he was great at? He was always looking at his computer screen. I said, \"That guy is incredible.\"</p><p>So, right at the beginning, I said, \"That's the man.\" And there was nobody better at that. And I think Hillary had 28 people and I had Dan. (Laughter.) Right? (Applause.) I had my Dan. And he works about 28 hours a day, and he works very hard. But he doesn't work I mean, he loves it. He loves it.</p><p>And his imagination and, really, working with all of you and many of you he'll come up with ideas and you'll come up with ideas. And he'll run into my office. He said, \"You got to see this.\"</p><p>And a lot of times, I'll go out and I'll spend a lot of money on a concept. I'll say, \"Here's a concept. Come up with this.\" And we'll hire these companies, and they want a lot of money. And they come back it just happened the other day, right? I said, \"That's terrible. These guys have no talent.\" (Laughter.) The people that have the talent are the people that we deal with. And it's true.</p><p>And some of you are extraordinary. I can't say everybody, but (laughter). No, but some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable. (Laughter and applause.) True. Unbelievable.</p><p>So I'm going to go back to the basics of Washington. I'm going to introduce some of my Secretaries. Steve Mnuchin. Steve? Where's Steve? Steve has done a fantastic job. (Applause.)</p><p>Wilbur Ross. Wilbur? We have a meeting (applause) in a little while, on the census and citizenship. Can you believe: \"Are you a citizen of the United States of America?\" \"Sir, you can't ask that question.\" (Laughter.) \"Why?\" \"Because the court said you can't.\"</p><p>We have three very unfriendly courts. They fight us all the way. The judges don't like us too much, I guess. But think of that, Herman. Think of that question: Are you a citizen?</p><p>We spend this is another thing that's so crazy: $20 billion on a census $20 billion. They spend $20 billion. I said, 20 billion what? (Laughter.) Twenty billion dollars on a census.</p><p>They go through houses they go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. How many toilets do they have? How many desks do they have? How many beds? What's their roof made of? (Laughter.) The only thing we can't ask is, Are you a citizen of the United States? (Laughter and applause.) No, isn't it the craziest thing? Twenty billion. (Applause.) Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing, Charlie.</p><p>Also, David Bernhardt, great job you're doing Interiors. (Applause.) He's the largest landlord in the United States. When my friends tell me how big they are, they I just bought another building. Big deal, Kevin, right? They bought another building. Then I look at David Bernhardt; he controls half of the United States. (Laughter.) Department of Interior. There's a lot of land a lot of beautiful land that we're taking good care of, David. Right?</p><p>Acting Director Russ Vought. Russ, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) We're working on our budget. (Applause.)</p><p>Along with some of the great members of Congress and a wonderful friend of mine who's my Leader, right? He's my Leader. I tell him that to his face because it makes him feel good. I don't know if I believe that, Marsha. (Laughter.) But, Kevin stand up, Kevin. Kevin McCarthy, everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>Senator Marsha Blackburn of the great state of Tennessee. We campaigned together. (Applause.) And she did we can say it now: She ran against the most popular Democrat in the last 50 years. He really was great. A good man, right? THE PRESIDENT: And governor for quite a long time eight years. And she just didn't stop.</p><p>SENATOR BLACKBURN: I beat him by 12 points.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Twelve points. (Applause.) She was down by 10, and she won by 12. That's right. She was down by 10, and she won by 12. And she wouldn't stop. They just every day, Where is she? She's here. She's there. Fantastic job you did. We're proud of you.</p><p>SENATOR BLACKBURN: Thank you (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, honey. That's great. It was just honestly, working with people that know what they're doing, it's fun. That was fun. And you know what you're doing.</p><p>Representative Dan Crenshaw, who is very good at this, by the way, Dan. (Applause.) Very good at this. Really good. Thank you. It's great to have you in the party. And you have more courage than I do, Dan. Okay? That courage of yours is incredible. Thank you very much. Great job.</p><p>A friend of mine, and a wonderful person, and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future, I'd say I hear a lot of very positive things Liz Cheney. Liz, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.</p><p>And, you know, I pardoned somebody named Scooter Libby. A lot of you don't know who Scooter Libby is. Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly. And Liz was right on the forefront of that one. And I said, What do you think, Liz? And you said, Absolutely. He deserves it. And it's been a very popular pardon. He was treated very, very brutally and unfairly. So, thank you for that for that help.</p><p>Matt Gaetz. Where's Matt? Where's Matt? Stand up, Matt. (Applause.) Boy, a great defender. He gets on television, and he's like it doesn't stop. And he's smart, and he's good, and he loves Florida, and he loves his people, and he's a hard worker. And, Matt, thank you very much. I really appreciate it very much.</p><p>And Mike Johnson. Mike, thank you. (Applause.) Great job, Mike.</p><p>And I want to thank a man who I said, a long time ago, when we said, Let's do it because Josh Hawley is special. He is somebody that I said, Josh, you got to run. Well, I don't know. You know, he had a good set-up pretty well, right? You weren't going anywhere. He could do whatever he wanted in his great state.</p><p>And I said, I'm telling you, you can do it.\" And she turned out she's a tough candidate. Whether you like her or you don't like her, she's tough. Right? And by the end of that, that was incredible. That was a hell of a race and he won. And he's young and he's brilliant. And I'm going to ask him to come up and say a few words, if you don't mind, about what we're doing. And come on up right now. I think it would be a good time, right? (Applause.)</p><p>SENATOR HAWLEY: Thank you. Well, first of all, can we just give another round of applause to the President of the United States for his leadership on this issue? (Applause.)</p><p>You know, the media the media says the establishment media, the fake media they say, Oh, there's no censorship in social media. That's all made up. That's all fake. You and I know that that's not true. You and I know the truth is that the social media giants would love to shut us down. They would love to shut us up. They would love to shut him up more than anything else. And we can't let them. And that's why we need to step up now.</p><p>And I think we need to say to them, Here's the deal. Google, Facebook, Twitter they've gotten these special deals from government. They've gotten a special giveaway from government. They're treated unlike anybody else. If they want to keep their special deal, here's the bargain: They have to quit discriminating against conservatives. Do you agree with that? No more! (Applause.) No more discrimination. It's that simple. (Applause.) That's all we're asking for.</p><p>They ought to abide by the same principles of free speech and the First Amendment that this country embraces, that we love and call our own. And I don't think it's too much to ask for these huge tech platforms who've gotten rich off our information, right? Off of our data, off of everything we've given them they've gotten rich off of it. They've gotten rich off their special privileges from government. If they want to keep those, they shouldn't discriminate. They shouldn't censor. They shouldn't shut us down.</p><p>I want to thank the President again for his incredible leadership. Thank you for allowing me to be here. Thank you, Mr. President, for all that you do. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, you know, Josh is doing right now, he's doing some very important legislation because we have to do something about what's happening. I never hear about the other side. I can tell you I think I'm pretty good at getting out a message, but, technologically, I would think I'm okay. Just okay. But I'll tell you, a lot of bad things are happening.</p><p>I have people come up to me, \"Sir, we want to follow you. They don't let us on.\" And it was so different than it was even six, seven months ago. I was picking up unbelievable amounts of people. And I'm hotter now than I was then, okay? Because, you know, you also cool off, right? But much hotter. (Laughter.) Especially with a nice, new stock market like it is, right?</p><p>But, no, I'm hotter now. And I go to Dan, and I say, \"Hey, what's going on here? It used to take me a short number of days to pick up 100,000 people.\" I'm not complaining; we're like 60-some-odd million. But then we have five different sites. We have another site with 25 million. We have another site with 10 or 12. Then we have Facebook. Then we have Instagram. We have a lot you know, a lot of people way, way over 100 million.</p><p>But I used to pick them up, and I when I say \"used to,\" I'm talking about a few months ago. I was picking them up 100,000 people every very short period of time. Now it's, I would say, 10 times as long.</p><p>And I noticed things happening when I put out something a good one that people like. (Laughter.) Right? A good tweet. It goes up. It used to go up it would say \"7,000, 7,008, 7,017, 7,024, 7,032, 7,044.\" (Laughter.) Right? Now it goes \"7,000, 7,008, 6,998.\"</p><p>Then they go, \"7,009, 6,074.\" I say, \"What's going on?\" It never did that before. It goes up, and then they take it down, and then it goes up. I never had that. Does anyone know what I'm talking about with this?</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I never had that before. I used to watch it. It would be like a rocket ship when I put out a beauty. (Laughter and applause.) Like when I said remember I said somebody was \"spying on me\"? That thing was like a rocket. I got a call two minutes later. \"Did you say that?\" I said, \"Yeah, I said that.\" \"Well, it's exploding.\" (Laughter.) \"It's exploding.\" I turned out to be right. I turned out to be right. And we turn out to be right about lot of things. (Applause.)</p><p>But I never had it. I'm just saying from you know, from the standpoint of a of somebody that maybe has used social media better than anybody, Josh, because I became President. I'm sure I could have done it, as we said, much I would have there's no question I would have done it either way.</p><p>I said to Mark Burnett the other day I said, \"So, The Apprentice...\" Had I never done \"The Apprentice\" because it was a tremendous hit for 12 seasons. I said, \"Had I never done The Apprentice, would I be President?\" He said, \"Maybe not.\" And I said, \"I think I would have.\" But I'm always going to say that. (Laughter.) I'm always going to say it. But it was a great show.</p><p>But with social media so I've never seen it before where I go up and then come down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Now, ultimately, you get but it goes very slowly. But I've never seen where it's subtracted. And I really believe people are they're taking it up as it goes up. And it sometimes it comes down substantially.</p><p>A number of months ago, I was at a certain number you know, many millions and then all of a sudden, I was down over a million. And then I came down I said, \"What's going on?\" And you checked, Dan, and you said, \"They say they're doing adjustments. They say they don't like some of the people.\"</p><p>And I don't have the fake people. You know, a lot of people buy people. I don't want to do that because, first of all, if I did it, it's a front page story all over the place. (Laughter.) but I know a lot of people there's no question about it, because I see some numbers that are phony numbers where they have these, you know, many, many millions of followers. And I say, \"There's no way because nobody has any interest in these people.\" (Laughter.) There's they have no</p><p>Now, Herman Cain, they have interest in, okay? (Applause.) But they have no interest in these people. They're playing games. They're playing games.</p><p>James Woods. I don't know James, but he's an interesting guy and he's a conservative guy. And he is a straight shooter. He's tough. But when they want to take him off and other people like him; many in this room, some in this room it's a very, very bad it's a very bad thing.</p><p>So I have many millions of followers across various accounts. And together, everyone in this room, we reach over a half a billion followers. And I think that's probably a low number. Because one of the things I get that's a little benefit I'll go, \"Watch.\" Like, I did Golan Heights. I gave Israel the the real credit over and, you know, Golan Heights in Israel. Very important.</p><p>But I gave representation, in the strongest form, of the Golan Heights Israel. And I talked about it in a little quick tweet. They've been looking at it for 52 years, they've been trying to get it. They couldn't get it. They'd have many summits where people would fly in, talk about the Golan Heights, and then fly out. This went on many, many summits. It's about a 52-year period. I said, \"What happened?\" They said, \"Nothing.\" They'd fly in. They'd fly out. Some had beautiful planes. Some didn't. Some probably didn't get there by plane. But they'd have many summits.</p><p>said, \"Watch, I'm going to do this.\" And I said, \"We recognize the Golan Heights as being part of Israel.\" It was a big thing. I go, \"Watch this.\" Boom. I press it and, within two seconds, \"We have breaking news.\" John Roberts of Fox was over, and he said, \"We have breaking news. Please, break it up.\" Doesn't matter what they're talking about, John, does it? He breaks it up.</p><p>Now, that's Twitter. That's social media. I call Twitter a \"typewriter.\" That's what I really call Twitter, because it goes onto Facebook automatically and it goes onto Instagram. And it goes onto television more so Fox than it does CNN. If it's something bad, they'll put it on. (Laughter.)</p><p>If I have a spelling deal, they will put it on. (Laughter.) It's \"Donald Trump spelled the word 'the' wrong.\" You know? (Laughter.) \"He doesn't know how to spell, 'the.' He spelled it 'T-H-I.'\" (Laughter.) You know, I couldn't care any kind of a punctuation mistake, they put it on. So I'm very, very careful. I really I'm actually a good speller. But everyone said, \"The fingers aren't as good as the brain.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>But but it is true. And it's it's incredible what it does. I put out a social media statement. And I was telling Kellyanne the other day, I said, you know, I used to put out like a press release, right? And people would pick it up, sort of, you know, in the next day, two days. They'd find it sitting on a desk. If I put out we hardly do press releases anymore because if I put out, on social media, a statement like I'm going to in a little while on something totally unrelated, but a very important statement. Now they're going crazy. What it is? Tell me what it is. Watch. (Laughter.) But it's very important.</p><p>But if I put that out in a press release, I'm telling you, Kevin, people don't pick it up. It's me same. If I put it out on social media, it's like an explosion. Fox, CNN, crazy MSNBC they're stone-cold crazy. (Laughter.) I made them a lot of money with The Apprentice. And I gave them a top show when they were dying on NBC. But they don't like me too much. They wanted a big extension. They used Arnold Schwarzenegger instead a big movie star. You know what? He died. He died. (Laughter.) I was there 12 12 years, 14 seasons. And then they pick a movie actor and he dies on us. (Laughter.)</p><p>You know, I own that with Mark Burnett and some people. And I said they said, Would you rather have him had been like this tremendous massive success? You own it, so you benefit, financially. Or would you rather have him die? So they just say, You did it for 14 seasons, 12 years. I said, I think I'd rather him die at it. (Laughter.) That means you don't need the money. I'd rather have him die at it. Anyway.</p><p>But with amazing creativity and determination, you're bypassing the corrupt establishment and it is corrupt and you're bypassing the very, very corrupt media which not all of it, but much of it is far greater percentages than anyone would understand. As the cameras start to go off. There go the red lights. Look, boom. I can always tell. (Laughter.)</p><p>I can always tell. Like, when I talk about and I'll be in the stadium. The red lights are all on. Everyone has got and then we start talking about, like, the media how dishonest it is, how corrupt it is, how fake it is. And you see lights going off. (Laughter.) Lights immediately go off. And, usually, they don't come back. They say, This guy is impossible. (Laughter.)</p><p>But I want to just say it because you people have a lot of courage. To each and every one of you, I say: Thank you very much, on behalf of a nation. Thank you very much. It's very important what you're doing. You're getting the you're getting, in many cases, the honest word out not in all cases, but in many cases.</p><p>When historians look back at this time, they will see that many of the biggest news stories of our era were totally ignored. I I can tell you that I deal with the media, and the spin they put on it or sometimes they'll leave it out, and then if there's something slightly negative, they'll make it, you know, headline news. They'll put it down as headline news. Or even covered up by the media they were broken up by citizens.</p><p>And you'll take a look at what's happening, and you see stories that should be phenomenal, big, beautiful stories and it turns out that they don't get covered. We did something yesterday on kidney and kidney dialysis, and there's a tremendous number of people with problems with kidneys. And it was Secretary Azar it was a big, big important thing. It got very little coverage. You know, very positive what we did is such such a great thing.</p><p>I don't care. We don't have to get the hey, it's good for our nation. It's good for people to read about it and see the strides that we've made and what we're doing. But that doesn't get covered and it should get covered. And it doesn't get covered for a reason because they don't want to give that to a conservative. They don't want to let that happen.</p><p>Now, if somebody else were in this position such as the previous administration they'd make that headline news all over the place, what we did yesterday. But when we're doing it, they give very little credit to that.</p><p>But anything bad that happens I always say, They can take bad and make it horrible. They can take a good story and make it sort of bad. And they can take a great, great story and make it anywhere from good to slightly bad. (Laughter.) It's incredible what they can do.</p><p>I say I haven't had a good story in two and a half years. I used to get great press. Steve Mnuchin knows. He said, Man, you get the greatest press. Until I got elected. (Laughter.) Then it stopped. But I used to get the greatest press possibly one of the reasons I'm here.</p><p>But we're getting the word out, and we get it out in a different way. I didn't think we'd have to Charlie, I didn't think it would be this tough and</p><p>By the way, two very special people I have to say hello to them. Because my wife said, I see these two beautiful women African American, incredible women that are on television. They are unbelievable. This is two years ago. She was before her time. They have no idea who I'm talking about. (Laughter.) She was our First Lady said, You have to see these women. They're incredible. They're genius. And they like you. I said, I want to see them. (Laughter.) And I liked them. I loved them, actually. I loved them. Come. Come. (Applause.)</p><p>I don't want them to fall, because it'll be a major story. (Laughter.)</p><p>So, when the historians look back, they're going to see something very important took place right here. Before today, it took place. It started taking place a number of years ago, and it's something that nobody ever thought would happen.</p><p>Free speech is a bedrock of American life. Our constitutional rights must be fiercely protected. And I want you to know that we will always have your back. We're fighting for you very hard. We're going to be calling a big meeting of the companies for in a week or two. They have to be here.</p><p>And Josh is really leading a very strong group of people. This isn't just Josh. This is you leading a tremendous group, and they feel equally as strongly as you because they see the unfairness of what's happening.</p><p>And remember: We won. We have a bigger voice than anybody. But we don't get covered fairly. Can you imagine if we were covered fairly? We had our best polls, like, yesterday, they were telling me. I said, Could you imagine if I actually got good press instead of even fair press. I don't want good; I want fair. Can you imagine what those numbers would be? They make up stories you know, the Russian hoax. I call it the Russian hoax the witch hunt. All bad publicity, and yet we're doing great in the polls.</p><p>So people understand it. The public is very smart. But we're getting the word out about so many things not just that about so many things.</p><p>And maybe the most important thing about how great our country is doing. Jobs now more people working today than ever in the history of our country. Ever in the history of our country think of that. Unemployment are the best numbers in 51 years. For African American, the best numbers in our history in our history, Herman, right? (Applause.) Including you. And you're making a lot, I hope.</p><p>But Hispanic American best numbers in history. (Applause.) Right? Stand up. And I like your dresses, by the way, very much. No, not you, sir. You. (Laughter.) Thank you. I saw you the other day. Fantastic job.</p><p>But Hispanic American the best in history. Asian American the best in history. Women I think, Kellyanne the best in 75 years. The best in best unemployment numbers in 75 years. What we're doing it's nothing like this has been done.</p><p>Our military is now strong. When I took it over, it was depleted. We had planes that were so old they didn't fly. They'd have to go to the desert to get parts. When we took it over, it was not a good situation. We got $700 billion, and then $716 billion. And we're going to be asking for another one this year. And it's all manufactured in the United States. We make it ourselves. And that's always good, because that's jobs. Now, in this case, jobs aren't important compared military defense, but we make the best planes and rockets and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nothing like it. And we're doing something that's incredible.</p><p>So, our military is strong. Our our country is really powerful and really strong. Never been like this.</p><p>Whoops. How did a fly get into the White House? (Laughter.) I don't like that. I don't like flies. I don't like flies. (Laughter.)</p><p>So I just want to tell you, just in finishing up, we had a terrible bias. We have censorship like nobody has any understanding or nobody can believe. When you see the Google executives together, and one of their executives decides to put it on the phone right? That's right. Thank you. Oh, there he is. Stand up, please. Stand up. (Applause.) How good what a great job. Somebody said he's controversial. I said, He's not controversial. He's truthful. He's truthful. (Applause.) That was a great job. That was one of many. Thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic.</p><p>So, you know, they're playing with with a lot of minds and they're playing unfairly. And the funny thing is that, in theory, they shouldn't be liking the other side. They shouldn't be liking the other side. They should be, really, liking our side, because we're the ones that want freedom far more.</p><p>You see what's happening up in the debate stand. You see what they're doing to each other. You're seeing the hatred that they have up there. And it's a very different philosophy. It's a very different thought.</p><p>And I'll say this: The election that's coming up is, I think and, you know, we talk 2016, and I would say maybe that's the most important, and certainly I said it. But what we're really fighting for there has never been a difference of this candidate, our candidate, your candidate against whoever it may be. There will never be anything like that hopefully again, because what they're looking at is pure socialism or worse than socialism. You know, there's a word called communism, too. There's a word called they don't like to use it. Very rarely do you hear that. But there's a word called communism, and they're trying to get socialism over the line.</p><p>But these people are this is beyond socialism, to a large extent. And I think that we're going to have a tremendous success. We had a sort of, an opening rally in Orlando, Florida. We had 109,000 maybe more; I think it was nine wanting to come. We were doing as much as we could to keep people not from coming. We have a 21,000-seat stadium, and then, with the basketball court, it held many more than that. It was packed. And we had a similar number outside, and we had thousands and thousands of people that wanted to be there. And this was an opening.</p><p>And you look at Biden; they say he had 600 people. That wasn't 600; that was 150 people. (Laughter and applause.) That was 150. That was a very small crowd. (Laughter.) And even their big crowds I mean, if they have 1,000 people, it's like a big crowd. We have enthusiasm that's far greater than the left. It's not even a contest. They don't want to say that. They never will say that.</p><p>We had, on the Mall, just the other day 4th of July a tremendous success. It was pouring. The weather was just it was beautiful, in one way. They learned it was my real hair that day (laughter) because I was drenched. Well, that is the one good thing. I ran, and they learned it's my hair, because I've been through every windstorm, sandstorm. Let's go over here. Let's go this one, that one this desert. Let's go to this ocean and get out of the plane. Sir, the wind is blowing at about 70 miles an hour. I said, Boy, it's got to be it's got to be mine. (Laughter.)</p><p>But we've seen it all. We've seen it all. And I tell you what: More than anything else, I've met great people. I've met great people. Dedicated people. And I think that the election coming up, Kevin, this is the most important election of our times.</p><p>This is an election where our country is going to go one way or it's going to head in the direction of Venezuela. And that's what's going to happen. That's what's going to happen.</p><p>This Green New Deal and I you know, I hate to speak badly of it right now because it's a little early. I spoke too early on Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren. (Laughter.) I spoke I should've saved it.</p><p>But, you know so I don't like to go too early because I don't want them to change. I like the Green New Deal. I want them to keep going. I don't want them to make you know, the problem with this business: They can make a change, and immediately upon making the it lasts for about a week. You look at, for instance, on the wall, Chuck Schumer was totally in favor of a wall. Right, Liz? Totally in favor. Everybody. Hillary. Everybody. They were all in favor of a wall, just a few years ago.</p><p>Now a wall is a well, that's okay. They want open borders. They want people to pour in, including criminals the worst criminals. They want people to pour into our country. Nobody can tell me that's good, politically. Nobody can tell me.</p><p>So all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations, they've got a right to speak their mind. That includes them. That includes them. But they don't have the same difficulty. They don't get shut out. I wrote a few terms. I said to my son, Don, who's here some- where are you, Don? Where are you, Don? (Applause.) He's very good. Kimberly. Don. People like Don, I tell you. (Applause.) Good. Thank you, Don.</p><p>But we wrote out a few shadow ban, 100 percent. You look at what's going on. You know, I could go the blocking just the basic blocking of what we want to get out. The fact that they don't let them join. They don't. There was there's no doubt in my mind that I should have millions and millions I have millions of people so many people, I wouldn't believe it. But I know that we've been blocked.</p><p>People come up to me and they say, Sir, I can't get you. I can't follow you. They make it impossible.\" These are people that are really good at what they do. They say, \"They make it absolutely impossible.\" And, you know, we can't have it. We're not going to let it happen. Josh, we're not going to let it happen.</p><p>And, you know, if they did it on both sides, if it were done to the other side, to the other group and I'm representing everybody. I do. I represent everybody. I fully understand liberal. I fully understand Democrat. We want to get along. We want to make sure that everybody loves each other, if that's possible. And, maybe, I really believe it is. Someday it will be.</p><p>I, for a while, have said that the thing that's going to bring us together is great success. Now we have tremendous success greater than we've ever had before. I mean, our country picked up trillions of dollars in value and worth. China has gone down trillions of dollars. The tariffs have hurt them. I don't want to hurt them, but I want to give us a fair playing field. But China has gone down trillions. We've gone up tril- not billions, trillions. We've gone up in value and worth.</p><p>I want everybody to do well, but they've got to treat us fairly. They've got to treat everybody has to be treated fairly. Their side, our side we all have to be treated fairly.</p><p>And, you know, the farmers say, We just want a level playing field, sir. I love the farmers. They're patriots. And China, as you know, targeted the farmers because they think they could get to me by hurting the people that I love and that we take care of. And it had no impact.</p><p>I would watch, even on networks that don't exactly like me, and I'd watch as they interview farmers. And they'd have 10 or 12 people sitting around. They're saying, We don't care. The President is right. We've been ripped off for many years. Somebody has to do somebody had to do this.</p><p>China made, over the last 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars. You could say four to five hundred billion dollars a year. That's not sustainable. That's not we built China. And you know what? They've done a great job. I don't blame them; I blame our former Presidents and the leaders of our country for allowing this to go on ever since the World Trade Organization opened up. They allowed this to go on. They allowed hundreds of billions of dollars a year to be taken out of our country and to be used to rebuild China. So those days are over.</p><p>So, right now, they're paying 25 percent on $250 billion. A lot of money coming in. You know, we had a 3.2 GDP for the first quarter. Everyone said, I wonder how that happened. Because first quarter is the weakest quarter always almost almost always. And we had like this great quarter.</p><p>But I don't consider 3.2 great. I consider much higher. And, frankly, if we had lower interest rates you know, we're forced to pay more money than other countries because we have a rate that's high. We have somebody that likes raising rates. Now, I think he's maybe going to change, but we'll find out. But if we had lower, we'd have another 10,000 points. We're doing we just set a record. You know, I'm a very greedy person. We just set a record: 27,000. I said, We could be 10,000 points higher. We could be 10,000 because there's no inflation. A big thing is inflation. There's no inflation. But we're doing so well. We're going to keep it that way.</p><p>So, I just want to introduce because a person that I've admired for a long time who is a great lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, and she's one of the leading First Amendment lawyers in our country. And, Harmeet, could you come up just say a few words, please? Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS. DHILLON: Thank you, Mr. President. (Applause.) Thank you, Mr. President. It's a tremendous honor to be here with a lot of people who I really respect and admire.</p><p>The corrupt establishment that you talked about and the mainstream media have told a lot of people in this room that the social media censorship and the banning that we're experiencing is all in our heads. They're gaslighting us with this lie.</p><p>Let me tell you about a couple of people I represent in my law practice and the civil rights work that we do. David Horowitz is a great American, who is a supporter of yours has been in the movement for many decades. Well, Twitter abruptly de-platformed him one day took him off, said he was banned. And then, he complained and then they let him back on. And then, the next day, they did the exact same thing to him. That's not an accident.</p><p>James Damore is another great American who I represent. Mr. Damore complained internally about Google's discriminatory practices against conservatives and pushed for more balance. Not only was he fired for daring to do that, but then these social media platforms used their platforms to humiliate him publicly, weaponize their platforms, and make sure that he could not get a job in Silicon Valley. That's a disgrace.</p><p>But it goes beyond that. These social media CEOs have come to Congress in front of the many of these members of Congress here, and they've lied about what they do. They've lied about the data theft. They've lied about the media manipulation. And they can't get away with that.</p><p>Now, Senator Blackburn knows, from what happened to her on Twitter, that these companies are trying to stop the ordinary men and women who you represent from hearing their voices. I'm very concerned that they affected the outcome of the 2018 election. And if we let them do what they're going to what they've been doing, it's going to affect the outcome of the 2020 election as well.</p><p>So, Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting everybody here to talk about these issues. And we're all behind you joining the fight to make sure that every American's voice is heard. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And what Harmeet said is so, so true. I mean it's it's really incredible. You know, I've watched and I've watched some of these scenes that have been taped and gotten through talented people, by the way but gotten through and gotten to the public where you see the hatred of of our party, of our people, of our voice. And you say, That's the collusion.\" It's a collusion between the Democrats and the media and and social media and these platforms. It's a disgraceful thing. (Applause.)</p><p>And another thing, I believe you're representing a young man who just got slugged, viciously slugged. I think it's a disgrace. Do you ever notice they pick on certain people? I mean, he would tell you he's not the toughest person in the world physically, right? They don't go after Bikers for Trump. (Laughter.)</p><p>Do you ever notice that? They don't go after our construction workers, who love us. They don't go after the police. They don't go after we have incredible people. You know, we're the elite. They say they're elite. You know. Do you ever hear this? Hey, I live better than all of them. (Laughter.) Great education. The greatest houses. The great- but I guess I'm not elite. They live like in the basement of their mom's home. (Laughter.) Their arms are this big. Look, like this.</p><p>But they have the black they have the black masks on, and they have sticks. And they hit people. They hit people in the face, in the head this Antifa.</p><p>But do you ever notice the Antifa is never there when we have a bikers rally? (Laughter.) They're never there when the construction workers and the unions are honoring the President. They're never around. They're always there when you have a single guy protesting in front of a school.</p><p>And as you probably know I think all of you know we did something very serious. I signed an executive order recently. We're taking money away from those schools. (Applause.) We're going to you know, we give them billions and billions of dollars, and they don't allow free speech. (Applause.) And we don't want anything special, but we want free speech.</p><p>We're also joined by someone affected by this troubling bias very, very much and President of Live Action and somebody I've watched, really, with great admiration. Lila, please come up. Lila Rose. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>MS. ROSE: Thank you so much, Mr. President. It's really an honor to be here. Thank you for doing this important summit.</p><p>I represent Live Action. I'm the founder and president, and we are a pro-life organization which reaches millions of people every week with the truth about abortion and human dignity.</p><p>We have been, for four years, banned from doing any advertising on Twitter. And they told us that, in order to reinstate our accounts, we'd have to stop calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood and stop sharing our pro-life content. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other abortion groups continue to advertise.</p><p>Last month, we were permanently suspended from Pinterest, and they accused us of spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation with our pro-life content, with no evidence. And then, news media groups picked up the narrative and spread it around. Meanwhile, abortion groups, including abortion clinics, post freely on Pinterest.</p><p>And then, recently, our videos have been viewed more highly than almost any other abortion-related content on YouTube. But YouTube we made it to the first page of search results, but YouTube buried our pro-life videos and boosted pro-abortion videos. So this double standard and bias is a growing problem in big tech, even though they say that they are politically neutral and they don't discriminate. They even testified before Congress and said that.</p><p>So thank you so much to the administration and to you, Mr. President, for holding this very important summit. Thank you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Thank you very much.</p><p>So, one of the advantages of being President is when you ask for a meeting, you get it, generally. I don't know I can't think of too many I haven't gotten. And you say, I'd like to see you in Oval Office. Or you have somebody call Oval Office.</p><p>I have been with all of these people at the highest level one-on-one, just recently, with Google. Just recently, with Twitter. The top. All right? And you talk to them and you swear they're like your best friend. Oh, sir. No, we're we're we believe we freedom of speech. Oh, yes. Absol-...\"</p><p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And we go out</p><p>He says, Liar. Who said that? (Laughter.) Must come from Queens. (Laughter.)</p><p>So so it's very interesting to see that. And and the level of you know, you look at them the sincerity. And I say, That's fantastic. And they'll leave. And then, I'll realize, three or four weeks later, it's worse. It actually got worse.</p><p>Because I say look, I believe in technology. I believe in free markets. I believe in freedom of speech. I believe in all of the things, and they are super genius.</p><p>I'll tell you, I'm dealing with China. And they admitted there's nobody like Silicon Valley. There's nobody smart, in that sense maybe not smart in other senses. I've watched some of them speak before Congress; it's not pretty. (Laughter.) I say, I could do much better than that. (Laughter.)</p><p>But I tell you what: Technologically, it's unbelievable what they think of. Even Dan and I, when we sat with you-know-who at Twitter number one. We talked about certain things. He says, You know, we could do this, this, this. I said, That's really great. You know, this is incredible stuff.</p><p>China will admit there's nobody like these brains. But they're not using that brilliance and they're not using what we gave them fairly. And they have to do that.</p><p>And we don't want to stifle anything. We certainly don't want to stifle free speech, but that's no longer free speech. See, I don't think that the mainstream media is free speech either because it's so crooked. It's so dishonest.</p><p>So, to me, free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write bad. To me, that's very dangerous speech and you become angry at it. But that's not free speech. Somebody came to my office and I won't say who, but a very big person. And I said, \"Okay, you don't like the term 'fake news'\" which I think I get credit for, but I'm sure that, if I said I get credit, they'll say, \"Thirteen years ago, somebody came up with the terms 'fake.'\" (Laughter.) I think I'd get credit. I'd be very proud to take it. But I think I'd get credit.</p><p>Now, by the way, the worst fakers of all are using \"fake news.\" I saw the other day on CNN total fakes I see on CNN they go, \"Fake-news media has reported...\" No, no they're fake-news media. (Laughter.) They've turned it around. (Applause.) They've turned it around.</p><p>So I'm not going to allow and Josh and all of us, we're not just going to allow it to happen like this. We're not going to be silenced.</p><p>Two months ago, we created a new White House tool to report social media bias, censorship, and discrimination. We saw you folks being taken off, and we fought on all of you. And many of you are back now. But many of the names I won't mention your names but some of you were taken off for absolutely no reason.</p><p>I mean, in all fairness, some of you I could almost understand. (Laughter.) I mean, some of you guys are out there. (Laughter.) But even you should have a voice. (Laughter.) But some of you no, some of you deserve (applause) some of you. I mean, it's genius, but it's bad. (Laughter.)</p><p>But they take off people that are you know, that you wouldn't believe. And we received over 16,000 responses just in a tiny little period of time talking about this subject.</p><p>Based on the feedback that we're hearing from you, I'm announcing that we will ask representatives of the major social media platforms to join me at the White House over the next month, have a big meeting and a real conversation. We want might want to invite some of you. I know, Josh, we're going to have you and some of the senators.</p><p>And it's amazing how the senators including Democrats, in all fairness which is probably because they know it can turn on them also. It can turn very quickly. But they want to come. So we'll let you know the date, okay?</p><p>And today, I'm directing my administration to explore all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans. That's you people in this room and a lot of people out there. There are a lot of people.</p><p>We hope to see transparency, more accountability, and more freedom. That's on both sides. This is not I am not speaking for our side, assuming we're all I don't even know if you're on our side. You could be some of the most liberal people in the world in this audience, and that's okay. I don't care. But we're talking about for everybody. Big tech must not censor the voices of the American people.</p><p>To all of the social media influencers here today a lot of you have a lot of power and you have a lot of strength. And, you know, you have to use it wisely. Many of you do, but you have to.</p><p>I want to thank you once again for being here. You're very special people. You're very brilliant people, in so many cases. I look around the room I mean, I see people that really have almost found a new life over the last short period of time with this new technology. But this new technology is so powerful and so important, and it has to be used fairly. It has to be used fairly.</p><p>So thank you all for being here. It's a great honor. Tremendous honor.</p><p>We're going to take a few questions, I think. And then I'll head out. And you're going to actually come if you want, you can come to the great Rose Garden. You can stand in the rain with me. We're going to talk a little bit about the fact that we're not allowed to ask for whether or not somebody is a citizen on the census form. And I think we have a solution that will be very good for a lot of people really good.</p><p>END</p><p>4:42 P.M.

EDT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. And today I'm signing an executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule: Hire American. We've been doing it at a level that hasn't been done maybe ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'll also be taking firm, disciplinary action against the leadership of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has sadly and cruelly betrayed American workers. And we have some of those great American workers with us at the table. This is the Cabinet Room, and it's an honor to have you in the Cabinet Room and at the Oval Office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're joined by the Vice President; Congressman Tim Burchett, who's doing a fantastic job in the state of Tennessee; Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia; Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Secretary, Ken Cuccinelli. Where's Ken\" Hi, Ken. I didn't see you down there. That's great. Doing a great job.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Quiet, as usual.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Keep you busy, right\" (Laughter.) We're keeping you busy, Ken.</p><p>Recently, the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeffrey Lyash, made a disastrous and heartless decision. The TVA announced that it would lay off over 200 American workers and replace them with cheaper foreign workers brought in from overseas.</p><p>The Tennessee Valley Authority leadership then ordered the American workers to train their foreign replacements, rubbing salt in their very open wound.</p><p>So we're going to bring in workers. They're going to foreign workers. And people from Tennessee, and some others states right around it, are going to train them -- what to do and how to do it. It doesn't work that way.</p><p>As we speak, we're finalizing H1-B regulations so that no American worker is replaced ever again. H1-Bs should be used for top, highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labor program to destroy American jobs.</p><p>Sitting at the table are six of the TVA workers who were ordered to train the foreign labor flown in to replace them. I want you and your colleagues to know that my administration will not be putting up with -- I happen to know a young woman who's been very active over the last couple of years because we were together on Disney and a couple of other things.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it all seems to be working out pretty well.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing a great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And thank you for it.</p><p>But that's why I'm formally removing the chairman of the board, James Thompson, and board member Richard Howorth. If the TVA does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire their workers, then more board members will be removed. We have the absolute right to remove board members. And the board makes the decision; I don't make the decision. I saw there was an ad on television talking about the amount of money that the chairman makes, and it's a ridiculous amount of money. But we have the right to replace the board, and the board is the one -- the only ones that get the right to then hire a new person.</p><p>Furthermore, the board must immediately hire that new CEO who puts the interest of American workers first. The current CEO, Jeff Lyash, is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year. Did you know that\" Eight million. He's the highest-paid government official of any country anywhere in the world.</p><p>Now, I don't know that you call him officially a \"government.\" It might be a public-private. It may be something -- a lot time ago, it was established, Tennessee Valley Authority. But he gets $8 million a year. So that was just a succession of deep-swamp things happening, and it's a disgrace. But he gets $8 million a year, and I can think of about almost 100 percent of the people I know would take that job. (Laughter.) It's not a very hard job. I mean, you have not a lot of debt, not a lot of anything, right?</p><p>Public service is just that: Those who takes these jobs must be focused on the public good, not on personal profit. He would have taken the job for millions and millions of dollars less, but nobody asked him to do that. Okay\" He would have gone for less. You could have had him for $4 million, $6 million, $7 million, $2 million, $1 million, probably $500,000 a year.</p><p>But the new CEO must be paid no more than $500,000 a year, which is still a significant amount more than the President of the United States makes. And I donate my salary. I've donated it. From what I hear, I'm the only President to do that. You'll have to check on that, but that's what I've heard. I'm very surprised to hear that. But I donate my full salary; I don't take it.</p><p>The board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure, too. We don't want him leaving and then he gets a big check for millions and millions of dollars.</p><p>We want the TVA to take action on this immediately: Lower energy prices in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. I love all those states. Any additional states you can think of there\" I don't know. Let's see. So we're talking about of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Great states, there -- every one of them.</p><p>So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words: \"You're fired.\" \"You're fired.\" It's ridiculous. The man is getting $8 million. It'd be interesting to see how much money he made before this. And I have no idea. Maybe he made more. I don't know. But I doubt it. But it'd be interesting to see. He got this position -- must have been politically inspired because I can think of probably, almost, everybody in the nation would have liked this position, including every one of the media folks across the table from me. I would say that everybody would have liked this position.</p><p>So, with that, we're getting rid of him in one form or another. Either the board is going to do it, we're going to do it. But he's gone. And he's done not a great job. He's done not even a good job, in certain ways. Plants in Kentucky -- he could've kept the plant open in Kentucky, if he wanted to, even if they retrofitted the plant. And he didn't do that, did he, Congressman?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn't do that.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We asked him to do it. He didn't want to do it. We said, \"That's okay.\" And here we are doing what we're doing today.</p><p>So we will get somebody for a much lower price. I want the saving -- much lower salary -- I want the saving to go to the people of these great states in the form of energy savings. And that's a pretty substantial number.</p><p>So, Kevin, could I ask you to start off and say a few words, please?</p><p>MR. LYNN: I certainly appreciate that, Mr. President. My name is Kevin Lynn. I'm the executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform and the founder of U.S. Tech Workers. And thank you for paying attention to our ad, Mr. President.</p><p>We were founded -- we founded U.S. Tech Workers three years ago to look at the -- and inform the public on the great harm that's being caused by the outsourcing and offshoring of our skilled labor jobs. And, Mr. President, I want to thank you for inviting us here. On behalf of U.S. Tech Workers and the Tennessee Valley Authority, we appreciate your willingness to look at the endangered jobs of the Tennessee Valley Authority workers, especially in a time of pandemic and an election year, when you've been so busy signing documents that affect the welfare of millions of Americans.</p><p>Taking time to ensure that these hundreds of workers, under your administration, can continue to provide great services to the American people, as they have since 1933, shows the people of Tennessee and beyond that you stand by your promise to keep American jobs with Americans.</p><p>This is a historic moment that I'm hopeful will reverse the harm outsourcing and offshoring have done to our nation's productive classes. And it is my hope that Congress will join you, Mr. President, in making sure our workers are more secure in their jobs.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. LYNN: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you're the one that took the ad about me that -- I didn't know that. (Laughter.) I was just saying, you know, \"I think he's the one that took this, really, vicious ad.\" Like, I hired this guy for $8 million, that I had nothing to do with it. I said, \"What's that?\" But, actually, you brought something very important up, because when I looked into it, I said, \"This guy is actually making $8 million a year.\" And you did the ad. So you really made me aware of what was going on with the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has been a -- a feeding pot for a long time. And a lot of deep state, a lot of swamp creatures, okay?</p><p>So, that's it. So we're going to make that -- I see. So I think now you realize that it wasn't about me. I hope you now realize that.</p><p>MR. LYNN: I do realize that, Mr. President. (Laughter.) But if I could --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I accept -- I accept your apology. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: In full disclosure, Mr. President, when we sat down with the Davis Agency constructing the ad, they said, \"Who's your audience?\" And I said, \"Just one person. He's the only one that...\" --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's smart. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: -- \"...would do this, and he's the only one that can come to the aid of these workers in the Tennessee Valley.\"</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He's the only one with any guts to do it -- who has guts to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll tell you, though -- I have to say, Kevin, the end was very appropriate. And while it has nothing to do with me, I can do things with respect to the board, and ultimately, the board controls that decision. This is a very, very old authority done in the --</p><p>MR. LYNN: 1933, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So it was done during the FDR days. And it's been -- you know, it's been getting crazier and crazier just over the years. And they have, basically, nobody watching over them. And the board isn't watching. You see this happening in public companies also. You see it happening a lot.</p><p>But for a essentially -- I would say, for a federal employee to be paid $8 million -- now what we're doing is we're looking at the board members, how much are they paid. Because usually what happens is they pay, and then he says, \"You know, I think you ought to get more money.\" And everybody is making a lot of money, and your pricing for electric and utilities starts going up, and people say, \"I wonder why.\"</p><p>I also see that they're doing a lot of things in terms of electric, which is very expensive electric. They're building facilities that are very, very expensive to build and don't work well. But we'll discuss that separately.</p><p>But I appreciate it because you did make me aware of what's going on, and it's a terrific thing we're doing today. Thank you very much, Kevin.</p><p>Please, Stacy. How are you?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: I'm doing fine. Mr. President, my name is Stacy Whetzell. I'm the son of a sharecropper.</p><p>First, I want to thank you for being the great American President you are and for caring about and looking out for the great American citizens and workers. We thank you for that.</p><p>I picked cotton from the time I was big enough to carry my own pick sack until I married. My wife and I have been married 47 years and have 7 children and 14 grandchildren. I began working for TVA in 1975 as a carpenter's apprentice. Currently, I'm the system administrator on TVA's core team that's responsible for installing a $20 million computer system. Our team and the entire IT department have been praised and thanked multiple times this summer for the outstanding performance we've done.</p><p>So it was shocking and devastating to be notified on July the 23rd that IT leadership had decided our team and a total of 40 workers would be terminated and our work done to others. This brings the total planned outsourced jobs to over 200 in TVA information technology alone. We believe there are more planned to come.</p><p>The three companies chosen to do the IT work are all three foreign companies that depend heavily on H1-B workers. We're required to train these -- our replacements, as President Trump said. Apparently, we're good enough to train but not retain.</p><p>Using H1-B workers to replace capable and willing American citizens is turning entire American communities upside down. Left unchecked, it will turn our nation upside down and negatively impact our national security as certainly as our 50-year build-up of dependence on China for manufacturing has. Thank you, President Trump, for beginning to reverse that hive-centric mistake.</p><p>American patriots will forever be grateful that you're also acting and fought the misguided and out-of-control H1-B worker program. I thank you for Americans first and acting to stop this travesty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you're a very powerful speaker. And so powerful that we just got a call -- Mark just brought this in from -- the TVA CEO, and he's indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course. (Laughter and applause.)</p><p>So it must have been Stacy. I think Stacy did a much better job than me. I mean, you're talking and all of the sudden, I get the note.</p><p>So he's looking to change course and reverse it, and that's good. Now, maybe he'll take a major cut in salary, too. That'll be phase two, right\" So we'll take a look at that. And maybe you'll start looking at that on behalf of everybody, gratis. Right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your group. That's great, isn't it.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I mean, TVA told me while we were in this process of working on behalf of the workers -- I'm the union president, IFPTE-Engineering Association. They told me it's going to take a message -- a stop order from the President in order to keep us from moving forward. And I said, \"I'm working on that.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Everybody in this room did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: I appreciate you, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, Congressman, you have my endorsement.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay\" You had it anyway, but you have it now. It's a great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Well, I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: The only congressman in the room. I tell you, Tim, great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, brother.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's only phase one. Phase two is -- imagine being paid the $8 million a year to run a thing that's pretty easy to run, in all fairness. It's not like he built it; he didn't build it. He went there and he's been there, and he gets a lot of money, and it shouldn't be. Five hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, right?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir. In Tennessee, it is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And I'm willing to say he gets paid more money than I do. I don't care.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But, you know, it shouldn't happen.</p><p>So that's a start. That's a start. And I think we should find out what board members make, okay\" Because --</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I'll look into that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: -- I can almost guarantee you they're paid heavily.</p><p>Congratulations, Stacy. Really good.</p><p>Please, go ahead.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir. Mr. President, thank you. My name is David Littlejohn. I am a soon-to-be father. This November, my wife will be giving birth to my first child. I am a long line -- I'm the son in a long line of military men and women, so I was born with a heart of service. And with that, I love to serve the people of the Valley.</p><p>I was told July 23rd that I would be sent home and to be trained -- training a contractor from a H1-B-dependent contract company. Now, I'm shaking right now because --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing great.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You had a big victory already. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>I'm shaking right now because this really impacts me and my wife and my unborn child, and I greatly appreciate everyone here to support us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate it, and thank you very much.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you'll see what happens. It's going to be very quick, too. Thank you.</p><p>Wendy, please.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah. I'm Wendy Turner, and thank you for having us here. I've been a software engineer at TVA for 19 years. I'm going to change my comments a little. I was (inaudible) saying, you know, for the first time in 19 years, I didn't know what was going to happen to me and my kids, and I also take care of my mom. But what we're going to do going forward -- so, thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And this was -- everybody felt this way in Tennessee Valley Authority then, I guess-- right\" -- if you do. You've been there for 19 years. So everyone had to feel this way, like there's been a big feeling of doubt, right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Right. Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's a terrible thing.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They're waiting for it to happen to them.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, and I've been training since June. I've been training our replacements from a company that relied on --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You've been training people?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yes. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And so, did they let you off yet\" Or are you not sure?</p><p>MS. TURNER: I got my notice in June that we would be laid off September 1st.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you're training people to take your job at a -- whatever. Right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They told us it would be --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And where are the people from that you're training?</p><p>MS. TURNER: All over the place. We -- everything is done remotely or --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are they from other countries?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They're here on soil now. I don't know their status as far as --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Because with Disney, they were from other countries, right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, so I don't know. I know the com- -- Accenture is replacing our group, and I know they rely heavily on H1-B workers, but I don't know for sure where everyone is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, we'll make sure that things work out for the three of them because they're brave to be here, actually, Sara. So you'll check that out, right?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let's see that they get their jobs back --</p><p>MS. TURNER: Thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: -- because I hear you're great workers. I mean, I said I want people, but I also people that are really good workers -- that did a great job. Because, you know, people can be let go; should be able to -- if they're not doing a good job. I'm all for that. I think -- I'll bet you are.</p><p>But I said, \"I want people that really do a great job and were unfairly let go.\" Right, Tim?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's, to me, very important.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Wendy. We'll see what happens. Okay\" We're going to push it hard.</p><p>Chuck, please.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I recognize how busy your schedule is, and I sincerely appreciate your time today. Okay?</p><p>I'm Chuck Charnawskas. Basically, I've had the opportunity to work with the really technically competent people of the Tennessee Valley for seven years, okay\" It's been a great experience. I have a degree in electrical engineering, 45 years of valuable industrial experience, and I'm a certified security professional here, okay?</p><p>Working with the people in Tennessee Valley was how I learned just how important the Tennessee Valley is to 11 million people in seven different states, okay, and how it basically impacts their lives. It's absolutely significant. And that is the reason that I'm really here today.</p><p>The TVA basically has the capability to produce 35 billion watts of powers, okay\" They have 17,000 lines of high-voltage transmission.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How does that compare to other big utilities, would you say?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: It definitely ranks right in the top of them. There's no question about it. And very significant: Tennessee Valley is part of the Southeastern Reliability Corporation, and it's obviously one of the biggest players in that area.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yea, it's very big. That's a lot.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Very significant in that respect, okay\" And in essence here, as a consequence of that, they also basically support 35 dams -- that produce power from 29 -- to do flood control.</p><p>Just a couple years ago, they were able to reduce billions of dollars of potential damage by managing the rivers correctly, in that case.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: They have three major power plants -- nuclear power plants.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What's your biggest dam\" What's the big dam?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Probably it would be Chickamauga or --</p><p>MR. HICKS: Wilson. Wilson Dam, in Alabama.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Wilson in Alabama.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: There's the expert, right down there. (Laughter.) So I defer to the expert about that.</p><p>But the bottom line of it: As a consequence of this, it's a very -- a very important player not only in the Southeast region, but for (inaudible) internationally, okay\" And today, the TVA receives hundreds if not thousands of potential attacks -- cyberattacks -- testing its network here, right?</p><p>It's imperative to have experienced, knowledgeable employees to handle that situation, yeah. Okay?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And a fine example of this -- and I just kind of -- you know, it's a little bit humorous, but the great power outage in 2003 was affected by a software glitch -- okay\" -- that impacted and it shut down Manhattan for 24 hours.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I remember that very well. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: I thought you might be related -- or familiar with that. So, as a -- it just really points to the significance of having qualified, vetted people with proper clearances.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: -- dedicated to that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree. That wouldn't happen with you, would it\" Huh\" It wouldn't happen.</p><p>MS. TURNER: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And then just a -- quickly, two other quick points. Basically, this outsourcing agreement could impact -- the Tennessee Valley has always -- our goals are to provide energy, economic development, and protect the environment. This particular outsourcing agreement could impact the Valley by $88 million to these local economies here. And for the individuals that are in there, not only may they lose their primary income, but they may consequently have insurance costs that basically reflect a 3- to 400 percent increase for these families on how they manage it.</p><p>And I'd like --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And you're going to lose -- you're going to lose people when you're firing people that are -- they live in Tennessee and they live in Georgia and they live in the other states that I mentioned, and it's not a fair situation.</p><p>Go ahead. Let's -- let's go, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Final point: The effort here to make America great again -- okay -- reflects the fact that we need to take into repatriate manufacturing companies and companies to take and spend our money domestically and support the domestic product. How can we justify spending these millions of dollars -- for one particular consulting firm, $15 million to --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Who is the consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, that would be Capgemini (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You spent $15 million a year on a consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, this was a --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We just found another nugget of gold. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Sara doesn't care about that one, but that's a -- (laughter) -- I care about. You spent $15 million to one consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: It's not -- it's not a consulting -- that's one of the companies that are picking up. And it's Capgemini, and that's $15 million that -- just for that one company.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How many are there -- how many are there like that?</p><p>MS. HENSON: There's Capgemini, CGI, Accenture, and Tech Systems at TVA --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And they're paying tremendous amount of money?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir. And our workers are more than capable.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very -- they're very political people. You know this is a very political group of people you just named?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Really\" I just know that --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Not to me. Not to me, I don't care. (Laughter.) I don't care who they are, but they -- they are very political.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, I mean, and these people are more than capable of doing the job and have done it with excellence. And TVA says your matrix for your performance is above; it doesn't make sense. And what you're doing -- I cannot tell you how much it means to me. And for these workers it -- and I'm very emotional because TVA is a large racket. They do their thing, and nobody can touch them. And I believe today they've been touched.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's a racket.</p><p>MS. HENSON: They've been touched. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, it's a racket. Well, we just found that out. (Laughter.) No, it's a racket.</p><p>I mean -- I mean, I understand it. The four firms that you just mentioned that are paid tens of millions of dollars, they're very political firms. You know, they may be good, but they're very political firms. And they do it for much less much -- much, much, much less. You could give them half. You could give them 10 percent, they'd probably do it for. Those are big numbers for a consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they're -- they're not the consulting firm; they're the ones actually going to take these people's jobs. That --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's worse.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, it is worse. So I mean --</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim, go ahead, please.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Mr. President, thank you --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: -- and Vice President so much for this. My mama worked at TVA after the Second -- during the -- at the end of the Second World War, when dad came home from the Pacific and married her, and then she went into education. But, you know, working people are the backbone of this country. That's not cliche and you've --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: -- you've highlighted that so much with the trades and other things, and I'm very appreciative of the fact.</p><p>But I'll you what: Dadgummit, if TVA wants be Duke Electric, let them because Duke Electric, but they're not. And they -- they hide behind the government's skirt and they -- they use eminent domain, and their arrogance is beyond belief. You know, when they had the ash spill, people died, and then -- you know, and then they are just these poor country folks that are just pushing them off until they all die off, until those lawsuits go away. It's ridiculous.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, that's right. And, by the way, in Kentucky, when we wanted to have a plant open with a lot of jobs, they didn't even want to consider it.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No. No, they didn't. It's their arrogance. You're questioning them, and finally we have a President with the guts that understands business and government. And if TVA wants to be a government entity, they need to -- they need to declare it, and quit using -- they hide behind -- you know, they have their -- their --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think Joe Biden would do this?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Heck no.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn't know you're alive.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He'd be -- no, he'd --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He doesn't know he's alive either. (Laughter.)</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He needs to get out of the bunker.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, can you imagine him sitting at this table right now\" Wouldn't have a clue.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. So go ahead, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, I think you pretty much covered it, Mr. President. I'm just honored to be here. And I --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm honored that you're here. And you've done a fantastic job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: And I thank you for standing up for working Americans.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, well we're going to -- and we're going to get this finished too. So we'll get it finished, Sara.</p><p>Thank you very much, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Gene, please.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Mr. President, thank you for bringing this group together. And this this meeting has, I think, shown a very human impact on individual working --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Incredible.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: -- men and women of a practice that's actually pretty widespread.</p><p>And the way it's worked under our immigration laws for a while now is that a company that wants to bring in workers from overseas -- wants to use the H1-B program for high-skilled workers -- has to file an attestation with us at the Labor Department, saying American workers aren't going to lose their jobs when I bring in these H1-B workers. And they have to say it's not going to hurt their wages.</p><p>But what companies do is they bring workers in, and then they lease them out to another company. And so you've got one company bringing them in and then leasing them to TVA. And it's true, the company bringing them in -- their workers aren't being affected, but the TVA workers are.</p><p>And so I took a look at this, as your Labor Secretary, recently, and I said to my staff -- I said, \"Well, if the workers are going to the other company, why doesn't the other company, where they're actually going to be working and supervised, also file an application?\"</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. Right.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: \"And say, 'We're not going to affect U.S. workers either.'\" And I said to staff, \"Why can't we do that?\" They looked into it. And, Mr. President, today, you're going be signing an order --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: -- that requires that change.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: So, going forward, when those workers are going to another company, both companies are going to (inaudible) -- (applause) -- and that's a change we'll make. We'll do it together with the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>I just want to mention one other thing we're doing together. For more than 15 years, the Secretary of Labor has had the authority to initiate an investigation of abuse of H1-B program when he or she finds reasonable cause. That has never been done. That authority has never been used.</p><p>But again, we saw -- signed a memo of understanding on Friday with the Department of Homeland Security that'll change that too. They're going to now share information they have, which I can then use to bring cases when we're finding the program (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. You're going to find a lot. And thank you very much, Gene.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Thank you. And thank you for this order today.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Good work, Stacy. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right, Stacy\" Right\" I like that. You like that?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: We'll take it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Linda, please.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being with us today. The concern you show for American workers is greatly appreciated. And my mother made me promise to tell you that Alabama loves and appreciates your leadership. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I love Alabama.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, a promise that my mother made.</p><p>My name is Linda McDonald. I've lived in northeast Alabama my entire life. My goal was to work at TVA; that was my American Dream. After years of sacrifice and hard work, I achieved that goal. I've been working for TVA for seven years now. But -- so, and in that role, I got to see every day --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So that was like an ambition of yours to work someday for TVA?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Correct.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you finally got there?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I did.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, what's happening?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, June 30th, we were told that we would be outsourced to another company with --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: All right. Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, so, here I am, faced with --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you had to have these consulting firms making 10, 15 million dollars a year?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, I feel like my --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And the man that heads it making $8 million a year, right\" (Laughter.)</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I feel like my American Dream was being stolen from me --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: -- and given to someone else. So I just think --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Is that the way you view it: \"given to somebody else\"?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: It is. It was taken from me, and --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's a very interesting way --</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: -- it was then given to someone else.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: -- of viewing it, right?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, I thank you for listening to us, because it felt, for so long, like no one was even listening to us. So thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I've been hearing about it for a long time. When I was running, I met Sara, and we worked on the Disney situation --</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: -- but that was a long time ago. But -- and, you know, this has been happening for a while. So we're taking care of it.</p><p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Linda. We'll see what happens. You may be very pleasantly surprised. Okay?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I hope so.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>Jonathan, please.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, thank you for your time.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MR. HICKS: My name is Jonathan Hicks. I'm a -- I'm from a large family, and we've had three -- three members of our family who have served in the U.S. military. I grew up in Tennessee, around the Knoxville area, and started my career with TVA in 2001 as an IT intern. During -- as soon as I graduated, I got a fulltime job there, and I've been there for -- for 19 years. I've been --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And that was a big deal, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Working -- because there's a great prestige to that.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's true.</p><p>MR. HICKS: I've spent my time there working for river operations for the -- for their group, and helping them, you know, have programs -- mostly in-house solutions to be able to manage the river and the river systems.</p><p>I was told in June -- early June -- that I would be training replacements, that I would be receiving my work notice in September, and that the workers that I'd be training, there's been five or plus that I've been training for my one position, and at least four of those seem to be H1-B type workers.</p><p>I guess there's a concern with the kind of stuff that we do, at least for the river operations, and that they're generating a significant amount of power out of all the -- out of all the -- all of these dams. And, you know, is this something that -- that we want to turn over this knowledge, this ability to control these dams and -- you know, whether it be generation, whether it be floodgates -- and hand it over to corporations that aren't in the U.S., to workers that aren't necessarily in the U.S. doing this work?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are you there now\" Are you --</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I -- I've been put on non-work status. I'm still employed and still getting a paycheck until September 1st, but I've been --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What happens on September 1st?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I've been relieved of my job duties, but September 1st is when I would lose --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you train people to take your job?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you've worked with people to take your job.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You've taught them, like, almost everything you know, but plenty, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I -- I think there's a big --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Maybe not. Maybe you held back a couple of secrets. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I think there's a -- I think there's a big learning curve and there's -- for the knowledge that they do there for river operations, I think it takes several years of understanding the job in order to be able to do this.</p><p>The people that are taking over the job have never dealt with utilities, they've never dealt with power generation, they've never dealt with any kind of water management or hydrogenation. And so the -- to say that they're ready to go is a misstatement. So --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, let's see how out it works out, Jonathan. I think you're going to be in very good shape. Okay\" I have a prediction.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p>Please.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: It's -- I'm so honored to be here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Honored to have you.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: My name is Renae McKenzie, and I actually work for the Engineering Association as an advocate for these IT employees and for other white-collar workers. But I've worked really closely with the IT professionals at TVA, with all of this that has been going on.</p><p>I've had to witness the anguish of the different employees that are performing these knowledge transfers on the software and the applications that they actually custom built themselves.</p><p>But so many TVA employees have been there from the beginning of their careers. So to actually witness what's happening to them, being replaced by these non-Americans, is very difficult.</p><p>But I think one of the hardest things to witness is what TVA is actually doing to themselves. I mean, their mission is about bringing economic development to the Tennessee Valley. And to be taking that -- taking our economy and just giving it outside of the United States is just almost -- it's unbelievable because of what they stand for and what they were built for. To come out of economic --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you see them going outside of the United States, not just here. You see them go --</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Well, if you look at these companies, these companies are based outside of the United States. So -- so when they're getting their millions of dollars, I mean, it's going to France, it's really going to -- I think one of them is --</p><p>MS. HENSON: India.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: India, Canada.</p><p>PARTICIPANT: Ireland</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: And Ireland. So, yes, our dollars are going to them.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Unbelievable. And they get us in many other ways too, but we're stopping it, as you noticed. That's very interesting.</p><p>So you would say France, India, Ireland, Canada. Who else?</p><p>MS. HENSON: That's the main groups right there. Those (inaudible) countries.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Those are the main ones.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: A lot of them -- are a lot of the workers being outsourced --</p><p>MR. LYNN: All these firms: H1-B visa dependent. And 70 percent of H1-B visa workers in the United States come from one country: mainly, India.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: You know, Mr. President, I worry too about the national security. You know, we're during a pandemic, people are out of work, and our electric grid could be put in the hands of folks that, maybe, their loyalty isn't to this great country, and that bothers me.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You know, with TVA, more so than most companies. You're right -- you're talking about controlling all of that energy and power. It's -- you're right. You're right about that, Tim. That's a very good statement. Anything else?</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Just, it -- again, it's such an honor to be in your presence. (Laughs.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's my honor. It's my great honor. Do you know the man next to you is Ken Cuccinelli, a legend\" (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Look, and I tend to be very quiet like him. Just saying.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He's a legend in his own mind. (Laughter.)</p><p>Ken -- Ken has done a fantastic job on the border. Unbelievable job on the border. And you might just tell us for a couple of seconds while we have the -- the media here -- I'm sure they'll report it very accurately -- how well we're doing on the border and then maybe get on to make a statement, because I know you've been working with Gene and everybody very hard.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Yes. And Secretary Scalia really covered the partnership with -- between DHS and Department of Labor to solve this problem. You're solving it forcefully today for these folks. You're certainly putting the ball in motion to do that. And what we're -- our two agencies, at your direction from June, are going to do is solve this permanently so that we never have to see this happen again.</p><p>But, on the border, we're seeing success with your leadership with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. The relationships you helped us forge last year, in 2019, are bearing fruit at the border during a very difficult time with the coronavirus and that taskforce, of course, led by the Vice President. And the ability since March to enforce the public health order there has changed the nature of our ability to protect the border.</p><p>There are still people getting away, more than we would like. But last year, they were running to us; this year, they're running from us, at the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's right.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It's a bit different. And over 80 percent of the folks that we're apprehending are being returned to Mexico in under two hours, which is astonishing. It's just an astonishing turn.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It used to take, in some cases, years. Years.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Right. Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's been incredible what's happened at the border. And I think the wall is helping you quite a bit, right\" We have now about almost 271 miles of wall.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Everywhere that that new system is put in place, the Border Patrol agents are just universal in their praise for both their safety and the way it impedes illegal traffic -- not just people, but drugs, as well, and so forth. So it's extremely effective, and it's going up faster and faster and faster.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They had a human trafficker the other day saying that they used to go out and they're trafficking -- human traffic -- mostly women and children, but mostly women, and they'd bring them across the border, taped up and -- horrible.</p><p>And this guy was saying how they used to go up and they'd make a left turn. They'd make a right and then a left into the United States. He says, and now we just keep driving into this massive wall that nobody gets through. Nobody is getting through that wall. That wall is the real deal. And it's steel, concrete, and everything else. And lots of cameras all over it.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And drones on top of it. And people aren't getting through. But it's been an incredible, incredible success.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It's a real force multiplier for the Border Patrol and OFO.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And Mexico is helping us a lot. They have --</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: A lot better partnership.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: -- 27,000 soldiers.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: I remember how people complained about how you were pushing them so hard last year. But the partnership that's grown up with Mexico has been the best. We have really had, in decades, if not forever --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's what they say.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: -- in cooperating and securing the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They have a very good President who was just here two weeks ago.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: He was. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He's really doing a good job. And we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding the border. And they don't play games. They don't play games. It's been pretty amazing. The numbers are way, way down. And we want people to come in, but they have to come in legally, and that's --</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: You got to come in legally. That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it.</p><p>Okay, please. Go ahead. You can finish up.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I appreciate you so much. I really do. As I said earlier, I'm the union president for the workers that are represented by this move that TVA has taken. I met earlier with Tim Burchett and he told me how disgusted he was with it. But that was earlier.</p><p>We've really tried to get our voice heard. We've been screaming, \"Hey! Hey! Help us out.\"</p><p>Finally, U.S. Tech Workers came out, kind of put a commercial together, and we're -- you know, that got your attention, and we appreciate it so much.</p><p>I've lived my whole life in the Tennessee Valley region, and my uncle was a -- worked at TVA during World War Two. He laid his job aside, and went and served and perished in that war. My mother told me TVA was a great place to work, and I -- I've worked there now 35 years.</p><p>This means a lot to the people of the Tennessee Valley region, more than you will ever know. I know that consulting companies looked at what to do with this IT work. They're now looking at what to do -- the same consulting companies are looking at what do with the transmission work. That transmission -- that grid has got to be protected at all cost. And we've got to. We cannot afford to let someone else, who may not have the loyalty to our nation, have the grid.</p><p>And I think that some of these workers here at this table, IT workers, that's one of the biggest they've said to me: There's a large chance that we would be breached. And we can't do that. And we tried to say all those things --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, with our people running it, a very small chance, from what I understand.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes. With the right people running it. right. But you can't give it to just anybody. And that's why these workers at TVA are so important. And I appreciate you and all that you are doing for us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are the people that you're representing, are they -- because you represent a big group of people -- are they all nervous, like the folks at the table?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Like Wendy?</p><p>MS. HENSON: They're going, \"Are we next, Gay\" Is this what's coming next?\" And my answer is, \"Not on my watch, if we can help it.\"</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tell them no. Tell them no, they're not next.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay\" You can tell them. I think we can say that. So thank you very much.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Thank you. I just think you bringing TVA back to their mission of service to the people of the Valley, service to people of the Valley and to this nation is -- is a pivotal moment for the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, right now, their mission is taking care of a lot of consultants and a lot of people and paying -- paying heads of this whole thing $8 million a year. And you'll find a lot of other things in there that are crazy.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, people over profit. And that's what you're doing here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What do the people of Tennessee think when they hear that the head of TVA -- which has been running for a long time -- and, in all fairness, not a very difficult thing; there are many people who can do it. What do they hear when they hear -- and they think of government, you know\" It's sort of semi- -- I guess, you call it -- public-private. But there's not private, really, when you think of it. So, it's a board member.</p><p>What do they think when they hear that the head person is making $8 million a year\" Which is, by the way, I said it before, the most highly paid person anywhere in any country if you call this government, which it sort of is. What do they think when they hear\" Do they know he makes $8 million a year?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they do now after Kevin's commercial. (Laughter.) But they're pretty shocked. I mean -- in fact, they -- I think the workers even -- I think some of the workers at TVA have been shocked about that. It is a lot of money.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But people have known. I've known, actually, before the commercial because we were looking at it. We sent them notices a year ago and two years ago saying, \"We want some information.\" And, you know, people have known this. I just can't even imagine that somebody gets paid $8 million a year.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, the difference --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's the most sought-after job. It has to be the most sought-after job in any country in any government. Right, Tim\" You'd take the job. Would you resign from Congress immediately?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Take it for one year. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You only need it for one year. You --</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I don't know. You don't know my wife and daughter, Mr. President. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim would take it. That's -- he'll take it only --</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, they're actually pretty thrifty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Only for a year. You just need it for one year. That's right. Anyway.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So the workers -- they are surprised at that. But, you know, back to the days of Kilgore and having worked there so long -- I tell people I started when I was eight, because I can't believe how long I've worked there now --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MS. HENSON: But the truth is, there are very capable people at TVA that love --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll bet.</p><p>MS. HENSON: -- the TVA and the mission that they're really -- were put together for and would love to take that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I even think they like your President -- your current President, anyway. I'm not sure about the past President.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Tennessee Valley is -- that's right. The boats on the lake all say, you know --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \"Trump.\" Yeah. No, they're great people. Say hello to them. Just say hello. They're great people.</p><p>Sara, why don't you just discuss it real quick, and you can maybe work with us in getting it all done very quickly. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Of course, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for having us and having everyone here and for all you're doing with regard to immigration. Immigration should be about America, Americans, and the immigrants. Right now -- the way it was, before you started working on it, it's always been the big business, big tech, and universities. And with you, we are working to make immigration in America for the right reasons.</p><p>And Protect U.S. Workers -- I endorsed you in 2016, we endorse you in 2020, and we know for a fact that \"Slow Biden\" and the Democrats will never push towards immigration that benefits Americans, America, and the immigrants. And I think they hide behind: \"Nationalists are bad, immigrants are kind and good.\" And if we are against the immigration the way it is now, then we are \"racists.\"</p><p>But the reality is, if you can keep immigration the way it's going now, the way Joe Biden will push it, the problem is you're actually benefiting the big tech billionaires and universities, and that is not what immigration is about in this country.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Where you come up with the name \"Slow Biden\"? You know, so many people want me to use that term, and I say, \"It's too mean; it's too nasty.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Oh, no! That means I'm mean.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you just come up with that term. And where did that come from\" Is that the --</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: My son, actually, who's 11.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your son\" He's 11?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: If he's 11, and he said he's slow and that he shouldn't be President --</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: They need to pay your son $15 million in consulting. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Actually, during the rallies in 2016, you met my son. He had a Thor, and he dressed him up like President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, that's great.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's very nice. Thank you, Sara. Very -- great job you're doing.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELLL: Thank you so much. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for all you do.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay, Mike. Go ahead. We'll knock it out, Sara.</p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I'll be -- I'll just be very brief.</p><p>Four years ago, when you ran for this office, you said the forgotten men and women in America would be forgotten no more. You said that we'd put America first and American workers first, you said that American workers would have a seat at the table in this administration, and we'd deliver real results.</p><p>And today, we see all that happen right in front of us. Because of your leadership indicated during this meeting, that the TVA is going to reverse course on their plan to use H1-B visa workers to replace hardworking Americans. And I can see the gratitude and the emotion on faces around the room, Mr. President, and the gratitude that these people feel and all those that will be reading about this and hearing about this in the days ahead.</p><p>But I also just want to say, finally, to all the -- all the great Americans who gathered here, who have been willing to speak up: Know that with the executive order the President is signing today, we're not just solving your problem. What the President is committing to today is to end the abuse of our worker visa program once and for all, and pulling together multiple agencies to do that. And I want to promise you that you've not only gone out and been a champion for fellow workers at TVA, but you've been champions for American workers all across this country.</p><p>And I know I speak on behalf of the President and our whole administration when I thank you. Thank you for stepping up for American workers and making it possible for this President to keep one more promise to working Americans. God bless you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. So we're going to sign a little document now. Is that okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: I would love that. Thank you, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it's very important one, aligning federal contractors and contracting and hiring practices with the interests of the American workers, which is very simple -- which actually just boils down to pretty much what we're talking about today. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much, President Trump.</p><p>(The executive order is signed.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Here, give that to Sara because she was there very early. (Distributes signing pen.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I have to give -- I have to give one to you. You got us moving here. That's good. Will you pass these around the table, Mike\" We'll just pass them on that side. You'll pass them on this side. Everybody that doesn't get it -- (distributes signing pens.)</p><p>So here we are.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I'll get you one, Tim. Don't worry.</p><p>So, thank you very much everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>We're going to be -- we're going to be discussing, very shortly, a immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It'll be a very, very comprehensive bill. That's a word that some people love and some people hate, but it'll be very comprehensive only in the sense that it'll cover just about everything.</p><p>It'll be based on merit. It will be -- it'll cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to. And I think it'll be bipartisan, in the sense that people are going to like a lot of the things that are in there. And probably some people won't; we're going to have that. And we'll probably do it maybe a little bit after our convention. We'll sign it after the convention.</p><p>Likewise, we're going to be doing a healthcare bill -- act -- and it'll be extremely comprehensive. It will cover a lot of things that nobody thought you would be able to get, and -- I mean, in a positive way. And I think it'll be very popular. And it will be a great thing for our country.</p><p>In addition, we have many other things. But immigration and healthcare -- it doesn't get much bigger than that. Immigration will be very merit-based, but it'll be -- it'll be great for the worker, and it'll be great for people coming into our country -- but coming into our country legally and loving our country and wanting to help our country, as opposed to people coming in and they don't like our country.</p><p>You see that, and you see that with certain of our politicians that ran for office. I say, \"I don't think they like our country too much. All they do is complain.\" And you would never tell them to go back to their own country because that would be inappropriate, wouldn't it\" But all they do is complain about our country, and their country is going to hell. So, you know, it's sort of an interesting phenomenon.</p><p>So the -- the merit-based immigration is going to be incredible, and the healthcare bill or act is going to be something that I don't think anybody in this country thought they'd ever see. And we've done much of that. If look at some of the legislation that we passed, Ken, I think you can say very strongly we've -- we've gotten things passed that nobody would be possible.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Whether it's Right to Try -- that's where you're terminally ill and you don't have a right to use our great medicines because they haven't been approved -- they're in a line of approval and it takes some time. We've cut the time in half, by the way, for approval by the FDA. But people are sick.</p><p>We have very promising drugs and they're not allowed to use them because -- I mean, they're terminally ill and they wouldn't let them use them because of liability and other things, but I got that taken care of. So, Right to Try was a very important one.</p><p>Getting Veterans Choice was so important -- having Veterans Choice. Nobody thought we could get that. Hasn't been done in 50 years. They haven't been able to get it. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Accountability. Because we have so many other things. So many things.</p><p>And on the border, Ken, we've done things that nobody thought would have been possible. Right\" Do you want to name a couple of them?</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: We're making enormous progress in the -- especially in the regulatory arena: reestablishing the 140-year-old American tradition of inviting immigrants here who can stand on their own two feet, as -- much like Sara had said. And to add to this country and not -- while not becoming a burden on the country.</p><p>We've also -- the security that you've advocated for and pushed us to achieve has been unprecedented on a border that we still have more work to do. But we --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great progress.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: -- the amount of improvement in three years is just extraordinary.</p><p>And one more piece of legislation you know is near and dear to my heart that you led is criminal justice reform, which was -- you know, lots of people before you talked about it, and this is the first administration to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Nobody else could've gotten that done. Nobody. And we really thank Ken, but we thank a lot of people that came through.</p><p>By the way, some conservative -- very conservative really wanted it and some liberal wanted it. But we got criminal justice reform done. Nobody thought that was possible. The biggest beneficiary is African Americans and Hispanic Americans, I would say -- and Asian Americans -- the three, the groups.</p><p>But tremendous benefits and -- you know, it's really amazing. When we got that done, we had people supporting that that I would've never thought would've supported it. Not for bad reasons, but they would've never supported it, and they actually led the way. It's pretty incredible. Criminal justice reform was a big deal. You know that, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So -- and you were helpful actually, and I appreciate it. And thank you very much. Anybody have a question?</p><p>Q Yes, Mr. President --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, on TikTok: You said over the weekend --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q -- that you're planning to ban it. I know that you spoke with the CEO of Microsoft after that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I did.</p><p>Q So can you give us an update on --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q -- where you're at?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We had a great conversation. He called me to see whether or not -- how I felt about it. And I said, \"Look, it can't be controlled, for security reasons, by China. Too big, too invasive, and it can't be.\" And here is the deal: I don't mind if -- whether it's Microsoft or somebody else -- a big company, a secure company, very -- a very American company buy it. It's probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30 percent of it. Because they say, \"How do you do 30 percent\" Who's going to get the name?\" The name is hot; the brand is hot. And who's going to get the name\" How do you do that if it's owned by two different companies?</p><p>So my personal opinion was: You're probably better off buying the whole thing rather than buying 30 percent of it. I think buying 30 percent is complicated. And I suggested that he can go ahead. He can try. We set a date -- I set a date at around September 15th, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States. But if somebody -- and whether it's Microsoft or somebody else -- buys it, that'll be interesting.</p><p>I did say that if you buy it, whatever the price is, that goes to whoever owns it. Because I guess it's China, essentially, but more than anything else. I said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States because we're making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now, they don't have any rights, unless we give it to them. So if we're going to give them the rights, then it has to come into -- it has to come into this country.</p><p>It's a little bit like the landlord/tenant: Without a lease, the tenant has nothing. So they pay what's called \"key money,\" or they pay something. But the United States should be reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money, because without the United States, they don't have anything -- at least having to do with the 30 percent.</p><p>So I told him that. I think we're going to have -- maybe a deal is going to be made. It's a great asset. It's a great asset. But it's not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States. So it'll close down on September 15th, unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal -- an appropriate deal. So the Treasury of the -- really, the Treasury, I guess you would say, of the United States gets a lot of money. A lot of money. Okay?</p><p>Q Mr. President, can you explain why so many of the public health experts on the coronavirus task force are contradicting you on things like why the virus is so widespread in this country, on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine\" Why are so many of these people on your task force contradicting you?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we're doing a great job. I think we're doing great on vaccines. We're doing great on therapeutics. You'll be seeing that very soon. I think we're -- when you look at a map, this is a map of the -- I've got -- I sort of shown that around a little bit, but that's -- the red is the area of most concern. (Displays a U.S. map.) Pretty recent map of the -- of the country. And there's a lot of -- a lot of people that -- in a lot of areas that have gotten very -- you know, better very fast.</p><p>Hydroxy has tremendous support, but politically, it's toxic because I supported it. If they would have said, \"Do not use hydroxychloroquine under any circumstances,\" they would have come out and they would've said, \"It's a great -- it's a great thing.\" Many doctors have come out strongly in favor of it. They want it very badly. It's a great malaria drug.</p><p>So, for many years --</p><p>Q But Admiral Giroir says it's not effective.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me finish my -- let me finish my answer.</p><p>So for many years -- it's, I guess, 60 years it's been a malaria drug; very successful, as you know. And it's been also a drug for lupus. And it caused no trouble -- virtually nothing, in terms of causing people to get sick or having problems with anything. You add the zinc and you add the azithromycin -- the Z-Pak, as they call it -- and it's been very -- I happened to take it myself, the threesome.</p><p>I took it myself for a period of two weeks. I mean, I -- I had no problem. I had no problem whatsoever. And, importantly, I, you know, didn't test positive. That's very nice. Okay\" I'm very happy about that negative.</p><p>And so -- so that's the story. It's -- it's very highly thought of. Interestingly, a great doctor, from what I understand -- a great doctor from Yale feels very strongly about hydroxychloroquine. The Ford Clinic in Michigan came out with a very, very powerful paper saying it's very good. Many other -- in France, as you know, they came out with a very positive statement. Many individual doctors have come out with very positive statements.</p><p>I will tell you that if I was surrounded by people, as I was at the time -- the reason I took it: You know, we had some people that were relatively near me that tested positive. And I took it for that reason, just because I've heard good things.</p><p>Q But Fauci says it doesn't work. Admiral Giroir says it doesn't work.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I don't agree with Fauci on everything.</p><p>Q They're on your task force.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I don't agree with Fauci. Look, Fauci didn't want -- and I -- I like him. I get along with him actually great. But he didn't want to ban people from China from coming into the country, and I overrode him and I did the right thing. He was saying face masks are no good a short while ago. So it doesn't mean he's a bad person, because he's not. He's a good person; I like him. But we -- we disagree on things. We disagree on things.</p><p>Now, I will say this: We've done an amazing job with ventilators. We're supplying the world with ventilators. Ventilators are very hard, very expensive, very hard to make, very complex. Very complicated machines. Very -- very expensive.</p><p>Q But why does the --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it. Hold it.</p><p>Q But why does the U.S. have so many deaths?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it.</p><p>Q The U.S. has so many deaths compared to --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it.</p><p>Q -- so many countries around the world. I --</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Fake news CNN, hold it. We have done a great job in this country. We haven't been given -- and not me. I'm not talking about me. The Vice President, the task force have not been given the kind of credit.</p><p>If you look, countries all over the world are exploding right now -- people that you said were doing a wonderful job, so wonderful. But right now, take a look at the countries that are exploding: You have Italy back. You have Spain back. You have France back. You have Germany back. You have a lot of countries, and that's not to knock them.</p><p>It is a very delicate, very contagious disease. It was released by China. It should never have been allowed to release. There was the source where you could have stopped it. And they did stop it from going into China, although now they say that China is having a lot of problems. Moscow, in Russia, is having tremendous problems.</p><p>What China unleashed was a very, very sad situation. With all of that being understood, the United States has done an amazing job, a great job, and you're going to see that because we have vaccines and we have therapeutics coming very soon.</p><p>Yeah, go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, why are you not involved directly in negotiations with Capitol Hill?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I am. Oh, why\" The fact that I'm not over there with Crazy Nancy\" No, I'm totally involved.</p><p>Q Have you spoken with her?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'm totally involved. And we're going to be doing some things that are very good, because we don't think that she -- look, what Chuck Schumer wants more than anybody -- and I would say Nancy Pelosi would be second -- they want to bail out cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period of time. Nothing to do with coronavirus or China virus, or whatever you want to call it.</p><p>They want to bail out cities and states. They want bailout money. They want to trillion dollars in bailout money, and a lot of people don't want to do that because we don't think it's right. The Democrats have run some very bad states and some very, very bad cities, and a lot of people don't want to give them a trillion dollars to reward them for doing a bad job.</p><p>If you look at some of the states -- I won't insult anybody by naming those states, but you know what they are. They want bailout money. They're not interested in the people. They're not interested in unemployment. They're not interested in evictions, which is a big deal -- the evictions. They want to evict. A lot of people are going to be evicted, but I'm going to stop it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to executive orders, and we're looking at that very seriously right now.</p><p>But what the Democrats want, they want -- they're slow-rolling it, and all they're really interested in is bailout money to bail out radical-left governors and radical-left mayors, like in Portland and places that are so badly run. Chicago, New York City -- you see what's going on over there. Bailout cities and states who have been poorly run and spent a fortune doing it, they want a trillion dollars, and we're really not interested in that.</p><p>Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>Q What about the Postal Service, Mr. President\" What about the Postal Service\" Any message to your postmaster general?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jim, very much. Thank you.</p><p>END 1:10 P.M.

EDT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. And today I'm signing an executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule: Hire American. We've been doing it at a level that hasn't been done maybe ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'll also be taking firm, disciplinary action against the leadership of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has sadly and cruelly betrayed American workers. And we have some of those great American workers with us at the table. This is the Cabinet Room, and it's an honor to have you in the Cabinet Room and at the Oval Office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're joined by the Vice President; Congressman Tim Burchett, who's doing a fantastic job in the state of Tennessee; Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia; Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Secretary, Ken Cuccinelli. Where's Ken? Hi, Ken. I didn't see you down there. That's great. Doing a great job.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Quiet, as usual.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Keep you busy, right? (Laughter.) We're keeping you busy, Ken.</p><p>Recently, the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeffrey Lyash, made a disastrous and heartless decision. The TVA announced that it would lay off over 200 American workers and replace them with cheaper foreign workers brought in from overseas.</p><p>The Tennessee Valley Authority leadership then ordered the American workers to train their foreign replacements, rubbing salt in their very open wound.</p><p>So we're going to bring in workers. They're going to foreign workers. And people from Tennessee, and some others states right around it, are going to train them what to do and how to do it. It doesn't work that way.</p><p>As we speak, we're finalizing H1-B regulations so that no American worker is replaced ever again. H1-Bs should be used for top, highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labor program to destroy American jobs.</p><p>Sitting at the table are six of the TVA workers who were ordered to train the foreign labor flown in to replace them. I want you and your colleagues to know that my administration will not be putting up with I happen to know a young woman who's been very active over the last couple of years because we were together on Disney and a couple of other things.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it all seems to be working out pretty well.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing a great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And thank you for it.</p><p>But that's why I'm formally removing the chairman of the board, James Thompson, and board member Richard Howorth. If the TVA does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire their workers, then more board members will be removed. We have the absolute right to remove board members. And the board makes the decision; I don't make the decision. I saw there was an ad on television talking about the amount of money that the chairman makes, and it's a ridiculous amount of money. But we have the right to replace the board, and the board is the one the only ones that get the right to then hire a new person.</p><p>Furthermore, the board must immediately hire that new CEO who puts the interest of American workers first. The current CEO, Jeff Lyash, is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year. Did you know that? Eight million. He's the highest-paid government official of any country anywhere in the world.</p><p>Now, I don't know that you call him officially a \"government.\" It might be a public-private. It may be something a lot time ago, it was established, Tennessee Valley Authority. But he gets $8 million a year. So that was just a succession of deep-swamp things happening, and it's a disgrace. But he gets $8 million a year, and I can think of about almost 100 percent of the people I know would take that job. (Laughter.) It's not a very hard job. I mean, you have not a lot of debt, not a lot of anything, right?</p><p>Public service is just that: Those who takes these jobs must be focused on the public good, not on personal profit. He would have taken the job for millions and millions of dollars less, but nobody asked him to do that. Okay? He would have gone for less. You could have had him for $4 million, $6 million, $7 million, $2 million, $1 million, probably $500,000 a year.</p><p>But the new CEO must be paid no more than $500,000 a year, which is still a significant amount more than the President of the United States makes. And I donate my salary. I've donated it. From what I hear, I'm the only President to do that. You'll have to check on that, but that's what I've heard. I'm very surprised to hear that. But I donate my full salary; I don't take it.</p><p>The board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure, too. We don't want him leaving and then he gets a big check for millions and millions of dollars.</p><p>We want the TVA to take action on this immediately: Lower energy prices in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. I love all those states. Any additional states you can think of there? I don't know. Let's see. So we're talking about of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Great states, there every one of them.</p><p>So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words: \"You're fired.\" \"You're fired.\" It's ridiculous. The man is getting $8 million. It'd be interesting to see how much money he made before this. And I have no idea. Maybe he made more. I don't know. But I doubt it. But it'd be interesting to see. He got this position must have been politically inspired because I can think of probably, almost, everybody in the nation would have liked this position, including every one of the media folks across the table from me. I would say that everybody would have liked this position.</p><p>So, with that, we're getting rid of him in one form or another. Either the board is going to do it, we're going to do it. But he's gone. And he's done not a great job. He's done not even a good job, in certain ways. Plants in Kentucky he could've kept the plant open in Kentucky, if he wanted to, even if they retrofitted the plant. And he didn't do that, did he, Congressman?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn't do that.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We asked him to do it. He didn't want to do it. We said, \"That's okay.\" And here we are doing what we're doing today.</p><p>So we will get somebody for a much lower price. I want the saving much lower salary I want the saving to go to the people of these great states in the form of energy savings. And that's a pretty substantial number.</p><p>So, Kevin, could I ask you to start off and say a few words, please?</p><p>MR. LYNN: I certainly appreciate that, Mr. President. My name is Kevin Lynn. I'm the executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform and the founder of U.S. Tech Workers. And thank you for paying attention to our ad, Mr. President.</p><p>We were founded we founded U.S. Tech Workers three years ago to look at the and inform the public on the great harm that's being caused by the outsourcing and offshoring of our skilled labor jobs. And, Mr. President, I want to thank you for inviting us here. On behalf of U.S. Tech Workers and the Tennessee Valley Authority, we appreciate your willingness to look at the endangered jobs of the Tennessee Valley Authority workers, especially in a time of pandemic and an election year, when you've been so busy signing documents that affect the welfare of millions of Americans.</p><p>Taking time to ensure that these hundreds of workers, under your administration, can continue to provide great services to the American people, as they have since 1933, shows the people of Tennessee and beyond that you stand by your promise to keep American jobs with Americans.</p><p>This is a historic moment that I'm hopeful will reverse the harm outsourcing and offshoring have done to our nation's productive classes. And it is my hope that Congress will join you, Mr. President, in making sure our workers are more secure in their jobs.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. LYNN: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you're the one that took the ad about me that I didn't know that. (Laughter.) I was just saying, you know, \"I think he's the one that took this, really, vicious ad.\" Like, I hired this guy for $8 million, that I had nothing to do with it. I said, \"What's that?\" But, actually, you brought something very important up, because when I looked into it, I said, \"This guy is actually making $8 million a year.\" And you did the ad. So you really made me aware of what was going on with the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has been a a feeding pot for a long time. And a lot of deep state, a lot of swamp creatures, okay?</p><p>So, that's it. So we're going to make that I see. So I think now you realize that it wasn't about me. I hope you now realize that.</p><p>MR. LYNN: I do realize that, Mr. President. (Laughter.) But if I could</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I accept I accept your apology. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: In full disclosure, Mr. President, when we sat down with the Davis Agency constructing the ad, they said, \"Who's your audience?\" And I said, \"Just one person. He's the only one that...\"</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's smart. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: \"...would do this, and he's the only one that can come to the aid of these workers in the Tennessee Valley.\"</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He's the only one with any guts to do it who has guts to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll tell you, though I have to say, Kevin, the end was very appropriate. And while it has nothing to do with me, I can do things with respect to the board, and ultimately, the board controls that decision. This is a very, very old authority done in the</p><p>MR. LYNN: 1933, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So it was done during the FDR days. And it's been you know, it's been getting crazier and crazier just over the years. And they have, basically, nobody watching over them. And the board isn't watching. You see this happening in public companies also. You see it happening a lot.</p><p>But for a essentially I would say, for a federal employee to be paid $8 million now what we're doing is we're looking at the board members, how much are they paid. Because usually what happens is they pay, and then he says, \"You know, I think you ought to get more money.\" And everybody is making a lot of money, and your pricing for electric and utilities starts going up, and people say, \"I wonder why.\"</p><p>I also see that they're doing a lot of things in terms of electric, which is very expensive electric. They're building facilities that are very, very expensive to build and don't work well. But we'll discuss that separately.</p><p>But I appreciate it because you did make me aware of what's going on, and it's a terrific thing we're doing today. Thank you very much, Kevin.</p><p>Please, Stacy. How are you?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: I'm doing fine. Mr. President, my name is Stacy Whetzell. I'm the son of a sharecropper.</p><p>First, I want to thank you for being the great American President you are and for caring about and looking out for the great American citizens and workers. We thank you for that.</p><p>I picked cotton from the time I was big enough to carry my own pick sack until I married. My wife and I have been married 47 years and have 7 children and 14 grandchildren. I began working for TVA in 1975 as a carpenter's apprentice. Currently, I'm the system administrator on TVA's core team that's responsible for installing a $20 million computer system. Our team and the entire IT department have been praised and thanked multiple times this summer for the outstanding performance we've done.</p><p>So it was shocking and devastating to be notified on July the 23rd that IT leadership had decided our team and a total of 40 workers would be terminated and our work done to others. This brings the total planned outsourced jobs to over 200 in TVA information technology alone. We believe there are more planned to come.</p><p>The three companies chosen to do the IT work are all three foreign companies that depend heavily on H1-B workers. We're required to train these our replacements, as President Trump said. Apparently, we're good enough to train but not retain.</p><p>Using H1-B workers to replace capable and willing American citizens is turning entire American communities upside down. Left unchecked, it will turn our nation upside down and negatively impact our national security as certainly as our 50-year build-up of dependence on China for manufacturing has. Thank you, President Trump, for beginning to reverse that hive-centric mistake.</p><p>American patriots will forever be grateful that you're also acting and fought the misguided and out-of-control H1-B worker program. I thank you for Americans first and acting to stop this travesty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you're a very powerful speaker. And so powerful that we just got a call Mark just brought this in from the TVA CEO, and he's indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course. (Laughter and applause.)</p><p>So it must have been Stacy. I think Stacy did a much better job than me. I mean, you're talking and all of the sudden, I get the note.</p><p>So he's looking to change course and reverse it, and that's good. Now, maybe he'll take a major cut in salary, too. That'll be phase two, right? So we'll take a look at that. And maybe you'll start looking at that on behalf of everybody, gratis. Right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your group. That's great, isn't it.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I mean, TVA told me while we were in this process of working on behalf of the workers I'm the union president, IFPTE-Engineering Association. They told me it's going to take a message a stop order from the President in order to keep us from moving forward. And I said, \"I'm working on that.\" (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Everybody in this room did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: I appreciate you, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, Congressman, you have my endorsement.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? You had it anyway, but you have it now. It's a great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Well, I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: The only congressman in the room. I tell you, Tim, great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, brother.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's only phase one. Phase two is imagine being paid the $8 million a year to run a thing that's pretty easy to run, in all fairness. It's not like he built it; he didn't build it. He went there and he's been there, and he gets a lot of money, and it shouldn't be. Five hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, right?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir. In Tennessee, it is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And I'm willing to say he gets paid more money than I do. I don't care.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But, you know, it shouldn't happen.</p><p>So that's a start. That's a start. And I think we should find out what board members make, okay? Because</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I'll look into that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I can almost guarantee you they're paid heavily.</p><p>Congratulations, Stacy. Really good.</p><p>Please, go ahead.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir. Mr. President, thank you. My name is David Littlejohn. I am a soon-to-be father. This November, my wife will be giving birth to my first child. I am a long line I'm the son in a long line of military men and women, so I was born with a heart of service. And with that, I love to serve the people of the Valley.</p><p>I was told July 23rd that I would be sent home and to be trained training a contractor from a H1-B-dependent contract company. Now, I'm shaking right now because</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing great.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You had a big victory already. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>I'm shaking right now because this really impacts me and my wife and my unborn child, and I greatly appreciate everyone here to support us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate it, and thank you very much.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you'll see what happens. It's going to be very quick, too. Thank you.</p><p>Wendy, please.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah. I'm Wendy Turner, and thank you for having us here. I've been a software engineer at TVA for 19 years. I'm going to change my comments a little. I was (inaudible) saying, you know, for the first time in 19 years, I didn't know what was going to happen to me and my kids, and I also take care of my mom. But what we're going to do going forward so, thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And this was everybody felt this way in Tennessee Valley Authority then, I guess right? if you do. You've been there for 19 years. So everyone had to feel this way, like there's been a big feeling of doubt, right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Right. Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's a terrible thing.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They're waiting for it to happen to them.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, and I've been training since June. I've been training our replacements from a company that relied on</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You've been training people?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yes. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And so, did they let you off yet? Or are you not sure?</p><p>MS. TURNER: I got my notice in June that we would be laid off September 1st.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you're training people to take your job at a whatever. Right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They told us it would be</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And where are the people from that you're training?</p><p>MS. TURNER: All over the place. We everything is done remotely or</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are they from other countries?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They're here on soil now. I don't know their status as far as</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Because with Disney, they were from other countries, right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, so I don't know. I know the com- Accenture is replacing our group, and I know they rely heavily on H1-B workers, but I don't know for sure where everyone is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, we'll make sure that things work out for the three of them because they're brave to be here, actually, Sara. So you'll check that out, right?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let's see that they get their jobs back</p><p>MS. TURNER: Thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: because I hear you're great workers. I mean, I said I want people, but I also people that are really good workers that did a great job. Because, you know, people can be let go; should be able to if they're not doing a good job. I'm all for that. I think I'll bet you are.</p><p>But I said, \"I want people that really do a great job and were unfairly let go.\" Right, Tim?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's, to me, very important.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Wendy. We'll see what happens. Okay? We're going to push it hard.</p><p>Chuck, please.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I recognize how busy your schedule is, and I sincerely appreciate your time today. Okay?</p><p>I'm Chuck Charnawskas. Basically, I've had the opportunity to work with the really technically competent people of the Tennessee Valley for seven years, okay? It's been a great experience. I have a degree in electrical engineering, 45 years of valuable industrial experience, and I'm a certified security professional here, okay?</p><p>Working with the people in Tennessee Valley was how I learned just how important the Tennessee Valley is to 11 million people in seven different states, okay, and how it basically impacts their lives. It's absolutely significant. And that is the reason that I'm really here today.</p><p>The TVA basically has the capability to produce 35 billion watts of powers, okay? They have 17,000 lines of high-voltage transmission.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How does that compare to other big utilities, would you say?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: It definitely ranks right in the top of them. There's no question about it. And very significant: Tennessee Valley is part of the Southeastern Reliability Corporation, and it's obviously one of the biggest players in that area.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yea, it's very big. That's a lot.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Very significant in that respect, okay? And in essence here, as a consequence of that, they also basically support 35 dams that produce power from 29 to do flood control.</p><p>Just a couple years ago, they were able to reduce billions of dollars of potential damage by managing the rivers correctly, in that case.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: They have three major power plants nuclear power plants.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What's your biggest dam? What's the big dam?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Probably it would be Chickamauga or</p><p>MR. HICKS: Wilson. Wilson Dam, in Alabama.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Wilson in Alabama.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: There's the expert, right down there. (Laughter.) So I defer to the expert about that.</p><p>But the bottom line of it: As a consequence of this, it's a very a very important player not only in the Southeast region, but for (inaudible) internationally, okay? And today, the TVA receives hundreds if not thousands of potential attacks cyberattacks testing its network here, right?</p><p>It's imperative to have experienced, knowledgeable employees to handle that situation, yeah. Okay?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And a fine example of this and I just kind of you know, it's a little bit humorous, but the great power outage in 2003 was affected by a software glitch okay? that impacted and it shut down Manhattan for 24 hours.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I remember that very well. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: I thought you might be related or familiar with that. So, as a it just really points to the significance of having qualified, vetted people with proper clearances.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: dedicated to that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree. That wouldn't happen with you, would it? Huh? It wouldn't happen.</p><p>MS. TURNER: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And then just a quickly, two other quick points. Basically, this outsourcing agreement could impact the Tennessee Valley has always our goals are to provide energy, economic development, and protect the environment. This particular outsourcing agreement could impact the Valley by $88 million to these local economies here. And for the individuals that are in there, not only may they lose their primary income, but they may consequently have insurance costs that basically reflect a 3- to 400 percent increase for these families on how they manage it.</p><p>And I'd like</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And you're going to lose you're going to lose people when you're firing people that are they live in Tennessee and they live in Georgia and they live in the other states that I mentioned, and it's not a fair situation.</p><p>Go ahead. Let's let's go, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Final point: The effort here to make America great again okay reflects the fact that we need to take into repatriate manufacturing companies and companies to take and spend our money domestically and support the domestic product. How can we justify spending these millions of dollars for one particular consulting firm, $15 million to</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Who is the consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, that would be Capgemini (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You spent $15 million a year on a consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, this was a</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We just found another nugget of gold. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Sara doesn't care about that one, but that's a (laughter) I care about. You spent $15 million to one consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: It's not it's not a consulting that's one of the companies that are picking up. And it's Capgemini, and that's $15 million that just for that one company.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How many are there how many are there like that?</p><p>MS. HENSON: There's Capgemini, CGI, Accenture, and Tech Systems at TVA</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And they're paying tremendous amount of money?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir. And our workers are more than capable.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very they're very political people. You know this is a very political group of people you just named?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Really? I just know that</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Not to me. Not to me, I don't care. (Laughter.) I don't care who they are, but they they are very political.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, I mean, and these people are more than capable of doing the job and have done it with excellence. And TVA says your matrix for your performance is above; it doesn't make sense. And what you're doing I cannot tell you how much it means to me. And for these workers it and I'm very emotional because TVA is a large racket. They do their thing, and nobody can touch them. And I believe today they've been touched.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's a racket.</p><p>MS. HENSON: They've been touched. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, it's a racket. Well, we just found that out. (Laughter.) No, it's a racket.</p><p>I mean I mean, I understand it. The four firms that you just mentioned that are paid tens of millions of dollars, they're very political firms. You know, they may be good, but they're very political firms. And they do it for much less much much, much, much less. You could give them half. You could give them 10 percent, they'd probably do it for. Those are big numbers for a consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they're they're not the consulting firm; they're the ones actually going to take these people's jobs. That</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's worse.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, it is worse. So I mean</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim, go ahead, please.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Mr. President, thank you</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: and Vice President so much for this. My mama worked at TVA after the Second during the at the end of the Second World War, when dad came home from the Pacific and married her, and then she went into education. But, you know, working people are the backbone of this country. That's not cliche and you've</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: you've highlighted that so much with the trades and other things, and I'm very appreciative of the fact.</p><p>But I'll you what: Dadgummit, if TVA wants be Duke Electric, let them because Duke Electric, but they're not. And they they hide behind the government's skirt and they they use eminent domain, and their arrogance is beyond belief. You know, when they had the ash spill, people died, and then you know, and then they are just these poor country folks that are just pushing them off until they all die off, until those lawsuits go away. It's ridiculous.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, that's right. And, by the way, in Kentucky, when we wanted to have a plant open with a lot of jobs, they didn't even want to consider it.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No. No, they didn't. It's their arrogance. You're questioning them, and finally we have a President with the guts that understands business and government. And if TVA wants to be a government entity, they need to they need to declare it, and quit using they hide behind you know, they have their their</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think Joe Biden would do this?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Heck no.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn't know you're alive.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He'd be no, he'd</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He doesn't know he's alive either. (Laughter.)</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He needs to get out of the bunker.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, can you imagine him sitting at this table right now? Wouldn't have a clue.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. So go ahead, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, I think you pretty much covered it, Mr. President. I'm just honored to be here. And I</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm honored that you're here. And you've done a fantastic job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: And I thank you for standing up for working Americans.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, well we're going to and we're going to get this finished too. So we'll get it finished, Sara.</p><p>Thank you very much, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Gene, please.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Mr. President, thank you for bringing this group together. And this this meeting has, I think, shown a very human impact on individual working</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Incredible.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: men and women of a practice that's actually pretty widespread.</p><p>And the way it's worked under our immigration laws for a while now is that a company that wants to bring in workers from overseas wants to use the H1-B program for high-skilled workers has to file an attestation with us at the Labor Department, saying American workers aren't going to lose their jobs when I bring in these H1-B workers. And they have to say it's not going to hurt their wages.</p><p>But what companies do is they bring workers in, and then they lease them out to another company. And so you've got one company bringing them in and then leasing them to TVA. And it's true, the company bringing them in their workers aren't being affected, but the TVA workers are.</p><p>And so I took a look at this, as your Labor Secretary, recently, and I said to my staff I said, \"Well, if the workers are going to the other company, why doesn't the other company, where they're actually going to be working and supervised, also file an application?\"</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. Right.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: \"And say, 'We're not going to affect U.S. workers either.'\" And I said to staff, \"Why can't we do that?\" They looked into it. And, Mr. President, today, you're going be signing an order</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: that requires that change.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: So, going forward, when those workers are going to another company, both companies are going to (inaudible) (applause) and that's a change we'll make. We'll do it together with the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>I just want to mention one other thing we're doing together. For more than 15 years, the Secretary of Labor has had the authority to initiate an investigation of abuse of H1-B program when he or she finds reasonable cause. That has never been done. That authority has never been used.</p><p>But again, we saw signed a memo of understanding on Friday with the Department of Homeland Security that'll change that too. They're going to now share information they have, which I can then use to bring cases when we're finding the program (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. You're going to find a lot. And thank you very much, Gene.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Thank you. And thank you for this order today.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Good work, Stacy. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right, Stacy? Right? I like that. You like that?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: We'll take it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Linda, please.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being with us today. The concern you show for American workers is greatly appreciated. And my mother made me promise to tell you that Alabama loves and appreciates your leadership. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I love Alabama.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, a promise that my mother made.</p><p>My name is Linda McDonald. I've lived in northeast Alabama my entire life. My goal was to work at TVA; that was my American Dream. After years of sacrifice and hard work, I achieved that goal. I've been working for TVA for seven years now. But so, and in that role, I got to see every day</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So that was like an ambition of yours to work someday for TVA?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Correct.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you finally got there?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I did.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, what's happening?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, June 30th, we were told that we would be outsourced to another company with</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: All right. Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, so, here I am, faced with</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you had to have these consulting firms making 10, 15 million dollars a year?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, I feel like my</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And the man that heads it making $8 million a year, right? (Laughter.)</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I feel like my American Dream was being stolen from me</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: and given to someone else. So I just think</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Is that the way you view it: \"given to somebody else\"?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: It is. It was taken from me, and</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's a very interesting way</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: it was then given to someone else.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: of viewing it, right?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, I thank you for listening to us, because it felt, for so long, like no one was even listening to us. So thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I've been hearing about it for a long time. When I was running, I met Sara, and we worked on the Disney situation</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: but that was a long time ago. But and, you know, this has been happening for a while. So we're taking care of it.</p><p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Linda. We'll see what happens. You may be very pleasantly surprised. Okay?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I hope so.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>Jonathan, please.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, thank you for your time.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MR. HICKS: My name is Jonathan Hicks. I'm a I'm from a large family, and we've had three three members of our family who have served in the U.S. military. I grew up in Tennessee, around the Knoxville area, and started my career with TVA in 2001 as an IT intern. During as soon as I graduated, I got a fulltime job there, and I've been there for for 19 years. I've been</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And that was a big deal, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Working because there's a great prestige to that.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's true.</p><p>MR. HICKS: I've spent my time there working for river operations for the for their group, and helping them, you know, have programs mostly in-house solutions to be able to manage the river and the river systems.</p><p>I was told in June early June that I would be training replacements, that I would be receiving my work notice in September, and that the workers that I'd be training, there's been five or plus that I've been training for my one position, and at least four of those seem to be H1-B type workers.</p><p>I guess there's a concern with the kind of stuff that we do, at least for the river operations, and that they're generating a significant amount of power out of all the out of all the all of these dams. And, you know, is this something that that we want to turn over this knowledge, this ability to control these dams and you know, whether it be generation, whether it be floodgates and hand it over to corporations that aren't in the U.S., to workers that aren't necessarily in the U.S. doing this work?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are you there now? Are you</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I I've been put on non-work status. I'm still employed and still getting a paycheck until September 1st, but I've been</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What happens on September 1st?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I've been relieved of my job duties, but September 1st is when I would lose</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you train people to take your job?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you've worked with people to take your job.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You've taught them, like, almost everything you know, but plenty, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I I think there's a big</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Maybe not. Maybe you held back a couple of secrets. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I think there's a I think there's a big learning curve and there's for the knowledge that they do there for river operations, I think it takes several years of understanding the job in order to be able to do this.</p><p>The people that are taking over the job have never dealt with utilities, they've never dealt with power generation, they've never dealt with any kind of water management or hydrogenation. And so the to say that they're ready to go is a misstatement. So</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, let's see how out it works out, Jonathan. I think you're going to be in very good shape. Okay? I have a prediction.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p>Please.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: It's I'm so honored to be here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Honored to have you.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: My name is Renae McKenzie, and I actually work for the Engineering Association as an advocate for these IT employees and for other white-collar workers. But I've worked really closely with the IT professionals at TVA, with all of this that has been going on.</p><p>I've had to witness the anguish of the different employees that are performing these knowledge transfers on the software and the applications that they actually custom built themselves.</p><p>But so many TVA employees have been there from the beginning of their careers. So to actually witness what's happening to them, being replaced by these non-Americans, is very difficult.</p><p>But I think one of the hardest things to witness is what TVA is actually doing to themselves. I mean, their mission is about bringing economic development to the Tennessee Valley. And to be taking that taking our economy and just giving it outside of the United States is just almost it's unbelievable because of what they stand for and what they were built for. To come out of economic</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you see them going outside of the United States, not just here. You see them go</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Well, if you look at these companies, these companies are based outside of the United States. So so when they're getting their millions of dollars, I mean, it's going to France, it's really going to I think one of them is</p><p>MS. HENSON: India.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: India, Canada.</p><p>PARTICIPANT: Ireland</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: And Ireland. So, yes, our dollars are going to them.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Unbelievable. And they get us in many other ways too, but we're stopping it, as you noticed. That's very interesting.</p><p>So you would say France, India, Ireland, Canada. Who else?</p><p>MS. HENSON: That's the main groups right there. Those (inaudible) countries.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Those are the main ones.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: A lot of them are a lot of the workers being outsourced</p><p>MR. LYNN: All these firms: H1-B visa dependent. And 70 percent of H1-B visa workers in the United States come from one country: mainly, India.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: You know, Mr. President, I worry too about the national security. You know, we're during a pandemic, people are out of work, and our electric grid could be put in the hands of folks that, maybe, their loyalty isn't to this great country, and that bothers me.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You know, with TVA, more so than most companies. You're right you're talking about controlling all of that energy and power. It's you're right. You're right about that, Tim. That's a very good statement. Anything else?</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Just, it again, it's such an honor to be in your presence. (Laughs.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's my honor. It's my great honor. Do you know the man next to you is Ken Cuccinelli, a legend? (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Look, and I tend to be very quiet like him. Just saying.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He's a legend in his own mind. (Laughter.)</p><p>Ken Ken has done a fantastic job on the border. Unbelievable job on the border. And you might just tell us for a couple of seconds while we have the the media here I'm sure they'll report it very accurately how well we're doing on the border and then maybe get on to make a statement, because I know you've been working with Gene and everybody very hard.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Yes. And Secretary Scalia really covered the partnership with between DHS and Department of Labor to solve this problem. You're solving it forcefully today for these folks. You're certainly putting the ball in motion to do that. And what we're our two agencies, at your direction from June, are going to do is solve this permanently so that we never have to see this happen again.</p><p>But, on the border, we're seeing success with your leadership with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. The relationships you helped us forge last year, in 2019, are bearing fruit at the border during a very difficult time with the coronavirus and that taskforce, of course, led by the Vice President. And the ability since March to enforce the public health order there has changed the nature of our ability to protect the border.</p><p>There are still people getting away, more than we would like. But last year, they were running to us; this year, they're running from us, at the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's right.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It's a bit different. And over 80 percent of the folks that we're apprehending are being returned to Mexico in under two hours, which is astonishing. It's just an astonishing turn.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It used to take, in some cases, years. Years.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Right. Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's been incredible what's happened at the border. And I think the wall is helping you quite a bit, right? We have now about almost 271 miles of wall.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Everywhere that that new system is put in place, the Border Patrol agents are just universal in their praise for both their safety and the way it impedes illegal traffic not just people, but drugs, as well, and so forth. So it's extremely effective, and it's going up faster and faster and faster.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They had a human trafficker the other day saying that they used to go out and they're trafficking human traffic mostly women and children, but mostly women, and they'd bring them across the border, taped up and horrible.</p><p>And this guy was saying how they used to go up and they'd make a left turn. They'd make a right and then a left into the United States. He says, and now we just keep driving into this massive wall that nobody gets through. Nobody is getting through that wall. That wall is the real deal. And it's steel, concrete, and everything else. And lots of cameras all over it.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And drones on top of it. And people aren't getting through. But it's been an incredible, incredible success.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It's a real force multiplier for the Border Patrol and OFO.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And Mexico is helping us a lot. They have</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: A lot better partnership.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: 27,000 soldiers.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: I remember how people complained about how you were pushing them so hard last year. But the partnership that's grown up with Mexico has been the best. We have really had, in decades, if not forever</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's what they say.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: in cooperating and securing the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They have a very good President who was just here two weeks ago.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: He was. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He's really doing a good job. And we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding the border. And they don't play games. They don't play games. It's been pretty amazing. The numbers are way, way down. And we want people to come in, but they have to come in legally, and that's</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: You got to come in legally. That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it.</p><p>Okay, please. Go ahead. You can finish up.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I appreciate you so much. I really do. As I said earlier, I'm the union president for the workers that are represented by this move that TVA has taken. I met earlier with Tim Burchett and he told me how disgusted he was with it. But that was earlier.</p><p>We've really tried to get our voice heard. We've been screaming, \"Hey! Hey! Help us out.\"</p><p>Finally, U.S. Tech Workers came out, kind of put a commercial together, and we're you know, that got your attention, and we appreciate it so much.</p><p>I've lived my whole life in the Tennessee Valley region, and my uncle was a worked at TVA during World War Two. He laid his job aside, and went and served and perished in that war. My mother told me TVA was a great place to work, and I I've worked there now 35 years.</p><p>This means a lot to the people of the Tennessee Valley region, more than you will ever know. I know that consulting companies looked at what to do with this IT work. They're now looking at what to do the same consulting companies are looking at what do with the transmission work. That transmission that grid has got to be protected at all cost. And we've got to. We cannot afford to let someone else, who may not have the loyalty to our nation, have the grid.</p><p>And I think that some of these workers here at this table, IT workers, that's one of the biggest they've said to me: There's a large chance that we would be breached. And we can't do that. And we tried to say all those things</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, with our people running it, a very small chance, from what I understand.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes. With the right people running it. right. But you can't give it to just anybody. And that's why these workers at TVA are so important. And I appreciate you and all that you are doing for us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are the people that you're representing, are they because you represent a big group of people are they all nervous, like the folks at the table?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Like Wendy?</p><p>MS. HENSON: They're going, \"Are we next, Gay? Is this what's coming next?\" And my answer is, \"Not on my watch, if we can help it.\"</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tell them no. Tell them no, they're not next.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? You can tell them. I think we can say that. So thank you very much.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Thank you. I just think you bringing TVA back to their mission of service to the people of the Valley, service to people of the Valley and to this nation is is a pivotal moment for the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, right now, their mission is taking care of a lot of consultants and a lot of people and paying paying heads of this whole thing $8 million a year. And you'll find a lot of other things in there that are crazy.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, people over profit. And that's what you're doing here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What do the people of Tennessee think when they hear that the head of TVA which has been running for a long time and, in all fairness, not a very difficult thing; there are many people who can do it. What do they hear when they hear and they think of government, you know? It's sort of semi- I guess, you call it public-private. But there's not private, really, when you think of it. So, it's a board member.</p><p>What do they think when they hear that the head person is making $8 million a year? Which is, by the way, I said it before, the most highly paid person anywhere in any country if you call this government, which it sort of is. What do they think when they hear? Do they know he makes $8 million a year?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they do now after Kevin's commercial. (Laughter.) But they're pretty shocked. I mean in fact, they I think the workers even I think some of the workers at TVA have been shocked about that. It is a lot of money.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But people have known. I've known, actually, before the commercial because we were looking at it. We sent them notices a year ago and two years ago saying, We want some information. And, you know, people have known this. I just can't even imagine that somebody gets paid $8 million a year.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, the difference</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's the most sought-after job. It has to be the most sought-after job in any country in any government. Right, Tim? You'd take the job. Would you resign from Congress immediately?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Take it for one year. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You only need it for one year. You</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I don't know. You don't know my wife and daughter, Mr. President. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim would take it. That's he'll take it only</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, they're actually pretty thrifty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Only for a year. You just need it for one year. That's right. Anyway.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So the workers they are surprised at that. But, you know, back to the days of Kilgore and having worked there so long I tell people I started when I was eight, because I can't believe how long I've worked there now</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MS. HENSON: But the truth is, there are very capable people at TVA that love</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll bet.</p><p>MS. HENSON: the TVA and the mission that they're really were put together for and would love to take that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I even think they like your President your current President, anyway. I'm not sure about the past President.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Tennessee Valley is that's right. The boats on the lake all say, you know</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \"Trump.\" Yeah. No, they're great people. Say hello to them. Just say hello. They're great people.</p><p>Sara, why don't you just discuss it real quick, and you can maybe work with us in getting it all done very quickly. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Of course, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for having us and having everyone here and for all you're doing with regard to immigration. Immigration should be about America, Americans, and the immigrants. Right now the way it was, before you started working on it, it's always been the big business, big tech, and universities. And with you, we are working to make immigration in America for the right reasons.</p><p>And Protect U.S. Workers I endorsed you in 2016, we endorse you in 2020, and we know for a fact that \"Slow Biden\" and the Democrats will never push towards immigration that benefits Americans, America, and the immigrants. And I think they hide behind: \"Nationalists are bad, immigrants are kind and good.\" And if we are against the immigration the way it is now, then we are racists.</p><p>But the reality is, if you can keep immigration the way it's going now, the way Joe Biden will push it, the problem is you're actually benefiting the big tech billionaires and universities, and that is not what immigration is about in this country.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Where you come up with the name Slow Biden? You know, so many people want me to use that term, and I say, It's too mean; it's too nasty. (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Oh, no! That means I'm mean.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you just come up with that term. And where did that come from? Is that the</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: My son, actually, who's 11.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your son? He's 11?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: If he's 11, and he said he's slow and that he shouldn't be President</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: They need to pay your son $15 million in consulting. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Actually, during the rallies in 2016, you met my son. He had a Thor, and he dressed him up like President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, that's great.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's very nice. Thank you, Sara. Very great job you're doing.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELLL: Thank you so much. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for all you do.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay, Mike. Go ahead. We'll knock it out, Sara.</p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I'll be I'll just be very brief.</p><p>Four years ago, when you ran for this office, you said the forgotten men and women in America would be forgotten no more. You said that we'd put America first and American workers first, you said that American workers would have a seat at the table in this administration, and we'd deliver real results.</p><p>And today, we see all that happen right in front of us. Because of your leadership indicated during this meeting, that the TVA is going to reverse course on their plan to use H1-B visa workers to replace hardworking Americans. And I can see the gratitude and the emotion on faces around the room, Mr. President, and the gratitude that these people feel and all those that will be reading about this and hearing about this in the days ahead.</p><p>But I also just want to say, finally, to all the all the great Americans who gathered here, who have been willing to speak up: Know that with the executive order the President is signing today, we're not just solving your problem. What the President is committing to today is to end the abuse of our worker visa program once and for all, and pulling together multiple agencies to do that. And I want to promise you that you've not only gone out and been a champion for fellow workers at TVA, but you've been champions for American workers all across this country.</p><p>And I know I speak on behalf of the President and our whole administration when I thank you. Thank you for stepping up for American workers and making it possible for this President to keep one more promise to working Americans. God bless you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. So we're going to sign a little document now. Is that okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: I would love that. Thank you, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it's very important one, aligning federal contractors and contracting and hiring practices with the interests of the American workers, which is very simple which actually just boils down to pretty much what we're talking about today. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much, President Trump.</p><p>(The executive order is signed.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Here, give that to Sara because she was there very early. (Distributes signing pen.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I have to give I have to give one to you. You got us moving here. That's good. Will you pass these around the table, Mike? We'll just pass them on that side. You'll pass them on this side. Everybody that doesn't get it (distributes signing pens.)</p><p>So here we are.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I'll get you one, Tim. Don't worry.</p><p>So, thank you very much everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>We're going to be we're going to be discussing, very shortly, a immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It'll be a very, very comprehensive bill. That's a word that some people love and some people hate, but it'll be very comprehensive only in the sense that it'll cover just about everything.</p><p>It'll be based on merit. It will be it'll cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to. And I think it'll be bipartisan, in the sense that people are going to like a lot of the things that are in there. And probably some people won't; we're going to have that. And we'll probably do it maybe a little bit after our convention. We'll sign it after the convention.</p><p>Likewise, we're going to be doing a healthcare bill act and it'll be extremely comprehensive. It will cover a lot of things that nobody thought you would be able to get, and I mean, in a positive way. And I think it'll be very popular. And it will be a great thing for our country.</p><p>In addition, we have many other things. But immigration and healthcare it doesn't get much bigger than that. Immigration will be very merit-based, but it'll be it'll be great for the worker, and it'll be great for people coming into our country but coming into our country legally and loving our country and wanting to help our country, as opposed to people coming in and they don't like our country.</p><p>You see that, and you see that with certain of our politicians that ran for office. I say, I don't think they like our country too much. All they do is complain. And you would never tell them to go back to their own country because that would be inappropriate, wouldn't it? But all they do is complain about our country, and their country is going to hell. So, you know, it's sort of an interesting phenomenon.</p><p>So the the merit-based immigration is going to be incredible, and the healthcare bill or act is going to be something that I don't think anybody in this country thought they'd ever see. And we've done much of that. If look at some of the legislation that we passed, Ken, I think you can say very strongly we've we've gotten things passed that nobody would be possible.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Whether it's Right to Try that's where you're terminally ill and you don't have a right to use our great medicines because they haven't been approved they're in a line of approval and it takes some time. We've cut the time in half, by the way, for approval by the FDA. But people are sick.</p><p>We have very promising drugs and they're not allowed to use them because I mean, they're terminally ill and they wouldn't let them use them because of liability and other things, but I got that taken care of. So, Right to Try was a very important one.</p><p>Getting Veterans Choice was so important having Veterans Choice. Nobody thought we could get that. Hasn't been done in 50 years. They haven't been able to get it. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Accountability. Because we have so many other things. So many things.</p><p>And on the border, Ken, we've done things that nobody thought would have been possible. Right? Do you want to name a couple of them?</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: We're making enormous progress in the especially in the regulatory arena: reestablishing the 140-year-old American tradition of inviting immigrants here who can stand on their own two feet, as much like Sara had said. And to add to this country and not while not becoming a burden on the country.</p><p>We've also the security that you've advocated for and pushed us to achieve has been unprecedented on a border that we still have more work to do. But we</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great progress.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: the amount of improvement in three years is just extraordinary.</p><p>And one more piece of legislation you know is near and dear to my heart that you led is criminal justice reform, which was you know, lots of people before you talked about it, and this is the first administration to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Nobody else could've gotten that done. Nobody. And we really thank Ken, but we thank a lot of people that came through.</p><p>By the way, some conservative very conservative really wanted it and some liberal wanted it. But we got criminal justice reform done. Nobody thought that was possible. The biggest beneficiary is African Americans and Hispanic Americans, I would say and Asian Americans the three, the groups.</p><p>But tremendous benefits and you know, it's really amazing. When we got that done, we had people supporting that that I would've never thought would've supported it. Not for bad reasons, but they would've never supported it, and they actually led the way. It's pretty incredible. Criminal justice reform was a big deal. You know that, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So and you were helpful actually, and I appreciate it. And thank you very much. Anybody have a question?</p><p>Q Yes, Mr. President</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, on TikTok: You said over the weekend</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q that you're planning to ban it. I know that you spoke with the CEO of Microsoft after that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I did.</p><p>Q So can you give us an update on</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q where you're at?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We had a great conversation. He called me to see whether or not how I felt about it. And I said, \"Look, it can't be controlled, for security reasons, by China. Too big, too invasive, and it can't be.\" And here is the deal: I don't mind if whether it's Microsoft or somebody else a big company, a secure company, very a very American company buy it. It's probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30 percent of it. Because they say, \"How do you do 30 percent? Who's going to get the name?\" The name is hot; the brand is hot. And who's going to get the name? How do you do that if it's owned by two different companies?</p><p>So my personal opinion was: You're probably better off buying the whole thing rather than buying 30 percent of it. I think buying 30 percent is complicated. And I suggested that he can go ahead. He can try. We set a date I set a date at around September 15th, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States. But if somebody and whether it's Microsoft or somebody else buys it, that'll be interesting.</p><p>I did say that if you buy it, whatever the price is, that goes to whoever owns it. Because I guess it's China, essentially, but more than anything else. I said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States because we're making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now, they don't have any rights, unless we give it to them. So if we're going to give them the rights, then it has to come into it has to come into this country.</p><p>It's a little bit like the landlord/tenant: Without a lease, the tenant has nothing. So they pay what's called \"key money,\" or they pay something. But the United States should be reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money, because without the United States, they don't have anything at least having to do with the 30 percent.</p><p>So I told him that. I think we're going to have maybe a deal is going to be made. It's a great asset. It's a great asset. But it's not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States. So it'll close down on September 15th, unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal an appropriate deal. So the Treasury of the really, the Treasury, I guess you would say, of the United States gets a lot of money. A lot of money. Okay?</p><p>Q Mr. President, can you explain why so many of the public health experts on the coronavirus task force are contradicting you on things like why the virus is so widespread in this country, on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine? Why are so many of these people on your task force contradicting you?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we're doing a great job. I think we're doing great on vaccines. We're doing great on therapeutics. You'll be seeing that very soon. I think we're when you look at a map, this is a map of the I've got I sort of shown that around a little bit, but that's the red is the area of most concern. (Displays a U.S. map.) Pretty recent map of the of the country. And there's a lot of a lot of people that in a lot of areas that have gotten very you know, better very fast.</p><p>Hydroxy has tremendous support, but politically, it's toxic because I supported it. If they would have said, \"Do not use hydroxychloroquine under any circumstances,\" they would have come out and they would've said, \"It's a great it's a great thing.\" Many doctors have come out strongly in favor of it. They want it very badly. It's a great malaria drug.</p><p>So, for many years</p><p>Q But Admiral Giroir says it's not effective.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me finish my let me finish my answer.</p><p>So for many years it's, I guess, 60 years it's been a malaria drug; very successful, as you know. And it's been also a drug for lupus. And it caused no trouble virtually nothing, in terms of causing people to get sick or having problems with anything. You add the zinc and you add the azithromycin the Z-Pak, as they call it and it's been very I happened to take it myself, the threesome.</p><p>I took it myself for a period of two weeks. I mean, I I had no problem. I had no problem whatsoever. And, importantly, I, you know, didn't test positive. That's very nice. Okay? I'm very happy about that negative.</p><p>And so so that's the story. It's it's very highly thought of. Interestingly, a great doctor, from what I understand a great doctor from Yale feels very strongly about hydroxychloroquine. The Ford Clinic in Michigan came out with a very, very powerful paper saying it's very good. Many other in France, as you know, they came out with a very positive statement. Many individual doctors have come out with very positive statements.</p><p>I will tell you that if I was surrounded by people, as I was at the time the reason I took it: You know, we had some people that were relatively near me that tested positive. And I took it for that reason, just because I've heard good things.</p><p>Q But Fauci says it doesn't work. Admiral Giroir says it doesn't work.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I don't agree with Fauci on everything.</p><p>Q They're on your task force.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I don't agree with Fauci. Look, Fauci didn't want and I I like him. I get along with him actually great. But he didn't want to ban people from China from coming into the country, and I overrode him and I did the right thing. He was saying face masks are no good a short while ago. So it doesn't mean he's a bad person, because he's not. He's a good person; I like him. But we we disagree on things. We disagree on things.</p><p>Now, I will say this: We've done an amazing job with ventilators. We're supplying the world with ventilators. Ventilators are very hard, very expensive, very hard to make, very complex. Very complicated machines. Very very expensive.</p><p>Q But why does the</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it. Hold it.</p><p>Q But why does the U.S. have so many deaths?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it.</p><p>Q The U.S. has so many deaths compared to</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it.</p><p>Q so many countries around the world. I</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Fake news CNN, hold it. We have done a great job in this country. We haven't been given and not me. I'm not talking about me. The Vice President, the task force have not been given the kind of credit.</p><p>If you look, countries all over the world are exploding right now people that you said were doing a wonderful job, so wonderful. But right now, take a look at the countries that are exploding: You have Italy back. You have Spain back. You have France back. You have Germany back. You have a lot of countries, and that's not to knock them.</p><p>It is a very delicate, very contagious disease. It was released by China. It should never have been allowed to release. There was the source where you could have stopped it. And they did stop it from going into China, although now they say that China is having a lot of problems. Moscow, in Russia, is having tremendous problems.</p><p>What China unleashed was a very, very sad situation. With all of that being understood, the United States has done an amazing job, a great job, and you're going to see that because we have vaccines and we have therapeutics coming very soon.</p><p>Yeah, go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, why are you not involved directly in negotiations with Capitol Hill?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I am. Oh, why? The fact that I'm not over there with Crazy Nancy? No, I'm totally involved.</p><p>Q Have you spoken with her?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'm totally involved. And we're going to be doing some things that are very good, because we don't think that she look, what Chuck Schumer wants more than anybody and I would say Nancy Pelosi would be second they want to bail out cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period of time. Nothing to do with coronavirus or China virus, or whatever you want to call it.</p><p>They want to bail out cities and states. They want bailout money. They want to trillion dollars in bailout money, and a lot of people don't want to do that because we don't think it's right. The Democrats have run some very bad states and some very, very bad cities, and a lot of people don't want to give them a trillion dollars to reward them for doing a bad job.</p><p>If you look at some of the states I won't insult anybody by naming those states, but you know what they are. They want bailout money. They're not interested in the people. They're not interested in unemployment. They're not interested in evictions, which is a big deal the evictions. They want to evict. A lot of people are going to be evicted, but I'm going to stop it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to executive orders, and we're looking at that very seriously right now.</p><p>But what the Democrats want, they want they're slow-rolling it, and all they're really interested in is bailout money to bail out radical-left governors and radical-left mayors, like in Portland and places that are so badly run. Chicago, New York City you see what's going on over there. Bailout cities and states who have been poorly run and spent a fortune doing it, they want a trillion dollars, and we're really not interested in that.</p><p>Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>Q What about the Postal Service, Mr. President? What about the Postal Service? Any message to your postmaster general?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jim, very much. Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>1:10 P.M.

And today I\u2019m signing an executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule: Hire American. We\u2019ve been doing it at a level that hasn\u2019t been done maybe ever.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be taking firm, disciplinary action against the leadership of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has sadly and cruelly betrayed American workers. And we have some of those great American workers with us at the table. This is the Cabinet Room, and it\u2019s an honor to have you in the Cabinet Room and at the Oval Office.</p><p>We\u2019re joined by the Vice President; Congressman Tim Burchett, who\u2019s doing a fantastic job in the state of Tennessee; Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia; Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Secretary, Ken Cuccinelli. Where\u2019s Ken? Hi, Ken. I didn\u2019t see you down there. That\u2019s great. Doing a great job.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Quiet, as usual.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Keep you busy, right? (Laughter.) We\u2019re keeping you busy, Ken.</p><p>Recently, the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeffrey Lyash, made a disastrous and heartless decision. The TVA announced that it would lay off over 200 American workers and replace them with cheaper foreign workers brought in from overseas.</p><p>The Tennessee Valley Authority leadership then ordered the American workers to train their foreign replacements, rubbing salt in their very open wound.</p><p>So we\u2019re going to bring in workers. They\u2019re going to foreign workers. And people from Tennessee, and some others states right around it, are going to train them \u2014 what to do and how to do it. It doesn\u2019t work that way.</p><p>As we speak, we\u2019re finalizing H1-B regulations so that no American worker is replaced ever again. H1-Bs should be used for top, highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labor program to destroy American jobs.</p><p>Sitting at the table are six of the TVA workers who were ordered to train the foreign labor flown in to replace them. I want you and your colleagues to know that my administration will not be putting up with \u2014 I happen to know a young woman who\u2019s been very active over the last couple of years because we were together on Disney and a couple of other things.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it all seems to be working out pretty well.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re doing a great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And thank you for it.</p><p>But that\u2019s why I\u2019m formally removing the chairman of the board, James Thompson, and board member Richard Howorth. If the TVA does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire their workers, then more board members will be removed. We have the absolute right to remove board members. And the board makes the decision; I don\u2019t make the decision. I saw there was an ad on television talking about the amount of money that the chairman makes, and it\u2019s a ridiculous amount of money. But we have the right to replace the board, and the board is the one \u2014 the only ones that get the right to then hire a new person.</p><p>Furthermore, the board must immediately hire that new CEO who puts the interest of American workers first. The current CEO, Jeff Lyash, is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year. Did you know that? Eight million. He\u2019s the highest-paid government official of any country anywhere in the world.</p><p>Now, I don\u2019t know that you call him officially a \u201cgovernment.\u201d It might be a public-private. It may be something \u2014 a lot time ago, it was established, Tennessee Valley Authority. But he gets $8 million a year. So that was just a succession of deep-swamp things happening, and it\u2019s a disgrace. But he gets $8 million a year, and I can think of about almost 100 percent of the people I know would take that job. (Laughter.) It\u2019s not a very hard job. I mean, you have not a lot of debt, not a lot of anything, right?</p><p>Public service is just that: Those who takes these jobs must be focused on the public good, not on personal profit. He would have taken the job for millions and millions of dollars less, but nobody asked him to do that. Okay? He would have gone for less. You could have had him for $4 million, $6 million, $7 million, $2 million, $1 million, probably $500,000 a year.</p><p>But the new CEO must be paid no more than $500,000 a year, which is still a significant amount more than the President of the United States makes. And I donate my salary. I\u2019ve donated it. From what I hear, I\u2019m the only President to do that. You\u2019ll have to check on that, but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. I\u2019m very surprised to hear that. But I donate my full salary; I don\u2019t take it.</p><p>The board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure, too. We don\u2019t want him leaving and then he gets a big check for millions and millions of dollars.</p><p>We want the TVA to take action on this immediately: Lower energy prices in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. I love all those states. Any additional states you can think of there? I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s see. So we\u2019re talking about of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Great states, there \u2014 every one of them.</p><p>So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d It\u2019s ridiculous. The man is getting $8 million. It\u2019d be interesting to see how much money he made before this. And I have no idea. Maybe he made more. I don\u2019t know. But I doubt it. But it\u2019d be interesting to see. He got this position \u2014 must have been politically inspired because I can think of probably, almost, everybody in the nation would have liked this position, including every one of the media folks across the table from me. I would say that everybody would have liked this position.</p><p>So, with that, we\u2019re getting rid of him in one form or another. Either the board is going to do it, we\u2019re going to do it. But he\u2019s gone. And he\u2019s done not a great job. He\u2019s done not even a good job, in certain ways. Plants in Kentucky \u2014 he could\u2019ve kept the plant open in Kentucky, if he wanted to, even if they retrofitted the plant. And he didn\u2019t do that, did he, Congressman?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn\u2019t do that.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We asked him to do it. He didn\u2019t want to do it. We said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d And here we are doing what we\u2019re doing today.</p><p>So we will get somebody for a much lower price. I want the saving \u2014 much lower salary \u2014 I want the saving to go to the people of these great states in the form of energy savings. And that\u2019s a pretty substantial number.</p><p>So, Kevin, could I ask you to start off and say a few words, please?</p><p>MR. LYNN: I certainly appreciate that, Mr. President. My name is Kevin Lynn. I\u2019m the executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform and the founder of U.S Tech Workers. And thank you for paying attention to our ad, Mr. President.</p><p>We were founded \u2014 we founded U.S Tech Workers three years ago to look at the \u2014 and inform the public on the great harm that\u2019s being caused by the outsourcing and offshoring of our skilled labor jobs. And, Mr. President, I want to thank you for inviting us here. On behalf of U.S Tech Workers and the Tennessee Valley Authority, we appreciate your willingness to look at the endangered jobs of the Tennessee Valley Authority workers, especially in a time of pandemic and an election year, when you\u2019ve been so busy signing documents that affect the welfare of millions of Americans.</p><p>Taking time to ensure that these hundreds of workers, under your administration, can continue to provide great services to the American people, as they have since 1933, shows the people of Tennessee and beyond that you stand by your promise to keep American jobs with Americans.</p><p>This is a historic moment that I\u2019m hopeful will reverse the harm outsourcing and offshoring have done to our nation\u2019s productive classes. And it is my hope that Congress will join you, Mr. President, in making sure our workers are more secure in their jobs.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. LYNN: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you\u2019re the one that took the ad about me that \u2014 I didn\u2019t know that. (Laughter.) I was just saying, you know, \u201cI think he\u2019s the one that took this, really, vicious ad.\u201d Like, I hired this guy for $8 million, that I had nothing to do with it. I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d But, actually, you brought something very important up, because when I looked into it, I said, \u201cThis guy is actually making $8 million a year.\u201d And you did the ad. So you really made me aware of what was going on with the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has been a \u2014 a feeding pot for a long time. And a lot of deep state, a lot of swamp creatures, okay?</p><p>So, that\u2019s it. So we\u2019re going to make that \u2014 I see. So I think now you realize that it wasn\u2019t about me. I hope you now realize that.</p><p>MR. LYNN: I do realize that, Mr. President. (Laughter.) But if I could \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I accept \u2014 I accept your apology. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: In full disclosure, Mr. President, when we sat down with the Davis Agency constructing the ad, they said, \u201cWho\u2019s your audience?\u201d And I said, \u201cJust one person. He\u2019s the only one that\u2026\u201d \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s smart. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: \u2014 \u201c\u2026would do this, and he\u2019s the only one that can come to the aid of these workers in the Tennessee Valley.\u201d</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He\u2019s the only one with any guts to do it \u2014 who has guts to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ll tell you, though \u2014 I have to say, Kevin, the end was very appropriate. And while it has nothing to do with me, I can do things with respect to the board, and ultimately, the board controls that decision. This is a very, very old authority done in the \u2014</p><p>MR. LYNN: 1933, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So it was done during the FDR days. And it\u2019s been \u2014 you know, it\u2019s been getting crazier and crazier just over the years. And they have, basically, nobody watching over them. And the board isn\u2019t watching. You see this happening in public companies also. You see it happening a lot.</p><p>But for a essentially \u2014 I would say, for a federal employee to be paid $8 million \u2014 now what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re looking at the board members, how much are they paid. Because usually what happens is they pay, and then he says, \u201cYou know, I think you ought to get more money.\u201d And everybody is making a lot of money, and your pricing for electric and utilities starts going up, and people say, \u201cI wonder why.\u201d</p><p>I also see that they\u2019re doing a lot of things in terms of electric, which is very expensive electric. They\u2019re building facilities that are very, very expensive to build and don\u2019t work well. But we\u2019ll discuss that separately.</p><p>But I appreciate it because you did make me aware of what\u2019s going on, and it\u2019s a terrific thing we\u2019re doing today. Thank you very much, Kevin.</p><p>Please, Stacy. How are you?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: I\u2019m doing fine. Mr. President, my name is Stacy Whetzell. I\u2019m the son of a sharecropper.</p><p>First, I want to thank you for being the great American President you are and for caring about and looking out for the great American citizens and workers. We thank you for that.</p><p>I picked cotton from the time I was big enough to carry my own pick sack until I married. My wife and I have been married 47 years and have 7 children and 14 grandchildren. I began working for TVA in 1975 as a carpenter\u2019s apprentice. Currently, I\u2019m the system administrator on TVA\u2019s core team that\u2019s responsible for installing a $20 million computer system. Our team and the entire IT department have been praised and thanked multiple times this summer for the outstanding performance we\u2019ve done.</p><p>So it was shocking and devastating to be notified on July the 23rd that IT leadership had decided our team and a total of 40 workers would be terminated and our work done to others. This brings the total planned outsourced jobs to over 200 in TVA information technology alone. We believe there are more planned to come.</p><p>The three companies chosen to do the IT work are all three foreign companies that depend heavily on H1-B workers. We\u2019re required to train these \u2014 our replacements, as President Trump said. Apparently, we\u2019re good enough to train but not retain.</p><p>Using H1-B workers to replace capable and willing American citizens is turning entire American communities upside down. Left unchecked, it will turn our nation upside down and negatively impact our national security as certainly as our 50-year build-up of dependence on China for manufacturing has. Thank you, President Trump, for beginning to reverse that hive-centric mistake.</p><p>American patriots will forever be grateful that you\u2019re also acting and fought the misguided and out-of-control H1-B worker program. I thank you for Americans first and acting to stop this travesty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you\u2019re a very powerful speaker. And so powerful that we just got a call \u2014 Mark just brought this in from \u2014 the TVA CEO, and he\u2019s indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course. (Laughter and applause.)</p><p>So it must have been Stacy. I think Stacy did a much better job than me. I mean, you\u2019re talking and all of the sudden, I get the note.</p><p>So he\u2019s looking to change course and reverse it, and that\u2019s good. Now, maybe he\u2019ll take a major cut in salary, too. That\u2019ll be phase two, right? So we\u2019ll take a look at that. And maybe you\u2019ll start looking at that on behalf of everybody, gratis. Right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your group. That\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I mean, TVA told me while we were in this process of working on behalf of the workers \u2014 I\u2019m the union president, IFPTE-Engineering Association. They told me it\u2019s going to take a message \u2014 a stop order from the President in order to keep us from moving forward. And I said, \u201cI\u2019m working on that.\u201d (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Everybody in this room did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: I appreciate you, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, Congressman, you have my endorsement.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? You had it anyway, but you have it now. It\u2019s a great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Well, I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: The only congressman in the room. I tell you, Tim, great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, brother.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s only phase one. Phase two is \u2014 imagine being paid the $8 million a year to run a thing that\u2019s pretty easy to run, in all fairness. It\u2019s not like he built it; he didn\u2019t build it. He went there and he\u2019s been there, and he gets a lot of money, and it shouldn\u2019t be. Five hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, right?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir. In Tennessee, it is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And I\u2019m willing to say he gets paid more money than I do. I don\u2019t care.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But, you know, it shouldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>So that\u2019s a start. That\u2019s a start. And I think we should find out what board members make, okay? Because \u2014</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I\u2019ll look into that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 I can almost guarantee you they\u2019re paid heavily.</p><p>Congratulations, Stacy. Really good.</p><p>Please, go ahead.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir. Mr. President, thank you. My name is David Littlejohn. I am a soon-to-be father. This November, my wife will be giving birth to my first child. I am a long line \u2014 I\u2019m the son in a long line of military men and women, so I was born with a heart of service. And with that, I love to serve the people of the Valley.</p><p>I was told July 23rd that I would be sent home and to be trained \u2014 training a contractor from a H1-B-dependent contract company. Now, I\u2019m shaking right now because \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re doing great.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You had a big victory already. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>I\u2019m shaking right now because this really impacts me and my wife and my unborn child, and I greatly appreciate everyone here to support us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate it, and thank you very much.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you\u2019ll see what happens. It\u2019s going to be very quick, too. Thank you.</p><p>Wendy, please.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah. I\u2019m Wendy Turner, and thank you for having us here. I\u2019ve been a software engineer at TVA for 19 years. I\u2019m going to change my comments a little. I was (inaudible) saying, you know, for the first time in 19 years, I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to me and my kids, and I also take care of my mom. But what we\u2019re going to do going forward \u2014 so, thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And this was \u2014 everybody felt this way in Tennessee Valley Authority then, I guess\u2013 right? \u2014 if you do. You\u2019ve been there for 19 years. So everyone had to feel this way, like there\u2019s been a big feeling of doubt, right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Right. Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s a terrible thing.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re waiting for it to happen to them.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, and I\u2019ve been training since June. I\u2019ve been training our replacements from a company that relied on \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019ve been training people?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yes. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And so, did they let you off yet? Or are you not sure?</p><p>MS. TURNER: I got my notice in June that we would be laid off September 1st.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you\u2019re training people to take your job at a \u2014 whatever. Right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They told us it would be \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And where are the people from that you\u2019re training?</p><p>MS. TURNER: All over the place. We \u2014 everything is done remotely or \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are they from other countries?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They\u2019re here on soil now. I don\u2019t know their status as far as \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Because with Disney, they were from other countries, right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, so I don\u2019t know. I know the com- \u2014 Accenture is replacing our group, and I know they rely heavily on H1-B workers, but I don\u2019t know for sure where everyone is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, we\u2019ll make sure that things work out for the three of them because they\u2019re brave to be here, actually, Sara. So you\u2019ll check that out, right?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let\u2019s see that they get their jobs back \u2014</p><p>MS. TURNER: Thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 because I hear you\u2019re great workers. I mean, I said I want people, but I also people that are really good workers \u2014 that did a great job. Because, you know, people can be let go; should be able to \u2014 if they\u2019re not doing a good job. I\u2019m all for that. I think \u2014 I\u2019ll bet you are.</p><p>But I said, \u201cI want people that really do a great job and were unfairly let go.\u201d Right, Tim?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s, to me, very important.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Wendy. We\u2019ll see what happens. Okay? We\u2019re going to push it hard.</p><p>Chuck, please.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I recognize how busy your schedule is, and I sincerely appreciate your time today. Okay?</p><p>I\u2019m Chuck Charnawskas. Basically, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with the really technically competent people of the Tennessee Valley for seven years, okay? It\u2019s been a great experience. I have a degree in electrical engineering, 45 years of valuable industrial experience, and I\u2019m a certified security professional here, okay?</p><p>Working with the people in Tennessee Valley was how I learned just how important the Tennessee Valley is to 11 million people in seven different states, okay, and how it basically impacts their lives. It\u2019s absolutely significant. And that is the reason that I\u2019m really here today.</p><p>The TVA basically has the capability to produce 35 billion watts of powers, okay? They have 17,000 lines of high-voltage transmission.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How does that compare to other big utilities, would you say?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: It definitely ranks right in the top of them. There\u2019s no question about it. And very significant: Tennessee Valley is part of the Southeastern Reliability Corporation, and it\u2019s obviously one of the biggest players in that area.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yea, it\u2019s very big. That\u2019s a lot.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Very significant in that respect, okay? And in essence here, as a consequence of that, they also basically support 35 dams \u2014 that produce power from 29 \u2014 to do flood control.</p><p>Just a couple years ago, they were able to reduce billions of dollars of potential damage by managing the rivers correctly, in that case.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: They have three major power plants \u2014 nuclear power plants.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What\u2019s your biggest dam? What\u2019s the big dam?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Probably it would be Chickamauga or \u2014</p><p>MR. HICKS: Wilson. Wilson Dam, in Alabama.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Wilson in Alabama.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: There\u2019s the expert, right down there. (Laughter.) So I defer to the expert about that.</p><p>But the bottom line of it: As a consequence of this, it\u2019s a very \u2014 a very important player not only in the Southeast region, but for (inaudible) internationally, okay? And today, the TVA receives hundreds if not thousands of potential attacks \u2014 cyberattacks \u2014 testing its network here, right?</p><p>It\u2019s imperative to have experienced, knowledgeable employees to handle that situation, yeah. Okay?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And a fine example of this \u2014 and I just kind of \u2014 you know, it\u2019s a little bit humorous, but the great power outage in 2003 was affected by a software glitch \u2014 okay? \u2014 that impacted and it shut down Manhattan for 24 hours.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I remember that very well. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: I thought you might be related \u2014 or familiar with that. So, as a \u2014 it just really points to the significance of having qualified, vetted people with proper clearances.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: \u2014 dedicated to that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree. That wouldn\u2019t happen with you, would it? Huh? It wouldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>MS. TURNER: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And then just a \u2014 quickly, two other quick points. Basically, this outsourcing agreement could impact \u2014 the Tennessee Valley has always \u2014 our goals are to provide energy, economic development, and protect the environment. This particular outsourcing agreement could impact the Valley by $88 million to these local economies here. And for the individuals that are in there, not only may they lose their primary income, but they may consequently have insurance costs that basically reflect a 3- to 400 percent increase for these families on how they manage it.</p><p>And I\u2019d like \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And you\u2019re going to lose \u2014 you\u2019re going to lose people when you\u2019re firing people that are \u2014 they live in Tennessee and they live in Georgia and they live in the other states that I mentioned, and it\u2019s not a fair situation.</p><p>Go ahead. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Final point: The effort here to make America great again \u2014 okay \u2014 reflects the fact that we need to take into repatriate manufacturing companies and companies to take and spend our money domestically and support the domestic product. How can we justify spending these millions of dollars \u2014 for one particular consulting firm, $15 million to \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Who is the consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, that would be Capgemini (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You spent $15 million a year on a consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, this was a \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We just found another nugget of gold. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Sara doesn\u2019t care about that one, but that\u2019s a \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I care about. You spent $15 million to one consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not a consulting \u2014 that\u2019s one of the companies that are picking up. And it\u2019s Capgemini, and that\u2019s $15 million that \u2014 just for that one company.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How many are there \u2014 how many are there like that?</p><p>MS. HENSON: There\u2019s Capgemini, CGI, Accenture, and Tech Systems at TVA \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And they\u2019re paying tremendous amount of money?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir. And our workers are more than capable.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very \u2014 they\u2019re very political people. You know this is a very political group of people you just named?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Really? I just know that \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Not to me. Not to me, I don\u2019t care. (Laughter.) I don\u2019t care who they are, but they \u2014 they are very political.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, I mean, and these people are more than capable of doing the job and have done it with excellence. And TVA says your matrix for your performance is above; it doesn\u2019t make sense. And what you\u2019re doing \u2014 I cannot tell you how much it means to me. And for these workers it \u2014 and I\u2019m very emotional because TVA is a large racket. They do their thing, and nobody can touch them. And I believe today they\u2019ve been touched.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s a racket.</p><p>MS. HENSON: They\u2019ve been touched. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, it\u2019s a racket. Well, we just found that out. (Laughter.) No, it\u2019s a racket.</p><p>I mean \u2014 I mean, I understand it. The four firms that you just mentioned that are paid tens of millions of dollars, they\u2019re very political firms. You know, they may be good, but they\u2019re very political firms. And they do it for much less much \u2014 much, much, much less. You could give them half. You could give them 10 percent, they\u2019d probably do it for. Those are big numbers for a consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re not the consulting firm; they\u2019re the ones actually going to take these people\u2019s jobs. That \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s worse.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, it is worse. So I mean \u2014</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim, go ahead, please.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Mr. President, thank you \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: \u2014 and Vice President so much for this. My mama worked at TVA after the Second \u2014 during the \u2014 at the end of the Second World War, when dad came home from the Pacific and married her, and then she went into education. But, you know, working people are the backbone of this country. That\u2019s not clich\u00e9 and you\u2019ve \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: \u2014 you\u2019ve highlighted that so much with the trades and other things, and I\u2019m very appreciative of the fact.</p><p>But I\u2019ll you what: Dadgummit, if TVA wants be Duke Electric, let them because Duke Electric, but they\u2019re not. And they \u2014 they hide behind the government\u2019s skirt and they \u2014 they use eminent domain, and their arrogance is beyond belief. You know, when they had the ash spill, people died, and then \u2014 you know, and then they are just these poor country folks that are just pushing them off until they all die off, until those lawsuits go away. It\u2019s ridiculous.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, that\u2019s right. And, by the way, in Kentucky, when we wanted to have a plant open with a lot of jobs, they didn\u2019t even want to consider it.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No. No, they didn\u2019t. It\u2019s their arrogance. You\u2019re questioning them, and finally we have a President with the guts that understands business and government. And if TVA wants to be a government entity, they need to \u2014 they need to declare it, and quit using \u2014 they hide behind \u2014 you know, they have their \u2014 their \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think Joe Biden would do this?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Heck no.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn\u2019t know you\u2019re alive.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He\u2019d be \u2014 no, he\u2019d \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s alive either. (Laughter.)</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He needs to get out of the bunker.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, can you imagine him sitting at this table right now? Wouldn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. So go ahead, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, I think you pretty much covered it, Mr. President. I\u2019m just honored to be here. And I \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m honored that you\u2019re here. And you\u2019ve done a fantastic job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: And I thank you for standing up for working Americans.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, well we\u2019re going to \u2014 and we\u2019re going to get this finished too. So we\u2019ll get it finished, Sara.</p><p>Thank you very much, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Gene, please.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Mr. President, thank you for bringing this group together. And this this meeting has, I think, shown a very human impact on individual working \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Incredible.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: \u2014 men and women of a practice that\u2019s actually pretty widespread.</p><p>And the way it\u2019s worked under our immigration laws for a while now is that a company that wants to bring in workers from overseas \u2014 wants to use the H1-B program for high-skilled workers \u2014 has to file an attestation with us at the Labor Department, saying American workers aren\u2019t going to lose their jobs when I bring in these H1-B workers. And they have to say it\u2019s not going to hurt their wages.</p><p>But what companies do is they bring workers in, and then they lease them out to another company. And so you\u2019ve got one company bringing them in and then leasing them to TVA. And it\u2019s true, the company bringing them in \u2014 their workers aren\u2019t being affected, but the TVA workers are.</p><p>And so I took a look at this, as your Labor Secretary, recently, and I said to my staff \u2014 I said, \u201cWell, if the workers are going to the other company, why doesn\u2019t the other company, where they\u2019re actually going to be working and supervised, also file an application?\u201d</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. Right.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: \u201cAnd say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to affect U.S workers either.\u2019\u201d And I said to staff, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we do that?\u201d They looked into it. And, Mr. President, today, you\u2019re going be signing an order \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: \u2014 that requires that change.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: So, going forward, when those workers are going to another company, both companies are going to (inaudible) \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and that\u2019s a change we\u2019ll make. We\u2019ll do it together with the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>I just want to mention one other thing we\u2019re doing together. For more than 15 years, the Secretary of Labor has had the authority to initiate an investigation of abuse of H1-B program when he or she finds reasonable cause. That has never been done. That authority has never been used.</p><p>But again, we saw \u2014 signed a memo of understanding on Friday with the Department of Homeland Security that\u2019ll change that too. They\u2019re going to now share information they have, which I can then use to bring cases when we\u2019re finding the program (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. You\u2019re going to find a lot. And thank you very much, Gene.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Thank you. And thank you for this order today.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Good work, Stacy. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right, Stacy? Right? I like that. You like that?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: We\u2019ll take it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Linda, please.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being with us today. The concern you show for American workers is greatly appreciated. And my mother made me promise to tell you that Alabama loves and appreciates your leadership. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I love Alabama.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, a promise that my mother made.</p><p>My name is Linda McDonald. I\u2019ve lived in northeast Alabama my entire life. My goal was to work at TVA; that was my American Dream. After years of sacrifice and hard work, I achieved that goal. I\u2019ve been working for TVA for seven years now. But \u2014 so, and in that role, I got to see every day \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So that was like an ambition of yours to work someday for TVA?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Correct.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you finally got there?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I did.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, what\u2019s happening?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, June 30th, we were told that we would be outsourced to another company with \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: All right. Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, so, here I am, faced with \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you had to have these consulting firms making 10, 15 million dollars a year?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, I feel like my \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And the man that heads it making $8 million a year, right? (Laughter.)</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I feel like my American Dream was being stolen from me \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: \u2014 and given to someone else. So I just think \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Is that the way you view it: \u201cgiven to somebody else\u201d?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: It is. It was taken from me, and \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s a very interesting way \u2014</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: \u2014 it was then given to someone else.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 of viewing it, right?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, I thank you for listening to us, because it felt, for so long, like no one was even listening to us. So thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019ve been hearing about it for a long time. When I was running, I met Sara, and we worked on the Disney situation \u2014</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 but that was a long time ago. But \u2014 and, you know, this has been happening for a while. So we\u2019re taking care of it.</p><p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Linda. We\u2019ll see what happens. You may be very pleasantly surprised. Okay?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I hope so.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>Jonathan, please.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, thank you for your time.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MR. HICKS: My name is Jonathan Hicks. I\u2019m a \u2014 I\u2019m from a large family, and we\u2019ve had three \u2014 three members of our family who have served in the U.S military. I grew up in Tennessee, around the Knoxville area, and started my career with TVA in 2001 as an IT intern. During \u2014 as soon as I graduated, I got a fulltime job there, and I\u2019ve been there for \u2014 for 19 years. I\u2019ve been \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And that was a big deal, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Working \u2014 because there\u2019s a great prestige to that.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s true.</p><p>MR. HICKS: I\u2019ve spent my time there working for river operations for the \u2014 for their group, and helping them, you know, have programs \u2014 mostly in-house solutions to be able to manage the river and the river systems.</p><p>I was told in June \u2014 early June \u2014 that I would be training replacements, that I would be receiving my work notice in September, and that the workers that I\u2019d be training, there\u2019s been five or plus that I\u2019ve been training for my one position, and at least four of those seem to be H1-B type workers.</p><p>I guess there\u2019s a concern with the kind of stuff that we do, at least for the river operations, and that they\u2019re generating a significant amount of power out of all the \u2014 out of all the \u2014 all of these dams. And, you know, is this something that \u2014 that we want to turn over this knowledge, this ability to control these dams and \u2014 you know, whether it be generation, whether it be floodgates \u2014 and hand it over to corporations that aren\u2019t in the U.S , to workers that aren\u2019t necessarily in the U.S doing this work?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are you there now? Are you \u2014</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I \u2014 I\u2019ve been put on non-work status. I\u2019m still employed and still getting a paycheck until September 1st, but I\u2019ve been \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What happens on September 1st?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I\u2019ve been relieved of my job duties, but September 1st is when I would lose \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you train people to take your job?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you\u2019ve worked with people to take your job.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019ve taught them, like, almost everything you know, but plenty, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I \u2014 I think there\u2019s a big \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Maybe not. Maybe you held back a couple of secrets. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I think there\u2019s a \u2014 I think there\u2019s a big learning curve and there\u2019s \u2014 for the knowledge that they do there for river operations, I think it takes several years of understanding the job in order to be able to do this.</p><p>The people that are taking over the job have never dealt with utilities, they\u2019ve never dealt with power generation, they\u2019ve never dealt with any kind of water management or hydrogenation. And so the \u2014 to say that they\u2019re ready to go is a misstatement. So \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, let\u2019s see how out it works out, Jonathan. I think you\u2019re going to be in very good shape. Okay? I have a prediction.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p>Please.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: It\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m so honored to be here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Honored to have you.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: My name is Renae McKenzie, and I actually work for the Engineering Association as an advocate for these IT employees and for other white-collar workers. But I\u2019ve worked really closely with the IT professionals at TVA, with all of this that has been going on.</p><p>I\u2019ve had to witness the anguish of the different employees that are performing these knowledge transfers on the software and the applications that they actually custom built themselves.</p><p>But so many TVA employees have been there from the beginning of their careers. So to actually witness what\u2019s happening to them, being replaced by these non-Americans, is very difficult.</p><p>But I think one of the hardest things to witness is what TVA is actually doing to themselves. I mean, their mission is about bringing economic development to the Tennessee Valley. And to be taking that \u2014 taking our economy and just giving it outside of the United States is just almost \u2014 it\u2019s unbelievable because of what they stand for and what they were built for. To come out of economic \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you see them going outside of the United States, not just here. You see them go \u2014</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Well, if you look at these companies, these companies are based outside of the United States. So \u2014 so when they\u2019re getting their millions of dollars, I mean, it\u2019s going to France, it\u2019s really going to \u2014 I think one of them is \u2014</p><p>MS. HENSON: India.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: India, Canada.</p><p>PARTICIPANT: Ireland</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: And Ireland. So, yes, our dollars are going to them.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Unbelievable. And they get us in many other ways too, but we\u2019re stopping it, as you noticed. That\u2019s very interesting.</p><p>So you would say France, India, Ireland, Canada. Who else?</p><p>MS. HENSON: That\u2019s the main groups right there. Those (inaudible) countries.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Those are the main ones.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: A lot of them \u2014 are a lot of the workers being outsourced \u2014</p><p>MR. LYNN: All these firms: H1-B visa dependent. And 70 percent of H1-B visa workers in the United States come from one country: mainly, India.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: You know, Mr. President, I worry too about the national security. You know, we\u2019re during a pandemic, people are out of work, and our electric grid could be put in the hands of folks that, maybe, their loyalty isn\u2019t to this great country, and that bothers me.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You know, with TVA, more so than most companies. You\u2019re right \u2014 you\u2019re talking about controlling all of that energy and power. It\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right about that, Tim. That\u2019s a very good statement. Anything else?</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Just, it \u2014 again, it\u2019s such an honor to be in your presence. (Laughs.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s my honor. It\u2019s my great honor. Do you know the man next to you is Ken Cuccinelli, a legend? (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Look, and I tend to be very quiet like him. Just saying.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He\u2019s a legend in his own mind. (Laughter.)</p><p>Ken \u2014 Ken has done a fantastic job on the border. Unbelievable job on the border. And you might just tell us for a couple of seconds while we have the \u2014 the media here \u2014 I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll report it very accurately \u2014 how well we\u2019re doing on the border and then maybe get on to make a statement, because I know you\u2019ve been working with Gene and everybody very hard.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Yes. And Secretary Scalia really covered the partnership with \u2014 between DHS and Department of Labor to solve this problem. You\u2019re solving it forcefully today for these folks. You\u2019re certainly putting the ball in motion to do that. And what we\u2019re \u2014 our two agencies, at your direction from June, are going to do is solve this permanently so that we never have to see this happen again.</p><p>But, on the border, we\u2019re seeing success with your leadership with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. The relationships you helped us forge last year, in 2019, are bearing fruit at the border during a very difficult time with the coronavirus and that taskforce, of course, led by the Vice President. And the ability since March to enforce the public health order there has changed the nature of our ability to protect the border.</p><p>There are still people getting away, more than we would like. But last year, they were running to us; this year, they\u2019re running from us, at the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s right.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It\u2019s a bit different. And over 80 percent of the folks that we\u2019re apprehending are being returned to Mexico in under two hours, which is astonishing. It\u2019s just an astonishing turn.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It used to take, in some cases, years. Years.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Right. Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s been incredible what\u2019s happened at the border. And I think the wall is helping you quite a bit, right? We have now about almost 271 miles of wall.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Everywhere that that new system is put in place, the Border Patrol agents are just universal in their praise for both their safety and the way it impedes illegal traffic \u2014 not just people, but drugs, as well, and so forth. So it\u2019s extremely effective, and it\u2019s going up faster and faster and faster.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They had a human trafficker the other day saying that they used to go out and they\u2019re trafficking \u2014 human traffic \u2014 mostly women and children, but mostly women, and they\u2019d bring them across the border, taped up and \u2014 horrible.</p><p>And this guy was saying how they used to go up and they\u2019d make a left turn. They\u2019d make a right and then a left into the United States. He says, and now we just keep driving into this massive wall that nobody gets through. Nobody is getting through that wall. That wall is the real deal. And it\u2019s steel, concrete, and everything else. And lots of cameras all over it.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That\u2019s right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And drones on top of it. And people aren\u2019t getting through. But it\u2019s been an incredible, incredible success.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It\u2019s a real force multiplier for the Border Patrol and OFO.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And Mexico is helping us a lot. They have \u2014</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: A lot better partnership.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \u2014 27,000 soldiers.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: I remember how people complained about how you were pushing them so hard last year. But the partnership that\u2019s grown up with Mexico has been the best. We have really had, in decades, if not forever \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s what they say.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: \u2014 in cooperating and securing the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They have a very good President who was just here two weeks ago.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: He was. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He\u2019s really doing a good job. And we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding the border. And they don\u2019t play games. They don\u2019t play games. It\u2019s been pretty amazing. The numbers are way, way down. And we want people to come in, but they have to come in legally, and that\u2019s \u2014</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: You got to come in legally. That\u2019s right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it.</p><p>Okay, please. Go ahead. You can finish up.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I appreciate you so much. I really do. As I said earlier, I\u2019m the union president for the workers that are represented by this move that TVA has taken. I met earlier with Tim Burchett and he told me how disgusted he was with it. But that was earlier.</p><p>We\u2019ve really tried to get our voice heard. We\u2019ve been screaming, \u201cHey! Hey! Help us out.\u201d</p><p>Finally, U.S Tech Workers came out, kind of put a commercial together, and we\u2019re \u2014 you know, that got your attention, and we appreciate it so much.</p><p>I\u2019ve lived my whole life in the Tennessee Valley region, and my uncle was a \u2014 worked at TVA during World War Two. He laid his job aside, and went and served and perished in that war. My mother told me TVA was a great place to work, and I \u2014 I\u2019ve worked there now 35 years.</p><p>This means a lot to the people of the Tennessee Valley region, more than you will ever know. I know that consulting companies looked at what to do with this IT work. They\u2019re now looking at what to do \u2014 the same consulting companies are looking at what do with the transmission work. That transmission \u2014 that grid has got to be protected at all cost. And we\u2019ve got to. We cannot afford to let someone else, who may not have the loyalty to our nation, have the grid.</p><p>And I think that some of these workers here at this table, IT workers, that\u2019s one of the biggest they\u2019ve said to me: There\u2019s a large chance that we would be breached. And we can\u2019t do that. And we tried to say all those things \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, with our people running it, a very small chance, from what I understand.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes. With the right people running it. right. But you can\u2019t give it to just anybody. And that\u2019s why these workers at TVA are so important. And I appreciate you and all that you are doing for us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are the people that you\u2019re representing, are they \u2014 because you represent a big group of people \u2014 are they all nervous, like the folks at the table?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Like Wendy?</p><p>MS. HENSON: They\u2019re going, \u201cAre we next, Gay? Is this what\u2019s coming next?\u201d And my answer is, \u201cNot on my watch, if we can help it.\u201d</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tell them no. Tell them no, they\u2019re not next.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? You can tell them. I think we can say that. So thank you very much.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Thank you. I just think you bringing TVA back to their mission of service to the people of the Valley, service to people of the Valley and to this nation is \u2014 is a pivotal moment for the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, right now, their mission is taking care of a lot of consultants and a lot of people and paying \u2014 paying heads of this whole thing $8 million a year. And you\u2019ll find a lot of other things in there that are crazy.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, people over profit. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What do the people of Tennessee think when they hear that the head of TVA \u2014 which has been running for a long time \u2014 and, in all fairness, not a very difficult thing; there are many people who can do it. What do they hear when they hear \u2014 and they think of government, you know? It\u2019s sort of semi- \u2014 I guess, you call it \u2014 public-private. But there\u2019s not private, really, when you think of it. So, it\u2019s a board member.</p><p>What do they think when they hear that the head person is making $8 million a year? Which is, by the way, I said it before, the most highly paid person anywhere in any country if you call this government, which it sort of is. What do they think when they hear? Do they know he makes $8 million a year?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they do now after Kevin\u2019s commercial. (Laughter.) But they\u2019re pretty shocked. I mean \u2014 in fact, they \u2014 I think the workers even \u2014 I think some of the workers at TVA have been shocked about that. It is a lot of money.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But people have known. I\u2019ve known, actually, before the commercial because we were looking at it. We sent them notices a year ago and two years ago saying, \u201cWe want some information.\u201d And, you know, people have known this. I just can\u2019t even imagine that somebody gets paid $8 million a year.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, the difference \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s the most sought-after job. It has to be the most sought-after job in any country in any government. Right, Tim? You\u2019d take the job. Would you resign from Congress immediately?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Take it for one year. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You only need it for one year. You \u2014</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t know my wife and daughter, Mr. President. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim would take it. That\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019ll take it only \u2014</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, they\u2019re actually pretty thrifty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Only for a year. You just need it for one year. That\u2019s right. Anyway.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So the workers \u2014 they are surprised at that. But, you know, back to the days of Kilgore and having worked there so long \u2014 I tell people I started when I was eight, because I can\u2019t believe how long I\u2019ve worked there now \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MS. HENSON: But the truth is, there are very capable people at TVA that love \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ll bet.</p><p>MS. HENSON: \u2014 the TVA and the mission that they\u2019re really \u2014 were put together for and would love to take that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I even think they like your President \u2014 your current President, anyway. I\u2019m not sure about the past President.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Tennessee Valley is \u2014 that\u2019s right. The boats on the lake all say, you know \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: \u201cTrump.\u201d Yeah. No, they\u2019re great people. Say hello to them. Just say hello. They\u2019re great people.</p><p>Sara, why don\u2019t you just discuss it real quick, and you can maybe work with us in getting it all done very quickly. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Of course, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for having us and having everyone here and for all you\u2019re doing with regard to immigration. Immigration should be about America, Americans, and the immigrants. Right now \u2014 the way it was, before you started working on it, it\u2019s always been the big business, big tech, and universities. And with you, we are working to make immigration in America for the right reasons.</p><p>And Protect U.S Workers \u2014 I endorsed you in 2016, we endorse you in 2020, and we know for a fact that \u201cSlow Biden\u201d and the Democrats will never push towards immigration that benefits Americans, America, and the immigrants. And I think they hide behind: \u201cNationalists are bad, immigrants are kind and good.\u201d And if we are against the immigration the way it is now, then we are \u201cracists.\u201d</p><p>But the reality is, if you can keep immigration the way it\u2019s going now, the way Joe Biden will push it, the problem is you\u2019re actually benefiting the big tech billionaires and universities, and that is not what immigration is about in this country.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Where you come up with the name \u201cSlow Biden\u201d? You know, so many people want me to use that term, and I say, \u201cIt\u2019s too mean; it\u2019s too nasty.\u201d (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Oh, no! That means I\u2019m mean.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you just come up with that term. And where did that come from? Is that the \u2014</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: My son, actually, who\u2019s 11.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your son? He\u2019s 11?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: If he\u2019s 11, and he said he\u2019s slow and that he shouldn\u2019t be President \u2014</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: They need to pay your son $15 million in consulting. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Actually, during the rallies in 2016, you met my son. He had a Thor, and he dressed him up like President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, that\u2019s great.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s very nice. Thank you, Sara. Very \u2014 great job you\u2019re doing.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELLL: Thank you so much. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for all you do.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay, Mike. Go ahead. We\u2019ll knock it out, Sara.</p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I\u2019ll be \u2014 I\u2019ll just be very brief.</p><p>Four years ago, when you ran for this office, you said the forgotten men and women in America would be forgotten no more. You said that we\u2019d put America first and American workers first, you said that American workers would have a seat at the table in this administration, and we\u2019d deliver real results.</p><p>And today, we see all that happen right in front of us. Because of your leadership indicated during this meeting, that the TVA is going to reverse course on their plan to use H1-B visa workers to replace hardworking Americans. And I can see the gratitude and the emotion on faces around the room, Mr. President, and the gratitude that these people feel and all those that will be reading about this and hearing about this in the days ahead.</p><p>But I also just want to say, finally, to all the \u2014 all the great Americans who gathered here, who have been willing to speak up: Know that with the executive order the President is signing today, we\u2019re not just solving your problem. What the President is committing to today is to end the abuse of our worker visa program once and for all, and pulling together multiple agencies to do that. And I want to promise you that you\u2019ve not only gone out and been a champion for fellow workers at TVA, but you\u2019ve been champions for American workers all across this country.</p><p>And I know I speak on behalf of the President and our whole administration when I thank you. Thank you for stepping up for American workers and making it possible for this President to keep one more promise to working Americans. God bless you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. So we\u2019re going to sign a little document now. Is that okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: I would love that. Thank you, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it\u2019s very important one, aligning federal contractors and contracting and hiring practices with the interests of the American workers, which is very simple \u2014 which actually just boils down to pretty much what we\u2019re talking about today. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much, President Trump.</p><p>(The executive order is signed.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Here, give that to Sara because she was there very early. (Distributes signing pen.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I have to give \u2014 I have to give one to you. You got us moving here. That\u2019s good. Will you pass these around the table, Mike? We\u2019ll just pass them on that side. You\u2019ll pass them on this side. Everybody that doesn\u2019t get it \u2014 (distributes signing pens.)</p><p>So here we are.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I\u2019ll get you one, Tim. Don\u2019t worry.</p><p>So, thank you very much everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>We\u2019re going to be \u2014 we\u2019re going to be discussing, very shortly, a immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It\u2019ll be a very, very comprehensive bill. That\u2019s a word that some people love and some people hate, but it\u2019ll be very comprehensive only in the sense that it\u2019ll cover just about everything.</p><p>It\u2019ll be based on merit. It will be \u2014 it\u2019ll cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to. And I think it\u2019ll be bipartisan, in the sense that people are going to like a lot of the things that are in there. And probably some people won\u2019t; we\u2019re going to have that. And we\u2019ll probably do it maybe a little bit after our convention. We\u2019ll sign it after the convention.</p><p>Likewise, we\u2019re going to be doing a healthcare bill \u2014 act \u2014 and it\u2019ll be extremely comprehensive. It will cover a lot of things that nobody thought you would be able to get, and \u2014 I mean, in a positive way. And I think it\u2019ll be very popular. And it will be a great thing for our country.</p><p>In addition, we have many other things. But immigration and healthcare \u2014 it doesn\u2019t get much bigger than that. Immigration will be very merit-based, but it\u2019ll be \u2014 it\u2019ll be great for the worker, and it\u2019ll be great for people coming into our country \u2014 but coming into our country legally and loving our country and wanting to help our country, as opposed to people coming in and they don\u2019t like our country.</p><p>You see that, and you see that with certain of our politicians that ran for office. I say, \u201cI don\u2019t think they like our country too much. All they do is complain.\u201d And you would never tell them to go back to their own country because that would be inappropriate, wouldn\u2019t it? But all they do is complain about our country, and their country is going to hell. So, you know, it\u2019s sort of an interesting phenomenon.</p><p>So the \u2014 the merit-based immigration is going to be incredible, and the healthcare bill or act is going to be something that I don\u2019t think anybody in this country thought they\u2019d ever see. And we\u2019ve done much of that. If look at some of the legislation that we passed, Ken, I think you can say very strongly we\u2019ve \u2014 we\u2019ve gotten things passed that nobody would be possible.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That\u2019s right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Whether it\u2019s Right to Try \u2014 that\u2019s where you\u2019re terminally ill and you don\u2019t have a right to use our great medicines because they haven\u2019t been approved \u2014 they\u2019re in a line of approval and it takes some time. We\u2019ve cut the time in half, by the way, for approval by the FDA. But people are sick.</p><p>We have very promising drugs and they\u2019re not allowed to use them because \u2014 I mean, they\u2019re terminally ill and they wouldn\u2019t let them use them because of liability and other things, but I got that taken care of. So, Right to Try was a very important one.</p><p>Getting Veterans Choice was so important \u2014 having Veterans Choice. Nobody thought we could get that. Hasn\u2019t been done in 50 years. They haven\u2019t been able to get it. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Accountability. Because we have so many other things. So many things.</p><p>And on the border, Ken, we\u2019ve done things that nobody thought would have been possible. Right? Do you want to name a couple of them?</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: We\u2019re making enormous progress in the \u2014 especially in the regulatory arena: reestablishing the 140-year-old American tradition of inviting immigrants here who can stand on their own two feet, as \u2014 much like Sara had said. And to add to this country and not \u2014 while not becoming a burden on the country.</p><p>We\u2019ve also \u2014 the security that you\u2019ve advocated for and pushed us to achieve has been unprecedented on a border that we still have more work to do. But we \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great progress.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: \u2014 the amount of improvement in three years is just extraordinary.</p><p>And one more piece of legislation you know is near and dear to my heart that you led is criminal justice reform, which was \u2014 you know, lots of people before you talked about it, and this is the first administration to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Nobody else could\u2019ve gotten that done. Nobody. And we really thank Ken, but we thank a lot of people that came through.</p><p>By the way, some conservative \u2014 very conservative really wanted it and some liberal wanted it. But we got criminal justice reform done. Nobody thought that was possible. The biggest beneficiary is African Americans and Hispanic Americans, I would say \u2014 and Asian Americans \u2014 the three, the groups.</p><p>But tremendous benefits and \u2014 you know, it\u2019s really amazing. When we got that done, we had people supporting that that I would\u2019ve never thought would\u2019ve supported it. Not for bad reasons, but they would\u2019ve never supported it, and they actually led the way. It\u2019s pretty incredible. Criminal justice reform was a big deal. You know that, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So \u2014 and you were helpful actually, and I appreciate it. And thank you very much. Anybody have a question?</p><p>Q Yes, Mr. President \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, on TikTok: You said over the weekend \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q \u2014 that you\u2019re planning to ban it. I know that you spoke with the CEO of Microsoft after that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I did.</p><p>Q So can you give us an update on \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q \u2014 where you\u2019re at?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We had a great conversation. He called me to see whether or not \u2014 how I felt about it. And I said, \u201cLook, it can\u2019t be controlled, for security reasons, by China. Too big, too invasive, and it can\u2019t be.\u201d And here is the deal: I don\u2019t mind if \u2014 whether it\u2019s Microsoft or somebody else \u2014 a big company, a secure company, very \u2014 a very American company buy it. It\u2019s probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30 percent of it. Because they say, \u201cHow do you do 30 percent? Who\u2019s going to get the name?\u201d The name is hot; the brand is hot. And who\u2019s going to get the name? How do you do that if it\u2019s owned by two different companies?</p><p>So my personal opinion was: You\u2019re probably better off buying the whole thing rather than buying 30 percent of it. I think buying 30 percent is complicated. And I suggested that he can go ahead. He can try. We set a date \u2014 I set a date at around September 15th, at which point it\u2019s going to be out of business in the United States. But if somebody \u2014 and whether it\u2019s Microsoft or somebody else \u2014 buys it, that\u2019ll be interesting.</p><p>I did say that if you buy it, whatever the price is, that goes to whoever owns it. Because I guess it\u2019s China, essentially, but more than anything else. I said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States because we\u2019re making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now, they don\u2019t have any rights, unless we give it to them. So if we\u2019re going to give them the rights, then it has to come into \u2014 it has to come into this country.</p><p>It\u2019s a little bit like the landlord/tenant: Without a lease, the tenant has nothing. So they pay what\u2019s called \u201ckey money,\u201d or they pay something. But the United States should be reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money, because without the United States, they don\u2019t have anything \u2014 at least having to do with the 30 percent.</p><p>So I told him that. I think we\u2019re going to have \u2014 maybe a deal is going to be made. It\u2019s a great asset. It\u2019s a great asset. But it\u2019s not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States. So it\u2019ll close down on September 15th, unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal \u2014 an appropriate deal. So the Treasury of the \u2014 really, the Treasury, I guess you would say, of the United States gets a lot of money. A lot of money. Okay?</p><p>Q Mr. President, can you explain why so many of the public health experts on the coronavirus task force are contradicting you on things like why the virus is so widespread in this country, on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine? Why are so many of these people on your task force contradicting you?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we\u2019re doing a great job. I think we\u2019re doing great on vaccines. We\u2019re doing great on therapeutics. You\u2019ll be seeing that very soon. I think we\u2019re \u2014 when you look at a map, this is a map of the \u2014 I\u2019ve got \u2014 I sort of shown that around a little bit, but that\u2019s \u2014 the red is the area of most concern. (Displays a U.S map.) Pretty recent map of the \u2014 of the country. And there\u2019s a lot of \u2014 a lot of people that \u2014 in a lot of areas that have gotten very \u2014 you know, better very fast.</p><p>Hydroxy has tremendous support, but politically, it\u2019s toxic because I supported it. If they would have said, \u201cDo not use hydroxychloroquine under any circumstances,\u201d they would have come out and they would\u2019ve said, \u201cIt\u2019s a great \u2014 it\u2019s a great thing.\u201d Many doctors have come out strongly in favor of it. They want it very badly. It\u2019s a great malaria drug.</p><p>So, for many years \u2014</p><p>Q But Admiral Giroir says it\u2019s not effective.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me finish my \u2014 let me finish my answer.</p><p>So for many years \u2014 it\u2019s, I guess, 60 years it\u2019s been a malaria drug; very successful, as you know. And it\u2019s been also a drug for lupus. And it caused no trouble \u2014 virtually nothing, in terms of causing people to get sick or having problems with anything. You add the zinc and you add the azithromycin \u2014 the Z-Pak, as they call it \u2014 and it\u2019s been very \u2014 I happened to take it myself, the threesome.</p><p>I took it myself for a period of two weeks. I mean, I \u2014 I had no problem. I had no problem whatsoever. And, importantly, I, you know, didn\u2019t test positive. That\u2019s very nice. Okay? I\u2019m very happy about that negative.</p><p>And so \u2014 so that\u2019s the story. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s very highly thought of. Interestingly, a great doctor, from what I understand \u2014 a great doctor from Yale feels very strongly about hydroxychloroquine. The Ford Clinic in Michigan came out with a very, very powerful paper saying it\u2019s very good. Many other \u2014 in France, as you know, they came out with a very positive statement. Many individual doctors have come out with very positive statements.</p><p>I will tell you that if I was surrounded by people, as I was at the time \u2014 the reason I took it: You know, we had some people that were relatively near me that tested positive. And I took it for that reason, just because I\u2019ve heard good things.</p><p>Q But Fauci says it doesn\u2019t work. Admiral Giroir says it doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t agree with Fauci on everything.</p><p>Q They\u2019re on your task force.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t agree with Fauci. Look, Fauci didn\u2019t want \u2014 and I \u2014 I like him. I get along with him actually great. But he didn\u2019t want to ban people from China from coming into the country, and I overrode him and I did the right thing. He was saying face masks are no good a short while ago. So it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a bad person, because he\u2019s not. He\u2019s a good person; I like him. But we \u2014 we disagree on things. We disagree on things.</p><p>Now, I will say this: We\u2019ve done an amazing job with ventilators. We\u2019re supplying the world with ventilators. Ventilators are very hard, very expensive, very hard to make, very complex. Very complicated machines. Very \u2014 very expensive.</p><p>Q But why does the \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it. Hold it.</p><p>Q But why does the U.S have so many deaths?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it.</p><p>Q The U.S has so many deaths compared to \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it.</p><p>Q \u2014 so many countries around the world. I \u2014</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Fake news CNN, hold it. We have done a great job in this country. We haven\u2019t been given \u2014 and not me. I\u2019m not talking about me. The Vice President, the task force have not been given the kind of credit.</p><p>If you look, countries all over the world are exploding right now \u2014 people that you said were doing a wonderful job, so wonderful. But right now, take a look at the countries that are exploding: You have Italy back. You have Spain back. You have France back. You have Germany back. You have a lot of countries, and that\u2019s not to knock them.</p><p>It is a very delicate, very contagious disease. It was released by China. It should never have been allowed to release. There was the source where you could have stopped it. And they did stop it from going into China, although now they say that China is having a lot of problems. Moscow, in Russia, is having tremendous problems.</p><p>What China unleashed was a very, very sad situation. With all of that being understood, the United States has done an amazing job, a great job, and you\u2019re going to see that because we have vaccines and we have therapeutics coming very soon.</p><p>Yeah, go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, why are you not involved directly in negotiations with Capitol Hill?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I am. Oh, why? The fact that I\u2019m not over there with Crazy Nancy? No, I\u2019m totally involved.</p><p>Q Have you spoken with her?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m totally involved. And we\u2019re going to be doing some things that are very good, because we don\u2019t think that she \u2014 look, what Chuck Schumer wants more than anybody \u2014 and I would say Nancy Pelosi would be second \u2014 they want to bail out cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period of time. Nothing to do with coronavirus or China virus, or whatever you want to call it.</p><p>They want to bail out cities and states. They want bailout money. They want to trillion dollars in bailout money, and a lot of people don\u2019t want to do that because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s right. The Democrats have run some very bad states and some very, very bad cities, and a lot of people don\u2019t want to give them a trillion dollars to reward them for doing a bad job.</p><p>If you look at some of the states \u2014 I won\u2019t insult anybody by naming those states, but you know what they are. They want bailout money. They\u2019re not interested in the people. They\u2019re not interested in unemployment. They\u2019re not interested in evictions, which is a big deal \u2014 the evictions. They want to evict. A lot of people are going to be evicted, but I\u2019m going to stop it because I\u2019ll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to executive orders, and we\u2019re looking at that very seriously right now.</p><p>But what the Democrats want, they want \u2014 they\u2019re slow-rolling it, and all they\u2019re really interested in is bailout money to bail out radical-left governors and radical-left mayors, like in Portland and places that are so badly run. Chicago, New York City \u2014 you see what\u2019s going on over there. Bailout cities and states who have been poorly run and spent a fortune doing it, they want a trillion dollars, and we\u2019re really not interested in that.</p><p>Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>Q What about the Postal Service, Mr. President? What about the Postal Service? Any message to your postmaster general?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jim, very much. Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>1:10 P.M EDT</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3593159</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HJ-3KT1-JDG9-Y31B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11398\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 4, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Trump, 2020</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">August 3, 2020</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The President. Well, thank you very much. And today I'm signing an Executive order to ensure that the Federal Government lives by a very simple rule: Hire American. We've been doing it at a level that hasn't been done maybe ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'll also be taking firm, disciplinary action against the leadership of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has sadly and cruelly betrayed American workers. And we have some of those great American workers with us at the table. This is the Cabinet Room, and it's an honor to have you in the Cabinet Room and being at the Oval Office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're joined by the Vice President; Congressman Tim Burchett, who's doing a fantastic job in the State of Tennessee; Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia; Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Secretary Ken Cuccinelli. Where's Ken? Hi, Ken. I didn't see you down there. [Laughter] That's great. Doing a great job.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Kenneth T. Cuccinelli. Quiet, as usual.</p><p>The President. Keep you busy, right? [Laughter] We're keeping you busy, Ken.</p><p>Recently, the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeffrey Lyash, made a disastrous and heartless decision. The TVA announced that it would lay off over 200 American workers and replace them with cheaper foreign workers brought in from overseas. The Tennessee Valley Authority leadership then ordered the American workers to train their foreign replacements, rubbing salt in their very open wound.</p><p>So we're going to bring in workers. They're going to be foreign workers. And people from Tennessee, and some others States right around it, are going to train them-what to do and how to do it. It doesn't work that way.</p><p>As we speak, we're finalizing H1-B regulations so that no American worker is replaced ever again. H1-B's should be used for top, highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labor program to destroy American jobs.</p><p>Sitting at the table are six of the TVA workers who were ordered to train the foreign labor flown in to replace them. I want you and your colleagues to know that my administration will not be putting up with-I happen to know a young woman who's been very active over the last couple of years, because we were together on Disney and a couple of other things.</p><p>Protect US Workers Founder and President Sara K. Blackwell. Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>The President. And it all seems to be working out pretty well.</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Thank you so much.</p><p>The President. You're doing a great job.</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Thank you.</p><p>The President. And I thank you for it.</p><p>But that's why I'm formally removing the Chairman of the Board, James Thompson, and Board member Richard Howarth. If the TVA does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire their workers, then more Board members will be removed. We have the absolute right to remove Board members. And the board makes the decision; I don't make the decision. I saw there was an ad on television talking about the amount of money that the Chairman makes, and it's a ridiculous amount of money. But we have the right to replace the Board, and the Board is the one-the only ones that get the right to then hire a new person.</p><p>Furthermore, the Board must immediately hire that new CEO who puts the interest of American workers first. The current CEO, Jeff Lyash, is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year. Did you know that? Eight million. He's the highest paid government official of any country anywhere in the world.</p><p>Now, I don't know that you call him officially a \"government.\" It might be a public-private. It may be something-as a lot time ago, it was established, Tennessee Valley Authority. But he gets $8 million a year. So that was just a succession of deep-swamp things happening, and it's a disgrace. But he gets $8 million per year, and I can think of about almost a hundred-percent of the people I know would take that job. [Laughter] And it's not a very hard job. I mean, you have not a lot of debt, not a lot of anything, right?</p><p>Public service is just that: Those who takes these jobs must be focused on the public good, not on personal profit. He would have taken the job for millions and millions of dollars less, but nobody asked him to do that. Okay? He would have gone for less. You could have had him for $4 million, $6 million, $7 million, $2 million, $1 million, probably $500,000 a year.</p><p>But the new CEO must be paid no more than $500,000 a year, which is still a significant amount more than the President of the United States makes. And I donate my salary. I've donated it. From what I hear, I'm the only President to do that. You'll have to check on that, but that's what I've heard. I'm very surprised to hear that. But I donate my full salary; I don't take it.</p><p>The Board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure too. We don't want him leaving and then he gets a big check for millions and millions of dollars.</p><p>We want the TVA to take action on this immediately: Lower energy prices in the States of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. I love all those States. Any additional States you can think of there? I don't know. Let's see. So we're talking about of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Great States, they're-every one of them.</p><p>So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed Board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words: \"You're fired.\" \"You're fired.\" It's ridiculous. The man is getting $8 million. It'd be interesting to see how much money he made before this. And I have no idea. Maybe he made more. I don't know. But I doubt it. But it'd be interesting to see. He got this position; must have been politically inspired, because I can think of probably, almost, everybody in the nation would have liked this position, including every one of the media folks across the table from me. I would say that everybody would have liked this position.</p><p>So, with that, we're getting rid of him in one form or another. Either the Board is going to do it, we're going to do it. But he's gone. And he's done not a great job. He's done not even a good job, in certain ways. Plants in Kentucky-he could have kept the plant open in Kentucky, if he wanted to, even if they retrofitted the plant. And he didn't do that, did he, Congressman?</p><p>Representative Timothy F. Burchett. No, sir.</p><p>The President. He wouldn't do that.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. No, sir.</p><p>The President. We asked him to do it. He didn't want to do it. We said, \"That's okay.\" And here we are doing what we're doing today.</p><p>So we will get somebody for a much lower price. I want the saving-much lower salary-I want the saving to go to the people of these great States in the form of energy savings. And that's a pretty substantial number.</p><p>So, Kevin, could I ask you to start off and say a few words, please?</p><p>U.S. Tech Workers Founder Kevin Lynn. I certainly appreciate that, Mr. President. My name is Kevin Lynn. I'm the executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform and the founder of U.S. Tech Workers. And thank you for paying attention to our ad, Mr. President.</p><p>[At this point, Mr. Lynn continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]</p><p>This is a historic moment that I'm hopeful will reverse the harm outsourcing and offshoring have done to our Nation's productive classes. And it is my hope that Congress will join you, Mr. President, in making sure our workers are more secure in their jobs.</p><p>The President. Good.</p><p>Mr. Lynn. Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>The President. So you're the one that took the ad about me that-I didn't know that. [Laughter] I was just saying, you know, \"I think he's the one that took this, really, vicious ad.\" Like, I hired this guy for $8 million, and I had nothing to do with it. I said, \"What's that?\" But actually, you brought something very important up, because when I looked into it, I said, \"This guy is actually making $8 million a year.\" And you did the ad. So you really made me aware of what was going on with the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has been a feeding pot for a long time. And a lot of deep state, a lot of swamp creatures, okay?</p><p>So that's it. So we're going to make that-I see. So I think now you realize that it wasn't about me. I hope you now realize that.</p><p>Mr. Lynn. I do realize that, Mr. President. [Laughter] But if I could-</p><p>The President. I accept your apology. [Laughter]</p><p>Mr. Lynn. In full disclosure, Mr. President, when we sat down with the Davis Agency constructing the ad-</p><p>The President. Right.</p><p>Mr. Lynn.-they said, \"Who's your audience?\" And I said: \"Just one person. He's the only one that\"-</p><p>The President. That's smart. [Laughter]</p><p>Mr. Lynn.-\"would do this, and he's the only one that can come to the aid of these workers in the Tennessee Valley Authority.\"</p><p>Rep. Burchett. He's the only one with any guts to do it-who has guts to do it.</p><p>The President. I'll tell you though: I have to say, Kevin, the end was very appropriate. And while it has nothing to do with me, I can do things with respect to the Board, and ultimately, the board controls that decision. This is a very, very old authority done in the-</p><p>Mr. Lynn. Nineteen-thirty-three, Mr. President.</p><p>The President. So it was done during the FDR days. And it's been-you know, it's been getting crazier and crazier just over the years. And they have, basically, nobody watching over them. And the Board isn't watching. You see this happening in public companies also. You see it happening a lot.</p><p>But for a essentially-I would say, for a Federal employee to be paid $8 million-now what we're doing is, we're looking at the Board members, how much are they paid. Because usually what happens is they pay, and then he says, \"You know, I think you ought to get more money.\" And everybody is making a lot of money, and your pricing for electric and utilities starts going up, and people say, \"I wonder why.\"</p><p>I also see that they're doing a lot of things in terms of electric, which is very expensive electric. They're building facilities that are very, very expensive to build and don't work well. But we'll discuss that separately.</p><p>But I appreciate it because you did make me aware of what's going on, and it's a terrific thing we're doing today. Thank you very much, Kevin.</p><p>Please, Stacy. How are you?</p><p>Tennessee Valley Authority system administrator Stacy Whetzell. I'm doing fine. Mr. President, my name is Stacy Whetzell. I'm the son of a sharecropper.</p><p>[Mr. Whetzell continued his remarks, concluding as follows. ]</p><p>American patriots will forever be grateful that you're also acting and fought the misguided and out-of-control H1-B worker program. I thank you for Americans first and acting to stop this travesty.</p><p>The President. Well, you're a very powerful speaker. And so powerful that we just got a call-Mark just brought this in from-the TVA CEO, and he's indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course. [Laughter] So it must have been Stacy. I think Stacy did a much better job than me. [Laughter] I mean, you're talking and all of the sudden, I get the note.</p><p>So he's looking to change course and reverse it, and that's good. Now, maybe he'll take a major cut in salary too. That will be phase two, right? So we'll take a look at that. And maybe you'll start looking at that on behalf of everybody, gratis. Right?</p><p>International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Eastern Federal Area Vice President Gay Henson. Yes, sir.</p><p>The President. Your group. That's great, isn't it.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Yes, I mean, TVA told me while we were in this process of working on behalf of the workers-I'm the union president, IFPTE Engineering Association. They told me it's going to take a message-a stop order from the President in order to keep us from moving forward. And I said, \"I'm working on that.\" [Laughter]</p><p>The President. And you did a good job.</p><p>Ms. Henson. So I appreciate you.</p><p>The President. Everybody in this room did a good job.</p><p>Ms. Henson. I appreciate you, sir.</p><p>The President. And, Congressman, you have my endorsement.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>The President. Okay? You had it anyway, but you have it now. It's a great job.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Well, I appreciate you.</p><p>The President. The only Congressman in the room. I tell you, Tim, great job.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Thank you, brother.</p><p>The President. That's only phase one. Phase two is-imagine being paid the $8 million a year to run a thing that's pretty easy to run, in all fairness. It's not like he built it; he didn't build it. He went there, and he's been there, and he gets a lot of money, and it shouldn't be. Five hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, right?</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Yes, sir. In Tennessee, it is.</p><p>The President. And I'm willing to say he gets paid more money than I do. I don't care.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Yes, sir.</p><p>The President. But you know, it shouldn't happen.</p><p>So that's a start. That's a start. And I think we should find out what Board members make, okay? Because-</p><p>Rep. Burchett. I'll look into that.</p><p>The President. -I can almost guarantee you they're paid heavily.</p><p>Congratulations, Stacy. Really good.</p><p>Mr. Whetzell. Thank you, President.</p><p>The President. Please, go ahead.</p><p>Tennessee Valley Authority IT Operations Engineer for Reliability and Performance David Littlejohn. Yes, sir. Mr. President, thank you. My name is David Littlejohn. I am a soon-to-be father. This November, my wife will be giving birth to my first child. I am a long line-I'm the son in a long line of military men and women, so I was born with a heart of service. And with that, I love to serve the people of the Valley.</p><p>I was told July 23 that I would be sent home and to be trained-training a contractor from a H1-B-dependent contract company. Now, I'm shaking right now becauseThe</p><p>President. You're doing great.</p><p>Mr. Littlejohn. Thank you.</p><p>The President. You had a big victory already. [Laughter]</p><p>Mr. Littlejohn. Yes, sir.</p><p>I'm shaking right now because this really impacts me and my wife and my unborn child, and I greatly appreciate everyone here to support us.</p><p>The President. I appreciate it, and thank you very much.</p><p>Mr. Littlejohn. Yes, sir.</p><p>The President. And you'll see what happens. It's going to be very quick too. Thank you.</p><p>Wendy, please.</p><p>Tennessee Valley Authority Software Engineer for Enterprise Resource Planning Wendy Turner. Yes. I'm Wendy Turner, and thank you for having us here. I've been a software engineer at TVA for 19 years. I'm going to change my comments a little. I was coming to say, you know, for the first time in 19 years, I didn't know what was going to happen to me and my kids, and I also take care of my mom. But what we're going to do going forward-so thank you.</p><p>The President. And this was-everybody felt this way in Tennessee Valley Authority then, I guess-right?-if you do. You've been there for 19 years. So everyone had to feel this way, like there's been a big feeling of doubt, right?</p><p>Ms. Turner. Right. Yes.</p><p>The President. That's a terrible thing.</p><p>Ms. Turner. Yes.</p><p>The President. They're waiting for it to happen to them.</p><p>Ms. Turner. Yes, and I've been training since June. I've been training our replacements from a company that relied on-</p><p>The President. You've been training people?</p><p>Ms. Turner. Yes. Yes, sir.</p><p>The President. And so did they lay you off yet? Or are you not sure?</p><p>Ms. Turner. I got my notice in June that we would be laid off September 1.</p><p>The President. So you're training people to take your job at a-whatever. Right?</p><p>Ms. Turner. They told us it would beThe</p><p>President. And where are the people from that you're training?</p><p>Ms. Turner. All over the place. We-everything is done remotely orThe</p><p>President. Are they from other countries?</p><p>Ms. Turner. They're here on soil now. I don't know their status as far asThe</p><p>President. Because with Disney, they were from other countries, right?</p><p>Ms. Henson. Yes, sir.</p><p>The President. Go ahead.</p><p>Ms. Turner. Yes, so I don't know. I know the company-Accenture is replacing our group, and I know they rely heavily on H1-B workers, but I don't know for sure where everyone is.</p><p>The President. Okay. Well, we'll make sure that things work out for the three of them, because they're brave to be here, actually, Sara. So you'll check that out, right?</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Yes, sir.</p><p>The President. Let's see that they get their jobs backMs.</p><p>Turner. Thank you very much.</p><p>The President. -because I hear you're great workers. I mean, I said I want people, but I also people that are really good workers-that did a great job. Because, you know, people can be let go; should be able to-if they're not doing a good job. I'm all for that. I think-I'll bet you are.</p><p>But I said, \"I want people that really do a great job and were unfairly let go.\" Right, Tim?</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Absolutely.</p><p>The President. That's, to me, very important.</p><p>Thank you very much, Wendy. We'll see what happens. Okay? We're going to push it hard.</p><p>Chuck, please.</p><p>Tennessee Valley Authority Disaster Recovery Administrator Chuck Charnawskas. Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I recognize how busy your schedule is, and I sincerely appreciate your time today. Okay?</p><p>I'm Chuck Charnawskas. Basically, I've had the opportunity to work with the really technically competent people of the Tennessee Valley for 7 years, okay? It's been a great experience. I have a degree in electrical engineering, 45 years of valuable industrial experience, and I'm a certified security professional here, okay?</p><p>Working with the people in Tennessee Valley was how I learned just how important the Tennessee Valley is to 11 million people in seven different States, okay, and how it basically impacts their lives. It's absolutely significant. And that is the reason that I'm really here today.</p><p>The TVA basically has the capability to produce 35 billion watts of powers, okay? They have 17,000 lines of high-voltage transmission.</p><p>The President. How does that compare to other big utilities, would you say?</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. It definitely ranks right in the top of them. There's no question about it. And very significant: Tennessee Valley is part of the Southeastern Reliability Corporation, and it's obviously one of the biggest players in that area.</p><p>The President. Yes, it's very big. That's a lot.</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. Very significant in that respect, sir, okay? And in essence here, as a consequence of that, they also basically support 35 dams that produce power from 29, to do flood control. Just a couple years ago, they were able to reduce billions of dollars of potential damage by managing the rivers correctly, in that case.</p><p>The President. Right.</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. They have three major power plants-nuclear power plants.</p><p>The President. What's your biggest dam? What's the big dam?</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. Probably, it would be Chickamauga or-</p><p>Tennessee Valley Authority software engineer Jonathan Hicks. Wilson. Wilson Dam, in Alabama.</p><p>The President. Wilson in Alabama.</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. There's the expert, right down there. [Laughter] So I defer to the expert about that.</p><p>But the bottom line of it: As a consequence of this, it's a very important player not only in the Southeast region, but for, basically, internationally, okay? And today, the TVA receives hundreds if not thousands of potential attacks-cyberattacks-testing its networking, right?</p><p>It's imperative to have experienced, knowledgeable employees to handle that situation, yes. Okay?</p><p>The President. Right. Good.</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. And a fine example of this-and I just kind of-you know, it's a little bit humorous, but the great power outage in 2003 was affected by a software glitch-okay?-that impacted and it shut down Manhattan for 24 hours.</p><p>The President. I remember that very well. [Laughter]</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. I thought you might be related-or familiar with that. So, as a consequence-it just really points to the significance of having qualified, vetted people with proper clearances.</p><p>The President. I agree.</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas.-dedicated to that job.</p><p>The President. I agree. That wouldn't happen with you, would it? Huh? It wouldn't happen.</p><p>Ms. Turner. No, sir.</p><p>The President. Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Chuck.</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. And then, if I-quickly, two other quick points. Basically, this outsourcing agreement could impact-the Tennessee Valley has always-our goals are to provide energy, economic development, and protect the environment. This particular outsourcing agreement could impact the Valley by $88 million to these local economies here. And for the individuals that are in there, not only may they lose their primary income, but they may consequently have insurance costs that basically reflect a three- to four-hundred-percent increase for these families on how they manage it.</p><p>And I'd like-</p><p>The President. Yes. And you're going to lose-you're going to lose people, and you're firing people that are-they live in Tennessee and they live in Georgia, and they live in the other States that I mentioned, and it's not a fair situation.</p><p>Go ahead. Let's go, Chuck.</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. Final point: The effort here to make America great again-okay-reflects the fact that we need to take into repatriate manufacturing companies and companies to take and spend our money domestically and support the domestic product. How can we justify spending these millions of dollars-for one particular consulting firm, $15 million toThe</p><p>President. Who is the consulting firm?</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. Well, that would be Capgemini; it was out of France.</p><p>The President. You spent $15 million a year on a consulting firm?</p><p>Mr. Charnawskas. Well, this was a-</p><p>The President. We just found another nugget of gold. [Laughter]</p><p>Sara doesn't care about that one, but that's a-[laughter]-I care about it. You spent $15 million to one consulting firm.</p><p>Ms. Henson. It's not-it's not a consulting-that's one of the companies that are picking up. And it's Capgemini, and that's $15 million that-just for that one company.</p><p>The President. How many are there-how many are there like that?</p><p>Ms. Henson. There's Capgemini, CGI, Accenture, and Tech Systems at TVA-</p><p>The President. And they're paying tremendous amount of money?</p><p>Ms. Henson. Yes, sir. And our workers are more than capable.</p><p>The President. Very-they're very political people. You know this is a very political group of people you just named?</p><p>Ms. Henson. Really? I just know that-</p><p>The President. Not to me. Not to me, I don't care. [Laughter] I don't care who they are, but they are very political.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Well, I mean, and these people are more than capable of doing the job and have done it with excellence. And TVA says your matrix for your performance is above; it doesn't make sense. And what you're doing-I cannot tell you how much it means to me. And for these workers it-and I'm very emotional, because TVA is a large racket. They do their thing, and nobody can touch them. And I believe today they've been touched.</p><p>The President. It's a racket.</p><p>Ms. Henson. They've been touched. [Laughter]</p><p>The President. No, it's a racket. Well, we just found that out. [Laughter] No, it's a racket.</p><p>And, I mean, I understand it. The four firms that you just mentioned that are paid tens of millions of dollars, they're very political firms. You know, they may be good, but they're very political firms. And they do it for much less much-much, much, much less. You could give them half. You could give them 10 percent, they'd probably do it for. Those are big numbers for a consulting firm.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Well, they're-they're not the consulting firm; they're the ones actually going to take these people's jobs. That-</p><p>The President. That's worse.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Yes, it is worse. So I meanThe</p><p>President. Tim, go ahead, please.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Mr. President, thank youThe</p><p>President. Congratulations.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. -and Vice President so much for this. My mama worked at TVA after the Second-during the-at the end of the Second World War, when dad came home from the Pacific and married her, and then she went into education. But you know, working people are the backbone of this country. That's not clich\u00e9, and you'veThe</p><p>President. Yes.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. -you've highlighted that so much with the trades and other things, and I'm very appreciative of the fact.</p><p>But I'll you what: Dadgummit, if TVA wants be Duke Electric, let them because Duke Electric, but they're not. And they-they hide behind the Government's skirt and they-they use eminent domain, and their arrogance is beyond belief. You know, when they had the ash spill, people died, and then-you know, and then they are just these poor country folks that are just pushing them off until they all die off, until those lawsuits go away. It's ridiculous.</p><p>The President. No, that's right. And by the way, in Kentucky, when we wanted to have a plant open with a lot of jobs, they didn't even want to consider it.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. No. No, they didn't. It's their arrogance. You're questioning them, and finally we have a President with the guts that understands business and government. And if TVA wants to be a government entity, they need to-they need to declare it, and quit using-they hide behind-you know, they have their-theirThe</p><p>President. Do you think Joe Biden would do this?</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Heck no.</p><p>The President. He wouldn't know you're alive.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. He'd be-no, he'dThe</p><p>President. He doesn't know he's alive either. [Laughter]</p><p>Rep. Burchett. He needs to get out of the bunker.</p><p>The President. No, can you imagine him sitting at this table right now? Wouldn't have a clue.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. No, sir.</p><p>The President. Okay. So go ahead, Tim.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. No, I think you pretty much covered it, Mr. President. I'm just honored to be here. And IThe</p><p>President. Well, I'm honored that you're here. And you've done a fantastic job.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. And I thank you for standing up for working Americans.</p><p>The President. Yes, well we're going to-and we're going to get this finished too. So we'll get it finished, Sara.</p><p>Thank you very much, Tim.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Yes, sir.</p><p>The President. Gene, please.</p><p>Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia. Mr. President, thank you for bringing this group together. And this this meeting has, I think, shown a very human impact on individual working-</p><p>The President. Incredible.</p><p>Secretary Scalia.-men and women of a practice that's actually pretty widespread.</p><p>And the way it's worked under our immigration laws for a while now is that a company that wants to bring in workers from overseas-wants to use the H1-B program for high-skilled workers-has to file an attestation with us at the Labor Department, saying American workers aren't going to lose their jobs when I bring in these H1-B workers. And they have to say it's not going to hurt their wages.</p><p>But what companies do is, they bring workers in, and then they lease them out to another company. And so you've got one company bringing them in and then leasing them to TVA. And it's true, the company bringing them in-their workers aren't being affected, but the TVA workers are.</p><p>And so I took a look at this, as your Labor Secretary, recently, and I said to my staff-I said, \"Well, if the workers are going to the other company, why doesn't the other company, where they're actually going to be working and supervised, also file an application?\"</p><p>The President. Very good. Right.</p><p>Secretary Scalia. \"And say, 'We're not going to affect U.S. workers either.'\" And I said to my staff, \"Why can't we do that?\" They looked into it. And, Mr. President, today, you're going to be signing an order-</p><p>The President. Well, good.</p><p>Secretary Scalia.-that requires that change.</p><p>The President. Good.</p><p>Secretary Scalia. So, going forward, when those workers are going to another company, both companies are going to check for it, and that's a change we'll make. We'll do it together with the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>I just want to mention one other thing we're doing together. For more than 15 years, the Secretary of Labor has had the authority to initiate an investigation of abuse of H1-B program when he or she finds reasonable cause. That has never been done. That authority has never been used.</p><p>But again, we saw-signed a memo of understanding on Friday with the Department of Homeland Security that will change that too. They're going to now share information they have, which I can then use to bring cases when we're finding the program abused.</p><p>The President. Very good. You're going to find a lot. And thank you very much, Gene.</p><p>Secretary Scalia. Thank you. And thank you for this order today.</p><p>The President. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Good work, Stacy. [Laughter]</p><p>The President. Right, Stacy? Right? I like that. You like that?</p><p>Mr. Whetzell. We'll take it.</p><p>The President. Linda, please.</p><p>Tennessee Valley Authority IT end user analyst Linda McDonald. Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being with us today. The concern you show for American workers is greatly appreciated. And my mother made me promise to tell you that Alabama loves and appreciates your leadership. [Laughter]</p><p>The President. I love Alabama.</p><p>Ms. McDonald. So a promise that my mother made.</p><p>My name is Linda McDonald. I've lived in northeast Alabama my entire life. My goal was to work at TVA; that was my American Dream. After years of sacrifice and hard work, I achieved that goal. I've been working for TVA for 7 years now. But-so, and in that role, I got to see every day-</p><p>The President. So that was like an ambition of yours to work someday for TVA?</p><p>Ms. McDonald. Correct.</p><p>The President. And you finally got there?</p><p>Ms. McDonald. I did.</p><p>The President. So what's happening?</p><p>Ms. McDonald. Well, June 30, we were told that we would be outsourced to another company with-</p><p>The President. All right. Yes.</p><p>Ms. McDonald. Yes, so, here I am, faced with-</p><p>The President. And you had to have these consulting firms making $10, $15 million a year?</p><p>Ms. McDonald. Yes, I feel like my-</p><p>The President. And the man that heads it making $8 million a year, right? [Laughter]</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>Ms. McDonald. I feel like my American Dream was being stolen from meThe</p><p>President. Yes.</p><p>Ms. McDonald.-and given to someone else. So I just thinkThe</p><p>President. Is that the way you view it: \"Given to somebody else\"?</p><p>Ms. McDonald. It is. It was taken from me, andThe</p><p>President. It's a very interesting wayMs.</p><p>McDonald.-it was then given to someone else.</p><p>The President.-of viewing it, right?</p><p>Ms. McDonald. So I thank you for listening to us, because it felt, for so long, like no one was even listening to us. So thank you very much.</p><p>The President. Well, I've been hearing about it for a long time. When I was running, I met Sara, and we worked on the Disney situationMs.</p><p>Blackwell. Yes, sir. Thank you.</p><p>The President.-but that was a long time ago. But-and you know, this has been happening for a while. So we're taking care of it.</p><p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Linda. We'll see what happens. You may be very pleasantly surprised. Okay?</p><p>Ms. McDonald. I hope so.</p><p>The President. Thank you.</p><p>Jonathan, please.</p><p>Mr. Hicks. Well, thank you for your time.</p><p>The President. Thank you.</p><p>Mr. Hicks. My name is Jonathan Hicks. I'm a-I'm from a large family, and we've had three-three members of our family who have served in the U.S. military. I grew up in Tennessee, around the Knoxville area, and started my career with TVA in 2001 as an IT intern. During-as soon as I graduated, I got a full-time job there, and I've been there for 19 years. I've been-</p><p>The President. And that was a big deal, right?</p><p>Mr. Hicks. Yes. Yes.</p><p>The President. Working-because there's a great prestige to that.</p><p>Mr. Hicks. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>The President. That's true.</p><p>Mr. Hicks. I've spent my time there working for river operations for the-for their group, and helping them, you know, have programs-mostly in-house solutions to be able to manage the river and the river systems.</p><p>I was told in June-early June-that I would be training replacements, that I would be receiving my work notice in September, and that the workers that I'd been training, there's been five or plus that I've been training for my one position, and at least four of those seem to be H1B-type workers.</p><p>I guess there's a concern with the kind of stuff that we do, at least for the river operations, and that they're generating a significant amount of power out of all the-out of all of these dams. And you know, is this something that we want to turn over this knowledge, this ability to control these dams and-you know, whether it be generation, whether it be floodgates-and hand it over to corporations that aren't in the U.S., to workers that aren't necessarily in the U.S. doing this work?</p><p>The President. Are you there now? Are youMr.</p><p>Hicks. Well, I've been put on nonwork status. I'm still employed and still getting a paycheck until September 1, but I've been-</p><p>The President. What happens on September 1?</p><p>Mr. Hicks. Well, I've been relieved of my job duties, but September 1 is when I would lose-</p><p>The President. And you trained people to take your job?</p><p>Mr. Hicks. Yes.</p><p>The President. So you've worked with people to take your job.</p><p>Mr. Hicks. Yes.</p><p>The President. You've taught them, like, almost everything you know, but plenty, right?</p><p>Mr. Hicks. Well, I think there's a big-</p><p>The President. Maybe not. Maybe you held back a couple of secrets. [Laughter]</p><p>Mr. Hicks. Well, I think there's a-I think there's a big learning curve, and there's-for the knowledge that they do there for river operations, I think it takes several years of understanding the job in order to be able to do this.</p><p>The people that are taking over the job have never dealt with utilities, they've never dealt with power generation, they've never dealt with any kind of water management or hydrogeneration. And so the-to say that they're ready to go is a misstatement. SoThe</p><p>President. Well, let's see how out it works out, Jonathan. I think you're going to be in very good shape. Okay? I have a prediction.</p><p>Mr. Hicks. Thank you.</p><p>The President. Thank you. Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p>Please.</p><p>Engineering Association Local 1937 Labor Relations Assistant Renae McKenzie. It's-I'm so honored to be here.</p><p>The President. Honored to have you.</p><p>Ms. McKenzie. My name is Renae McKenzie, and I actually work for the Engineering Association as an advocate for these IT employees and for other white-collar workers. But I've worked really closely with the IT professionals at TVA, with all of this that has been going on.</p><p>I've had to witness the anguish of the different employees that are performing these knowledge transfers on the software and the applications that they actually custom built themselves.</p><p>But so many TVA employees have been there from the beginning of their careers. So to actually witness what's happening to them, being replaced by these non-Americans, is very difficult.</p><p>But I think one of the hardest things to witness is what TVA is actually doing to themselves. I mean, their mission is about bringing economic development to the Tennessee Valley. And to be taking that-taking our economy and just giving it outside of the United States is just almost-it's unbelievable because of what they stand for and what they were built for was to come out of economicThe</p><p>President. And you see them going outside of the United States, not just here. You see them go-</p><p>Ms. McKenzie. Right. Well, if you look at these companies, these companies are based outside of the United States. So when they're getting their millions of dollars, I mean, it's going to France, it's really going to-I think one of them isMs.</p><p>Henson. India.</p><p>Ms. McKenzie. India, Canada.</p><p>Mr. Hicks. Ireland</p><p>Ms. McKenzie. And Ireland. So yes, our dollars are going to them.</p><p>The President. It's unbelievable. And they get us in many other ways too, but we're stopping it, as you noticed. That's very interesting.</p><p>So you would say France, India, Ireland, Canada. Who else?</p><p>Ms. Henson. That's the main groups right there. Those four countries.</p><p>Ms. McKenzie. Right. Those are the main ones.</p><p>The President. A lot of them-are a lot of the workers being outsourcedMr.</p><p>Lynn. All these firms: H1-B visa dependent. And 70 percent of H1-B visa workers in the United States come from one country: mainly, India.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. You know, Mr. President, I worry too about the national security. You know, we're during a pandemic, people are out of work, and our electric grid could be put in the hands of folks that, maybe, their loyalty isn't to this great country, and that bothers me.</p><p>The President. You know, with TVA, more so than most companies. You're right: You're talking about controlling all of that energy and power. It's-you're right. You're right about that, Tim. That's a very good statement. Anything else?</p><p>Ms. McKenzie. Just, it-again, it's such an honor to be in your presence. [Laughter]</p><p>The President. It's my honor. It's my great honor. Do you know the man next to you is Ken Cuccinelli, a legend? [Laughter]</p><p>Ms. McKenzie. Look, and I tend to be very quiet like him. Just saying that.</p><p>The President. He's a legend in his own mind. [Laughter]</p><p>Ken has done a fantastic job on the border. Unbelievable job on the border. And you might just tell us for a couple of seconds while we have the-the media here-I'm sure they'll report it very accurately-how well we're doing on the border and then maybe get on to make a statement, because I know you've been working with Gene and everybody very hard.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. Yes. And Secretary Scalia really covered the partnership with-between DHS and Department of Labor to solve this problem. You're solving it forcefully today for these folks. You're certainly putting the ball in motion to do that. And what we're-our two agencies, at your direction from June, are going to do is solve this permanently so that we never have to see this happen again.</p><p>But, on the border, we're seeing success with your leadership with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. The relationships you helped us forge last year, in 2019, are bearing fruit at the border during a very difficult time with the coronavirus and that Task Force, of course, led by the Vice President. And the ability since March to enforce the public health order there has changed the nature of our ability to protect the border.</p><p>There are still people getting away, more than we would like. But last year, they were running to us; this year, they're running from us, at the border. [Laughter]</p><p>The President. That's right.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. It's a bit different. And over 80 percent of the folks that we're apprehending are being returned to Mexico in under 2 hours, which is astonishing. It's just an astonishing turn.</p><p>The President. It used to take, in some cases, years. Years.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. Right. Absolutely.</p><p>The President. It's been incredible what's happened at the border. And I think the wall is helping you quite a bit, right? We have now about almost 271 miles of wall.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. Everywhere that that new system has been in place, the Border Patrol agents are just universal in their praise for both their safety and the way it impedes illegal traffic, not just people, but drugs, as well, and so forth. So it's extremely effective, and it's going up faster and faster and faster.</p><p>The President. They had a human trafficker the other day saying that they used to go out and they're trafficking-human traffic-mostly women and children, but mostly women, and they'd bring them across the border, taped up and-horrible. And this guy was saying how they used to go up, and they'd make a left turn. They'd make a right and then a left into the United States. He says, and now we just keep driving into this massive wall that nobody gets through. Nobody is getting through that wall. That wall is the real deal. And it's steel, concrete, and everything else. And lots of cameras all over it.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. That's right.</p><p>The President. And drones on top of it. And people aren't getting through. But it's been an incredible, incredible success.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. It's a real force multiplier for the Border Patrol and OFO.</p><p>The President. Yes. And Mexico is helping us a lot. They haveActing</p><p>Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. A lot better partnership.</p><p>The President.-27,000 soldiers.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. I remember how people complained about how you were pushing them so hard last year. But the partnership that's grown up with Mexico has been the best. We have really had, in decades, if not foreverThe</p><p>President. It's what they say.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli.-in cooperating and securing the border.</p><p>The President. They have a very good President who was just here 2 weeks ago.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. He was. Yes.</p><p>The President. He's really doing a good job. And we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding the border. And they don't play games. They don't play games. It's been pretty amazing. The numbers are way, way down. And we want people to come in, but they have to come in legally, and that'sActing</p><p>Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. They've got to come in legally. That's right.</p><p>The President. You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>The President. Appreciate it.</p><p>Okay, please. Go ahead. You can finish up.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Yes, I appreciate you so much. I really do. As I said earlier, I'm the union president for the workers that are represented by this move that TVA has taken. I met earlier with Tim Burchett, and he told me how disgusted he was with it. But that was earlier.</p><p>[Ms. Henson continued her remarks, concluding as follows. ]</p><p>And I think that some of these workers here at this table, IT workers, that's one of the biggest they've said to me: There's a large chance that we would be breached. And we can't do that. And I-we tried to say all those thingsThe</p><p>President. Well, with our people running it, a very small chance, from what I understand.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Yes. Right. With the right people running it. Right. But you can't give it to just anybody. And that's why these workers at TVA are so important. And I appreciate you and all that you are doing for us.</p><p>The President. Are the people that you're representing, are they-because you represent a big group of people-are they all nervous, like the folks at the table?</p><p>Ms. Henson. Yes.</p><p>The President. Like Wendy?</p><p>Ms. Henson. They're going: \"Are we next, Gay? Is this what's coming next?\" And my answer is, \"Not on my watch, if we can help it.\"</p><p>The President. Tell them no. Tell them no, they're not next.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Okay. Thank you.</p><p>The President. Okay? You can tell them. I think we can say that. So thank you very much.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Thank you. I just think you bringing TVA back to their mission of service to the people of the Valley, service to people of the Valley and to this Nation, is a pivotal moment for the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p><p>The President. So right now their mission is taking care of a lot of consultants and a lot of people and paying heads of this whole thing $8 million a year. And you'll find a lot of other things in there that are crazy.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Well, people over profit. And that's what you're doing here.</p><p>The President. What do the people of Tennessee think when they hear that the head of TVA-which has been running for a long time-and, in all fairness, not a very difficult thing; there are many people who could do it. What do they hear when they hear-and they think of government, you know? It's sort of semi-I guess, you call it-public-private. But there's not private, really, when you think of it. So it's a Board member.</p><p>What do they think when they hear that the head person is making $8 million a year? Which is, by the way, I said it before, the most highly paid person anywhere in any country if you call this government, which it sort of is. What do they think when they hear? Do they know he makes $8 million a year?</p><p>Ms. Henson. Well, they do now after Kevin's commercial. [Laughter] But they're pretty shocked. I mean-in fact, they-I think the workers even-I think some of the workers at TVA have been shocked about that. It is a lot of money.</p><p>The President. But people have known. I've known, actually, before the commercial because we were looking at it. We sent them notices a year ago and 2 years ago saying, \"We want some information.\" And you know, people have known this. I just can't even imagine that somebody gets paid $8 million a year.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Well, the difference-</p><p>The President. It's the most sought-after job. It has to be the most sought-after job in any country in any government. Right, Tim? You'd take the job. Would you resign from Congress immediately?</p><p>Rep. Burchett. I'd take it for 1 year. [Laughter]</p><p>The President. You only need it for 1 year. YouRep.</p><p>Burchett. I don't know. You don't know my wife and daughter, Mr. President. [Laughter]</p><p>The President. Tim would take it. That's-he'll take it only-</p><p>Rep. Burchett. No, they're actually pretty thrifty.</p><p>The President. Only for a year. You just need it for 1 year. That's right. Anyway.</p><p>Ms. Henson. So the workers-they are surprised at that. But you know, back to the days of Kilgore, and having worked there so long-I tell people I started when I was 8, because I can't believe how long I've worked there now-</p><p>The President. Right.</p><p>Ms. Henson. But the truth is, there are very capable people at TVA that love-</p><p>The President. I'll bet.</p><p>Ms. Henson. -the TVA and the mission that they're really-were put together for and would love to take that job.</p><p>The President. I even think they like your President-your current President, anyway. [Laughter] I'm not sure about the past President.</p><p>Ms. Henson. Tennessee Valley is-that's right. The boats on the lake all say, you knowThe</p><p>President. \"Trump.\" Yes. No, they're great people. Say hello to them. Just say hello. They're great people.</p><p>Sara, why don't you just discuss it real quick, and you can maybe work with us in getting it all done very quickly. Okay?</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Of course, President Trump.</p><p>The President. Thank you.</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Thank you for having us and having everyone here and for all you're doing with regard to immigration. Immigration should be about America, Americans, and the immigrants. Right now the way it was, before you started working on it, it's always been the big business, Big Tech, and universities. And with you, we are working to make immigration in America for the right reasons.</p><p>And Protect U.S. Workers-I endorsed you in 2016, we endorse you in 2020, and we know for a fact that \"Slow Biden\" and the Democrats will never push towards immigration that benefits Americans, America, and the immigrants. And I think they hide behind: \"Nationalists are bad; immigrants are kind and good.\" And if we are against the immigration the way it is now, then we are \"racists.\"</p><p>But the reality is, if you can keep immigration the way it's going now, the way Joe Biden will push it, the problem is, you're actually benefiting the Big Tech billionaires and universities, and that is not what immigration is about in this country.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>The President. Where you come up with the name \"Slow Biden\"? You know, so many people want me to use that term, and I say, \"It's too mean; it's too nasty.\" [Laughter]</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Oh, no! That means I'm mean.</p><p>The President. And you just come up with that term. And where did that come from? Is that the-</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. My son, actually, who's 11.</p><p>The President. Your son? He's 11?</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Yes.</p><p>The President. If he's 11, and he said he's slow and that he shouldn't be PresidentRep.</p><p>Burchett. They need to pay your son $15 million in consulting. [Laughter]</p><p>The President. Great job.</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Actually, during the rallies in 2016, you met my son. He had a Thor, and he dressed him up like President Trump.</p><p>The President. Oh, that's great.</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Yes. Thank you.</p><p>The President. That's very nice. Thank you, Sara. Very-great job you're doing.</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Thank you so much. Thank you.</p><p>The President. Good. Thank you.</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Thank you for all you do.</p><p>The President. Okay, Mike. Go ahead. We'll knock it out, Sara.</p><p>Vice President Michael R. Pence. Well, thank you, Mr. President. I'll be-I'll just be very brief.</p><p>[Vice President Pence continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]</p><p>And I know I speak on behalf of the President and our whole administration when I thank you. Thank you for stepping up for American workers and making it possible for this President to keep one more promise to working Americans. God bless you.</p><p>The President. Thank you. So we're going to sign a little document now. Is that okay?</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. I would love that. Thank you, President Trump.</p><p>The President. And it's a very important one, aligning Federal contractors and contracting and hiring practices with the interests of the American workers, which is very simple-which actually just boils down to pretty much what we're talking about today. Okay?</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Thank you. Thank you so much, President Trump.</p><p>[The President signed an Executive order titled \"Aligning Federal Contracting and Hiring Practices With the Interests of American Workers.\"]</p><p>The President. Here, give that to Sara because she was there very early.</p><p>[The President handed the pen to Ms. Blackwell.]</p><p>Ms. Blackwell. Thank you so much. I'm so happy.</p><p>The President. I have to give-I have to give one to you. You got us moving here. That's good. Will you pass these around the table, Mike? We'll just pass them on that side. You'll pass them on this side. Everybody that doesn't get it[The</p><p>President distributed pens to participants.]</p><p>So here we are.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. [Inaudible]</p><p>The President. Yes, I'll get you one, Tim. Don't worry.</p><p>So thank you very much, everybody.</p><p>We're going to be discussing, very shortly, a immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It will be a very, very comprehensive bill. That's a word that some people love and some people hate, but it will be very comprehensive only in the sense that it will cover just about everything.</p><p>It will be based on merit. It will be-it will cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to. And I think it will be bipartisan, in the sense that people are going to like a lot of the things that are in there. And probably, some people won't; we're going to have that. And we'll probably do it maybe a little bit after our convention. We'll sign it after the convention.</p><p>Likewise, we're going to be doing a health care bill-act-and it will be extremely comprehensive. It will cover a lot of things that nobody thought you would be able to get, and-I mean, in a positive way. And I think it will be very popular. And it will be a great thing for our country.</p><p>In addition, we have many other things. But immigration and health care-it doesn't get much bigger than that. Immigration will be very merit-based, but it will be great for the worker, and it will be great for people coming into our country, but coming into our country legally and loving our country and wanting to help our country, as opposed to people coming in and they don't like our country.</p><p>You see that, and you see that with certain of our politicians that ran for office. I say: \"I don't think they like our country too much. All they do is complain.\" And you would never tell them to go back to their own country, because that would be inappropriate, wouldn't it? But all they do is complain about our country, and their country is going to hell. So, you know, it's sort of an interesting phenomenon.</p><p>So the-the merit-based immigration is going to be incredible, and the health care bill or act is going to be something that I don't think anybody in this country thought they'd ever see. And we've done much of that. If look at some of the legislation that we passed, Ken, I think you can say very strongly we've gotten things passed that nobody would be possible.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. That's right.</p><p>The President. Whether it's \"right to try\"-that's where you're terminally ill and you don't have a right to use our great medicines because they haven't been approved-they're in a line of approval, and it takes some time. We've cut the time in half, by the way, for approval by the FDA. But people are sick.</p><p>We have very promising drugs, and they're not allowed to use them because-I mean, they're terminally ill, and they wouldn't let them use them because of liability and other things, but I got that taken care of. So \"right to try\" was a very important one.</p><p>Getting Veterans Choice was so important-having Veterans Choice. Nobody thought we could get that. Hasn't been done in 50 years. They haven't been able to get it. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Accountability. Because we have so many other things. So many things.</p><p>And, on the border, Ken, we've done things that nobody thought would have been possible. Right? Do you want to name a couple of them?</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli. We're making enormous progress in the-especially in the regulatory arena: reestablishing the 140-year-old American tradition of inviting immigrants here who can stand on their own two feet, as-much like Sara had said. And to add to this country and not-while not becoming a burden on the country.</p><p>We've also-the security that you've advocated for and pushed us to achieve has been unprecedented on a border that we still have more work to do. But weThe</p><p>President. Great progress.</p><p>Acting Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli.-the amount of improvement in 3 years is just extraordinary.</p><p>And one more piece of legislation you know is near and dear to my heart that you led is criminal justice reform, which was-you know, lots of people before you talked about it, and this is the first administration to do it.</p><p>The President. Nobody else could have gotten that done. Nobody. And we really thank Ken, but we thank a lot of people that came through.</p><p>By the way, some conservative-very conservative-really wanted it, and some liberal wanted it. But we got criminal justice reform done. Nobody thought that was possible. The biggest beneficiary is African Americans and Hispanic Americans, I would say-and Asian Americans-the three, the groups.</p><p>But tremendous benefits and-you know, it's really amazing. When we got that done, we had people supporting that that I would have never thought would have supported it. Not for bad reasons, but they would have never supported it, and they actually led the way. It's pretty incredible. Criminal justice reform was a big deal. You know that, Tim.</p><p>Rep. Burchett. Yes, sir.</p><p>The President. So-and you were helpful actually, and I appreciate it. And thank you very much. Anybody have a question?</p><p>TikTok/Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella/China-U.S. Relations</p><p>Q. Yes, Mr. PresidentThe</p><p>President. Go ahead.</p><p>Q. Mr. President, on TikTok: You said over the weekendThe</p><p>President. Yes.</p><p>Q.-that you're planning to ban it. I know that you spoke with the CEO of Microsoft after that.</p><p>The President. I did.</p><p>Q. So can you give us an update on-</p><p>The President. Yes.</p><p>Q. -where you're at?</p><p>The President. Yes. We had a great conversation. He called me to see whether or not-how I felt about it. And I said: \"Look, it can't be controlled, for security reasons, by China. Too big, too invasive, and it can't be.\" And here is the deal: I don't mind if-whether it's Microsoft or somebody else-a big company, a secure company, very-a very American company buy it. It's probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30 percent of it. Because they say: \"How do you do 30 percent? Who's going to get the name?\" The name is hot; the brand is hot. And who's going to get the name? How do you do that if it's owned by two different companies?</p><p>So my personal opinion was: You're probably better off buying the whole thing rather than buying 30 percent of it. I think buying 30 percent is complicated. And I suggested that he can go ahead. He can try. We set a date-I set a date at around September 15, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States. But if somebody-and whether it's Microsoft or somebody else-buys it, that will be interesting.</p><p>I did say that if you buy it, whatever the price is, that goes to whoever owns it. Because I guess it's China, essentially, but more than anything else. I said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States, because we're making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now they don't have any rights, unless we give it to them. So if we're going to give them the rights, then it has to come into-it has to come into this country.</p><p>It's a little bit like the landlord/tenant: Without a lease, the tenant has nothing. So they pay what's called \"key money,\" or they pay something. But the United States should be reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money, because without the United States, they don't have anything-at least having to do with the 30 percent.</p><p>So I told him that. I think we're going to have-maybe a deal is going to be made. It's a great asset. It's a great asset. But it's not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States. So it will close down on September 15, unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal-an appropriate deal. So the Treasury of the-really, the Treasury, I guess you would say, of the United States gets a lot of money. A lot of money. Okay?</p><p>Q. Mr. PresidentFederal</p><p>Coronavirus Response/Hydroxychloroquine/Potential Alternative Treatments for Coronavirus</p><p>Q. Mr. President, can you explain why so many of the public health experts on the Coronavirus Task Force are contradicting you on things like why the virus is so widespread in this country, on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine? Why are so many of these people on your Task Force contradicting you?</p><p>The President. Well, I think we're doing a great job. I think we're doing great on vaccines. We're doing great on therapeutics. You'll be seeing that very soon. I think we're-when you look at a map, this is a map of the-I've got-I sort of shown that around a little bit, but that's-the red is the area of most concern.</p><p>[The President displayed a map of the t/.Y]</p><p>Pretty recent map of the-of the country. And there's a lot of people that-in a lot of areas that have gotten very-you know, better very fast.</p><p>Hydroxy has tremendous support, but politically, it's toxic because I supported it. If I would have said, \"Do not use hydroxychloroquine under any circumstances,\" they would have come out and they would've said, \"It's a great-it's a great thing.\" Many doctors have come out strongly in favor of it. They want it very badly. It's a great malaria drug.</p><p>So, for many yearsQ.</p><p>But in that-but Admiral Giroir says it's not effective.</p><p>The President. Let me finish my-let me finish my answer.</p><p>So for many years-it's, I guess, 60 years it's been a malaria drug; very successful, as you know. And it's been also a drug for lupus. And it's caused no trouble, virtually nothing, in terms of causing people to get sick or having problems with anything. You add the zinc and you add the azithromycin-the Z-Pak, as they call it-and it's been very-I happened to take it myself, the threesome.</p><p>I took it myself for a period of 2 weeks. I mean, I-I had no problem. I had no problem whatsoever. And, importantly, I, you know, didn't test positive. That's very nice. Okay? I'm very happy about that negative.</p><p>And so that's the story. It's very highly thought of. Interestingly, a great doctor, from what I understand, a great doctor from Yale feels very strongly about hydroxychloroquine. The Ford Clinic in Michigan came out with a very, very powerful paper saying it's very good. Many other-in France, as you know, they came out with a very positive statement. Many individual doctors have come out with very positive statements.</p><p>I will tell you that if I was surrounded by people, as I was at the time-the reason I took it: You know, we had some people that were relatively near me that tested positive. And I took it for that reason, just because I've heard good things.</p><p>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci/Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Global Coronavirus Outbreak</p><p>Q. But Fauci says it doesn't work. Admiral Giroir says it doesn't work.</p><p>The President. I don't agree with Fauci on everything.</p><p>Q. They're on your Task Force.</p><p>The President. I don't agree with Fauci. Look, Fauci didn't want-and I like him. I get along with him actually great. But he didn't want to ban people from China from coming into the country, and I overrode him, and I did the right thing. He was saying face masks are no good a short while ago. So it doesn't mean he's a bad person, because he's not. He's a good person; I like him. But we disagree on things. We disagree on things.</p><p>Now, I will say this: We've done an amazing job with ventilators. We're supplying the world with ventilators. Ventilators are very hard, very expensive, very hard to make, very complex. Very complicated machines. Very-very expensive.</p><p>Q. But why does theThe</p><p>President. Hold it. Hold it.</p><p>Q. But why does the U.S. have so many deaths?</p><p>The President. Hold it.</p><p>Q. The U.S. has so many deaths compared toThe</p><p>President. Hold it.</p><p>Q. -so many countries around the world. I-</p><p>The President. Fake news CNN, hold it. We have done a great job in this country. We haven't been given-and not me. I'm not talking about me. The Vice President, the Task Force have not been given the kind of credit.</p><p>If you look, countries all over the world are exploding right now-people that you said were doing a wonderful job, so wonderful. But right now take a look at the countries that are exploding: You have Italy back. You have Spain back. You have France back. You have Germany back. You have a lot of countries, and that's not to knock them.</p><p>It is a very delicate, very contagious disease. It was released by China. It should never have been allowed to release. There was the source where you could have stopped it. And they did stop it from going into China, although now they say that China is having a lot of problems. Moscow, in Russia, is having tremendous problems.</p><p>What China unleashed was a very, very sad situation. With all of that being understood, the United States has done an amazing job, a great job, and you're going to see that because we have vaccines and we have therapeutics coming very soon.</p><p>Yes, go ahead.</p><p>Economic Stimulus Legislation</p><p>Q. Mr. President, why are you not involved directly in negotiations with Capitol Hill?</p><p>The President. I am. Oh, why? The fact that I'm not over there with Crazy Nancy? No, I'm totally involved.</p><p>Q. Have you spoken with her?</p><p>The President. I'm totally involved. And we're going to be doing some things that are very good, because we don't think that she-look, what Chuck Schumer wants more than anybody- and I would say Nancy Pelosi would be second-they want to bail out cities and States that have done a bad job over a long period of time. Nothing to do with coronavirus or China virus, or whatever you want to call it.</p><p>They want to bail out cities and States. They want bailout money. They want to trillion dollars in bailout money, and a lot of people don't want to do that because we don't think it's right. The Democrats have run some very bad States and some very, very bad cities, and a lot of people don't want to give them a trillion dollars to reward them for doing a bad job.</p><p>If you look at some of the States-I won't insult anybody by naming those States, but you know what they are. They want bailout money. They're not interested in the people. They're not interested in unemployment. They're not interested in evictions, which is a big deal-the evictions. They want to evict. A lot of people are going to be evicted, but I'm going to stop it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to Executive orders, and we're looking at that very seriously right now.</p><p>But what the Democrats want, they want-they're slow-rolling it, and all they're really interested in is bailout money to bail out radical-left Governors and radical-left mayors, like in Portland and places that are so badly run. Chicago, New York City-you see what's going on over there. Bail out cities and States who have been poorly run and spent a fortune doing it, they want a trillion dollars, and we're really not interested in that.</p><p>Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>Q. What about the Postal Service, Mr. President? What about the Postal Service? Any message to your Postmaster General?</p><p>The President.

MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>(LEE GREENWOOD SINGING \"GOD BLESS THE USA\")</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we have a big program this morning.</p><p>Joining the conversation, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman, and \"The Wall Street Journal's\" wealth management reporter, host of the podcast \"Secrets of Wealthy Women,\" Veronica Dagher.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Good to be here.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, PODCAST HOST, \"SECRETS OF WEALTHY WOMEN\": Great to be here. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome. A lot to talk about.</p><p>And we have a big show in terms of our lineup. Also on deck this morning, the former CEO and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange is here. Dick Grasso joining us coming up to talk about September 11th and, of course, that big news this morning with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange making a bid for the London Stock Exchange this morning. Dick Grasso will be here.</p><p>Also joining us is former secretary of state and the co-author of \"To Build a Better World,\" author Condoleezza Rice, remembering this day 18 years ago. We will talk about foreign policy with Condi Rice this morning.</p><p>The chief investment officer of Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, you see here, Chris Hizy, to talk about the August producer price index and investing today.</p><p>\"Washington Examiner\" chief political correspondent Byron York to talk about John Bolton's exit from the White House.</p><p>And family medicine doctor Mihale Varshefski (ph) is here. Dr. Mike talking about the dangers of vaping. We keep seeing more stories about that.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big three hours coming up.</p><p>And, of course, we kick off this morning with the remembrance, a day we will never forget. That is September 11, 2001. The day the United States suffered its worst terrorist attack in history. Nearly 3,000 Americans died on that day in New York City, in Washington D.C., in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.</p><p>President Trump took part in a moment of silence -- he will take part in a moment of silence later today, traveling to the 9/11 Pentagon memorial. We will take that for you live when the president gets -- gets ready to -- to move.</p><p>But, of course, we have our own stories. We were there and we know we all have our own memories.</p><p>I want to point out this pin that I'm wearing this morning. This pin was given to me by Dick Grasso a couple of weeks after 9/11. And it signifies the number of first responders that died on that day because, of course, we know that as we were coming out or they were coming out, the Fire Department of New York was going in and the NYPD and the first responders. So I wear this today in honor and remembrance of their legacies.</p><p>James, what do you remember?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I didn't live in New York at the time. I was -- I actually lived near the Pentagon. But the -- the -- I think we all remember the heroism of the first responders. The security people in the towers, along with the fire and police who stayed in there trying to rescue people. And - - and we do appreciate that we haven't had, thank God, an attack like that since then.</p><p>And I think that gets into the current debate about Afghanistan. Do we -- do we need to stay there to prevent it or -- or is it time to come home? And that's something, obviously, the president's been wrestling with.</p><p>We'll talk about that with -- with Condoleezza Rice this morning as well.</p><p>Dagen, your thoughts?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: That we are in a -- it's a time for people who were too young or not even born to sit back and listen to the stories of people who were there, of families who lost loved ones, who lost parents, who lost siblings, aunts and uncles. And remember the heroism that day. The heroism of first responders, of the fire department, of police officers, but of everyday folks who put other people's lives ahead of their own.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Which is why I wanted to wear this pin because as you see this pin, it's a shot of the towers and then it says 343 across, that's 343, the number of firefighters who we lost. And then you've got 23, the number of NYPD, and, 37, the first responders. And it's -- Dick Grasso designed it after 9/11 and --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I mean I clearly have a hard time talking about it. It was here in New York and it was just -- it was terrifying. It was absolutely terrifying to -- for anybody in the city particularly because you thought the world was coming to an end.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I don't think that people who -- in this day and age, 18 years out, a lot of people in this country cannot get the heads around what the -- what the sacrifices that people made and the sacrifices that we will need to continue to make as a nation to ensure that we are never attacked in this way again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>I'll never forget Eric, the security guard at the New York Stock Exchange. Eric, I'm thinking of you today.</p><p>I was at the New York Stock Exchange. And I ran out after the first plane hit the first tower and I ran out to the corner of Wall Street and Broadway. And I stood there and I watched for the rest. And I was on air on CNBC and I was on the phone. And then when I went back to go back into the New York Stock Exchange, everything was boarded up. And I was covered in soot because I was outside.</p><p>And I stood there on the corner and it was an incredible moment when I was on the corner after the first plane went into the first tower. There were all these people around. There was all this comradery. People's phones weren't working. They were borrowing each other's phones to call family to say, we just saw a plane going into the first tower.</p><p>The guy next to me said, the world will never be the same. This is terrorism. And we didn't yet know that because it was --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We weren't sure if it was a small plane and -- but he said it. And we were all in shock.</p><p>All of a sudden, when the -- hour later, when the buildings collapsed, there was all this soot in the air and you had to keep your eyes closed because if you had your eyes open something was going to go in your eye. And I started running.</p><p>DAGHER: Wow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the New York Stock Exchange was all boarded up. So I -- I went across the street from the exchange, in the MetLife building. And they were -- it was a little overhang, so I was there with a lot of people and people -- and the group that I was with were screaming and crying and it was -- they were so nervous. We didn't know what was going on. And I looked at the stock exchange and Eric saw me. And Eric came out and was, what are you doing out here, and he pulled me back in. And I went inside and I reported for the rest of the day inside.</p><p>And then I took a walk outside with Bob Pasani (ph) later on in the day, when things had settled, and the soot and the dirt and the debris from the offices was just incredible. And I stayed at the stock exchange that day until 9:00 at night. And Bob and I walked to the 14th -- no trains were running.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bob and I walked uptown to the 14th Street train station. We got on the train. And we both when our -- went our ways.</p><p>My heart goes out to all of the families that lost loved ones and friends. I lost friends. You lost friends. We all lost people. It's terrible. The only thing we can do is honor their legacy and honor the people who went in and tried to help, like the first responders and the New York Police Department and the Fire Department of New York and cherish their legacy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And continue to protect the United States and honor the memories of people who sacrificed their lives by doing the right things in terms of protecting the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>So we will never forget.</p><p>And we have coverage this morning of all of the events going on across the country in New York, on Wall Street and at the Pentagon.</p><p>We also have breaking news this morning.</p><p>As we remember 9/11 and the New York Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has made an offer to acquire the London Stock Exchange. Reports are putting the offer's value at $36.6 billion. And, of course, we've seen consolidation in the exchange space already, Veronica. This would be a big deal, $36 billion.</p><p>We're going to have Dick Grasso coming up to react to this. But, clearly, well, in my experience at the stock exchange -- I started at the exchange in 1990 -- well, really it was 1989 when I was at CNN. But, at that time, there were 5,000 people on the -- on the floor of the exchange. There were five rooms and 5,000 people. Today, there's one room and about 500 people.</p><p>DAGHER: Right, and some people refer to it as a museum now, which is very odd, right? You take a tour rather than observe someone trading.</p><p>BARTIROMO: you can understand why there's consolidation in each -- in Hong Kong, China, (INAUDIBLE) London.</p><p>DAGHER: Absolutely. And -- right. You know, so much consolidation. So much automation. So many of those jobs, those trading jobs, are actually gone. And we've automated so much and will continue to automate in the future.</p><p>I think it also shows how powerful Hong Kong is and how much assets are there and the power of some of those companies looking to diversify across the world. So I think we'll see more consolidation. It will be interesting to see if the deal goes through.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see what London says.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because didn't -- the LSE just make a bid not long ago for Refinitiv for $27 billion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So that raises -- this bid off -- raises questions about that deal that the LSE was trying to ink with Refinitiv.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Are -- you could understand if you're in Hong Kong why you might want to diversify at this point, but I think it also tells you something about the enduring value of London as a financial center. Brexit, no Brexit, hard Brexit, soft Brexit. Obviously some people in Hong Kong think that London is going to be important for a long time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Knowing that we've got 28 years left in the, you know, autonomy that Hong Kong is supposed to have from China, well, I don't know, does that play into anything here with London thinking about getting acquired by Hong Kong, especially what we're seeing take place in the streets, this -- this overreach by China?</p><p>FREEMAN: Maybe if you're in London you would prefer an all cash offer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DAGHER: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: You know, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I -- you're serious. So am I.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't know, maybe -- maybe you're a little more optimistic after the decision to withdraw the extradition bill in Hong Kong. The regime -- Chinese regime, through its Hong Kong chief executive, pulling back a little. Obviously, not nearly far enough for the democracy activists there.</p><p>But, yes, it's a -- I think it's a -- it's a -- certainly it leaves to bet on the future of London though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A couple of other headlines.</p><p>We know that the U.S.-China trade story continues. China has announced certain U.S. products will be exempt from the retaliatory tariffs. And that includes soybeans and corn. The items most important to America's farmers are not on the select list. That's the -- the soybeans is -- that was questioning. People were questioning, why isn't soybeans on the list because that's such an important factor here.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>DAGHER: You know, our farmers are looking for some relief. Yes, they've gotten in some relief from the president. It's a really tough time. Every day, you know, anecdotally I see on FaceBook friends who had farms in the Midwest saying, you know, so and so is losing their farm, so and so is having pressure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, really?</p><p>DAGHER: Right. It's a very difficult time for some people. And so I think as this trade war goes on, it's good to see some reprieve here and there. But I think, overall, people are looking for some relief and long-term strategy to be happen sooner than later.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That would be one of the first things on the table, first things that I think Xi Jinping and President Trump would agree to, and that is China buying agriculture -- basically lifting the tariffs on our agricultural products, buying more down the road. There's a much taller list in terms of what needs to get done, stopping the intellectual property theft, stopping the forced surrender of technology, stopping the espionage.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is -- this is one of the -- if -- if a deal gets done, this is one of the first things that they'll hit on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the -- there was a story in \"Politico\" earlier this week that the agreement that China put on the table -- and we didn't get any confirmation about this -- but that it would be -- China would buy more agriculture. Take -- take those tariffs off. China would buy more agricultures if the U.S. lays off Huawei. I don't know if that's a deal that the president would -- would -- would go for. But we've got that this morning.</p><p>And also, of course, one of the big stories, the president ousted John Bolton. Cover story of all the papers this morning. The national security adviser, John Bolton, is out. The president said he's going to name a new one in the next coming days. We're going to talk about that as well.</p><p>But first less slip in this break. We have news on the explosion at the U.S. embassy in Afghanistan. Days after President Trump cancels peace talks with the Taliban, there's an explosion outside the embassy.</p><p>Then, Apple's latest offerings. What you can expect from the new iPhone 11. Plus, Apple's new low price subscription service.</p><p>All that right after this. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A rocket explosion near the U.S. embassy in Afghanistan, minutes into the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria, good morning.</p><p>Well, a plume of smoke -- you can see it here -- billowed over central Kabul shortly after midnight there. Nobody was hurt, luckily, but this is the first major attack in Kabul since President Trump canceled peace talks with the Taliban over the weekend. So far no one has claimed responsibility for this.</p><p>Well, back here at home, Charles Schwab is cutting about 600 jobs. The layoffs amount to roughly 3 percent of its San Francisco brokerage staff. These cuts happening as Schwab is dealing with the impact of lower interest rates and on profits.</p><p>Layoffs also hitting Uber. That rid share giant laying off 435 people from their engineering and product teams. That represents about 8 percent of that company.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) there's just a number of uninsured Americans has arisen for the first time in a decade. Federal data shows the number climbing to $27.5 million in 2018. That is a rise from 25.6 million back in 2017. Now, this end price (ph) driven by a drop in coverage under public programs like Medicaid. The number of people under private insurance didn't show much of a change.</p><p>You know, Maria, this data is interesting and, of course, crucial to watch because health care still is the number one thing on voter's minds right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sure is.</p><p>Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>All right, a quick break. When we come back, vaping dangers. More deaths from vaping-related illnesses as the FDA looks at marketing practices. We're going to tell you all about it when we come back.</p><p>And then shiny new Apple. The tech giant revealing its updated line of iPhones, watches and iPads. What investors are saying about that. The stock is up a fraction this morning.</p><p>We're back in a minute with all of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Apple taking center stage at Silicon Valley, unveiling an impressive line of new products and services yesterday. It was the annual product launch day. A lot of hype around that.</p><p>The technology giant debuted new iPhone and iPads. It also announced the creation of its own video game subscription service. Apple taking aim at Disney and Netflix with the new Apple TV Plus streaming service, undercutting all of them with price.</p><p>Let's talk all about it. Joining us right now is CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino.</p><p>Angelo, great to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>ANGELO ZINO, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, CFRA RESEARCH: All right, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What was the big take-a-way from your standpoint?.</p><p>ZINO: For us there were really two big take-a-ways. The first one, of course, being the lower price point on the iPhone 11. Very unlike Apple, them reducing the price from $750 down to $699. And, again, very unlike Apple. Typically they're, you know, in the hunt of increasing prices that actually helps offset some of the challenges in the broader semiconductor - - I'm sorry, the smart phone industry.</p><p>So that was interesting. We think it will help them in terms of the overall China market. That along with their trade-in program out there.</p><p>The second is the service side of things. Them pricing that Apple TV Plus service at $4.99. I think this buys them a lot of time. The fact that you can bundle that with the purchase of an iPhone 11, Apple TV, or iPad, get it free for a year at $4.99 I think is a great move by them.</p><p>And I think it's only the start. I mean clearly this gives them time to increase the content. Therefore, in a year from now, those investors or, you know, consumers that have that service now have the ability to kind of see what's next for Apple in terms of that content side of things.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I will add one thing. Apple had to price it at $4.99 a month because it's only coming -- going to have a handful of shows when it debuts in November.</p><p>ZINO: Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I think that the strategy is -- because, again, to point out, Disney Plus is going to be $6.99 a month when it shows up in November.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You get a lot more at Disney, though, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then Netflix is $12.99. That's kind of the standard package. Disney's going to give you Hulu and ESPN, plus Disney Plus for the price of $12.00. Apple is essentially trying to tell the customer, you don't need to choose between us and them, at least in the interim, until we can ramp up the amount of programming that we offer. They want it as an add-on rather than a choice of us or them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But look -- look at -- look at all the -- the products you get a Disney, though. I mean given all of those acquisitions. Pixar and Marvel and Lucas Films, the \"Star Wars\" franchise. So, you know, you're getting -- I mean the library is so extensive at Disney.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>ZINO: I think that's absolutely true. That being said, I think this really is a power move on Apple in terms of them trying to flex the ecosystem right? Them have -- being able to kind of combine the hardware side of things with the -- with the services business, I think, again, this is just a beginning for them. I think, over time, listen, they've only spent about $6 billion in terms of the actual content here. They can go a lot higher than that in terms of the amount they're spending. And I think they will here over the next couple of years.</p><p>DAGHER: Couldn't this cause, though, a pricing war to the bottom, though? When you start so low, it could bring the other competitors down conceivably.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I will add, I don't think so because there's no content right now on Apple. They're so little that -- that you're not -- you don't need to -- the competitors like a Disney, they don't need to compete on price.</p><p>FREEMAN: So -- so why would you buy it? You get a show with the Aqua man (ph) guy. I mean what is -- what is the -- what are you buying for $4.99 a month.</p><p>ZINO: Yes, no, I --</p><p>FREEMAN: And I think that's a great question -- I think that's a great question.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Reese Witherspoon, OK, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, James.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ZINO: Well, this is the thing.</p><p>FREEMAN: OK. All right. Well, those are -- those are big stars.</p><p>ZINO: Well, listen, I --</p><p>FREEMAN: So they're doing shows or -- you do shows for those guys.</p><p>ZINO: Well, this is the -- this is the thing, I don't think anybody doesn't buy it, right? And I think that's the reason they're bundling this for the first year. I think, at the end of the day, you're -- the $4.99 price point is what it is. But the people that are buying this are the ones that are -- are going to go out and buy an iPhone, that they're going to get the -- the Apple TV or an iPad and they're going to try that service as, you know, they're buying those hardware offerings. So I think this -- again, it buys them more time to kind of build up that library.</p><p>FREEMAN: This seems really so not Apple at all. I thought they were always second to the market but really with an impressive offering. It sounds like they're rolling out the video without much video content.</p><p>ZINO: Well -- well the -- so this is the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fake it till you make it.</p><p>ZINO: When we're talking about --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, that's not there.</p><p>ZINO: Well, when we're talking about content, right, it really takes time for them to build content, unless you're going out and making an acquisition, a big splash, to try to buy some of that, which is something they can do. I don't think it's in the DNA. I don't expect them to do that. But this is one of those things. They were very slow when it came to the Apple music side of things. A lot of people kind of thought they were going to fail on that side of things. They now have over 60 million paying subscribers.</p><p>So I think you've got to give them time and I think the approach they're taking is actually the right one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, and the TV device has never really kind of sky -- taken off. The TV device is not that great compared to the Amazon, the Fire and the Firestick.</p><p>DAGHER: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I -- listen, I have them all. I have every streaming service.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have virtually -- I have a Roku. I have the Apple. I have the Amazon device. And the Apple device is just not that good. And the Amazon content does really work through it, the Prime content. It's a way to deliver it, but it's a huge pain in the you know what.</p><p>ZINO: Right. And the other problem with the Apple TV actual hardware is the fact -- is the price point, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>ZINO: You can -- you can get it much cheaper --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ZINO: You know, on the Amazon side of things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick, a word about the earnings power of Apple. Here we are in the -- now ending the third quarter at the end of the month. We're going to have guidance in the end of the year. Any word on earnings from you in terms of the earnings power of Apple, what you're expecting in terms of earnings and fourth quarter performance?</p><p>ZINO: Well, overall, we think they're fairly safe here in terms of the September quarter and you're actually starting to laps some very easy comparables going into the December quarter and March quarter due to some of the challenges we saw in China a year ago. So our view is, even they you've got the lower price point starting on the iPhone 11, I think they're very safe here in terms of the upcoming quarter, as well as for the December quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Angelo, thank you.</p><p>ZINO: All right, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to get your insights this morning. We appreciate it.</p><p>Angelo Zino joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, a White House shakeup. John Bolton is out as national security advisor. What led to this exit? We will talk about it when we come back.</p><p>And then powering down. GameStop takes it pre-market hit. The stock is down 16 percent. We're going to go behind that number and tell you what's happening there.</p><p>And a stock alert. Dave and Buster's down sharply this morning. It cuts its annual earnings forecast. The stock is down 16 percent, as you can see there. My mistake, that's the one down 16 percent, Dave and Buster's.</p><p>We're going to have more on that when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, September 11th.</p><p>Your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast, we are remembering 9/11 this morning. Later this hour, we will see the giant flag unfurled at the Pentagon. We will take you there, live.</p><p>Next hour, we will reflect on the day that changed America forever with former New York Stock Exchange chairman Dick Grasso and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. We have a big show this morning, as we remember the legacies of those lost.</p><p>Meanwhile, we are watching market action this morning. Investors are watching some easing on China tariffs. Take a look at futures, indicating a higher opening for the broader averages. Dow Industrial's up 40 points, the S&amp;P just slipped into positive territory, up one and a half. And the Nasdaq is now also positive by just a quarter point.</p><p>This, after the Dow Industrials extended the winning streak yesterday, five days of gains. Take a look. Yesterday's move had the Dow up 73 points at the close, the S&amp;P was up one point, the Nasdaq was lower by three and a quarter points, yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this, and we start with the European indices, which are higher across the board this morning. Take a look at the F.T. (ph) 100 right now, up 68 points. And the CAC comp (ph) in Paris, up 26. The DAX index in Germany is up 94 points, that is three-quarters of one percent.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, mixed performances. Take a look. The Nikkei Average in Japan, up about a percent. The Shanghai in China was down half a percent, but Hong Kong was up one and three-quarters percent. As you know, we've been reporting Hong Kong is making a bid for the London Stock Exchange.</p><p>New concerns this morning over vaping after a sixth person dies from a related illness. We have the very latest on vaping.</p><p>We're cracking down this morning on a story on big tech. Bloomberg, reporting that the FTC is investigating Amazon over its marketplace. We know that the antitrust story around Google, it looks like this is going to broaden out.</p><p>GameStop is the stock to watch this morning. The stock is down, sliding after the company cut its guidance. That stock is down 16.5 percent on GameStop. We will tell you why, coming up.</p><p>All those stories, coming up this Wednesday morning. But out top story this half an hour, John Bolton is out as national security advisor. The president tweeted early yesterday that he disagreed with many of Bolton's suggestions, and asked for his resignation Monday night.</p><p>Bolton resigned with a two-sentence letter, saying this, \"I hereby resign effective immediately. Thank you for having afforded me this opportunity to serve our country.\"</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reacted yesterday at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: The president's entitled to the staff that he wants.</p><p>He should have people that he trusts and values, and whose efforts and judgments benefit him in delivering American foreign policy.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, SECRETARY OF TREASURY: The president's been very clear on this. The president's view of the Iraq War and Ambassador Bolton's was very different.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the \"Washington Examiner\" chief political correspondent, FOX NEWS contributor, Byron York. Byron, it is good to see you, as always. Thanks for being here.</p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to John Bolton, out?</p><p>YORK: Well, actually, Pompeo and Mnuchin looked kind of happy yesterday --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, they did, didn't they?</p><p>YORK: -- they -- yes, they were smiling big-time. Look, this was going to happen. The president and the national security advisor disagreed on too many big things -- around North Korea, the war in Afghanistan -- to make this a long-running relationship.</p><p>Now, he did -- Bolton did last 17 months there, which is no small accomplishment, sometimes, in this White House. But it does appear that this issue of the peace talks in Afghanistan really is what did it in the end. This -- Bolton opposed this -- the negotiations to reach an agreement with the Taliban that was being run by the State Department and Mike Pompeo.</p><p>And clearly, there were a lot of people who were appalled by the idea of actually inviting the Taliban to Camp David to finalize this deal. When word of that came out, I mean, there was really kind of an all-points bulletin in the conservative foreign policy world. You know, \"This can't happen. This has to be stopped.\"</p><p>So now, we've seen that Bolton has left. We've seen a lot of leaks, saying he was too abrasive, he was too aggressive, he was promoting his own views over the president's, and that sort of stuff. But, clearly, this was -- this was a relationship that was not going to last forever.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And I thought that the president liked to have different viewpoints around him.</p><p>YORK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He wants the hawks as well as the doves around him. So that's why it was a little bit of a surprise to me. But what do you think in terms of the successors here? Who would be a viable choice for his replacement?</p><p>YORK: Well, you're -- well, you're right about the president having differing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>YORK: -- wanting to have differing viewpoints around. I think he does like that. And if you look -- and I think we're going to see in some of the tick-tocks (ph) and explanations of this, that it did -- that this did relate to personal reasons, to arguments that people had, more than simply Bolton just disagreeing on the issues themselves.</p><p>Trump sometimes made fun of that. Remember that there was a time, the Irish prime minister was visiting, there in the White House, and Trump looks over to Bolton and said, \"Now, John, is Ireland one of those countries you want to invade?\" So, I mean, Trump kind of treated some of these disagreements with humor sometimes.</p><p>I think that we're probably going to have an un-Bolton-ish successor here, not sure who that's going to be. But the lessons are going to be, if you do disagree with the president, don't talk about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that's a good point.</p><p>North Carolina, the special election yesterday, Republicans winning twice last night, in the Tar Heel State. Greg Murphy won the GOP-leaning 3rd District, while Dan Bishop squeaked out a victory in the 9th District, due in part to President Trump and the support that he got from colleagues in the GOP. Your reaction to that special election, Byron?</p><p>YORK: Well, it's a big deal for Republicans. I mean, both sides will say, going in, that, you know, special elections don't mean that much, they don't predict anything. But why are they pouring so many millions of dollars and so much work into it? They want to win it.</p><p>And so Democrats hoped that if they could pick that seat up, if McCready could win in the 9th District, that would be a huge thing. The district, by the way, has been in Republican hands since 1963. So that would -- we would have seen endless stories about how this is kind of a forecast of disaster for Republicans in November 2020.</p><p>So what we saw, here, what was kind of interesting, McCready has now run twice and lost twice, last November, of 2018, and now. And he actually fell in a number of areas, between those two elections. And I think everybody believes that President Trump's visit on Monday night helped juice up turnout a bit as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It looks that way.</p><p>What about 2020? Can the House get back the majority? I mean, given all of these, you know, retirements that we're talking about every day, Byron?</p><p>Then there's these new polls from Univision at the University of Houston, finding that President Trump is losing in Texas against Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, along with Kamala Harris, Julian Castro and Cory Booker.</p><p>Now, look, I'm not a fan of some of these polls because I don't believe these polls. I didn't believe these polls on Election Night 2016. But you are seeing this narrative deepen, because of the retirements on the GOP side, that, \"Oh, you know, maybe this means that people don't believe the Republicans can gain back the House, and what about President Trump.\" What's your take on 2020 right now?</p><p>YORK: Well, I think the retirements do make Republicans winning back the House a really heavy lift. I mean, they were a huge factor in 2018. So that's clearly a problem.</p><p>As far as these polls, especially the one-on-one polls, are concerning. These are all hypotheticals right now. And what we basically have is a poll pitting Trump, who is a known -- a known quantity, versus this Democrat, who might be really great and people are -- at this point, are not prone to say that their minds are completely made up.</p><p>When you have a race between Donald Trump and a specific Democrat, and Republicans start working on that candidate to undermine him or her, then you get much, much better polling. But there's no doubt that there are several warning signs out there for President Trump. The Republican Party is far weaker in some suburban areas than it was a couple of years ago.</p><p>He has a lot of concern. And the states that really gave him the victory, narrowly --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>YORK: -- Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin -- I mean, there's no guarantee that they're going to do it again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But, I mean, look, these candidates on the stage, they're going to be on the stage tomorrow night. They couldn't be giving the president an easier path with these plans that we're hearing about, whether it's the Green New Deal or Medicare for All or Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax, which I equate to confiscation. So what about that?</p><p>YORK: And confiscation of guns, as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That -- good point.</p><p>YORK: I mean, you heard the president -- you heard the president saying this in North Carolina on Monday night, you know. \"A vote for a Democrat is a vote for a new socialist order.\" And I think you're going to hear that over and over and over again.</p><p>And you're right. The pledges that are being made in the Democratic primary right now --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>YORK: -- are going to stick with whatever candidate wins the nomination. So whatever he or she had to do to win the nomination, is going to stick with them for the general election. They won't be able to run away from it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll leave it there. Byron, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>YORK: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Byron York from the \"Washington Examiner.\"</p><p>Coming up, the dangers of vaping: a sixth person has died due to vaping- related illnesses. The FDA's new warning over marketing, coming up.</p><p>And then we are observing 9/11 all morning this morning. We are standing by for the unfurling of the American flag at the Pentagon at sunrise. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A live look at the Pentagon right now. Moments ago, the American flag, unfurled at sunrise. This is all part of the remembrance of the September 11th attacks, where America was changed 18 years ago. A beautiful shot of the American flag at the Pentagon right now.</p><p>The president just tweeted on the Federal Reserve, meanwhile. He said this: \"The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. Interest cost could be brought way down, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term. We have the great currency, power, and balance sheet...</p><p>\"The USA should always be paying the lowest rate. No inflation! It is only the naivete of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn't allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of 'Boneheads,'\" the president writes this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know what, the Federal Reserve's not in control of longer-term interest rates. And if we haven't noticed, longer-term interest rates have kind of gone up nicely in the -- in the last couple of weeks. The 10-year yield's now at 1.7, it was down to, what, 1.44. So, again, maybe that's a good sign about the health of the U.S. economy.</p><p>So it -- but we can't handle much higher interest rates in the United States because of our level of indebtedness --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He wants them cut. I mean, he wants --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, sure (ph) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- them zero or more, he said. He wants negative.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But short-term. But long-term, the Fed doesn't control long- term interest rates directly.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I think a zero rate is not the answer, we see that in Europe. But I think Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin should treat that tweet as an executive order, to immediately start refinancing our debt, lengthening the term along the lines that the president has suggested.</p><p>I think the secretary has talked about this, and full speed ahead.</p><p>DAGHER: I think the president's goal, obviously, is to keep the economy out of a recession, to boost growth. I mean, you talk to so many business leaders, their number one concern is trade. And that's what they feel is pulling down their businesses abroad and here.</p><p>So I think if we need to -- I think that needs to be the priority at the moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- and that certainly has impacted CapEx --</p><p>DAGHER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- and decisions from managers.</p><p>We'll take a short break. When we come back, the dangers of vaping: A sixth person has died due to the vaping-related illness. The FDA's new warning over its marketing, that's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Health officials, again, are urging people not to vape. This, as a sixth person has died in the United States, and it's being linked to lung disease associated with e-cigarettes, the death in Kansas raising even more concern about safety and industry regulation.</p><p>The CDC says that the number of possible vaping-related lung illnesses has more than doubled in the past week, to 450 cases in 33 states. Joining us right now is Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, also known as Dr. Mike. Dr. Mike, good to see you.</p><p>MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE: Good to see you --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- thanks so much for being here --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Yes, of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm sure you have plenty to say about this.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Yes. There's a lot to say, there's a lot to unpack. Health officials are really scrambling to figure out what's going on in these lung-related, vaping-related lung injuries. Because we can't certainly say that's it's because of vaping or e-cigarettes, but we certainly have a strong suspicion that that's what's going on.</p><p>What we're trying to figure out now is, is this vaping in general? Is it a specific product? Is it a specific chemical that's causing these injuries? We don't have an answer to that yet.</p><p>The two main suspects that we see a pattern emerging from, is THC vape- related products ,and those that have high levels of vitamin E acetate. It's a specific chemical that New York State Department of Health officials have sort of narrowed down as one of the main culprits as causing these injuries.</p><p>Now, what's concerning to me out of all of this? That it's happening in younger people, those who are otherwise healthy, don't have lung issues. And they're ending up in ICUs, they're ending up on breathing machines when they're otherwise healthy.</p><p>I mean, if the only thing that they're doing in terms of inhaling into their lungs, is vaping, that's likely to be the cause. I don't think we need a deep investigation to figure that one out.</p><p>DAGHER: It seems like it's skewing male in the deaths. Is that right? And do you have a sense of what's going on there?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: I think right now, it's so early to say, with only six deaths, it's a small number to say that it's one sex versus another.</p><p>What I don't like from the CDC -- and usually I'm a big fan of the CDC's actions -- is that they said, \"Look, we have these deaths, we have these injuries. Let's consider stopping vaping.\" What does that mean? What kind of warning is that? If we're in a building --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: -- and a fire alarm goes off, and they make an announcement, \"Consider evacuating the building,\" what are we supposed to do?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What does that mean? You're right, you're so right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: It really -- it's a confusing message. The American Medical Association, the \"Journal of American Medical Association,\" are very clear on this. We should stop vaping until we figure out what's going on.</p><p>When we have a salmonella crisis from lettuce or some other product, we make an announcement, \"Do not eat this product until we figure out what's going on.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we don't --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Why are we not doing this with --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- we don't say, \"Don't eat all chicken,\" so there's the difference. We say, \"Don't eat chicken produced by this producer\" --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Exactly, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- rather than, \"OK, nobody can eat chicken in the --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- \"entire United States,\" which is -- it does seem to be what might be happening with this, because a lot of these lung illnesses, apparently, are related to black-market THC products, black-market vaping products, not the mainstream e-cigarettes that you see in convenience stores.</p><p>So I'll put --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: No, that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what about Juul?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: -- that's a great critique. That's actually a really great critique --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: -- I think we should address that because all the major companies, Juul included in this, are coming out and saying, \"Well, look, the majority of these cases are THC-related, not our product. These are black-market products.\"</p><p>The majority of them are, and that is a pattern that is emerging. But to say that now we should excuse Juul from this and regular vaping products, I think it's too early to say that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So if teens are smoking -- basically, it's not smoking weed, but it is using -- the active -- a vaping device, a vaping pen to consume THC - -</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- or to get high, that's a lot of what we're talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look at these twelfth graders, vaping, 37.3 percent in 2018 --</p><p>VARSHAVKSI: Yes, these numbers --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where are the parents?</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- twelfth graders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where are the parents in all this?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: It's very easy to hide this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's very easy to get the access to --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- a vaping device, so --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: So that's -- that's the two major points that we're really trying to focus on now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Access, how are teens getting this? Are they ordering it online? Are they getting it in convenience stores that aren't being adequately policed?</p><p>And then the advertising principles of companies like Juul, they're being investigated. The FDA actually just sent them a very stern letter, saying that they have 15 days to act on why is it that they're going to schools, telling children that this is a safer alternative to smoking? That in the coming days, we're going to have 99 percent evidence that this is better than smoking.</p><p>We don't have that data. They don't have clearance from the FDA to do that. And we need to step in and stop allowing these companies to take a page straight out of big tobacco's playbook and get teens hooked on this product that's going to change their livelihood.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I will agree, I will say that, that this is clearly seen as a new market. It is a market of people who would have never smoked cigarettes, as -- but that is their --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: You're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the engine for their business.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: What they put forward into the marketing and into the mediasphere is, \"Oh, this is a smoking cessation product, we're trying to get people off of cigarettes.\" Well, that's great, but the majority of the people that are using this never smoked cigarettes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do they have to keep -- do they have to put the same warning labels on the vaping devices that they do on cigarette boxes? \"Smoking causes cancer\" --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: They don't have to do that. They have to warn that nicotine is a very addictive product --</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: -- because it is a nicotine component.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Dr. Mike, thank you.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good stuff from you.</p><p>Thank you, Veronica Dagher, actually, for joining us this morning.</p><p>DAGHER: Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to talk about that fantastic podcast that you have, \"Secrets of the Wealthy Women,\" that is a great one. Thank you for joining us this morning.</p><p>DAGHER: Thank you for having me, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sorry we didn't get to that, Veronica, joining us here.</p><p>Still ahead, former New York Stock Exchange chairman and CEO Dick Grasso is joining me, live, as we remember September 11th. The next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

He changed the perception and reality of sex in America. Iconic \"Playboy\" founder Hugh Hefner has died. We look back on his life and legacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>looking to reverse the tide in a rough week. His tax plan is out and he's planning an executive order on health care.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome back to EARLY START this morning. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs. It is 30 minutes past the hour.</p><p>The party is over. Breaking overnight \"Playboy\" founder Hugh Hefner has passed away at the age of 91. He died of natural causes at the \"Playboy\" mansion, surrounded by his family. Hefner was a true American icon.</p><p>ROMANS: He introduced the world to \"Playboy\" in 1953, building that company into one the most successful and recognizable American brands.</p><p>This morning tributes are pouring in for the man affectionately known as Hef. Jenny McCarthy, one of many celebrities who posed for \"Playboy,\" tweeting this -- of course she wasn't a celebrity before she did.</p><p>BRIGGS: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: It made her a celebrity. \"Rest in peace. Thank you for being a revolutionary and changing so many people's lives especially mine. I hope I made you proud.\" The #PMY94 meaning Playmate of the Year, 1994.</p><p>BRIGGS: Hugh Hefner survived by a wife and four children, CNN's Stephanie Elam has a look back at his remarkable life and career.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He was one of the original American \"Playboy\"s, a magazine tycoon who helped spark a revolution. One that challenged the nation's views on sexuality.</p><p>HUGH HEFNER, \"PLAYBOY\" FOUNDER: I have celebrated the romantic connection between the sexes. And that's part of what \"Playboy\" is all about.</p><p>ELAM: Hugh M. Hefner who liked to be called Hef was born in Chicago in 1926 and raised in what he said was a strict household by conservative Protestant parents.</p><p>HEFNER: I felt there was something more to life than the world I saw around me.</p><p>ELAM: In 1953, with just $8,000 the aspiring publisher produced the very first issue of \"Playboy\" magazine on the kitchen table of his Chicago apartment. The cover featured a photo of Marilyn Monroe and sold more than 50,000 when it hit newsstands in December of 1953. Hefner now had the funds to finance another issue and the \"Playboy\" empire was born.</p><p>HEFNER: Well, I have never really thought of \"Playboy\" as a sex magazine. What I've tried to do is create a lifestyle magazine for men.</p><p>ELAM: Hefner divorced his wife Mildred Williams in 1959 and during the early days of the magazine's success decided he would not only promote the fantasy he helped create but he would live it as well. Audiences got a taste of Hefner's good life in an early 1960s television show called \"Playboy's Penthouse.\"</p><p>HEFNER: Come on in and meet some of our guests.</p><p>ELAM: Having already established himself in Chicago, Hefner made the move out west. In the early 1970s when \"Playboy\" magazine was selling seven million copies a month he made his permanent home at the now famous \"Playboy\" mansion in Los Angeles. In 1989 Hefner uttered the two words many thought he'd never say again when he married Playmate of the Year Kimberly Conrad.</p><p>The couple had two children but separated in 1998. Hefner said he realized he was much happier as a bachelor.</p><p>HEFNER: I am essentially a romantic, so I think my life revolves and always has revolved around women.</p><p>ELAM: Hefner continued to live out the \"Playboy\" fantasy even in his later years. Often seen in his trademark silk pajamas surrounded by busty blonde lingerie clad women while hosting extravagant parties with celebrity guests. He even returned to television in 2005. This time sharing the small screen with three live-in girlfriends in the reality show \"The Girls Next Door.\"</p><p>In the late 2000s he began an on again-off again relationship with Playmate Crystal Harris, 60 years his junior. They tied the knot on New Year's Eve in 2012.</p><p>Hefner sold his beloved \"Playboy\" mansion for $100 million in 2016 on the condition that he be allowed to live there for the rest of his life.</p><p>Playboy and provocateur, Hugh Hefner wanted to make the world a happier, sexier place.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: What's your definition of obscenity?</p><p>HEFNER: Racism, war, bigotry, but sex itself? No. What a sad and cold world this would be if we weren't sexual beings. I mean, that's the heart of who we are.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[04:35:03] ROMANS: Hugh Hefner, 1926 to 2017, really one of those personalities that define the 20th century. Isn't it?</p><p>BRIGGS: No question about that. Iconic no matter what you think about him. And we are in interesting times when the president of the United States once was on the cover of \"Playboy.\"</p><p>ROMANS: That's true.</p><p>BRIGGS: That was in 1990. Now that cover a bit controversial in that Hugh Hefner's son was embarrassed by it in retrospect. But Hugh Hefner in his last final tweets encouraged people to donate to the America -- the One America Appeal, that's to provide hurricane relief. So --</p><p>ROMANS: Interesting.</p><p>BRIGGS: Interesting to see how we look back on his life.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. 35 minutes past the hour. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>unveiling his plan, his tax reform plan proposing the biggest overhaul in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is a once in a generation opportunity, and I guess it's probably something I could say that I'm very good at. Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Well, there's plenty in here for the wealthy and well- connected, by the way. And there are plenty of people that say the plan does favor the rich by eliminating the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. But most Americans will get tax cuts.</p><p>Let's be clear. Most Americans will get tax cuts. This is just a blueprint omitting some critical details that the tax writing committee will fill in. That could take months or longer. But here's what we know. For business, tax cuts, the corporate rate slashed to 20 percent. For individuals, a simpler tax code. The seven tax brackets we have now will be collapsed down to just three.</p><p>And we don't know the income ranges yet but tax writers will have to decide that, but we know it cuts the top rate to 35 percent. So the richest Americans would pay less. It also allows lawmakers to add, though, a fourth tax bracket above 35 percent if the president wants to make good on some suggestions he's had in the past, Dave, that he wants to raise taxes on the rich. So state tuned to that.</p><p>The lowest rate is actually a little bit higher. But the White House says most low income earners will not pay taxes because the plan doubles the standard deduction. Meaning, it won't tax the first $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples.</p><p>The plan in part doubles that deduction by eliminating personal exemptions along with most tax breaks. Two tax breaks are safe. You have mortgage interest deduction and the money you donate to charity. But student loan interest, medical expenses, state and local taxes all gone or deductions for those, all gone. That last one will hurt people in high tax and mostly blue states. A large majority of which are middle class.</p><p>Trump says the plan will benefit middle class families. We just don't know enough details yet to be able to give you an example of, like, a family of four making $100,000 would get X, you know. We don't have that map here.</p><p>Two things will help, though. Boosting the child tax credit and doubling that standard deduction. Losing the personal exemption, though, could take away some of those savings. Right now it reduces your tax bill by about $4,000 per person with that exemption.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon says bottom line nothing in this Trump tax scam for the middle class. Big fat giveaways for Trump and his friends, true or false?</p><p>ROMANS: Well, this is good for Trump and his friends. And when you look at -- I talked to a real estate Don Peebles yesterday who said this is great for entrepreneurs, this is great for real estate developers, great for people who are building condo, condo developments or buying and selling condos. It's good for them.</p><p>It is lower and simpler taxes, though, for everyone else. And the point of the president's sort of middle class miracle is that when you have these three tax brackets and you double extended deductions that's going to make it simpler and easier for people. And 25 percent income tax bracket for the middle of the spectrum.</p><p>But we don't know how much those people earn. We don't know -- they haven't decided yet what that income requirements are going to be.</p><p>BRIGGS: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: That happens with the tax writers.</p><p>BRIGGS: That's the big question. Why is the past-through rate so important? And how they'll enforce it also?</p><p>ROMANS: I don't know about the enforcement angle of that. That's a good question. The past-through rate is something that again is very good for entrepreneurs. It's good for people who maybe -- BRIGGS: Small business?</p><p>ROMANS: Have a small business. A lot of small business people. They have an LLC or limited liability partnership, an LLC Or LLP. And they are paying their taxes through the stated individual rate. So you lower that pass-through rate to 25 percent. Top rate was 39.6 percent in 2017 so that's a 14-point deduction or discount in your way of handling your taxes.</p><p>BRIGGS: But the enforcement I guess matters because you're not going to -- how do you make sure that people aren't using that to pay a lower rate? The rich aren't using that to pay a lower rate? Correct? Is that -- that's the question they have.</p><p>ROMANS: That's a good question.</p><p>BRIGGS: Create jobs.</p><p>ROMANS: You know --</p><p>BRIGGS: That's the chief argument here, right?</p><p>ROMANS: And look, then people in the business community say yes, with lower and simpler taxes for corporations and for small business this will be able to create jobs. What we have found and my colleague, Rana Faroohar, who's our -- you know, our chief -- one of our chief analysts on this, she works -- she's been making this point again and again, that the last 20 years, 30 years of tax cuts, when we've had tax cuts, they haven't spurred a bunch of job creation.</p><p>[04:40:15] And that's been something interesting that's happening to the economy. Why would this time be different?</p><p>BRIGGS: But this is reform, not just cuts so --</p><p>ROMANS: This is reform. You're right. This is reform, not just cuts. It's a very good point. What I see here looks like reform and I've been worried that they were going to end up just doing just tax cuts for business and then that would be it.</p><p>BRIGGS: No, it doesn't.</p><p>ROMANS: If they do this, this is reform.</p><p>BRIGGS: Does he have the votes? Time will tell.</p><p>All right. If Congress can't overhaul Obamacare, looks like <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is prepared to go it alone. Listen as he reveals a plan he believes will bring immediate relief to millions of Americans who can no longer afford skyrocketing health care premiums.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: And I'll probably be signing a very major executive order where people can go out across state lines, do lots of things, and buy their own health care. And the that will be probably signed next week. It's being finished now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Ironically it's Senator Rand Paul who has been pushing the idea of allowing insurers to sell policies in other states. The same Rand Paul who helped scuttle the Graham-Cassidy bill. If the president signs the order insurers would be allowed to sell policies in multiple states but they would only have to adhere to the regulations of their home state.</p><p>BRIGGS: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has no immediate plans to fire his secretary of Health and Human Services despite the uproar over Tom Price's use of private planes. The president, though, making it clear he's not pleased. Says he's awaiting more information before making a final decision on Price's future.</p><p>The embattled Health secretary offering up an apology to the president for the unnecessary distraction but did not offer his resignation.</p><p>ROMANS: A spokesman at HHS says Price is taking this criticism, quote, \"very seriously and to heart.\"</p><p>CNN has also learned EPA chief Scott Pruitt used private planes for government business this summer instead of flying commercial. We're told the EPA's general counsel approved those flight citing logistics.</p><p>BRIGGS: The Trump administration will dramatically reduce the number of refugees allowed to resettle in the United States. They plan to admit no more than 45,000 refugees in the coming fiscal year. That is less than half of what former President Obama proposed for the current fiscal year which ends Sunday.</p><p>ROMANS: The Trump proposal includes regional caps of 19,000 for Africa and 17,500 for the Near East and South Asia and the plan does not have a contingency to allow more refugees in if conditions deteriorate somewhere.</p><p>Democrats not happy about it. Maryland Senator Ben Cardin, ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, calls is a blow to America's standing as the premier global humanitarian leader.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. Ahead, basic necessities are still hard to find in Puerto Rico. Drinking water, cash, electricity in short supply. People are doing what they can to help the sick and needy. More from San Juan next.</p><p>[04:47:15] ROMANS: More than a week now since Hurricane Maria and the situation in Puerto Rico grows even more desperate. A major challenge right now getting critical supplies to people who need them. A shortage of truckers and the island's devastated infrastructure make it extremely difficult to move the aid from the port of San Juan to areas around the island.</p><p>BRIGGS: There are also new questions about a century-old law critics say is making it harder to get basic supplies to Puerto Rico. It's the Jones Act requiring all goods ferried between U.S. ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans.</p><p>ROMANS: There's a bipartisan push to get <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to suspend the Jones Act. The president is considering it but says not everyone is in favor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have a lot of shippers and a lot of people and a lot of people that work in the shipping industry that don't want the Jones Act lifted. And we have a lot of ships out there right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: All right. But the Department of Homeland Security says a waiver may not make a difference since the issue isn't getting the supplies to the island, it's getting those supplies off the ships and distributing them.</p><p>BRIGGS: As for the recovery, Puerto Rico's power authority says generators on the island are operational but 80 percent of the transmission system and the entire distribution system were damaged. About 44 percent of the island still without drinking water.</p><p>ROMANS: And many ATMs are out of cash. At least half of all bank branches remained closed probably there aren't enough drivers to ferry cash around in armored cars. For those who can get to them, more than 500 gas stations are operational. Police say 53 people have been arrested for looting or theft since the hurricane.</p><p>BRIGGS: People are doing everything they can to treat the sick and injured but resources are extremely limited making quality care really hard to come by.</p><p>We get more now from CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who's in San Juan.</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christine and Dave, we've made our way into this makeshift medical tent, essentially a tent set up in the middle of San Juan to try and take care of patients.</p><p>This is what's necessary right now. This is part of what is known as DMAT, Disaster Management Assistance Team. And I can tell you, many of the team members here, the nurses, the doctors, the medics, they've been busy for the last couple of months. They were in Louisiana after Hurricane Harvey, they were here in Puerto Rico during Irma, and they are back again now after Maria.</p><p>Talking to the -- one of the doctors here, they say that this is the worst that they have seen and they expected more and more patients to be coming in here as the patients are able to actually leave the areas where they live and make their way closer and closer to big cities.</p><p>It's unclear right now just how many people have been affected. But keep in mind, Christine and Dave, even before these storms, Puerto Rico was a tough place medically. A third of the adult population reported to be in poor health.</p><p>[04:50:04] They have a significant elderly population here and lots of lots of chronic disease which they think is going to be the big problem here if those people can't get access to care.</p><p>Christine and Dave, back to you.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, Sanjay. I'm glad he's there. You know?</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: He can be the eyes and ears on the ground there.</p><p>BRIGGS: Things are coming along. Just slow.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. 50 minutes past the hour. Lawmakers asking some big tech companies to testify about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Facebook is on this least. Who else? CNN Money Stream next.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. CNN reporting exclusively that people in Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, were targeted in at least one of the Facebook ads bought by Russians during the 2016 campaign.</p><p>[04:55:07] The ad referenced Black Lives Matter. Sources say it was meant to appear both as supporting the group but could also be seeing as portraying them as threatening to some residents.</p><p>BRIGGS: The ad first appeared in late 2015 or early 2016 as a Russian affiliated troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency tried to sow political chaos in the U.S. Facebook has said about a quarter of the 3,000 ads bought by the agency were geographically targeted but did not reveal the specific locations.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. A motorcycle officer in Indianapolis is recovering this morning from a broken ankle after getting into an accident while escorting <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to the airport. The crash took place yesterday after the president wrapped up his tax reform speech. Officer Robert Turner winding up on the shoulder, on the left side of Interstate 70 with his bike on the other side. An ambulance traveling in the motorcade was brought up to treat this officer.</p><p>The White House says the president spoke to Turner, wished him well and thanked him for his service.</p><p>BRIGGS: A rockslide on the face of Yosemite National Parks' El Capitan, killing one person and injuring another. Park officials say at least 20 climbers were on the wall at the time.</p><p>It's the height of climbing season right now. Pictures posted on social media show billowing white dust moments after the crash. El Capitan is famous for its near vertical clips in one of the most popular crimes in the world.</p><p>It is a stunning sight indeed. Scary.</p><p>ROMANS: Authorities on the pacific island nation of Vanuatu ordering the evacuation of the entire population of one of its islands because of a volcano that is threatening to erupt. As many as 15,000 people live on that island. They've been ordered to leave by plane or boat. Signs of activity from Manalo volcano began earlier this month. The alert level was raised to four. The second highest threat level just last weekend.</p><p>All right. 56 minutes past the hour. Let's check on Money Stream this morning. Global stock market mixed today after a good day for U.S. tax yesterday. Good day because of tax reform. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>releasing a blueprint yesterday.</p><p>We need more details, I'm going to be clear here. But this does propose tax cuts for companies and small businesses. That boosted bank stocks. Right now U.S. futures, though, the day after, a little bit lower.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter may testify about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Lawmakers asking executives to attend a public hearing next month. The topic how foreign nationals used their platforms to influence the election. That's according to three sources familiar with the matter.</p><p>Facebook admits to selling ads to Russian troll farms and Twitter is expected to disclose similar findings on Capitol Hill today. Facebook, Twitter and Google have not answered the invite yet and did not immediately respond to request for comments.</p><p>America's inequality problem getting worse. The richest 1 percent of families control a record amount of U.S. wealth. About 39 percent last year. That's nearly twice as much as the bottom 90 percent of earners. And their slice has only gotten smaller over the past year. The slice of the bottom of 90 percent. That's from a new report from the Federal Reserve.</p><p>But also found the richest Americans earn more overall. Paints a stark picture of inequality in the U.S. Even the Fed acknowledges that wealth distribution has grown increasingly unequal in recent years.</p><p>BRIGGS: So the question will be, do these tax cuts reform help or hurt that?</p><p>ROMANS: Right. Right. That's the lead. And we don't --</p><p>BRIGGS: Tough to know at this point?</p><p>ROMANS: Tough to know. This is the tax reform is a framework. The tax writers are on the committees --</p><p>BRIGGS: By design, though, right? ROMANS: By design you'll have to fill it out so they're still a lot of questions. But we can tell you this is the first attempt at tax reform of this level in some 30 years.</p><p>BRIGGS: But compared to health care, the president was master of details yesterday, in comparison to health care where he took away from --</p><p>ROMANS: He talked about this being a legacy. He really wants to get this done.</p><p>BRIGGS: He did mention legacy. No surprise there.</p><p>All right. EARLY START continues right now with what this tax reform means, and remembering Hugh Hefner.</p><p>Remembering Hef. Hugh Hefner has died. We look back on the life and legacy of the \"Playboy\" icon.</p><p>ROMANS: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>looking to reverse the tide in a rough week. His tax plan is out and he's planning an executive order on health care.</p><p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs. Good to see you, my friend. Good to see all of you. Thursday, September 28th. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p>We begin with the breaking news overnight. \"Playboy\" founder Hugh Hefner has passed away at the age of 91.

I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Tonight, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Senator Lindsey Graham, and we'll pay tribute to Civil Rights icon, the late John Lewis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, my open.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's never been a more important time to come together as a nation. This is not about being left or right. It's time to recognize the Chinese Communist Party's strategy is to become the world's superpower by putting a stranglehold on America.</p><p>Tonight, that stranglehold has put America at a tipping point as we remain under attack from the deadly virus that the Chinese Communist Party has allowed to escape China, effectively unleashing and seeding the virus upon America and the world and then lying about it.</p><p>Let me be straight with you. The virus imported from Wuhan, China has already taken over 137,000 American lives, sent over 40 million Americans to the unemployment line, triggered the expenditure of trillions of dollars to avoid complete economic collapse and tested the American spirit like never before.</p><p>To win the battle against this deadly virus. We know what's required: masks, social distancing and cleanliness. Along with those personal responsibilities, the Trump administration continues to move at operation warp speed to get vaccines, therapeutics, testing, and personal protective equipment needed for this battle.</p><p>But as we fight together, we cannot let the negative emotions directly caused by the unleashing of the China virus to tear us apart.</p><p>Come along with me and see if this makes sense. Example, many are legitimately mad, angry and depressed because they've been locked down in their homes. Many are anxious because of lost jobs or businesses that they know will ultimately fail.</p><p>Many are desperate because of the inability to pay rent, mortgage or credit card debt. Many are even fearful of becoming infected with the virus itself.</p><p>Many parents working from home thrown into the job of teaching their own children are frustrated as the teachers unions push back on schools reopening.</p><p>Many churches and religious institutions are off limits, while marijuana dispensaries and liquor stores are open as essential businesses. Many are unable to work out because of the refusal to allow gyms to reopen.</p><p>And many grandparents, isolated, as children and grandchildren are not allowed to visit for fear of infecting them.</p><p>These are all predictable and understandable reactions and emotions brought on by the China virus that has now teed up Americans to deal with issues than in another time, we might have dealt with differently.</p><p>Like the burning and looting of our cities because of racial unrest, the gunning down of innocent children in war zones like Chicago, Minneapolis, Baltimore, and now New York. Protests devolving literally into a Cultural Revolution as statues are torn down, businesses are burned to the ground, religious institutions are vandalized as anarchists attempt to literally erase our history. Like the rise of mindless mobs that would rather burn our history books than read them.</p><p>This cancel culture has declared war on free expression and our First Amendment rights. This isn't just a blip in our history, Americans go on a bit nuts. This is American self-immolation and self-destruction. It is the achievement of the goal of the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>So what now? We cannot fight in a partisan way. A house divided against itself cannot stand. This nation is in the fight of its life with the Chinese Communist Party that in addition to the virus has ripped us off for decades.</p><p>Last week, Attorney General William Barr delivered one of the most powerful speeches of a rising China ever delivered by an American government official.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics, currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisition, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks and industrial espionage.</p><p>About 80 percent of all Federal economic espionage prosecutions alleged conduct undertaken for the benefit of the Chinese state. And about 60 percent of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: We've heard about this for years from President Trump. Free trade and a friendly America that previously allowed a mercantilist and authoritarian China to use banks and financial markets of Hong Kong to suck the jobs and capital and lifeblood out of America to the Chinese Mainland.</p><p>Americans made the sacrifice because we wanted to support Hong Kong's freedom and democracy. However, the passage of the single law, the Chinese Communist Party canceled all freedom and democracy in Hong Kong.</p><p>It was certainly no accident that the Chinese Communist Party used the distraction of the global pandemic to make its reprehensible move on Hong Kong. It's well known historical MO, turn your back on them, their military will invade. Take your eye off the ball, and they will steal whatever they can.</p><p>A.G. Barr had it right when he said China's intent is not to trade with our companies, but simply raid them and steal intellectual property and trade secrets that make this nation so strong and our work force so prosperous.</p><p>It's time to recognize that Communist China has had a continuous and relentless attack upon American workers. They have been successful because of the collaboration of American corporate and financial interests that have effectively lobbied on their behalf.</p><p>And Hollywood has agreed to change characters and alter their movies to please the Chinese Communist Party. American Big Tech companies have allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence, helping the Chinese party build the Great Firewall of China, according to Bill Barr, the world's most sophisticated system for internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>So let us never forget, as we experience these turbulent times, that it was the Chinese Communist Party that lied and allowed this virus to spread and is now tearing our very society apart. As hard as they may lobby to be recognized as a peaceful sovereign nation, during the pandemic they hoarded the masks for themselves, and then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, and shipped often defective equipment, and then required foreign leaders to thank Beijing for the shipments.</p><p>Let us never forget that this nation, the world's greatest superpower, will be on its knees to this regime if we don't immediately take our medical supply chain from them.</p><p>China is our largest supplier of medical devices. Why? America also depends on the Chinese supply chain, especially pharmaceuticals. Should China decide to limit or restrict these supplies, we are in trouble.</p><p>Let us never forget that America, as she fights within herself must understand that we are now in the fight of our lives with the Chinese Communist Party that has ripped us off for decades, and now wants to take America down for good.</p><p>And that's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter #JudgeJeanine.</p><p>And remember, if you like my opens, you're going to love my new book, \"Don't Lie to Me.\" It's in stores in September, but you can preorder your copy today.</p><p>Here with reaction to my open and much more, White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. Good evening. I don't call you Congressman anymore. Do I call your Chief of Staff or just Chief?</p><p>MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: You can call me Mark, how about that? That's what I'd prefer. But Judge, great to be back with you and you know, you were spot on with your monologue.</p><p>When we look at the enemy and what China and really the China government did to the American people by hiding the facts, we're having to pay the consequences for their lack of transparency, and the American people are just not going to sit back and take it and I can tell you, this President is not going to do that either.</p><p>PIRRO: Well, you know, the President has repeatedly for the past, ever since he's come into office, talked about the imbalance in terms of trade.</p><p>And just recently, the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, and the sweeping Executive Order calls for various sanctions and restrictions against China as a result of what it did to Hong Kong. Can you give us an idea of what those restrictions are?</p><p>MEADOWS: Well, basically, it is trying to make sure that Hong Kong doesn't get special preferential treatment. We're going to treat them just like we would any other City in China, but more importantly, this President is willing to tackle it because what they're saying is, is that they don't value freedom and democracy.</p><p>We see that from the way that they've conducted themselves not only with regards to the transparency in this virus epidemic that we're now facing before, it's in every city, across the country, and indeed around the world.</p><p>But we also see it in the way that Attorney General Barr laid out. When they look at it stealing our intellectual property, when they -- they really are not being good corporate citizens. And I can tell you, this President is willing to negotiate with them, but he's also willing to hold them accountable if they're not willing to live up to the deal, as he has put forth.</p><p>And so I can tell you, I get to hear it each and every day where this President says, why have previous administrations not addressed China and their takeover of American businesses and property?</p><p>And so we've just got to make sure that we hold them accountable and the President's willing to do that.</p><p>PIRRO: And you know, before I get to John Lewis, I just want to ask you one more question. The other administrations seem not to care or not to recognize the deficit, certainly in terms of trade, and the President got a good trade deal, and that it all went kaput when the virus was unleashed.</p><p>And unfortunately, as a result of that, we now still, though have businesses and technology companies within the United States, who are, as I said, in my open, effectively lobbying for China.</p><p>MEADOWS: Well, they're lobbying for China and I think more importantly, it is time that we act as Americans and bring back a lot of our supply chain from overseas.</p><p>We found that -- you mentioned about some of that personal protective equipment that was sent to other countries. It was defective. I was talking to an ambassador of the other day, and they said a lot of what they got from China was not only overpriced, but it was under quality in terms of every standard you would look at.</p><p>And you're right, they are asking for others to applaud them in their effort.</p><p>This President is not going to stand up for it. This administration is not going to do that. And so you'll see additional actions that are coming as we start to bring back that manufacturing, protect American jobs and make sure that we hold China accountable.</p><p>PIRRO: Well, it clearly has been a priority of this President. But let's move on to the death of the Civil Rights icon, John Lewis. You worked with him. What are you feeling today? What is the impact in Washington and on America?</p><p>MEADOWS: Well, obviously, you're right. He is a Civil Rights icon. I did have the honor and privilege of serving with him in the House of Representatives and literally, the icon that he is, you would think that he was very understated if you met him in person, always engaging, always willing to take time to talk to students when they would come to visit.</p><p>But I think for most people, it's a reminder, if we're willing to stand for what we believe in, and we're willing to be steadfast in that belief that we'll be remembered not just for what we did, but we will be remembered long after we die for the difference we've made and I only hope and pray that it can be said of so many of us that we can make a real impact on behalf of our fellowmen.</p><p>PIRRO: You know, as you think about him and the fight that he waged, you know, alongside Martin Luther King. You have to wonder how frustrated he might have felt at the end of his days as to what was going on in America. It's as though, on the streets of America, I mean, did he feel -- do you think he had a feeling that, you know, more needs to be done or this was a fight that was already waged?</p><p>MEADOWS: Well, I think, you know, for John, I don't know that I can speak on what he was thinking in these last days. He's been battling, obviously, an illness that ended up consuming him.</p><p>But what I will say is for the vast majority of Americans, what we can support is peaceful protesters who are willing to stand up for a cause. What we won't tolerate and what we shouldn't tolerate is the anarchy that we continue to see in some of our cities across the country.</p><p>You know, even tonight in in the streets of Portland and other cities, where tragically, it is not about a peaceful protest with a message. In fact, many times it's hard to even describe what the message is. But the other thing that is still troubling that we have to come to grips with is the senseless killing that continues to happen in our major cities where we have kids and grandkids that their lives are taken too early for senseless gun violence that honestly has become epidemic in some of our larger cities.</p><p>We've got to make sure that law and order is restored there. I can tell you that General Barr and the President of the United States are fully engaged. You'll see more on that in the coming days.</p><p>PIRRO: All right. Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, great to have you on. Your first time on JUSTICE as Chief of Staff. Good to have you back.</p><p>MEADOWS: Great to be with you, Judge. Thanks so much.</p><p>PIRRO: Thank you. And coming up. Is it safe to send your kids back to school in just over a month? Dr. Robert Hariri is here tonight with new information.</p><p>And next, what does F.B.I. Director Christopher Wray have up his sleeve? Senator Lindsey Graham, next.</p><p>PIRRO: Developing tonight, newly classified documents shine a new light on the Dems ridiculous Russia narrative and the infamous Steele dossier.</p><p>South Carolina Republican and Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham joins me with the latest on this. Senator, welcome back. All right.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you.</p><p>PIRRO: Senator, yesterday, you unearthed previously, undisclosed F.B.I. documents that would shed new light on the F.B.I., and it's not always honest assessment of what they knew and when they knew it. Hit us.</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, number one, I want to thank Bill Barr for declassifying these documents so the American people can read them for themselves.</p><p>So there's two documents. One is a 40-page memo written by an Intel analyst and a case agent who interviewed the Russian sub-source who prepared all of the information for the Steele dossier, the guy who put the dossier together. That 40-page memo shreds the reliability of the dossier.</p><p>In that 40 pages, they talk about, it's all bar talk. It's all hearsay, none of it is firsthand. Why is it important? That document -- the dossier -- was continued to be used by the F.B.I. months after this interview to get two more warrants against Carter Page.</p><p>I'll be shocked if somebody does not go to jail now for defrauding the FISA Court, because those people who submitted the warrant application in April of 2017 and June of 2017, months after the interview of the sub-source saying it was all garbage, they should be real good candidates to go to jail.</p><p>PIRRO: Right. Real good candidates for previously uniform stripe jumpsuits which I hear, orange today, but whatever. Orange is the new black.</p><p>GRAHAM: Whatever, I'm not up on prison fashion. That's right.</p><p>PIRRO: But the sad part is those subsequent warrants signed by the FISA Court were, I believe six months apart. So they had them for a significant amount of time, they had that information. We kept going back.</p><p>GRAHAM: Exactly.</p><p>PIRRO: One of those people -- yes, one of those people was Rod Rosenstein.</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes. Rosenstein said he didn't know anything about it. But remember, the dossier was crucial to getting a warrant against Carter Page. McCabe said without the dossier, there'd be no warrant and Horowitz, the I.G. said, it was the critical piece of information that allowed a warrant to be issued.</p><p>In January of 2017, after three days of interviewing the Russian sub-source who prepared the dossier, he shreds the reliability of it. A 40-page memo was written by the F.B.I. Intel analysts and here's my question. To the Intel analysts in the case agent -- who did you tell about this stunning development? Who did you provide the memo to? Did you tell anybody above you?</p><p>Oh, by the way, the dossier is a bunch of garbage, and how could it be used in April and June months after this interview? Because the people who did it months after this interview, if they knew it was unreliable, they will be going to jail and I can't believe that the case agent and the Intel analyst wrote a 40-page memo and never told anybody about it.</p><p>PIRRO: Well, wasn't that their MO? And you know, to this day, I can tell you that most of the viewers who are watching and listening right now are saying, okay, we knew it. We didn't know what you have unearthed, but that's more evidence. When are they going to jail?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, here's what I think. Durham is looking at this. The next witness I want to call is the Intel analyst who put the memo together. It's a 40-page document that shows that the dossier is a bunch of garbage, all hearsay.</p><p>I want to ask him and the case agent who interviewed the Russian guy, who did you tell in the F.B.I.? It's impossible for me to believe that McCabe and Comey who got briefed regularly about Crossfire Hurricane did not know about this.</p><p>I have a hard time believing that the second document that was released, is comments by Peter Strzok, February 15th, 2017, saying there was not any evidence that a member of the Trump campaign was talking or working with the Russians contrary to what \"The New York Times\" article allege.</p><p>So what did we learn from these two documents? \"The New York Times\" is corrupt as hell when it came to reporting on Trump.</p><p>PIRRO: Just like that guy on the right, but anyway, I want to ask you something. \"The Wall Street Journal\" today talked about the fact that Christopher Wray is bringing in a new counsel, a general counsel for the F.B.I., a guy by the name of, I believe it's Jason Jones, and the only reference in \"The Wall Street Journal\" article is that this is Christopher Wray's -- a former partner from his old law firm.</p><p>Well, we did a little research here and we had some source who says not only is this guy that Christopher Wray -- who I've always thought was in the Deep State anyway -- that this guy that they're bringing in is a partner with Rod Rosenstein in the firm of King &amp; Spalding.</p><p>And Rod Rosenstein, the guy we just talked about who went and got warrants on totally unverified information that he knew was unverified. Now, Christopher Wray, head of the F.B.I. is bringing in another partner for Rod Rosenstein's firm and Sally Yates's firm that \"The Wall Street Journal\" didn't get and Christopher Wray didn't divulge.</p><p>I mean, this is just more Deep State. It's frustrating. Your reaction?</p><p>GRAHAM: I'll get back with this. First, I've heard about it. I will get back with you. You raised a lot of questions that need to be answered.</p><p>PIRRO: Well, King &amp; Spalding, it's not just where his friend worked, but it's where Rod Rosenstein and Sally Yates worked. Very quickly on John Lewis. Your thoughts?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, John, was known for causing good trouble. That's what he described the Civil Rights movement, good trouble, peaceful protest, being hitting the head for a worthy cause. That's different than what you see playing out in the streets of the United States.</p><p>I think John Lewis loved America. He wanted to make it better. What you see happening today is people who hate America and want to change it. Big difference, but he will be missed.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, Senator Lindsey Graham, so good to have you on JUSTICE. Thanks so much.</p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you.</p><p>PIRRO: All right. The facts on coronavirus and schools reopening with Dr. Robert Hariri still ahead and how big are the risks for your family?</p><p>But first, should the President's supporters be worried about the shakeup in his reelection campaign? Dan Bongino and senior adviser to the Trump 2020 team, Corey Lewandowski joins me next to put things in perspective.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening and live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York.</p><p>Civil Rights icon John Lewis is dead. Lewis died Friday night, losing his battle with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The flag over the U.S. Capitol is flying at half-mast in honor of the man who represented Georgia's fifth district for 17 terms.</p><p>Lewis was the last of the major Civil Rights activists led by Martin Luther King, Jr. Lewis became a national figure when he led 600 protesters across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama back in 1965. He was knocked to the ground and beaten by State Troopers. What became known as Bloody Sunday resulted in the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p><p>Lewis won a number of accolades over the years perhaps one of the biggest coming in 2010 when President Obama hung the Presidential Medal of Freedom around his neck.</p><p>President Trump tweeting that his prayers were with the family. John Lewis was 80 years old.</p><p>PIRRO: A big shakeup in the Trump 2020 campaign this week. But we've seen this before with quite interesting results.</p><p>Here to discuss that and more, former Trump's 2016 campaign manager and current senior adviser to the Trump 2020 campaign, Corey Lewandowski along with Fox News contributor, Dan Bongino.</p><p>Welcome back, guys. Good to have you on tonight. I'll start with you, Corey. I remember, it was during the 2016 campaign that the Trump campaign went from you to Manafort to Kellyanne Conway and it was even later in the election year, and everyone was saying that campaign is imploding, it's all over. The handwriting is on the wall. You put that together with the polling numbers and it's all over for Trump.</p><p>What's your take on what's going on now?</p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: You know, Judge, this is just the media's overreaction once again. The difference here is, you know, Brad Parscale, who we all recognize as a digital expert, someone who built the campaign's digital operation in 2016 is now refocused on that in 2020.</p><p>And Bill Stepien, who was part of our team in 2016, was serving as the Deputy Campaign Manager is overseeing the day-to-day operations. He is a phenomenal tactician. He understands strategy at the state based level. He is going to focus on the grassroots activities, which is what's going to propel this President to victory with the help of Brad Parscale. So this isn't a major shakeup, unlike what the press wants to report.</p><p>PIRRO: And it's even earlier in the campaign season, and interestingly enough, it's very similar, though, and it all worked out for the best in 2016, didn't it, Corey?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: You know, Judge, that's exactly right. It worked out very well for candidate Trump in 2016. It's going to work out even better for President Trump in 2020.</p><p>There's a long time in this race. We've got over 108 days to go right now. There's a lot of things including Joe Biden is still hiding in his basement. So once he comes out, the race is going to start. Once we start the debates and Donald Trump destroys Joe Biden on that debate stage, the American people will see just how strong this President continues to be.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, Dan Bongino, what's your take on those -- on claim that the Trump campaign is imploding?</p><p>DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well I mean, listen, how many times we heard, the end is near. What's the favorite, Corey? The walls are closing in, right?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: The walls are closing in.</p><p>BONGINO: Every day. That's it, the walls are closing in and everything. Come on. I mean, I don't take any of that stuff seriously, but on the polling in 2016, the phenomenon, Judge of the you know, quote, \"hidden Trump voter\" is very real. I ran in that cycle and I lost when I ran for Congress. But I ran in Florida. And I get a walk list of Republican voters.</p><p>I walk by all of these houses with Trump signs, and they weren't on my list. I said, this can't be -- my walk list has to be wrong. So Corey, you know, I can see you shaking your head.</p><p>So what would happen? I knock on the door and say, hey, you're not on my -- do you vote? Never. Are you voting now? You're damn right I'm voting now. It would take a nuclear war to keep me away from the polls. This is my first time and I'm voting for Trump. Judge, I'm telling you, that last phenomenon was real.</p><p>On my podcast the night before the election. I said if Trump loses Florida, I'll jump off a bridge. I knew he was going to win Florida because I knew those voters were out there.</p><p>The only question is do they show up again? And I think based on voter intensity, there is a pretty good chance they do.</p><p>PIRRO: Well, not only do they show up again, I've got to tell you, there's even more reason for them to be quiet -- more quiet than they were in 2016. You can get the hell beat out of you if you show up in a MAGA cap in this crazy world we're living in and I want to stay with you, Dan, for a second.</p><p>In this crazy world and the Democrats cities as things are absolutely exploding, especially the Democrat-held cities. What impact is that going to have on the election?</p><p>BONGINO: It's going to be devastating for Biden. I mean, listen, you can frame it any way you want. But chaos is not a message, okay? And Biden was crystal clear in that interview. Corey heard it. You heard it. I heard it.</p><p>When asked if they were -- if he was willing to take money away from the police. He said yes. Just go watch the interview. People act like YouTube and video players don't exist. Chaos is not a message. President Trump is clearly the public safety candidate. Biden is a chaos guys. It is as simple as that.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, and Corey, what we're looking at in the right of the screen are New York City cops. There was a peaceful protest on Wednesday with the black and Hispanic clergy along with the NYPD marching together and of course, these instigators got involved and started creating all kinds of hassles, getting the highest ranking uniformed officer in New York City assaulted.</p><p>The individual who was arrested for that was let out on bail almost immediately. What impact will this have on the election?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Judge, they were actually let out without bail. That's the craziest thing that happened. We assault a police officer and a person is let out without bail. What world are we living in?</p><p>Look, this is a law and order society. We have a law and order President. A man who stands with the men and women who wear the shield every day to protect us on that thin blue line.</p><p>The opposite of that is Joe Biden. He wants to take the billion dollars that de Blasio wants to defund the police with and he agrees with the defunding of the police.</p><p>You can spin it any way you want, but when you take money from one thing, and you give it to something else, we call that defunding. And this President has shown through his endorsement just this week from the Fraternal Order of Police, he is the law and order candidate.</p><p>PIRRO: He is the law and order candidate, Dan and Joe Biden, as you say, is trying to dance a very thin line. But what about the impact, very quickly, I only have a little time left, Dan, do you think Joe Biden will ever come out and debate the President? Or will he hide behind his mask and in his basement?</p><p>BONGINO: And now I think he'll have to. I mean, the media has no credibility whatsoever. But they know he has to come out in public and do it and the President really needs that. Biden would be a disaster on the stage. I mean, if he even knows he's on the stage. It would be a total train wreck.</p><p>PIRRO: Or if he knows what he is running for. Corey, your thoughts on that? Real fast.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Look, we hope Joe Biden comes out to the debate stage, if I'm his adviser, I say stay in the basement. That's the only place that you can't continue to make as many gaffes.</p><p>The truth is, with early voting, these debates that are going to take place are going to have to -- only transpire after tens of millions of people have potentially voted. I think that's a disservice.</p><p>Joe Biden should have to debate the President earlier and we should have more than three debates.</p><p>PIRRO: And how about answer the question from the press, you know, anyway, guys, so good to have you JUSTICE.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Oh never. Never happen, Judge.</p><p>PIRRO: Thanks for being with us. Never. I agree. I agree. All right, guys. John Solomon still ahead, but first, coronavirus, schools and your children. Is it safe to go back? Dr. Robert Hariri joins me next with a segment no parent should miss. Stay with us.</p><p>PIRRO: New York is heading toward Phase 4 of their reopening plans, but many other states are putting restrictions back in place as they see surging coronavirus case numbers.</p><p>Dr. Robert Hariri is the founder and CEO of Celularity, a spinoff of biotech giant Celgene, which developed the first cell therapy approved by the F.D.A. for clinical testing in the coronavirus fight. Dr. Hariri joins me now.</p><p>Doctor, thanks so much for being with us this evening. I'd like to start with the question that a great many Americans have on their minds right now. And that is, is there justification for kids to go back to school? What are the risks and what are the benefits?</p><p>DR. ROBERT HARIRI, FOUNDER AND CEO, CELULARITY: So Judge, first, thanks for having me. You know, one of the most crucial questions you have to ask at the outset of an infectious disease like the new coronavirus is how deadly is this new disease?</p><p>And in the case of coronavirus, the first information we got from China was terrifying. If you remember early on, we thought that this might be a virus that could have a lethality of five or 10 percent. That means somebody you know is going to die from this disease.</p><p>Now, fortunately, the data has indicated that although this is a bad, bad virus, no doubt about it. It is ruthlessly lethal against the elderly and the infirmed. But it is sparing the younger population and in fact, kids, for the most part, will do very, very well. In many cases won't even experience any symptoms if infected and if they do experience symptoms, they tend to be very mild.</p><p>So that is something which is heartening when we're thinking about having our kids return to the classroom.</p><p>PIRRO: So why is there so much pushback by the teachers unions? You know, saying that it's really not safe. Is it more safe for kids to be in school or at home? And that's separate and apart from the COVID issue?</p><p>So let's do the unintended -- accident. Go ahead.</p><p>HARIRI: All right, so what we what we know is this. We know that COVID-19 is extremely limited in its lethality for children.</p><p>In fact, on the list of the 10 most common causes of death in the five to 24-year-old population COVID doesn't even make the top 50.</p><p>What in fact is true is that a child from five to 24 is about 88 times more likely to die of an accidental injury rather than a COVID infection. And in fact, from five to 14, children are five times more likely to die of influenza, you know, the seasonal flu, than COVID.</p><p>So, although the teachers union is quite concerned that children might become infected at school, perhaps transmit the disease back to their household, nothing is preventing that from happening, even if they're existing among their peers, their parents and so on.</p><p>And teachers can take steps to protect themselves in the classroom. They can use isolation shields and all the social distancing tools we have in effect right now.</p><p>But the specific risk to children five to 24 is extremely low.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, I don't have a lot of time, Doctor, but I want to ask you this. If you were to use the C.D.C.'s lethality rate in assessing the percentage of COVID deaths. Right now the Johns Hopkins is saying 3.9 percent. What say you?</p><p>HARIRI: So interestingly, the way you calculate what they call the infection fatality rate is by dividing the number of deaths by the denominator which is the number of people who've been infected.</p><p>Now, we simply don't know. We can't measure everyone to know who has been infected. But if you use the same tools and the same approach that the C.D.C. uses for influenza, where they estimate the total number of people who get infected during the season, and then use that as the denominator, we're looking at an infectious fatality rate that is slightly above what's seen for seasonal flu.</p><p>Now, the numbers aren't out yet. But if you remember at the beginning of this crisis, there was concern that this might be five or ten times more lethal. And we just don't think that's the case right now.</p><p>PIRRO: What do you think it is? Very quickly.</p><p>HARIRI: I think it's probably two or three times. And some estimate that as high as point 0.5 percent versus point 0.1 percent for influenza. But either way, it's not nearly as bad as what was predicted.</p><p>PIRRO: All right. Dr. Robert Hariri, thanks so much for being with us. And John Solomon is next.</p><p>PIRRO: A new book released this week appropriately titled, \"Fallout\" contain several bombshell revelations concerning the Obama-era Uranium One deal. Here to discuss it all, co-author and Fox News contributor, John Solomon, who is probably the one person we could all thank for digging deeper than anyone as it relates to what was going on with the F.B.I. in one area in particular, which was the sale of uranium that was done by the Obama-Biden team to Rosatom, a Russian connected company that Bill Clinton made half a million dollars cash to give a speech in Russia or Moscow and Hillary Clinton, like got it through CFIUS Committee and they made $150 million into their foundation.</p><p>Tell us now what you have unearthed about the sale of our uranium through the Clintons to Russia.</p><p>JOHN SOLOMON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, well, if you remember back to the fall '17 when we unearthed the fact that there was an F.B.I. informant inside of Rosatom, who was telling the F.B.I. in real time, why all those things you just mentioned were going on that this very company Rosatom was involved in kickbacks, bribery, extortion, and money laundering.</p><p>And at the time the Obama folks said -- Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden said, we didn't hear about. We didn't know about it. There was no reason to block the sale of Uranium One or stop giving the tens of millions of dollars of nuclear fuel contracts that they gave to the Russians.</p><p>In fact, we unearthed the documents that December 2017 notification to Congress, and it says flatly, the top levels, the top echelons in the Obama administration, the NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Energy Department and State Department, were all told that this company that they're about to give Uranium One to plus billions of dollars in nuclear fuel contracts. They were corrupt, crooked, involved in criminality on our soil here in America.</p><p>PIRRO: And they made some very derogatory comments about President Obama.</p><p>SOLOMON: They did. Yes, listen, the entire Russia collusion story is a cover up for the big foreign policy failure of the Obama-Biden-Clinton team, which was called the Russian Reboot.</p><p>When it was all said and done, the Russians got tens of billions of dollars of contracts of uranium, and Hillary Clinton help them build their own Silicon Valley called Skolkovo and they were sitting around with the F.B.I. informant laughing at one point saying, we cannot believe how easy it was to get all this stuff from your President.</p><p>They used derogatory terms for our President being President Obama, and they acknowledged that this was a game. We were just going to get everything we could get from the United States and we're going to pull the carpet out from under him.</p><p>PIRRO: Yes, and I think we actually had a full screen of some of the stuff that they were saying about the President and about the United States.</p><p>SOLOMON: Pretty ugly stuff and the F.B.I. was listening.</p><p>PIRRO: But that uranium -- yes, the F.B.I. was listening. That's right. And in addition to that, they ended up -- they weren't supposed to sell the uranium or have it leave the United States, but we found out later that it did right, John?</p><p>SOLOMON: It did. The same letter, that very letter that I mentioned that talks about the fact that everyone was notified that they were about to give the uranium to a dirty company. They later sold it through Canada and into Europe and Asia, according to that letter.</p><p>And so all the storylines of the Obama-Clinton-Biden team gave us a few years ago, all of them have been disproven in this book.</p><p>PIRRO: Yes, stop lying to us. John Solomon, thanks so much for being with us. Great book, \"Fallout.\"</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>PIRRO: Finally tonight, don't forget to order my book, \"Don't Lie to Me.\" It hits stores in September but you can preorder it and you'll enjoy it and if you go to my store, judgejeanine.store. You get a hat to wear with it. You get a beach towel.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for watching. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way.

His target wasn't a fellow artist, but Brian Roberts, the billionaire CEO of Comcast, the nation's largest cable company. Comcast had just announced it was kicking 50 Cent's show Power off the cable giant's system. 'This is the guy fu**ing up (Power) over at @Comcast,' 50 Cent wrote, showing a picture of a grinning Roberts wearing a wrinkled golf shirt.A few weeks later, Sean 'Diddy' Combs joined the pile-on, despite having worked with Comcast for distribution of his now-defunct cable channel, Revolt TV. </p><p>'Comcast spends billions of dollars on content networks every year,' Combs wrote[1] in a statement, 'but just a few million go to African American owned networks.' Combs was soon joined[2] by Latino Hollywood director Robert Rodriguez, owner of the El Rey network, as well as a black former Comcast employee turned programming entrepreneur named Paula Madison, who runs The Africa Channel.The ringleader of this revolt is Byron Allen, a black comedian turned media entrepreneur who has pursued a multiyear, $20 billion lawsuit against Comcast for racial discrimination and refusing to negotiate in good faith with minority owners. Allen's empire is more eclectic and diverse than his allies'; it includes The Weather Channel, among other properties. Allen is using a specific law to challenge Comcast's behavior, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, America's oldest civil rights statute, which guarantees all citizens the right to make and enforce contracts. In response, in a case recently argued before the Supreme Court, Comcast worked with the Trump administration to weaken interpretation of the law.The issue for all of these players is the same. Comcast is the only on-ramp for pay-TV content to more than 20 million households, many of them African American and Latino. It spends tens of billions of dollars to acquire or make this content. Yet virtually none of that money goes to black-owned media channels. Comcast, in other words, is a monopoly, and it uses its monopoly power to harm black and brown media owners.Over the last ten years, the problem of monopoly has changed from a niche concern of academics and scribblers to a mainstream political issue. There is for the first time in 40 years a genuine ideological contest about the political importance of market control, and now black entertainment moguls are getting in on the fight. But for black businesspeople, concentrated corporate power in media is especially charged. Media is a special industry, as the stories we tell ourselves shape the imagery and iconography of who we are. Concentrated media ownership places the means to shape that imagery of black Americans into the hands of white financiers. But in addition, for black Americans, monopoly power combines with lack of capital as twin barriers to economic inclusion. Even if media markets were open to all comers, blacks have less access to bank financing. And because of this lack of capital and a highly concentrated corporate system, black politics has become intimately tied, and in many cases dependent, on the very monopolies oppressing black communities and business leaders.Allen's case and the associated battles with Comcast touch on every third rail in American politics: dominance of corporate monopolies, Donald Trump's racism, Barack Obama's failures, and even the failure of Reconstruction to make black America whole with '40 acres and a mule.'It is the story of black businessmen and the oppressiveness of corporate power, in microcosm.BYRON ALLEN is a master showman, and he loves a good fight. He peppers his rhetoric with intentionally inflammatory arguments, like calling Comcast 'nothing more than a bully' and accusing rivals of engaging in 'economic genocide.' There's a sprinkle of P.T. Barnum and Huey Long in the man; he's kind of a tycoon populist. On the popular radio show The Breakfast Club, Allen boasted that his net worth of $300 million is 'not a lot of money.' He is aware of his blackness, of both the racism and opportunity that engenders; one of his heroes is Motown impresario Berry Gordy, and he name-drops Coretta Scott King.But Allen's other[3] heroes are Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Rupert Murdoch, and Ted Turner; more tycoon than populist. After pointing out that civil rights organizations like the NAACP and the Urban League take large sums of money from Comcast, he likes to mention that he tried to buy the Urban League back from Comcast, making a quarter-million-dollar donation of his own. He's fully willing to work the system to his benefit, no matter where that leads him.Allen's story is extraordinary, and in his retelling, full of nothing but hustle, grit, and winning. His mother took him from a decrepit and riot-torn Detroit to Los Angeles. To avoid being taken away by social services when his mother didn't have enough money to raise him, Allen says that at ten years old he retrieved used shopping carts at supermarkets in return for food. At the age of 14, he began selling jokes to comedian Jimmie Walker, and later worked with a young David Letterman and Jay Leno. Eventually he became a low-grade TV star, performing on The Tonight Show and the early-1980s proto-reality TV series Real People on NBC. In the early 1990s, Allen started his own media company, creating low-budget syndicated shows he often hosted, and giving them to TV networks desperate for cheap content. He would split the advertising revenue with the stations, eventually growing his empire into one of the largest independent producers and distributors of televised content.Allen wants to be a global brand distributing all sorts of content, not a Tyler Perry type that puts himself at the center of the show. He uses the language of civil rights situationally, to promote his goals. And he is unafraid to challenge anyone in pursuit of his empire. After the financial crisis, he attacked former President Barack Obama for refusing to audit bailed-out banks over their lending practices to black people. Later, in 2016, he went[4] after Obama for allowing a giant cable merger between Charter and Time Warner, asserting that Charter refused to carry his content. President Obama and his FCC 'have really abandoned the African American community,' he said. 'At the end of the day, he is ignoring the fact that African Americans are suffering economic genocide. It's being played out in the homelessness, the unemployment and even the violence.'Allen is respected for his drive and hustle. 'The Byron that I know is a salesman\u2014he's always got a pitch\u2014combined with a visionary who believes in the need for more diversity,' said Robert Johnson, the legendary billionaire and founder of Black Entertainment Television. When Allen branched[5] into film in 2015, music business icon Quincy Jones said, 'I am very proud of Byron, and I hope he adopts me.' Last year, Allen bought[6] The Weather Channel from the Blackstone Group, Bain Capital, and Comcast, and he has a $500 million credit line for more acquisitions.And yet his colleagues mix this respect with a certain distance, a fear of his raw ambition. He made his money, as one person involved in the Comcast dispute told me, by 'gaming the white boy system.' His racial-discrimination lawsuit against Comcast is, he says, about economic inclusion, but it's hard to avoid the conclusion that in some ways it's about economic inclusion for Byron Allen[7] himself. In April 2019, for instance, black celebrities Magic Johnson, LL Cool J, and Serena Williams tried to buy 21 networks[8] Disney had to divest as a condition of its merger with Fox. Allen, by contrast, joined the rightward-titling Sinclair Broadcast Group as a minority investor, and Sinclair was able to buy Disney's assets[9]. Allen's company got several of the stations.But Allen's basic argument, whether put forward in good faith or not, is right. Black business moguls, having climbed to the top of the cable and entertainment field, now face the most intractable foe of economic inclusion: monopoly. Cable and Black Voices The cable industry is one of the focal points of this fight, for a few reasons.It is the first media industry that emerged after the civil rights movement. Cable television exploded from the 1970s to the 1990s, a sort of dot-com boom through coaxial cable. The wiring was largely done at a municipal level, so black businessmen could win franchises in cities with large black populations. It was a political business from the start, and where black voters had political power, black businessmen often succeeded.It also became, very quickly, a big business. Comcast, for instance, was incorporated under its current name in 1969. From 1978 to 1982, as the FCC allowed big cities to wire themselves with cable, networks like ESPN, Nickelodeon, CNN, USA, and C-Span all launched. Cable revenues[10] soared from $3.6 billion in 1981 to over $20 billion in 1990. In 1980, 20 percent of households had[11] cable; by 1990, it was 60 percent.A host of African American cable and content operators participated in the cable boom. Don Barden became a cable tycoon in the 1980s by wiring cities all over the country, winning the right to the cable franchise in the heavily African American city of Detroit. Malcolm X's lawyer Percy Sutton got the cable concession for Queens, as did black business leaders Barry Washington in Newark, William T. Johnson in Columbus, and James Wade in West Philadelphia. Robert and Sheila Johnson started Black Entertainment Television, and BET became the first black company to list on the New York Stock Exchange. By contrast, when similar explosions happened in the radio or broadcast TV industries decades earlier, Jim Crow was still in force, and blacks were left out.Concentrated media ownership places the means to shape the imagery of black Americans into the hands of white financiers. But a different barrier hit the first wave of black cable entrepreneurs: access to capital. Many, like Sutton, faced[12] financial challenges at the cost of wiring cities, unable to fulfill the promises they made to win cable franchises. Even successful cable entrepreneurs had trouble. Barden, for instance, after winning the cable franchise in Detroit in the early 1980s, had to cede some control to a Canadian company that did much of the financing. This lack of access to capital helped consolidate black businesses into the hands of white owners; Barden ended up selling his Detroit cable system to Comcast for $100 million in the early 1990s.Historically, entertainment is one of the few fields where black businesspeople can succeed on an even playing field, and in the 1980s, black entertainers began building large business empires. Sometimes the playing field was literal; Magic Johnson turned his basketball celebrity into a conglomerate worth $600 million, which has included a movie theater chain, a record label, a film studio, and a partnership with Starbucks. Forbes listed five black billionaires in America, and three\u2014Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, and Jay-Z\u2014are entertainers. Turning back to cable, BET founders Bob and Sheila Johnson were America's first black billionaire couple. Black entertainment barons know each other and can help each other, forming a critical network that often doesn't exist for African American entrepreneurs in other sectors of the economy.But the problem of capital access still plagues even the wealthiest black businesspeople. Despite her track record of success, Sheila Johnson couldn't get a loan[13] in 2019 to finance a new hotel. Even today, the racial wealth gap is extreme. Of the top 100 wealthiest people in America, not a single one is black. Black citizens face hurdles to full economic inclusion; black-owned banks were one-tenth as likely to get bailout funds during the financial crisis. That's what makes the fight between black business leaders and cable monopolists so important. While there are black tycoons in technology and finance, the wealth and power in those industries is disproportionately white. In media, there is enough black wealth to build business, but not quite enough to finance it at the scale of Comcast. And this has created tensions that expose an entire rigged system. The Rise of Law and Economics For most of American history, big used to be bad, especially in media. The government broke up its giants, doing everything from splitting off NBC from ABC in the 1940s, to preventing TV networks from owning their own prime-time content, to imposing restrictive rules on ownership of local radio and television channels.But the post-civil rights era also coincided with the emergence of a new economic ideology to destroy New Deal controls on corporate power. This movement was led by a law professor named Robert Bork, a conservative antitrust scholar. His strategy was risky, aggressive, and tailored to racist ideology from the jump. In a 1963 article in The New Republic, Bork publicly attacked the Civil Rights Act, earning the trust and respect of Southern white elites and an important place in the Barry Goldwater-led Republican Party.Using this springboard, over the next 15 years, Bork led the law and economics movement to get rid of antitrust enforcement and public rules for industry, not under the guise of explicit racism, but under the guise of property rights and efficiency. He was joined, ironically, by progressive baby boomer political leaders who came into force in the mid-1970s after Watergate. From 1975 onward, the Democratic Congress eliminated laws protecting small retailers, and deregulated airlines and banks. To many of these new leaders, Bork didn't look like a racist\u2014the Southern populists who sought to protect the small businessman against monopoly did. But his corporatist philosophy enabled racial inequality and discrimination across the country through the use of economic power.Media was always a focal point for Bork's movement; in the 1960s, scholars penned articles in The Journal of Law and Economics criticizing the FCC's attempts to organize the nascent cable industry. In 1979, the Supreme Court, in FCC v. Midwest Video Corp[14]., ruled the FCC didn't have the authority to regulate cable networks to ensure they were treating channel owners fairly. It was a 6-3 decision, with Thurgood Marshall notably dissenting.Democrats joined Bork's movement in concentrating media power. At the Federal Communications Commission, Jimmy Carter appointee Charles Ferris removed rules governing cable television. Radio broadcasters reacted[15] with 'glee' as Ferris deregulated their industry. Five years later, congressional Democrats and Ronald Reagan passed the Cable Act of 1984, which deregulated the industry. In 1985, Robert Bork, now a D.C. Court of Appeals judge, helped[16] strike down rules mandating that cable operators had to carry local content, citing the cable operators' First Amendment rights to choose what to carry on their network. It was not a conservative decision; joining Bork in the decision were Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Judge Skelly Wright, a John F. Kennedy appointee.Cable prices began skyrocketing, and consolidation started. By 1988, the ten largest cable operators served over 60 percent of subscribers. And subsequently, in the three years between 1986 and 1989, cable prices jumped[17] 43 percent. The price hikes soured Americans on the unregulated industry. Public outrage, along with the desire of broadcasters to charge for their content, led to the Cable Act of 1992, which re-regulated prices and blocked cable operators who owned content from discriminating against competitors or from demanding equity stakes or other favors to carry their content.The Cable Act was the only bill that passed over the veto of George H.W. Bush. Yet, FCC chairs under Bill Clinton didn't enforce the Cable Act strongly, and even when they tried, increasingly conservative courts continued to clip their wings. Just four years after the Cable Act re-regulated the industry, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed pricing caps for cable, and enabled a new round of consolidation. Comcast Politics This new legal environment enabled the massive growth of Comcast, which was a small Pennsylvania company in the 1970s. Comcast began consolidating power as soon as it became legal. It bought Group W Cable in 1986, increasing its base to a million subscribers, and purchased QVC, a home shopping content provider.In 1994, Comcast became the third-biggest cable operator in the country through a series of mergers. Two years later, it began offering broadband internet access, and bought the Philadelphia Flyers. It launched E! Entertainment Television with Disney. In 2002, Comcast acquired all of AT&amp;T's cable assets for $44.5 billion, giving the company 22 million subscribers and elevating it to number one in cable. It formed the Golf Channel, tried to buy Disney and MGM, and bought assets from Adelphia Cable in 2005.Meanwhile, the law and economics shift in thinking influenced black politics, just as it did the whole country. 'The Sherman Antitrust Act may at this point be an anachronism,' said Barbara Jordan in 1981; Jordan was one of the few black women who had served in Congress to that point. Many black leaders avoided, or did not see, the racial implications of concentrated financial power, instead choosing to focus on how it might advance the interests of individual businesses, people, and politicians. Corporate donations began to power the black political establishment. Today, the corporate advisory council[18] of the Congressional Black Caucus includes the most powerful monopolies in the land, with representatives from Google, Facebook, Apple, JPMorgan, Altria, Bank of America, and AT&amp;T. And CBC members like David Scott and Gregory Meeks have been reliable allies for Wall Street[19], continually subverting progressive efforts on the House Financial Services Committee.White financial leaders manipulated the language of racial tolerance for their own purposes. 'Unlike other crusaders from Berkeley, I have chosen Wall Street as my battleground for improving society,' said junk bond king turned (now pardoned) felon Michael Milken. Indeed, as he was constructing a political machine to defend himself from congressional investigators, Milken financed[20] the creation of the biggest black business in America, Reginald Lewis's 1988 takeover of Beatrice Foods. Milken also hired Jesse Jackson's son at his investment bank, reflecting a growing alliance between concentrated finance and black political actors in the post-civil rights era.From the 1980s to the 2000s, consolidations of power took place across our society, including in black America. There were 50 black-owned insurance companies in the 1980s, and just two as of 2014. Black-owned banks started collapsing in the 1980s, and from 2001 to 2017 the number fell by 56 percent.Would-be monopolists learned the value of having civil rights groups in their corner. In 2011, the Obama administration approved Comcast's largest merger, when it bought NBC, in part because of the strong support it received from the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP, the National Urban League, and other minority groups. Congressman Bobby Rush, a senior House Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee and a critical voice in racial debates over technology and media ownership, was effusive about the deal. 'I am pleased and interested and somewhat delighted by the approach that Comcast and NBC have made towards satisfying our concerns,' he said in a House hearing on the merger, citing the promises by Comcast to add diversity in programming to its slate of channels. 'This represents a real opportunity that minority businesses and investors must not miss.'The relationship between black leaders and Comcast goes beyond policy. Comcast has deep political and charitable relationships with black communities and political leaders. Comcast supports Rush through both political and charitable donations. A few months after the merger was approved, Comcast gave $50,000 to Beloved Community Foundation Family Services, an organization Rush founded. Earle Jones, Comcast's top lobbyist, is on the board of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. From 2011 to 2014, Comcast spent over $500,000[21] to 'honor the Congressional Black Caucus,' and it also donated[22] to the NAACP, the Urban League, and the National Action Network. Six months after the NBC merger approval, Comcast's news division added a black MSNBC host, none other than icon Al Sharpton.In 2011, the Obama administration approved the Comcast-NBC merger in part because of the strong support it received from minority groups. To secure support for the NBC merger, Comcast made a host of promises to black and Latino leaders. Comcast signed a memorandum of understanding about diversity with the NAACP, National Urban League, and Sharpton's National Action Network, among others. The corporation agreed to more than 150 conditions[23] upon signing its consent decree with the Obama administration.Federal Communications Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, the daughter of South Carolina Democratic power broker Jim Clyburn, voted to approve the merger, contingent on certain promises. Comcast committed to improve 'diversity of viewpoint and programming,' to avoid discriminating against content flowing on the internet (the principle known as 'net neutrality'), to protect small cable operators and local broadcasters, and to provide more broadband to children who get federally subsidized school lunches.Comcast essentially offered a deal to black policymakers and leaders. The corporation would serve some of the functions of a government, expanding vital services to black people that white people already get\u2014like broadband and representative media\u2014in return for political support. Comcast would also pay back political leaders and nonprofit groups with sweeteners like political and charitable contributions; they would use those resources to organize politically in communities starved of capital. Ultimately, policymakers decided that voluntary commitments from Comcast to improve the lived experience of black customers and creators who need the Comcast platform to get their shows to market were as good as they were going to get.And yet these promises were hollow and mostly didn't happen, including the pledges to work with black and brown content owners. Clyburn had little leverage, thanks to corruption and fecklessness among white officials. Obama's FCC Chair Julius Genachowski, who is now in charge of media company buyouts at private equity giant The Carlyle Group, had signaled he would approve the merger no matter what. And six months after the merger, one of the Republican FCC commissioners who voted for the deal, Meredith Baker, went[24] to work for Comcast. The deal didn't have to happen. As one person then at the Justice Department told me, 'If we had an FCC that was willing to say this is not in the public interest, then we could have gone forward to challenge the merger and may not have had to go to court.' Because of policy choices by Genachowski and Baker, black policymakers couldn't leverage their power into anything more than superficial concessions.The approval of the Comcast-NBC merger in 2011 was one of the most important antitrust actions of the Obama administration. 'Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal is a transaction like no other that has come before this Commission\u2014ever,' said then-FCC Commissioner Michael Copps. 'It reaches into virtually every corner of our media and digital landscapes and will affect every citizen in the land.'Comcast is now a Goliath, with 27 million households subscribing to its internet service and roughly a quarter of the pay-TV subscriber base. The NBC deal brought Comcast in-house movie assets like Universal Studios, news channels like MSNBC and CNBC, dozens of local affiliates, theme parks, and stakes in Snap, Hulu, Fandango, Buzzfeed, and Vox Media. If you want to distribute content to Americans, you are probably going through Comcast's pipes in one way or another, either through its broadband lines or its TV gatekeepers.But even the size and scale of Comcast understates the importance of the merger. The combination of a large content production and advertising company and a large content distributor set a precedent. Media in America would be, as it is said in the industry, vertically integrated, in the hands of a small number of players.The choice to allow Comcast and NBC to merge drove a wave of defensive-oriented strategic choices by rivals to expand their market power. Netflix, formerly just a distributor of content, soon produced House of Cards, realizing that it wouldn't be able to perpetually license content from a beefed-up Comcast. AT&amp;T bought Time Warner, and Disney continued an acquisition spree and launched a streaming service so it can control production and distribution of content. Google, Amazon, and Facebook are all vertically integrated advertising, content production, and distribution machines, and increasingly, so are video game corporations. As Copps put it, the merger conferred 'too much power' in too few hands. It helped set the stage for today's extraordinarily concentrated Big Tech and Big Media platform political framework.The consequences of the merger, and the media consolidation from 2011 onward, were catastrophic for black America. Black newspapers are largely gone, crushed first by the financial crisis and then the monopolization of ad revenue by Google and Facebook. Disproportionately black counties still trail[25] white counties in broadband access, and American broadband access[26] is among the most expensive in the world. The new world of Big Tech surrounds Americans with algorithms that promote racist content or enable new forms[27] of discrimination. The Byron Allen Suit In 2016, Byron Allen filed a federal lawsuit against both Charter and Comcast. The two large cable corporations refused to carry most of his networks, he alleges, because of racial discrimination.In some sense, Comcast is acting like a standard unregulated monopoly, without racial animus. Earlier this year, The Hollywood Reporter revealed it was removing 17 Starz channels from its lineup, channels owned by non-black company Lionsgate, due to a 'nasty' dispute over fees. Comcast will replace them with a rival, Epix. This is the heart of 50 Cent's fight with Comcast, since his show Power is carried by Starz.But race underpins the market structure of the entertainment industry, because the entertainment industry sells cultural products. Comcast, as a giant cable company, picks and chooses which channels to carry, giving it massive leverage over what Americans watch. And since Comcast bought NBC, it now has an incentive to carry its own content over its own distribution network, instead of buying content from others. Comcast, according to Byron Allen, won't carry his channels, but he alleged it will carry lesser-known channels from white-owned content creators.WHEN COMCAST negotiated with Allen's company, one of Comcast's executives apparently gave a racial argument for turning down carriage of Allen's content, saying, 'We're not trying to create any more Bob Johnsons,' referring to the billionaire founder of BET. It would not be so unusual to hear a racist comment from a corporate executive, except that, as we've seen, Comcast and the entire cable industry have particularly close ties to African American leaders.Allen is suing under America's oldest civil rights law, the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The law was passed immediately after the Civil War to ensure newly freed black citizens would get the same rights as white citizens to enter into contracts. Like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, this law builds racial equity into the way we define property itself. Black citizens didn't get land or property, but they got, at least legally, the right to access property through contracts on equal terms with white citizens. Allen's argument is that Comcast denied him access to the airwaves, while allowing access for white-owned content.Allen didn't limit his suit to the cable giants. He also sued the NAACP, the Urban League, and Al Sharpton, all of whom participated in the merger negotiations, because 'this was corrupt.' Allen told me, 'If you're going to sign something that black people are supposed to live by, why don't you tell black people how much money you're getting from Comcast, that may be controlling your behavior and how you negotiate on behalf of black people?'Allen's suits weren't popular within the black establishment. One judge, Terry Hatter, himself black, dismissed the suit against Comcast. Allen believes his attack on the black establishment may be why. 'Judge Hatter may have been offended that I named the NAACP and the Urban League and Al Sharpton' in the suit, he said. In the separate case against Charter, Judge George Wu let the lawsuit go forward. Both suits were later consolidated in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Allen could proceed.The legal question in the cases thus far wasn't on the underlying discrimination claim, but on whether Allen could bring the suit without clear evidence that racism is the only reason he was denied business. As Allen put it, 'It can be 99 percent because he's black and 1 percent because he's wearing tennis shoes and if that's the case, he can't even use the law against us to bring a suit against us. And so what the Ninth Circuit said it's not the sole reason, it's the motivating factor.'Charter eventually dropped its appeal and will go to trial on the merits of the claim. But Comcast, in response, appealed to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to prevent Allen from even bringing the suit unless he can prove that the decision to not carry his programming was made entirely on the basis of race. On March 23, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed with Comcast[28], sending the case back to the Ninth Circuit to reconsider whether Allen's channels were denied solely because of racial discrimination. This will weaken America's oldest civil rights statute, making it virtually impossible for a host of workers, consumers, and businesspeople to secure their property rights in the face of discrimination.The extreme position by Comcast has scrambled the politics of the cable industry. Many opponents of Comcast are conservative owners of smaller cable systems. In 2018, Donald Trump publicly attacked[29] Comcast for 'routinely' violating antitrust laws. But in 2019, his administration flipped, supporting Comcast's attempt to defang the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Comcast even gave Trump Solicitor General Noel Francisco ten of their allotted 30 minutes in oral arguments before the Supreme Court.Allen is suing under America's oldest civil rights law, the Civil Rights Act of 1866. This law builds racial equity into the way we define property itself. Despite Allen's earlier attack on much of the black establishment, the NAACP, the ACLU, Color of Change, the Urban League, and the National Association of Black Journalists have all come in against Comcast. The issue has now become much bigger than one man's quest to become a media tycoon. Multiple Congressional Black Caucus members, and Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Bernie Sanders weighed in, as have lesser political officials like New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer.Even Bobby Rush reversed his Comcast-friendly position, calling for the cable giant to be broken up. In a bitter letter to CEO Brian Roberts, Rush argued that Comcast, which had 'enjoyed the largesse of the African-American communities,' had now become an 'enemy of minority communities.' As Rush indicates, Comcast had mouthed soothing words about diversity when it needed support from black leaders, but has unacceptably embraced both the Trump administration and a racist ideology.In district court, Comcast mocked Allen, sarcastically noting that Allen's allegation put the company 'in a racist plot with the Obama Administration, the oldest civil rights organizations in the country, Diddy, and Magic Johnson.' Comcast, after all, had carried Combs's Revolt TV network.In response, Combs, who had been silent, took Allen's side. 'Revolt has never been in a position to truly compete on a fair playing field because it has not received the economic and distribution support necessary for real economic inclusion,' he said. 'Our relationship with Comcast is the illusion of economic inclusion.' Indeed, the case reflected back on Comcast's broken diversity promises. The corporation had pledged to launch minority-owned channels to secure approval for the Comcast-NBC merger in 2011, but then ensured that those channels would be unable to financially succeed. Combs explained that he simply didn't have the capital to make his channel viable, which seems odd for a man with a net worth of $850 million, but is consistent with the long history of black business leaders being unable to finance even profitable opportunities for expansion.What of the underlying substance of Allen's suit?It's certainly possible that Comcast's executives are openly racist. After buying NBC, Comcast switched the chief diversity officer from a black woman to its main political fixer, chief of lobbying David Cohen. But most of the people I spoke with in the industry believe that Comcast is simply destroying independent programmers, not solely targeting black programmers. The company has squeezed out FUSE, beIN Sports, the Tennis Channel, and Altitude TV, and is in a fight with the owner of the Los Angeles Rams, who is married to an heir to the Walmart fortune. Comcast has even fought with Michael Bloomberg over carriage for his corporation's business channel.Comcast only wants to do business with large integrated systems that produce must-have content, like Disney, Viacom/CBS, and AT&amp;T/Time Warner, with streaming options Netflix and Amazon in the wings. New technologies such as high-speed 5G mobile technology could fragment the market, providing ample opportunity for new streaming options, at least temporarily. 50 Cent is aggressively promoting Starz's streaming app. But today, pay TV remains the dominant distribution and investment system in sustained high-quality narrative video content. And there are no legal limits to consolidating what comes next.It might appear that Byron Allen is just one content creator among many muscled out by a powerful corporation, in a marketplace loosely controlled by four Goliaths. And he's not necessarily aiming to start a Black History Channel, or really anything that reflects the black experience. Exchanging white capitalists for black capitalists doesn't automatically improve opportunities for black actors and writers and filmmakers, or the images watched by black families.But Allen's crusade does shine a light on a long-standing system of oppression that, as so often is the case in America, disproportionately affects people of color. Black-owned media entrepreneurs are by and large independent producers, and even the giants among them struggle to finance their operations. Fully expressive black-owned media channels can't really exist without the open markets into which independent producers can sell. Which means unless we do something about concentration in media, it will be financiers like Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, rather than black leaders, who own the means of control for commercial imagery of black America.Is this a problem with racism, or is this just discrimination against the little guy that any monopolist might engage in? One person I interviewed said it's the age-old problem in America. 'When white folks catch a cold,' he said, 'black folks get pneumonia.' That's true with being able to raise money to start and run a business. And it's true with monopolies. Discrimination is discrimination.

Continue reading Remote working: How the biggest change to office life will happen in our homes</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Working from home is becoming the new normal, but office plans are not the only ones that will change. This is how remote work will change our homes, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like many other workers, Salim Hashmi lives in a compact studio-flat in the heart of London, where the bedroom doubles as the kitchen in a few dozen square metres   not that welcoming an      environment, it would seem, for home-working.</p><p>Yet even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Hashmi, who works as a teaching fellow at a central London university, was a keen remote worker. The academic s secret to successful telecommuting? He      has an office away from the office.</p><p>For many of us who are nearing the end of three months working from crammed flats, potentially with no garden, sometimes complete with noisy young children, the idea might sound attractive.</p><p> Whenever I would work from home before COVID,  Hashmi tells ZDNet,  I would start my day as if I was going to work, and then instead of getting onto the tube, I d go down to the co-working      space with my laptop and my coffee, and work there until lunchtime. </p><p>When his stomach would start rumbling, he would take the lift back up to his studio, make some food, and do some more work there.  But I d go back down if I wasn t working productively enough      in my own flat,  adds Hashmi.  To have this workspace was really beneficial, because otherwise you re always working in your bedroom-kitchen area. </p><p>Hashmi lives in a high-rise building managed by real estate company Uncle, which also owns a few other residences in central London, as well as in Manchester. At the heart of Uncle s business      model is the concept of a  vertical neighborhood : the company offers apartments to rent, but the buildings also include gyms, cafes, co-working spaces, and on-site resident managers who are      responsible for fostering a sense of community across the location.</p><p>Speaking at the CogX conference 2020, the company s CEO Ryan Prince explained that he was increasingly seeing his residents speak of having  co-workers from home . Relationships similar to      workplace colleagues emerged, said Prince, as residents spend time both living and working next to their neighbors.</p><p>Because of the pandemic, Uncle s co-working spaces have had to temporarily close down.  But as soon as they re-open, I will go straight down there, and probably a lot more than before,  says      Hashmi.</p><p> This is mostly just because the ergonomics of working in my studio aren t very good,  he adds.  Whereas all the times I ve worked in the co-working space, I ve never felt physically      discomforted. There s a variety in how you can sit, or change spaces. </p><p>At the heart of Uncle s business model is the concept of a  vertical neighborhood .</p><p>Image: Uncle</p><p>Having a dedicated space acting as an alternative to home and the office seems a fitting concept in current times. Government guidelines are staying clear of any encouragement to return to the      office, and many workers will now have fully embraced their telecommuting routines. That is not to say, however, that every aspect of remote work is thrilling.</p><p>Sure, you may have requested the appropriate lumbar cushion, keyboard or monitor from your employer to help with your back pain; or carefully stuck to expert tips to stay healthy, happy and      productive, even during a global pandemic.</p><p>It remains that the global work-from-home experiment was not only an overnight exercise for businesses, but also for their staff, who often found that their home setting wasn t exactly up to      the challenge.</p><p>Recent research from Uswitch conducted in the UK, in fact, showed that almost half of respondents reported working at the dinner table. A whole 25% admitted to doing their job from bed. What s      more, nearly two thirds of respondents said they had had issues with their broadband or mobile signal.</p><p>Having to make-do with stiff kitchen chairs and a temperamental internet connection might have been an acceptable last resort as the COVID-19 crisis suddenly locked the office doors. But now,      it has become widely accepted that remote working is here to stay, even in a post-coronavirus world. And as employees start spending a few more days at home every week, it is not only office      layouts that are going to change   but also the way we organize our homes.</p><p>In the UK, a strong 75% of employees have reported not wanting to go back into the office full-time. Of course, that does not spell the end of the workplace: the vast majority of employees      still miss the buzz and communication enabled by office life. Rather than disappear, the workplace is looking set to evolve into a space built for a different purpose   namely, to collaborate      and meet with co-workers, instead of sitting at a desk from nine to five.</p><p>But employees will want more flexibility in the way they work, and potentially only want to come into the office a few times a week. And big tech companies are prepared to give their staff what      they want: Twitter, for one, has already announced that it is giving workers the choice to stick with remote working permanently, even after offices are fully re-opened.</p><p>The incentive, from an employer s perspective, is easy to see. Phil Flaxton, the chief executive of non-profit organization Work Wise UK, and a strong advocate of smart working, tells ZDNet:  A      number of corporates right now are looking at this and wondering if they actually need to house all of their employees. There are effectively significant cost-savings that could be achieved in      down-sizing. </p><p>With a portion of employees at home most of the time, gone are the costs of rent for huge office space   as well as the free cupcakes, exercise classes or monthly socials. Instead, it might be      up to employees to find similar productivity-boosting environments, and in their own homes.</p><p>As a result, the core functions of houses and flats   sleeping, cooking, socializing   might expand to now include working. Urban planning company Prior+Partners, in a prospectus on designing      for a post-pandemic life, asks whether our living spaces should become more multifunctional. Our interiors, says the paper, should be more flexible to accommodate different uses, including      office use.</p><p>According to Flaxton, we could see a work-from-home space becoming a pre-requisite for future residential buildings.  It might become the norm for housing developers to design homes where the      technology for home working is built into the infrastructure of the property,  he says.</p><p> Homes would come with a designated area that has got Wi-Fi built-in, for example. The day you move in, you could just sit down with your laptop, switch it on, and go,  he continues.</p><p>To an extent, the concept of a hybrid space, mixing work and play environments in a way that allows a healthy dose of both, is what Uncle s  vertical neighborhoods  already offer. In the same      central London building as Salim Hashmi, lives Jessica Popplewell, who shares a studio flat with her partner; like Hashmi, she jokes that her mother s first visit to the apartment came with the      comment that  our bed is essentially in the kitchen .</p><p>In Yorkshire, where she used to live, explains Popplewell, the house came with a terrace, and it was always possible to find a peaceful space to work. Not so much in London.</p><p> The shared space downstairs is important, because it s a city-friendly version of that privilege of space I had in Yorkshire,  she tells ZDNet.  There s a sense of productivity in a shared      space that I don t always have in my flat. </p><p>Uncle s residential buildings come with a host of services that are strongly reminiscent of your typical millennial office, ranging from gyms to buffet-style canteen through to meditation and      chill-out studio spaces. It s not just about the amenities, however: the residential team also put on social events throughout the year, often hosted in the co-working space, to build up the      community.</p><p>One of Hashmi s best memories in the residence, in fact, was the Christmas party organized a few weeks after he moved in, complete with the free food and wine that punctuate many offices       Thursday evenings around that time of the year.</p><p>Uncle s residential buildings come with a host of services that are strongly reminiscent of your typical millennial office.</p><p>Image: Uncle</p><p>The company s CEO Ryan Prince tells ZDNet that in another one of Uncle s buildings, the residents  favorite activity is to organize Thursday night quizzes   another age-old staple of after-work      office life.</p><p> Before, we were not around our places of living all day,  says Prince.  But now, if people are going to be home two or three days a week, they re going to meet another universe of people they      wouldn t have otherwise met. </p><p>Prince is confident that the model s appeal will only increase in the future. About a quarter of Uncle s tenants at the moment are gig economy workers, who actively wanted a co-working space in      the building.  But now, every business large and small will be working from home. The number of people who might want that has expanded,  says the company s CEO.</p><p>Of course, moving into a brand-new apartment in a high-rise building, or fitting a small flat with an extra room for working, might not be on the cards for everyone. But that s no reason to      think that everybody else will have to stick with makeshift home offices, even as remote working becomes a norm.</p><p>Changes might also happen outside of immediate living spaces   at the level of local facilities, for example   to accommodate workers  new needs. City planners, in fact, are already      anticipating the migration out of the office and towards residential areas.</p><p>Tom Venables, planning director at Prior+Partner, says that the trend is already being given centre-stage when planning for new communities. According to Venables, planners are increasingly      imagining scenarios where people live further out and commute occasionally, and either have a better home office set up or the ability to go to a local community space.</p><p> It is also applicable to existing smaller centres in London,  says Venables.  For example, I live in West Norwood in zone three, and I don t think I ll ever go back to working in the office in      central London five days a week again. But I could totally imagine using a community space for meetings. </p><p>He gives the example of his local library, which was recently made-over in a multi-million pound joint venture. Equally, Venables predicts a big rise in  membership offices    a similar concept      to gym memberships, but to hot-desk in nearby dedicated facilities.</p><p>Memberships, however, come at a cost   and where there is a cost, there is the question of who should pay for it. In the case of remote working, very little legislation exists to regulate the      expenses that employers should take on, and those which should be left to the employee. It was only in 2014 that every worker was given the right to require flexible working, and since then,      grey areas have multiplied.</p><p>For example, you might argue that a decent internet connection is key to productivity; and official guidelines do allow tax relief for some of the bills an employee has to pay because of      home-working. The same rules, however, also state that such claims can t be made for things that can be used for both private and business use.</p><p>Much of the decision on how much money to give to whom is left in the hands of the employer. Work Wise UK s Phil Flaxton says:  I would hope that responsible employers, be they SMEs or      multinational corporations, would ensure that the health and well-being of their staff is a priority. </p><p> A responsible employer should ensure that people have the right equipment and they are not being asked to pay for it,  he added.</p><p>Although no law stipulates it, it is currently commonly accepted that employers should cover equipment such as ergonomic chairs, monitors, professional mobile phones, and so on. And since the      start of the pandemic, the government has updated the rules saying that employers can pay up to \u00a326 a month ($33) to cover additional costs induced by remote working.</p><p>But where the expense line should be drawn exactly remains unclear. In Switzerland, for example, a federal court recently ruled that an employee was entitled to a monthly compensation of CHF      150 ($160) from their employer to help with rent for a flat that could accommodate home working.</p><p>Should businesses take on the cost of their workers  more spacious flats, if that means that their living spaces are more WFH-friendly? At least, should the rent for a local hot-desking      facility be covered? If employees are to vacate offices on a semi-permanent basis, the idea doesn t seem unreasonable.</p><p>Should businesses take on the cost of their workers  more spacious flats, if that means that their living spaces are more WFH-friendly?</p><p>Image: Uncle</p><p> There are various HR issues that need to be addressed,  says Flaxton.  If you re working from home, and book a drop-in space in a local facility, maybe your company should pay for it.      Hopefully, they would. </p><p>And yet Flaxton reported a more alarming trend occurring: during the pandemic, some employees have approached Work Wise UK to report that employers were considering pay cuts as a result of home      working. In what he calls  unscrupulous behavior , businesses are arguing that their workers are saving on commuting costs, and suggesting lower salaries as a result.</p><p>Facebook s Mark Zuckerberg suggested in a video-conference with employees that those moving to areas with lower costs of living could see their pays reduced as a result.</p><p>If anything, the controversy only highlights that the huge acceleration of remote working caused by the pandemic has left legislation running behind. And policy-makers certainly have room to      start thinking about the do s and dont s of ethical telecommuting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/work-from-home-64-expert-tips-for-staying-healthy-happy-and-productive/\">https://www.zdnet.com/article/work-from-home-64-expert-tips-for-staying-healthy-happy-and-productive/</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Ann<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2594115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MB-H711-F08D-5045-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2419\"/><timeReceived>4:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 12, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In summary the committee called for:    a compulsory code of ethics for social media companies requiring all harmful content to be removed by the companies, including \"Fake News\";  this code to be overseen by a Regulator with enforcement powers;  reform to UK electoral laws.  The report makes for fearsome reading. The committee found that Facebook (which came in for especial and trenchant criticism) 'intentionally and knowingly' violated both privacy and anti-trust (anti competitive practice) law. </p><p>Ouch.  The chair of the committee, Damian Collins, stated:  \"Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use everyday. Much of this is directed from agencies working in foreign countries, including Russia.  \"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data privacy rights.  \"We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people. The age of inadequate self regulation must come to an end. The rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator.  \"We also have to accept that our electoral regulations are hopelessly out of date for the internet age. We need reform so that the same principles of transparency of political communications apply online, just as they do in the real world. More needs to be done to require major donors to clearly establish the source of their funds.  \"Much of the evidence we have scrutinised during our inquiry has focused on the business practices of Facebook; before, during and after the Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal.  \"We believe that in its evidence to the Committee Facebook has often deliberately sought to frustrate our work, by giving incomplete, disingenuous and at times misleading answers to our questions.  \"We also repeat our call to the Government to make a statement about how many investigations are currently being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics. We want to find out what was the impact of disinformation and voter manipulation on past elections including the UK Referendum in 2016 and are calling on the Government to launch an independent investigation.\"  Fake News  In this Final Report on 'Fake News', the committee confirms recommendations from its interim report published last year:    legal liabilities, clear in nature, to be put in place for social media companies to take measures against harmful or illegal content;  the concepts of harmful and illegal content to be defined in Code of Ethics (compulsory in nature);  a statutory regulator responsible for ensuring obedience to the code, with enforcement powers;  severe fines for transgressing companies;  removal of the defence of merely being a 'platform' without the responsibility of a 'publisher'.  Misuse of data - the targeting of individuals  The Committee slammed Facebook, referring to court documents published in December 2018 relating to the Six4Three case in the Californian circuit court. These documents (internal Facebook emails between 2011 and 2015), suggested to the Committee that the company was quite prepared to:    override its users' privacy settings with the intention of transferring data to certain App developers; and  charge high advertising prices to certain App developers, in exchange for the exchange of data, and  prevent certain App developers ( of which Six4Three was one) of that data.  The Committee has published more evidence that can be found here to support its findings in regards to the Six4Three documents.  The Committee urges Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, to investigate the practices of Facebook.  MPs did not stop there with Facebook: \"By choosing not to appear before the Committee and by choosing not to respond personally to any of our invitations, Mark Zuckerberg has shown contempt towards both our Committee and the 'International Grand Committee' involving members from nine legislators from around the world.\"  Ouch again.  Facebook and Russian disinformation  The DCMS Committee has written repeatedly to Facebook asking about Russian activity on the Facebook platform. The Committee also wanted to know what knowledge Facebook had of Russian advertisements during the US Presidential election in 2016. Many will recall that The New York Times reported in November 2018 that Facebook had discovered Russian-linked activity on its site in 2016, attempting to disrupt the US election.  Finally the DCMS committee found that two Facebook employees who gave evidence before the committee had \"deliberately misled the Committee or they were deliberately not briefed by senior executives at Facebook, about the extent of Russian interference in foreign elections\".  The way forward  The DCMS report can be seen and will be seen by many as devastating attack on Facebook and what it clearly viewed as its culture of knowing and intentional lawbreaking. But the five main recommendations (detailed above) will be seen as a sensible and pragmatic attempt by lawmakers to at least try and regulate the social media phenomenon.  Perhaps the most powerful of these is the last: remove the 'platform only' defence, acknowledge the companies as publishers and let lawyers do their job with the tools of defamation. A constant stream of law suits will force Facebook and others to take some responsibility for what they have on their platforms. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN841333120190222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGK-0PR1-DXCW-D1PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"992\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I mean, you have to look at Google in the same way we'd look at a company like Monsanto or DuPont in terms of regulating their operations to make sure that the environment is safe while jobs are created. Just the context is different,\" Rempel said.</p><p>\"The AggregateIQ outcome is a perfect example of this failure. Because if the Digital Charter actually worked, or had any sort of teeth to it, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation.\"</p><p>The Financial Post made multiple interview requests to Bains's office in the wake of the AggregateIQ report, but the minister was not made available.</p><p>\"Our competitiveness depends on our ability to use digital innovation to harness the power of data, but not at the expense of Canadians'trust,\" spokeswoman Dani Keenan said in a statement sent on Bains's behalf. \"That's why, earlier this year, Minister Bains unveiled Canada's Digital Charter, which outlines 10 key principles for continued Canadian leadership in the digital and data driven economy.\"</p><p>Around the world, the gold standard for data and privacy regulation has been GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the European regulatory behemoth that caused a lot of excitement in 2018.</p><p>However, since coming into force the law has faced heavy criticism for being too cumbersome and difficult to enforce.</p><p>In the United States, much of the conversation has focused on antitrust, and the possibility of breaking up the biggest tech companies.</p><p>Rempel said she doesn't favour either of those approaches.</p><p>She wouldn't get into the specific policy proposals the Conservatives plan on putting forward, but she said that the minority parliament gives a chance for opposition parties to drive the agenda.</p><p>In particular, she said that using legislative committees to compel documents and civil-servant testimony, along with potentially disrupting the budget process, could force the Liberals to act.</p><p>\"I have some plans for our parliamentary committee. I'll be reaching out to my opposition critics, from other political parties. And I think that, regardless of political stripe, we should be able to get some consensus on this,\" Rempel said.</p><p>While she did not want to give away her legislative agenda, one specific idea that Rempel raised is the concept that data and privacy should be valued as forms of labour; we all create data in the course of our lives, and if we put a price on that \"work\" it could create an economy for data and privacy.</p><p>Rempel said that she doesn't blame tech companies for taking advantage of the regulatory vacuum, but that as a country we need to get serious about setting boundaries for the market.</p><p>\"In the history of our species, people have always made money where they could.

The move came just a few days after privacy commissioners in Ottawa and British Columbia concluded a lengthy investigation into a Canadian company implicated in the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal.</p><p>The probe found that B.C.-based AggregateIQ had broken privacy laws in its handling of a massive trove of Facebook data that was used for political messaging purposes without proper consent, but that the regulators had no power to levy fines against the firm.</p><p>Rempel called the lack of fines a failure of government and said returning minister Navdeep Bains - whose Liberal government released a Digital Charter in the run-up to the federal election laying out a series of broad intentions such as \"A level playing field\" and \"Strong Enforcement and Real Accountability\" - has failed to enact meaningful regulation.</p><p>\"We're beyond that. I mean, you have to look at Google in the same way we'd look at a company like Monsanto or DuPont in terms of regulating their operations to make sure that the environment is safe while jobs are created. Just the context is different,\" Rempel said.</p><p>\"The AggregateIQ outcome is a perfect example of this failure. Because if the Digital Charter actually worked, or had any sort of teeth to it, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation.\"</p><p>The National Post made multiple interview requests to Bains'office in the wake of the AggregateIQ report, but the minister was not made available.</p><p>\"Our competitiveness depends on our ability to use digital innovation to harness the power of data, but not at the expense of Canadians'trust,\" spokeswoman Dani Keenan said in a statement sent on Bains' behalf. \"That's why, earlier this year, Minister Bains unveiled Canada's Digital Charter, which outlines 10 key principles for continued Canadian leadership in the digital and data driven economy.\"</p><p>Around the world, the gold-standard for data and privacy regulation has been GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the European regulatory behemoth that caused a lot of excitement in 2018. However, since coming into force the law has faced heavy criticism for being too cumbersome and difficult to enforce.</p><p>In the United States, much of the conversation has focused on anti-trust, and the possibility of breaking up the biggest tech companies.</p><p>Rempel said she doesn't favour either of those approaches. She wouldn't get into the specific policy proposals the Conservatives plan on putting forward, but she said that the minority Parliament gives a chance for opposition parties to drive the agenda.</p><p>In particular, she said that using legislative committees to compel documents and civil servant testimony, along with potentially disrupting the budget process, could force the Liberals to act.</p><p>\"I have some plans for our parliamentary committee. I'll be reaching out to my opposition critics, from other political parties. And I think that, regardless of political stripe, we should be able to get some consensus on this,\" Rempel said.</p><p>While she did not want to give away her legislative agenda, one specific idea that Rempel raised is the concept that data and privacy should be valued as forms of labour; we all create data in the course of our lives, and if we put a price on that \"work\" it could create an economy for data and privacy.</p><p>Rempel said that she doesn't blame tech companies for taking advantage of the regulatory vacuum, but that as a country we need to get serious about setting boundaries for the market.</p><p>\"In the history of our species, people have always made money where they could. It's the role of government to say the framework by which that occurs, and protect the individual,\" she said.</p><p>\"And I think the government has abdicated their responsibility in this role.\"</p><p>National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Parliament in Ottawa to force the issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Frida?, Rempel was appointed as the official opposition shadow minister for innovation, science and industr?. The move came just a few da?s after privac? commissioners in Ottawa and British Columbia concluded a length? investigation into a Canadian compan? implicated in the Cambridge Anal?tica privac? scandal.</p><p>The probe found that B.C.-based AggregateIQ had broken privac? laws in its handling of a massive trove of Facebook data that was used for political messaging purposes without proper consent, but that the regulators had no power to lev? fines against the firm.</p><p>Rempel called the lack of fines a failure of government and said returning minister Navdeep Bains - whose Liberal government released a Digital Charter in the run-up to the federal election la?ing out a series of broad intentions such as \"A level pla?ing field\" and \"Strong Enforcement and Real Accountabilit?\" - has failed to enact meaningful regulation.</p><p>\"We're be?ond that. I mean, ?ou have to look at Google in the same wa? we'd look at a compan? like Monsanto or DuPont in terms of regulating their operations to make sure that the environment is safe while jobs are created. Just the context is different,\" Rempel said.</p><p>\"The AggregateIQ outcome is a perfect example of this failure. Because if the Digital Charter actuall? worked, or had an? sort of teeth to it, ?ou and I wouldn't be having this conversation.\"</p><p>The National Post made multiple interview requests to Bains'office in the wake of the AggregateIQ report, but the minister was not made available.</p><p>\"Our competitiveness depends on our abilit? to use digital innovation to harness the power of data, but not at the expense of Canadians'trust,\" spokeswoman Dani Keenan said in a statement sent on Bains' behalf. \"That's wh?, earlier this ?ear, Minister Bains unveiled Canada's Digital Charter, which outlines 10 ke? principles for continued Canadian leadership in the digital and data driven econom?.\"</p><p>Around the world, the gold-standard for data and privac? regulation has been GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the European regulator? behemoth that caused a lot of excitement in 2018. However, since coming into force the law has faced heav? criticism for being too cumbersome and difficult to enforce.</p><p>In the United States, much of the conversation has focused on anti-trust, and the possibilit? of breaking up the biggest tech companies.</p><p>Rempel said she doesn't favour either of those approaches. She wouldn't get into the specific polic? proposals the Conservatives plan on putting forward, but she said that the minorit? Parliament gives a chance for opposition parties to drive the agenda.</p><p>In particular, she said that using legislative committees to compel documents and civil servant testimon?, along with potentiall? disrupting the budget process, could force the Liberals to act.</p><p>\"I have some plans for our parliamentar? committee. I'll be reaching out to m? opposition critics, from other political parties. And I think that, regardless of political stripe, we should be able to get some consensus on this,\" Rempel said.</p><p>While she did not want to give awa? her legislative agenda, one specific idea that Rempel raised is the concept that data and privac? should be valued as forms of labour; we all create data in the course of our lives, and if we put a price on that \"work\" it could create an econom? for data and privac?.</p><p>Rempel said that she doesn't blame tech companies for taking advantage of the regulator? vacuum, but that as a countr? we need to get serious about setting boundaries for the market.</p><p>\"In the histor? of our species, people have alwa?s made mone? where the? could. It's the role of government to sa? the framework b? which that occurs, and protect the individual,\" she said.</p><p>\"And I think the government has abdicated their responsibilit? in this role.\"</p><p>National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Steve Creamer, executive chairman of sPower and the former CEO of EnergySolutions, also warned the Public Utilities, Energy and Technology Interim Committee that failing to make changes to boost the state's portfolio of utility-scale renewable power generation would have dire economic consequences. That could include, Creamer said, losing out on luring big tech companies that are requiring renewable power access at expansion locations</p><p>\"Happy to take you to a meeting and have them tell you,\" Creamer said.\"Walmart, Microsoft, Amazon... 'We won't come to your state unless we can buy green power.' It's what they want to do.\"</p><p>Rocky Mountain Power was also targeted by sPower in an information packet presented to legislators stating that \"more projects could be built, but RMP is blocking developers.\" It goes on to cite examples of how the utility is hindering new renewable development by preventing access to transmission lines, refusing to operate the grid in a cost-effective manner and reducing terms of power purchase agreements.</p><p>Jon Cox, Rocky Mountain Power's vice president for government affairs, warned that the state should exercise caution when considering investments in renewables. He cited the current glut of green power generated in California that at times forces the state into \"negative pricing\" situations that result in having to pay customers to take the power off their hands.</p><p>\"I would warn the state of Utah about following California's lead in following these energy proposals,\" Cox said. \"Do we want to build significant amount of new capacity at great cost in a market that's rapidly changing?\"</p><p>Cox also rebutted sPowers claims about transmission lines, citing limited carrying capacity issues for the lines the company controls.</p><p>\"One thing we cannot repeal is the law of physics,\" Cox said. \"Congestion traffic is real. We're not trying to stall development.\"</p><p>Bill Green, CEO of MIC Renewable Energy Holdings also presented to the committee, via phone, and concurred with Creamer, at least as far as potential negative economic impacts and a need for regulatory change are concerned. He also added that the decision-making process should consider the aggressively pro-renewable energy stances taken by neighboring states.</p><p>\"I think for the state of Utah ... this is the single greatest economic development opportunity the state has ever had in your lifetimes,\" Green said. \"You are in competition, make no mistake about it.\"</p><p>Green sounded a more conciliatory tone than Creamer, however, when speaking about what role Rocky Mountain Power would best play in creating more renewable power generation in the state.</p><p>\"I actually see it differently in Utah at the moment,\" Green said. \"There's an opportunity to work with the utility, not frame it as 'us versus them.' \"</p><p>Green, Creamer and Cox did find some space for agreement on the issue that has kept renewable energy sources like solar and wind power from becoming reliable, around the clock \"base load\" providers - battery-based power storage. While the cost and efficiency of battery backup to store power when it's windy or sunny to provide power when it's dark and still has improved dramatically in the past few years, the technology has not progressed to where it needs to be just yet.</p><p>The cost of generating renewable energy has, however, crossed a threshold now falling into the 3-cents-per-kilowatt-hour range, according to Creamer, which is competitive with the cost of electricity generated by coal and gas sources.</p><p>HEAL Utah's senior policy associate Michael Shea, who was present at the meeting, said that this new fiscal reality was something Rocky Mountain Power needed to acknowledge when deciding its role in the state's energy generation future.</p><p>\"For the first time, the utility is having to deal with the fact that renewables are cheaper than traditional fossil fuels,\" Shea said. \"They need to decide whether they want to continue to live in the past or do business with companies like sPower, which represent the future.\"</p><p>Currently, about 12 percent of the electricity generated in Utah comes from renewable sources.</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p><p>Twitter: DNTechHive</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-22032394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P9X-3FV1-DY6J-M336-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"739\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 24, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001UM9</classCode><className>PACIFICORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009SN7</classCode><className>ENERGYSOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009AOK</classCode><className>RENEWABLE ENERGY HOLDINGS PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>REH (LSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000477</classCode><className>DEREGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009G7Z</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

Le d\u00e9bat est en France tranch\u00e9, si l'on peut dire, depuis toujours, par les g\u00e8nes du pays. R\u00e9ponse : trop. Les profits sont extravagants, les r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations des patrons scandaleuses, les \u00ab gilets jaunes \u00bb sont malheureux, la plan\u00e8te est surexploit\u00e9e, le march\u00e9 a tout le pouvoir. L'Etat doit reprendre la main.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cette renaissance des id\u00e9es interventionnistes \u00ab de gauche \u00bb ne se voit pas dans la politique nationale, si on en croit les sondages, \u00e0 cause du go\u00fbt des partis pour la division. Mais elle s'observe ailleurs, dans les pays qui ont fait l'exp\u00e9rience de l'inanit\u00e9 populiste, comme la Grande-Bretagne et les Etats-Unis.</p><p>Partout, la gauche red\u00e9couvre une vision traditionnelle d'un Etat fort qui, pourtant, a depuis belle lurette montr\u00e9 ses limites. Le principe du \u00ab taxer et d\u00e9penser \u00bb revient dans les programmes. La remont\u00e9e des vieilles recettes va, dans la bouche d'Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, dite \u00ab AOC \u00bb, toute jeune d\u00e9mocrate brillamment \u00e9lue \u00e0 New York lors des \u00ab midterms \u00bb l'an pass\u00e9, jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00f4ner l'usage sans limite de la planche \u00e0 billets par le gouvernement pour financer les besoins sociaux et environnementaux. Elle s'appuie sur une certaine \u00ab MMT \u00bb (\u00ab modern monetary policy \u00bb), invent\u00e9e il y a un si\u00e8cle. Partie sur ces pistes d'avant-hier, la gauche n'ira pas loin.</p><h>R\u00e9gulation d\u00e9faillante</h><p>Autrement f\u00e9conde est l'\u00e9cole qui explique la d\u00e9faillance des Etats, non parce qu'ils sont \u00e0 court d'argent mais parce qu'ils ont failli \u00e0 installer une bonne r\u00e9gulation du march\u00e9. Le constat de d\u00e9part est le m\u00eame : les fruits du capitalisme sont capt\u00e9s par quelques-uns, les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s se sont creus\u00e9es au point que les majorit\u00e9s des populations souffrent, les populistes prosp\u00e8rent sur cet \u00e9chec.</p><h>Lire aussi :</h><p>La lutte contre les monopoles est un combat pour la libert\u00e9 (Gaspard Koenig)</p><p>La faute en revient \u00e0 l'Etat, non parce qu'il est appauvri mais parce que, mauvais r\u00e9gulateur, il a laiss\u00e9 s'installer des monopoles. Le \u00ab pouvoir de march\u00e9 \u00bb des grandes firmes s'est accru depuis vingt-cinq ans dans les deux tiers des secteurs aux Etats-Unis. La concentration du capital y est devenue historiquement \u00e9lev\u00e9e. En t\u00e9moignent les profits record qui repr\u00e9sentent 76 % du PIB outre-Atlantique, au plus haut depuis un demi-si\u00e8cle, a calcul\u00e9 \u00ab The Economist \u00bb (17 novembre 2018). On peut vouloir taxer ces monopoles, l'Europe le fait avec les Gafa. La bonne solution est de les casser, de r\u00e9tablir la concurrence, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un lib\u00e9ralisme efficace.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon devraient aujourd'hui subir le sort d'un Rockefeller - dont l'empire p\u00e9trolier Standard Oil fut d\u00e9mantel\u00e9 en 1911. Mais ce n'est pas fait parce que les grandes firmes ont \u00ab capt\u00e9 \u00bb trop de force l\u00e9gislative \u00e0 Washington. L'Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e, elle n'a plus de pouvoir sur la structure de l'offre (Facebook a pu acheter Instagram en 2012, puis WhatsApp en 2014), et ne peut intervenir que si elle prouve que le consommateur est l\u00e9s\u00e9. L'est-il ? En proposant un livre proche de ceux que vous avez pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment command\u00e9s ou un h\u00f4tel pour les vacances, Big Tech rend service au consommateur.

Le d\u00e9bat est en France tranch\u00e9, si l'on peut dire, depuis toujours, par les g\u00e8nes du pays. R\u00e9ponse : trop. Les profits sont extravagants, les r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations des patrons scandaleuses, les \u00ab gilets jaunes \u00bb sont malheureux, la plan\u00e8te est surexploit\u00e9e, le march\u00e9 a tout le pouvoir. L'Etat doit reprendre la main.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cette renaissance des id\u00e9es interventionnistes \u00ab de gauche \u00bb ne se voit pas dans la politique nationale, si on en croit les sondages, \u00e0 cause du go\u00fbt des partis pour la division. Mais elle s'observe ailleurs, dans les pays qui ont fait l'exp\u00e9rience de l'inanit\u00e9 populiste, comme la Grande-Bretagne et les Etats-Unis.</p><p>Partout, la gauche red\u00e9couvre une vision traditionnelle d'un Etat fort qui, pourtant, a depuis belle lurette montr\u00e9 ses limites. Le principe du \u00ab taxer et d\u00e9penser \u00bb revient dans les programmes. La remont\u00e9e des vieilles recettes va, dans la bouche d'Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, dite \u00ab AOC \u00bb, toute jeune d\u00e9mocrate brillamment \u00e9lue \u00e0 New York lors des \u00ab midterms \u00bb l'an pass\u00e9, jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00f4ner l'usage sans limite de la planche \u00e0 billets par le gouvernement pour financer les besoins sociaux et environnementaux. Elle s'appuie sur une certaine \u00ab MMT \u00bb (\u00ab modern monetary policy \u00bb), invent\u00e9e il y a un si\u00e8cle. Partie sur ces pistes d'avant-hier, la gauche n'ira pas loin.</p><p>Autrement f\u00e9conde est l'\u00e9cole qui explique la d\u00e9faillance des Etats, non parce qu'ils sont \u00e0 court d'argent mais parce qu'ils ont failli \u00e0 installer une bonne r\u00e9gulation du march\u00e9. Le constat de d\u00e9part est le m\u00eame : les fruits du capitalisme sont capt\u00e9s par quelques-uns, les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s se sont creus\u00e9es au point que les majorit\u00e9s des populations souffrent, les populistes prosp\u00e8rent sur cet \u00e9chec.</p><p>La faute en revient \u00e0 l'Etat, non parce qu'il est appauvri mais parce que, mauvais r\u00e9gulateur, il a laiss\u00e9 s'installer des monopoles. Le \u00ab pouvoir de march\u00e9 \u00bb des grandes firmes s'est accru depuis vingt-cinq ans dans les deux tiers des secteurs aux Etats-Unis. La concentration du capital y est devenue historiquement \u00e9lev\u00e9e. En t\u00e9moignent les profits record qui repr\u00e9sentent 76 % du PIB outre-Atlantique, au plus haut depuis un demi-si\u00e8cle, a calcul\u00e9 \u00ab The Economist \u00bb (17 novembre 2018). On peut vouloir taxer ces monopoles, l'Europe le fait avec les Gafa. La bonne solution est de les casser, de r\u00e9tablir la concurrence, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un lib\u00e9ralisme efficace.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon devraient aujourd'hui subir le sort d'un Rockefeller - dont l'empire p\u00e9trolier Standard Oil fut d\u00e9mantel\u00e9 en 1911. Mais ce n'est pas fait parce que les grandes firmes ont \u00ab capt\u00e9 \u00bb trop de force l\u00e9gislative \u00e0 Washington. L'Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e, elle n'a plus de pouvoir sur la structure de l'offre (Facebook a pu acheter Instagram en 2012, puis WhatsApp en 2014), et ne peut intervenir que si elle prouve que le consommateur est l\u00e9s\u00e9. L'est-il ? En proposant un livre proche de ceux que vous avez pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment command\u00e9s ou un h\u00f4tel pour les vacances, Big Tech rend service au consommateur. Difficile de prouver qu'il est l\u00e9s\u00e9.</p><p>Mais les lib\u00e9raux n'ont pas dit leur dernier mot. Big Tech a d\u00e9rap\u00e9. En vendant les donn\u00e9es personnelles \u00e0 des fins politiques (Cambridge Analytica). En laissant foisonner sur le Net des propos liberticides et en ne tenant jamais les promesses faites d'endosser la responsabilit\u00e9 de ce qui se diffuse et de limiter les haines et les fausses nouvelles. Le \u00ab ciblage \u00bb publicitaire est devenu \u00ab manipulation \u00bb, glissant dans un<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab capitalisme de surveillance \u00bb</emphasis>, selon Shoshana Zuboff (1), o\u00f9 les comportements sont normalis\u00e9s par les \u00ab amis \u00bb sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux. L'arriv\u00e9e de l'intelligence artificielle ne peut que renforcer cette modernit\u00e9 ali\u00e9nante \u00e0 la Orwell... \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence pr\u00e8s que le Big Brother est cette fois nous tous.</p><p>Et si \u00ab les donn\u00e9es \u00bb devenaient le troisi\u00e8me facteur \u00e9conomique aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s du capital et du travail, comme le propose Eric Posner, professeur \u00e0 Chicago (2) ? Chacun serait propri\u00e9taire de l'historique de son comportement (d\u00e9placement, achats, lectures...), il serait r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 par les plates-formes quand elles l'utilisent et chacun doit pouvoir \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ses data pour les \u00ab louer \u00bb mieux \u00e0 une autre plate-forme.</p><p>Pour redonner confiance dans le capitalisme, faut-il ressortir les vieilles id\u00e9es de gauche ou inventer, au travers des technologies, des approches neuves ? Pour s'enrichir, le d\u00e9bat politique devrait, en France, abandonner les pens\u00e9es toutes faites sur la concurrence et le lib\u00e9ralisme.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"81fe039a1e5d0d4ef60eb6c8e4f11259\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/></p><p>Voir aussi: <br/><link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>[20/02/2019] Quel prix pour notre vie priv\u00e9e ?</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"DOC-ID\"/><keyValue value=\"LESECH-0600734599350\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>Voir aussi: <br/><link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>[04/07/2018] Pourquoi les Etats-Unis doivent r\u00e9guler les Gafa</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"DOC-ID\"/><keyValue value=\"LESECH-0301917718287\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>Voir aussi: <br/><link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>[24/05/2018] L'Europe lance son big bang de la protection des donn\u00e9es</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"DOC-ID\"/><keyValue value=\"LESECH-0301714895240\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>Voir aussi: <br/><link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>[22/05/2018] Ne diabolisons pas les Gafa !</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"DOC-ID\"/><keyValue value=\"LESECH-0301686319964\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>fichier PDF de ce document</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29031912\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LESECH-060986243017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LESECH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRY-XDT1-JCR4-X2SR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">233065</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Groupe Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Les Echos</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>N\u00b0. 22918</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>vendredi 29 mars 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For some big-time tech investors still aren't happy.  Could this be  a sign of the top?  Buyer beware, the one word that sells $40 billion worth  of food each year and means absolutely nothing.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And paying up for some will power.  We'll introduce you to the company that  will help you unplug for a price.  Because even when they say it's not it  is always about money.  Economic realities hitting home for more than 40  million American families.  A new study out of Harvard University finding  that 35 percent of U.S. households can't afford their current living  situation.  With me now, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Veronica Dagher,  editor of \"Power Trend Profits, Chris Versace and Dominick Tavella of  Diversified Financial.  Thanks to all of you for joining us.  So, what that  means is that their rent or their mortgage consumes 30 percent of their  monthly income.  I mean this is huge.  This is 40 million Americans.  For a  lot of them it consumes 50 percent! Veronica, this is a disaster.  </p><p/><p> VERONICA DAGHER, Fox BUSINESS:  It is a disaster especially because the  more you spend on housing the less you have to spend on other things like  consumer discretionary goods.  And so that has larger effects to our  economy.  These people are spending so much on their rent they can't go be  buying, you know, new cars or taking vacations.  They just don't have the  money.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  And a lot of the problems has to do with the fact that incomes  aren't growing, right, Chris? </p><p/><p> CHRIS VERSACE, POWERTREND PROFIST:  Absolutely.  I mean you look at all the  jobs that we've seen created, but we look at the mix of those jobs, lower  income jobs.  So, there's not a lot of wage growth.  We are seeing  inflation across food and energy, and to your point, Veronica, disposable  income is going to be tapped, so where are these people going to live?</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  No, I mean among the other problems that creates when you look at  the GDP print that we saw this week and just the big pullback, a lot of it  had to do with consumer spending.  You're not spending on discretionary  goods if you have this much of your money going to your rent and mortgage,  right? </p><p/><p> DOMINICK TAVELLA, DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL:  Not only that.  But it's the tax  consequence what is happened in the first quarter.  So, people paying much  higher taxes than they were before.  They are paying much higher in cost of  living issues, even though the government says there is no cost of living.   Cost of housing has gone through the roof.  It really as depressed the  average consumer what they can actually do out there.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  OK, more fallout from Barclays, over alleged dark pool fraud.   Charlie Gasparino first reported New York's lawsuit against Barclay's right  here on \"MONEY.\"  Now, they're getting the cold shoulder from several big  name brokerage firms, including Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada.   Chris, this is an interesting one.  Because it seems like dark pools, if  you look at this, we may die their own death.  If now people are afraid  when they stay away from them.  What do you think?</p><p/><p>VERSACE:  I think you're absolutely right on that.  We are ultimately  designed for, which was to allow large pools to be traded, you know, it's  very anonymously, so people can move in and out.  But where there is lot of  smoke there is fire.  The SEC is investigating.  And all of a sudden what  may have been once so safe may not be.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Veronica.  </p><p/><p> VERONICA DAGHER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  I think investors are going to be  demanding more transparency in this case.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  They want to see what's going on.  They're called dark pools for a  reason. </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  For a reason, right.</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  Yes.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  It is the opposite of transparency.  That is the whole point.</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  That's right, yeah.  And I think a lot of these firms that are  stepping away from their connections to Barclays right now.  You know,  there is a PR component to this, too.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  Nobody wants to be associated with a firm that could be saying  false things to investors.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  What is so appalling about this, if it is true, Dominick, you  know, the charges that on one hand they were saying that they weren't  allowing traders to have preference a step ahead of others at the very same  time that they were doing exactly that within their dark pools.  And  really, I mean, once again, it's just like such a big knock on Wall Street.  </p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  Yeah, two things - first this is not a small investor problem.   This is really institutional.  Traders were looking to do big block trades  and not let the whole world know what they're doing.  Having said that they  need to have a credibility, a trust with the institution that they're doing  it.  That they're getting fair pricing.  That trades are being done orderly  and efficiently.  And when that doesn't happen the trust gets cut.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  But it does have to do with the small investor because it's this  idea that Wall Street is rigged.  And there's more and more of these  stories come out.  It makes a little guy feel like why in the world should  I even get involved and why should I invest?  Meanwhile, I mean the stock  market has this thing that has really gone up in this recovery.  So, if  you're on the sidelines because you're paranoid you really lost out</p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  If the small investor out there trading 100 shares of Facebook,  this is not their world, OK?  And whether they should or shouldn't be  trading on .</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Nobody keeps them away from investing at all, Veronica.</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  It's the express issue, yeah.  They're even more skeptical.  And  they don't even understand what a dark pool is.  A lot of professionals  don't understand what that is.  So, it's just - it's more confusion and  more skepticism.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.  All right, the federal government is set to auction off  $17 million worth of bitcoin today.  This is all courtesy of the shuttered  online market silk road.  The online sell is shrouded in secrecy, speaking  of secrecy, and is attracting some financial power players.  Veronica, I  mean, this is an interesting one.  If they just went ahead and put all this  out on the open market, bitcoin, it would totally depress the price. </p><p/><p> DAGHER:  Yeah, it would sink the price.  It's going to be interesting to  see how the government handles this.  You know, it's not like selling  confiscated Chevys that they have got from drug bust.</p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  So, how this plays out and how the investors, you know, I think  there were investor lists, potential bidder lists released already.  How  that affects the bidding will be interesting to watch.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah, Chris, are you watching this one?</p><p/><p>VERSACE:  I'm watching it a little bit.  I'm wondering why the government  doesn't pull in like a currency trader or somebody in the know for dealing  with this .</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I thought they were?  They're not doing that? </p><p/><p>VERSACE:  You know, it sounds like they're doing it in-house.  We know that  they are not going to do it well.  So, you know, how well can they leak  this out?  That's the big question.  </p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  What is interesting that they confiscated these bitcoins from a  criminal entity, right?  The criminals are figuring out, bitcoin is the  perfect tool to buy and sell assets without having trunk loads of 100- dollar bills.  So, I think that's what's probably more interesting about  this, is the government has figured it out, criminals figured it out, this  is a perfect vehicle to trade value back and forth.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right, iPhones hitting the bargain bin at  Walmart.  The retailer pricing Apple's smartphone for the - is rolling back  prices to $29.  I mean I can't believe this, the iPhone 5-c, $29.  You have  to buy a two year contract, but come on.  Amazing.  </p><p/><p> DAGHER:  Yeah, it's really cheap.  But I think this is interesting because  Walmart is only applying this deal for people who come into their stores.   And I think this speaks to Walmart really needing to drive traffic.   They're losing out on foot traffic.  They're doing pretty good online, but  they're trying to find a way to how to get people in these huge stores and  that is a real issue.  This might be a strategy to .</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah, pretty smart thing for us.</p><p/><p>VERSACE:  Well, you know, two things.  One I think it is smart for Walmart  to bring people in to get them to shop and buy all these things.  But also,  I think it's smart for Apple.  Remember the 5C was not a big volume device.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p>VERSACE:  It's a nice way for them to kind of flush out all the inventory  in the channel potentially ahead of the iPhone 6.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I think it's also interesting to me it means that, Apple has  power to sell all across the price spectrum.  Because it used to be the  really high cost phone and you saw everybody, you know, couldn't afford it.  </p><p/><p>VERSACE:  We don't know, necessarily know that it is Apple who is selling  it for $29 through Walmart.  Walmart could actually be buying the phone and  subsidizing it to bring people in, kind of a loss leader.</p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  You know, Melissa, I will take the opposite of this one.  Steve  Jobs is going to be turning in his grave.</p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  But it's only with Apple cutting-edge technology, but this posh,  this mystique, it was a Gucci bag, it was the Armani.  Now, they are  selling it on the discount bin in Walmart.  I think it takes some of the  luster away from Apple.  I don't know.  I think it takes the shine off.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I think - interesting.  All right.  Life on Wall Street proving  no piece of cake for Crumbs Bakery.  The one time king of cupcakes will be  dropped by the NASDAQ after falling by more than 80 percent in the past  year.  I mean I don't know if you guys notice this, they're on every corner  right now.  They have 70 stores.  22 of which were open in the last year.   There is one on my block.  There is another cupcake store within the next  block.  How many cupcake stores do we need, Chris?</p><p/><p>VERSACE:  Not that many apparently.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Apparently, not that many.</p><p/><p>VERSACE:  And the thing is, you know, you can go almost anywhere now and  get cupcakes.  You can go to Starbucks and get cupcakes.  You can go to .</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Big cupcakes.  </p><p/><p>VERSACE:  Panera Bread and all this ...</p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  You can actually buy their cupcakes at BJ's.  So, again, this  idea, this mystique, this great store, you walk into, now they have kind of  tarnished their brand.  Competitors are coming.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Isn't that a warning, so we have this huge IPO rush going on  right now.  I mean, you know, that it is - it's going to be the biggest  week since 2006.  I remember when Crumbs went public and I thought it was  the most ridiculous thing.  So, I'm like how can you be a public company  when all you do is sell cupcakes?  Is this the warning to Yo or all these  other things?  What do you think of it?</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  That is the point.  Maybe not everyone should go public.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  Maybe it's not a good idea.  </p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  So, let's look at Starbucks, right?  Same theme.  It's just  coffee instead of a cupcake.  They reinvented themselves, reinvented  themselves, reinvented themselves and expanded intelligently.  This company  didn't single product.  Lots of competition.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I guess, although you - almost everybody needs a cup of coffee to  get through the day.  I don't need a cupcake.  </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  I probably need it, but .</p><p/><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  All right, I'm going to lose my job.</p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Riding shotgun wedding.  Uber expanding its reach into marital  bliss, bringing free full service weddings to some lucky couples tomorrow.   So I thought, you know, Uber is the king of this, we'll do something, you  know, within an hour, bring it to you.  They always have a gimmick on in  order to promote themselves.  But this one is really special.  Because they  say you just need to bring enough legal documents to get a marriage license  with you, but they will provide the notary and a qualified officiate to  handle the paperwork - ceremony, not to mention all the other accoutrements  that go with it.  Veronica.</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  Oh, man, I just got married.  </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  And I wish that .</p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  Actually, no.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Will they do on demand divorce next?</p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  That might drive volume.   FRANCIS:  I don't know.  I mean in Vegas it's easy to get married proving  that you really shouldn't most of the time.  Like they make it too easy.   So, maybe these guys are doing the same thing.  </p><p/><p>VERSACE:  You know, Melissa, I'm going to turn it back to you.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p/><p>VERSACE:  Would you say that nothing says romance like Uber? </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I don't know.  Quickie wedding, it is very romantic.  </p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  But Uber has done a lot of these kinds of gimmicks, right?</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  It's funny.</p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  It's a hell of a lot cheaper than hiring a Park Avenue  advertising firm. </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p> TAVELLA:  Lots of PR.  Get the name out there.  It's fabulous.  We laugh  about it.  It's good stuff.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  You guys were fantastic.  Thank you so much. </p><p/><p> Coming up the great band of China.  Why Hillary Clinton's new book won't be  hitting the bestseller's list in Shanghai anytime soon.  </p><p/><p> Plus, consumer sentiment is on the rise, but will feelings be enough to  beat what lies beneath?  \"THE MONEY\" hard truth coming up.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Walking on sunshine.  Consumer sentiment on the rise of beating  street expectations today.  Is this a ray of hope?  Here now, Fox  Business's Charlie Gasparino along with Veronica Dagher and former CBO  director Doug Holtz-Eakin.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Doug, I'm going  to let you go first.</p><p/><p> DOUGH HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CBO DIRECTOR:  Thank you.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Because you're on the road there.  Consumer sentiment rising  higher today.  The consumer is what was missing from the GDP report.   Consumer spending was very weak.  That was one of the big reasons we saw  the big contraction.  Does this mean things are about to get better? </p><p/><p> HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I don't think so.  If you look inside the numbers, they're  happier about what is going on right now, but they are not more confident  about the future.  And if you look at the monthly data, we've seen in the  past two months, the first two months of the second quarter, real declines  in personal consumption expenditures.  So, there is not a lot out there to  suggest the households are going to pick up this economy and carry it.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  You know, Charlie, I always laugh when I see the consumer  sentiment numbers.  Because it's like asking people what they will do.   It's not what they're actually doing. </p><p/><p> CHARLIE GASPARINO, Fox BUSINESS:  Right.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I mean it's like how you are feeling. </p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  What they might do .</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  In the future maybe, possibly.  I would just say this about - I  think that negative GDP print was probably somewhat of an aberration.  I  don't think we're in a recession right now.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  It certainly make the recipe - you look like .</p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  It's not - it's not - I'm not going to say that's good.  But  you know, one thing about the Obama economy.  We've seen this one before,  where you have a blip up in GDP you have a blip up in consumer confidence.   And then you get a blip down and then you really have very, very little  economic growth. </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  And it all nets out to just standing still.  That's right.  </p><p/><p> HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Charlie, may I point something out? </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah. </p><p/><p> HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I mean here is the thing, Charlie.  With the first quarter  that we got, we'd have to go to 3.7 percent every quarter for the rest of  the year, just to hit two percent for the year.  </p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  OK.</p><p/><p> HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Never seen that in this presidency.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  And Veronica, I would say on the horizon, I mean, we have the  specter of potential inflation.  Have you heard James Bullard here on Fox  Business earlier this week, he's already saying it's going to be hotter  than we thought.  Consumers as they go to the store every day, they  certainly feel it being hotter every day.  I mean is that a real threat,  inflation? </p><p/><p> DAGHER:  Yeah, I think it is.  Yes, you go to the grocery store now, things  cost more than they did a couple of months ago.  So, I think that is a real  issue.  And also, if you look at the personal spending numbers we got for  May.  If you adjust for inflation, those numbers actually went down.  So, I  think between that and people's fears about the economy, they are still  seeing people - their neighbors without a job for a long time, people are  underemployed.  They're afraid to spend.  So, we're going to see the  savings rates continue to go up until we feel more secure.  I don't know  what that's going to take, though, to make them feel more secure.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I mean Doug you are saying, you know, we would have to be above  three percent for the rest of year in order to even out to something.  What  do you think is going to happen for the rest of the year?</p><p/><p> HOLTZ-EAKIN:  What this economy has done for years - is it's along the two  percent.  That's been the average consumption for growth, household  spending growth, there's no evidence that they are going to change their  behavior.  They don't have the income or the sentiment to do it.   Businesses are the wildcard. </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p> HOLTZ-EAKIN:  And if they somehow get some animal spirits and go with the  big cap-ex expansion then we can get a good year, but I don't see that,  Charlie.  </p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  I agree with you.  If you're talking about two percent growth  and you have .</p><p/><p> HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I am.  </p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  And you're talking about inflation in certain sectors where the  Fed has to raise rates, we're heading for a recession.  I mean Hillary  Clinton runs for office.  If she runs in 2015, 2016, she is very possible,  that she runs in the middle of an economic downturn.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Interesting.  Meanwhile, you always make the point, Charlie, and  you are right, the only one who's getting rich in this economy right now  are people who are in the market.  Because that is what all this Fed work  has done, it's just stimulated the stock market.  It's ironic that these  policies out of Washington, all they've helped the one percent, who they  say they hate.  So, very interesting.  Guys, thanks to all of you for  joining us.  From the U.S. to every corner of globe money is flying around  the world today starting in Germany which has canceled the contract with  Verizon over fears that the U.S. is spying on them.  It all goes back to  documents leaked by Edward Snowden, which revealed we had kind of an  eavesdropping on calls made by Chancellor Angela Merkel.  You remember  that, right?  Germans, they were not so amused by that, especially as the  U.S. still refuses to agree with a no spy deal with the country.  Verizon  now bearing the brunt of that.  It has been providing a communications  network to the German government since 2010.</p><p/><p> Over to Japan, which is now exporting square watermelons to grow throughout  the globe. They curious, look at that are grown in boxes from a very young  age.  It sounds cruel.  Which forces them into a cube-like shape.  They  weigh 13-pounds a apiece.  Look at them.</p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Well, I think about it, no, no, no.   Now they are making way to  fruit stand in Canada.  They don't come cheap.  One sold in Moscow last  year, went for more than 800 bucks.  Juicy profits indeed.  Landing in  China where Hillary Clinton is getting the cold shoulder by officials.   Publishers there say they will not be purchasing the translation rights to  her new book.  Local agencies have banned the English language version from  being imported.   There are a few parts of book where she is somewhat  critical of the Chinese government.  You know, we kind of saw that one  coming, right? </p><p/><p> Crying wolves of Wall Street.  The hottest week for IPOs in years and still  not enough for some of the tech heavyweights.  That picture is going to  come back to haunt that guy.  Plus, if you can't win them, beer them.  One  job hunter's clever case to seal the deal.  We're raking in the money  coming up next.  See this of this guy.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Hold on tight.  Shares of the venture camera maker GoPro powering  higher in the second day of trading.  Let's go to Ashley Webster on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  For more on this, when even higher  today, Ashley.</p><p/><p> ASHLEY WEBSTER, Fox BUSINESS:  You know what they should do, Melissa.   Scrap one of those GoPro cameras on the stock, of what you go up and down.   Mostly up.  But as we know, when - yesterday, the price was set at $24.  It  shot up yesterday and today.  Look at this, it actually went above the $40  mark briefly before coming back down, still up 17percent.  What else would  you expect from this Adrenalin play on GoPro?</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Absolutely, still, Michael's not looking like a masterpiece,  though, on its return to the market? </p><p/><p> WEBSTER:  No, a tale of two IPOs.  Really, although that said, Michael's  pricing it $17, debuting on the NASDAQ today, came out very slowly.   Actually, went down below the IPO price.  But it since inched its way up,  and at least showing some positive signs, up 17, 1363 on the day.  Up about  three quarters of a percent.  The arts and crafts.  You know, by the way, I  didn't realize, they also own the Aaron Brothers chain as well.  So they go  public finally.  And up about 17, as I say, 14 cents above the share price  that was listed.  So, a slow but steady start I guess we'll call it.  No  GoPro.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  OK. All right, Ashley, thanks so much.  So, the market wrapping  up its biggest week for IPOs in eight years.  Some big tech investors are  not breaking out the champagne.  Rather, they're crying about how hard it  is to go public.  Somewhere alone violin plays for them.  Is this a sign of  the top?  Charlie is back with us, along with Scott Martin from United  Advisors and Jonathan Hoenig from CapitalistPig Hedge Fund.  They're both  Fox News contributors.  So, I mean it has been the week of endless IPOs.   Still, you have Marc Andreessen up there saying, it comes across like I'm  complaining about how hard it is to be public.  Of course, the answer is,  you just need to suck it up.  I mean poor IPO guys getting out there and  making a fortune.  Jonathan, ridiculous?</p><p/><p> JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG HEDGE FUND:  No, but we should be happy  they're getting out there making a fortune, Melissa.  We should be happy  that deals are getting done and still being priced.  I don't think this is  the death of the IPO market at all, as you pointed out.  It was an  extremely busy week for IPOs.  And you know, you'll the death comes when  you see the IPOs starts coming public and just falling flat.  It happened  in 1999 .</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  No, I know, but Scott . -- </p><p/><p> HOENIG:  In 2000.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I don't think it's so much the death of the IPO.  I think it is  more of a sign of the top.  That you have a zillion coming out.  It's the  most in whatever we - you know, eight years.  And then you have people  complaining about how hard it is when here, everyone is doing it.  How hard  could it be?  What do you think?</p><p/><p> SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS:  Well ..</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Everybody's got.</p><p/><p> MARTIN:  You're right, everybody is doing it.  But here's the thing,  Melissa.  I mean Andreessen is complaining about the pricing I think more  than anything.  And he's talking about back in the '90s with Netscape and  some of these other companies coming out at 2 billion valuation was kind of  the status quo.  Now you have got companies like Uber that are in - you  know, $17 billion-dollar range.  Even interest is somewhere between five  and six billion.  Here is the funny thing, right?  GoPro is somewhere  around 3 billion, but the stock is up gigantically, since it's IPO, because  probably too cheap.  So, it's more about pricing issue, but like Jonathan  said I will never disagree with somebody in a seersucker suit, by the way. </p><p/><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p> MARTIN:  That's the - stock, and that is why the prices are going up.  </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Charlie.  </p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  I'm not quite sure what Andreessen is complaining about.  I  mean is he complaining about the regulations?</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  He's talking about for the young companies, you know, there is  such a microscope on you.  Every part of your business ends up being  connected and end up being tied back to your self-pricing and morale.</p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  Well, too bad, pal.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  I mean, you know, that's what - you want to be a public  company, you are going to have some regulations you have to follow.  I will  say this, though.  Listen, it is great that they're coming public.  We  should point out that the NASDAQ has been overshadowed.  This has been  overshadowed.  NASDAQ has done 100 tech IPOs in the past year.  That's what  I'm .</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  It's amazing. </p><p/><p> HOENIG:  Can I just comment quickly?</p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  And, you know, they didn't win the Alibaba one, but they won  some other ones.  We had Ashley on the floor of the stock exchange. </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  NASDAQ won, I think, GoPro, right?</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p/><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  To make this point.  You guys can jump in.  Let me make this  point, Jonathan.  When you are getting numbers like this you're getting  close to a top.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  It is not general .</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Jonathan, real quick, last comment, go ahead.  </p><p/><p> HOENIG:  What's - I don't know, Charlie has been - I know calling for a  tough for at least a couple of weeks or months now.  And you say boo-hoo  hoo for companies that are trying to become public.</p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  Months.  </p><p/><p> HOENIG:  Think back to before Sarbanes-Oxley.  It has been harder and  harder for small companies to raise money.  That's why now some of them are  trying to use the Jobs Act to raise money. </p><p/><p> GASPARINO:  Why are we seeing .?</p><p/><p> HOENIG:  Because those regulations are so extensive.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  We have got to go.  You guys can keep fighting in the break.   That's fine.  Thanks, guys.  All right, there is no margin of error for  this comeback.  American demand for natural ingredients just keeps on  growing, and the likes of butter are on a roll, get it?  Get it?  I know,  one too many jokes in there for me.  Plus, as good as Goldberg.

Surveillance drones  from Iran are flying over the country.  The White House is looking to  Syrian rebels to potentially play a role.</p><p/><p> Joining me now, Chris Harmer, from the Institute for the Study of War and  Fox News Middle East expert, Walid Phares.  Chris, let me start with you.   I mean, this situation is intensifying.</p><p/><p> CHRIS HARMER, INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR:  Melissa, it's a pleasure to  be here, thanks for having me.  Yes, the situation is intensifying.  If you  look at is the snapshot, it looks like ISIS is culminating with this  massive offensive.  In fact, if you look closer at what they have been  doing the past two years they have been building towards this.</p><p/><p> They have done all the small building blocks they need to organize their  terrorist state and using that to attack the  government in Mosul, which  they've already won and they are now taking over the western desert areas  of Iraq that used to be dominated by the Sunni tribes.</p><p/><p> The real question here is, is the Iraqi security force going to be able to  respond to this?  So far the answer is no.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Walid, I mean, it's not about just about Iraq.  It's about the  entire region being sucked into this conflict as we said.  Look at the  White House proposing to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels, how do you  identify a moderate Syrian rebels are?</p><p/><p> DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS MIDDLE EAST EXPERT:  Speaking of how many  countries, let's do the count, Syria was involved, and they are considering  those.  Lebanon may go in because Lebanon also has pro and against ISIS.   Iran by sending the drones into Iraq will shoot against them.  How will we  identify the market?</p><p/><p> We're five years late.  We have been urging the administration since the  Arabs spring to do so in civil society.  Now it will be time to find a less  Islamist and jihadists on the ground, this is not something that will have  a bright future.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  So if everyone in the region is getting involved, is that an  argument for us to get involved or to stand back?  Chris, what do you  think?</p><p/><p> HARMER:  It's wrong for the U.S. to get involve.  Look, we have strategic  interests in Syria whether we want to acknowledge it or not.  We have  strategic interests in Iraq whether we want to acknowledge it or not.  It  is easy to embrace the isolationist argument, but in today's interconnected  world it's not possible.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  What are the interests?</p><p/><p> HARMER:  We do not want to see a caliphate organized in Eastern Syria and  Western Iraq where ISIS has the complete safe haven.  If you look at what  al Qaeda had in Afghanistan, they had a safe haven as guests of the  Taliban.  What they are organizing is a nation state where they are guests  of nobody and beholden to no one.  They can do whatever they want.</p><p/><p> In fact, one of the arguments between ISIS and al Qaeda, al Qaeda saw how  many fighters that ISIS was attracting, Europe, North America.  They said  you should use those guys right now to export terror back.  ISIS said no.   We will win the war here first and then have this cadres of several  thousand battle hardened formerly trained terrorists going back to Europe  and North America with passports and terrorist attacks here.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  So Walid, is it realistic to think that we can do something to  break up that safe phase?</p><p/><p> PHARES:  We could have, should have and continue to consider those  situations.  Let me say this.  If ISIS or (inaudible) organization is not  going to be stop, they will carve up this piece of Iraq and the other side  of Syria.  A large section of Syria not in Lebanon and put pressure on  Jordan across the border with Saudi Arabia, it's not going to stop there.</p><p/><p> And of course, as the gentleman has said, they are going to have launching  pad much stronger that the United States and the west.  We need to begin  acting with our allies.  For example, I would recommend to support the  Kurds in the north and mildly support the south in the situation.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Gentlemen, thanks for your expertise.  We really appreciate it.   It seems to be easing somewhat, crude-oil prices are lower after two  consecutive weeks of gains.  Let's go to trader, Andrew Keene at the CME.   This is the dichotomy.  You heard from the guests before you that this  situation is getting much bigger, the whole region is being pulled into it.   At the same time, if traders get used to it as background noise, what is  going on?</p><p/><p> ANDREW KEENE, KEENEONTHEMARKET.COM:  We talk about it a couple times.  A  lot of the oil price factor in this the fact we haven't had a resolution,  effective in the oil price over the last 12 trading days we have been stuck  in a  tight race between 105 and 108.  I will look at the break out, which  is to the downside.  If there is resolution overseas over the weekend, out  we will see oil embracing 105, 101 in a heartbeat or go to 120.  The fact  there isn't a resolution and they after day the price of oil goes cotter is  not factoring that in.  That is a fear to the downside.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Andrew Keene, thank you so much.  It's a natural state of mind  how food label using every antioxidants in the book to make your spending  anything but organic.  At the end of the day it is all about money.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I am Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief.  Nike reaping  ahead today after earnings surpassed expectations with 18 percent sales  growth in Europe.  World Cup giving the company boost with some better  numbers out of the soccer division.  Banks importing risky borrowers with  $4 million in credit cards issued to, 4 million credit cards issued for  sub-prime borrowers in the first quarter.  That is up around 40 percent  from last year and is highest amount since the financial crisis.</p><p/><p> Hundreds of Oklahoma residents met with oil and gas regulators to ask if  recent earthquakes were the results of drilling operations.  Many of them  have urged the industry to start banning the wells they use to dispose of  waste water with some suspect, seismic activity.  That is the latest from  the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Profits come naturally to brands catching in on the nutrition  crazed, but consumers getting wary of the labels on their groceries.  It  turns out some of these healthy buzzwords sound great, but they mean  absolutely nothing.</p><p/><p> Here now supermarket guru, Phil Lampert, natural labels when you see  something labels natural, bring in $40 billion a year.  The FDA says there  is no definition of natural.  Actually doesn't mean anything.  I am  outraged.  Are you outrage?</p><p/><p> PHIL LAMPERT, SUPERMARKET EXPERT:  No.  Because this is a 15-year-old scam  that we have been living with.  This is nearly 70s.  This is not something  new.  All those companies started using the word natural and it can't have  artificial flavors.  And when we see one of these products, we think it  came out of the ground that way.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Really means those things because the FDA says it doesn't mean  anything and consumer reports is petitioning the FDA to ban the word  natural from labels because they are saying it doesn't guarantee anything.</p><p/><p> LAMPERT:  And it should be banned and there's no FDA regulation that  specifies that, but FDA from the web site and the regulations do specified  that they will allow the word natural to be used under those three  conditions if they are met some there isn't a rule, but there have been  complaints where people have used those having added color for example and  FDA -- </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  At the checkout counter there were fried potato chips that were  there and a set of natural and for a moment on is like maybe these aren't  so bad for you.  But the reality comes flooding back in and you know is a  lot.  University of Houston found people are more likely to think that  foods with labels like organic and natural are healthy even when the food  was candy or soda.  Is organic another one that is a fraud?</p><p/><p> LAMPERT:  There are certified organic regulations, number one, but when it  comes to nutrition, there is no difference between something that is  organic and conventionally grown nutritionally.  You can use pesticides  with organics, that is something people don't realize, but there are  regulations in place so at least that is better than we think.  We pay more  for organic or natural.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  We do and at the same time people I shunning things  that are  frozen or in cans, just across the board even things  like healthy choice,  lean  cuisine, struggling.  Now that people have this perception that  natural and organic is better so they see something in the aisle.  Are we  going to see these brands go away?</p><p/><p> LAMPERT:  Absolutely not.  In the case of Conagra Foods, for example, you  look at Healthy Choice, what they have done over the past few years has  been dramatic to your point, people don't understand fresh and frozen what  that really means.  USDA came out a couple years ago talking about their  studies, lot of frozen products have more nutrients.  But Conagra has  educed sodium.  It limited ingredients, taking out ingredients, using  apples instead.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I don't want to run out of time because I have one more for you.   I can't believe it is butter.  The kitchen favorite melting its way into  hearts and arteries across the country, the \"Wall Street Journal\" even  calling butter one of the great comeback stories in U.S. food history.</p><p/><p> Check out this chart showing the recent consumption decline of greasy  margarine and the rise of delicious fluffy golden butter.  Look at that  spread.  Get it?  Look at that spread.  What do you think?</p><p/><p> VERONICA DAGHER, \"THE WALL STREE JOURNAL\":  I love butter.  I think is  delicious, one of those simple luxuries.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Why is it making a comeback in your opinion?</p><p/><p> LAMPERT:  A couple things.  One is taste certainly, but also let's not  forget everything Julia Child told us was true.  Use a little bit of  butter, you will have flavor and it will cook better and that a lot of  other artificial product.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Heading into the last hour of trading, let's check with Liz  Claman to see what she has coming up -- Liz.</p><p/><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  This is jam packed because as we go to the end  element is the end of the month for the trading session.  We are watching  markets.  And the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who's breaking news right  and left on the grand jury that now has brand new evidence that does not  look good for top executives of General Motors.  We are watching that.</p><p/><p> But also when we talk about the market's the best way to proceed going into  the month of July.  We have a bond guide and equity guide talk about why  each one feels the way they do about that.  John Miller, and billions in  assets under management, close to 100 billion just to be exact and they are  calling it the Uber or the Zafor wine.  You can photograph wine labels when  you are at dinner or lunch or breakfast depending.</p><p/><p> And it will put you into a database, you can order wine or do anything when  it comes to, we  have the founder and CEO, this is the most popular apps on  iTunes when it comes to that,  food and wine, the best new apps in all  categories.  Alex Fishman is the CEO and founder of \"Delectable.\"</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I am downloading that at the moment the show is over.  It is  Friday.  Perfect.  Whether it is on Wall Street are mainstream here's who's  making or losing money.  Anyone with a piece of either Dollar General or  Family Dollar, those are taking a hit today after dollar general CEO said,  investors Carl Icahn to merge the two companies.  Shares for -- don't go  feeling financial strains from all this.  He has run 11 million shares of  family dollar meaning he has already lost $16.5 million since this morning.</p><p/><p>I am telling you, hoping to make some money, employees stirring -- suing  her boss over stressful daily commute, commute, a New Jersey woman says  rush-hour traffic has during to send depressed and management should have  allowed her to come in a later each day.  Her lawyers are demanding an  unspecified amount in damages.  I wonder she has ever been on the New York  subway.</p><p/><p> Still making money, everyone else is shown the door, Whoopi Goldberg, the  Oscar winner is the sole survivor of a major cleanup of the TV show \"The  View.\"  Reports say talks broke out new deals with former co-host Sheri  Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy leaving her as the last one at the table until  the replacements are found.  No wireless in the woods.  Tech addicts go  cold turkey a digital detox cam.  All of a sudden my cruise isn't sounding  so bad.  Smart money on the way.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Time for fun with spare change.  Putting down your phone can be  hard to do, so much so that some are willing to pay to have it taken away.   Camp Grounded is an adult summer camp where people completely unplug.  Levi  Felix joins me now.  Why do I need a camp for this?  Can't put my phone in  a drawer for the weekend?</p><p/><p> LEVI FELIX, CAMP GROUNDED FOUNDER:  Of course, you can put your phone away  in a drawer and go camping but most people find when they go on vacation  they spent a fourth of their vacation on e-mail or on their phone checking  it.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Has anyone ever tried to cheat?  What is the deal?  You have the  phones under your hat?</p><p/><p> FELIX:  No.  Actually I got a nice haircut when I was at camp last week.   They decided to give me a bulkhead.  Campers show up and turn the devices  into a safe.  Anything of value, locked up for four days and we never had  anyone try to sneak out.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Why do I want to go to a camp and pay for this?  I want to detox,  I can put it to the side.  People need to go somewhere and have it  physically taken from them in order to do it?</p><p/><p> FELIX:  We are focused on the unplugging, it is what you are looking to  reconnect with.  There is yoga, meditation, hiking, different arts and  crafts programs, our jury, full on summer camp for adults.  We trade space  where people can put away their phones so they are not going to get work e- mail's for calls anywhere from 385 to 574 four days, we do all organic  sustainable food.  Basically like a cruise ship but in the redwoods for  four days and pretty amazing what happens when you have 300 adults  altogether, everyone is hanging out and singing together.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I am about to go on a cruise and trying to think of which two  vacations I would rather do.  Levi, thank you so much.  No phones for this  one.  Instead of e-mailing his resume look at what this guy did.  He  printed his resume on a pack of beer.</p><p/><p> Graphic designer, Brennan Gleeson started Resumemail at the University of  Frazier Valley in addition to his crafty labeling, he broods the beer  himself.  Apparently the companies he sent it to drank up the idea.  He  says he got a few offers right away.  What do you think of this?  Pretty  clever.</p><p/><p> DAGHER:  Nice to see an entrepreneur.  These ideas don't often work.   People sending balloons and flowers and kind of tacky, but for a graphic  designer he is showing talent.  It is really creative.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I heard someone wrapping up resume around a pineapple.  Put on  coffee because it perks everyone up.  There you go.  If there is one thing  Americans are great at in a World Cup is the ability to lose a game and  still get ahead.  Asking anything about the point system and how it works,  listen to who is getting that hilariously and publicly wrong.  At the end  of the day it is all about money and a very complex score keeping.</p><p/><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Well, we didn't win it, but we're in it.  Team USA advances in  the World Cup game despite its loss to Germany yesterday all thanks to the  point system.  If you didn't get the math of sports here, you are not  alone.  Dennys made the same mistake, going to eat my wait in ice cream now  because of sadness.</p><p/><p> Jonathan Hoenig and Scott Martin are back with me now.  I mean, they're  trying to tweet and stay on top of it, but apparently they didn't realize  we were still in.  What do you think, Jonathan?</p><p/><p> JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, soccer is still just an  unknown entity for so many of us here in the states, Melissa, so I take the  same approach that I do with stocks, you have to kind of go where the  action is.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p/><p> HOENIG:  Call me when we're in the finals.</p><p/><p> SCOTT MARTIN:  Come on -- </p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Go ahead, Scott.</p><p/><p> MARTIN:  Jonathan, don't make my come over there again.  This is big for  the country though.  Everybody is getting fired up about this.  The sad  thing about Dennys, Melissa, they didn't give out free food because the USA  lost.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  I didn't really watch yesterday.  I tried to, but apparently all  of Wall Street did.  Volume of shares traded during the game yesterday, 25  percent lower than the same time as last year.  Scott, you were watching,  yes?  Were you trading or watching?</p><p/><p> MARTIN:  I was definitely watching.  And the funny thing is, you know, if  you're at a restaurant watch how many people pile in there, and the second  the game is over, it's like a stampede out the door.  But it's good  business for these restaurants.  If you open up your business for some of  these fans, you get people spending money, and I think it's good.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Absolutely, Jonathan, I guess I wasn't alone not watching because  even astronauts in space tuned in, American and German astronauts at the  International Space Station celebrated their teams advancing with a little  victory dancing.  Do we have that video?  What do you think?  Jonathan, did  you see this? </p><p/><p> HOENIG:  I didn't see that, but I'm not surprised.  I mean, sporting events  like this, Melissa, give us the opportunity to come together for a shared  experience and celebrate the good, the good for being the good, the heroic  nature of these really incredible athletes who are able to run for I don't  know how long, how hard, their endurance is remarkable.  So the fact that  we can all get together and cheer, a positive thing.</p><p/><p> FRANCIS:  Absolutely.  Gentlemen, thanks to both of you.  Happy Friday to  everyone out there.  I don't know about you, but these guys here in the  studio are ready to get the weekend started, right, guys?  Yes.  All right,  \"COUNTDOWN\" starts right now.</p><p/><p> END</p><p/><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

For some big-time tech investors still aren't happy.  Could this be  a sign of the top?  Buyer beware, the one word that sells $40 billion worth  of food each year and means absolutely nothing.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And paying up for some will power.  We'll introduce you to the company that  will help you unplug for a price.  Because even when they say it's not it  is always about money.  Economic realities hitting home for more than 40  million American families.  A new study out of Harvard University finding  that 35 percent of U.S. households can't afford their current living  situation.  With me now, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Veronica Dagher,  editor of \"Power Trend Profits, Chris Versace and Dominick Tavella of  Diversified Financial.  Thanks to all of you for joining us.  So, what that  means is that their rent or their mortgage consumes 30 percent of their  monthly income.  I mean this is huge.  This is 40 million Americans.  For a  lot of them it consumes 50 percent! Veronica, this is a disaster.  </p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, Fox BUSINESS:  It is a disaster especially because the  more you spend on housing the less you have to spend on other things like  consumer discretionary goods.  And so that has larger effects to our  economy.  These people are spending so much on their rent they can't go be  buying, you know, new cars or taking vacations.  They just don't have the  money.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And a lot of the problems has to do with the fact that incomes  aren't growing, right, Chris? </p><p>CHRIS VERSACE, POWERTREND PROFIST:  Absolutely.  I mean you look at all the  jobs that we've seen created, but we look at the mix of those jobs, lower  income jobs.  So, there's not a lot of wage growth.  We are seeing  inflation across food and energy, and to your point, Veronica, disposable  income is going to be tapped, so where are these people going to live?</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, I mean among the other problems that creates when you look at  the GDP print that we saw this week and just the big pullback, a lot of it  had to do with consumer spending.  You're not spending on discretionary  goods if you have this much of your money going to your rent and mortgage,  right? </p><p>DOMINICK TAVELLA, DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL:  Not only that.  But it's the tax  consequence what is happened in the first quarter.  So, people paying much  higher taxes than they were before.  They are paying much higher in cost of  living issues, even though the government says there is no cost of living.   Cost of housing has gone through the roof.  It really as depressed the  average consumer what they can actually do out there.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, more fallout from Barclays, over alleged dark pool fraud.   Charlie Gasparino first reported New York's lawsuit against Barclay's right  here on \"MONEY.\"  Now, they're getting the cold shoulder from several big  name brokerage firms, including Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada.   Chris, this is an interesting one.  Because it seems like dark pools, if  you look at this, we may die their own death.  If now people are afraid  when they stay away from them.  What do you think?</p><p>VERSACE:  I think you're absolutely right on that.  We are ultimately  designed for, which was to allow large pools to be traded, you know, it's  very anonymously, so people can move in and out.  But where there is lot of  smoke there is fire.  The SEC is investigating.  And all of a sudden what  may have been once so safe may not be.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Veronica.  </p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  I think investors are going to be  demanding more transparency in this case.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER:  They want to see what's going on.  They're called dark pools for a  reason. </p><p>FRANCIS:  For a reason, right.</p><p>DAGHER:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It is the opposite of transparency.  That is the whole point.</p><p>DAGHER:  That's right, yeah.  And I think a lot of these firms that are  stepping away from their connections to Barclays right now.  You know,  there is a PR component to this, too.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER:  Nobody wants to be associated with a firm that could be saying  false things to investors.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What is so appalling about this, if it is true, Dominick, you  know, the charges that on one hand they were saying that they weren't  allowing traders to have preference a step ahead of others at the very same  time that they were doing exactly that within their dark pools.  And  really, I mean, once again, it's just like such a big knock on Wall Street.  </p><p>TAVELLA:  Yeah, two things - first this is not a small investor problem.   This is really institutional.  Traders were looking to do big block trades  and not let the whole world know what they're doing.  Having said that they  need to have a credibility, a trust with the institution that they're doing  it.  That they're getting fair pricing.  That trades are being done orderly  and efficiently.  And when that doesn't happen the trust gets cut.</p><p>FRANCIS:  But it does have to do with the small investor because it's this  idea that Wall Street is rigged.  And there's more and more of these  stories come out.  It makes a little guy feel like why in the world should  I even get involved and why should I invest?  Meanwhile, I mean the stock  market has this thing that has really gone up in this recovery.  So, if  you're on the sidelines because you're paranoid you really lost out</p><p>TAVELLA:  If the small investor out there trading 100 shares of Facebook,  this is not their world, OK?  And whether they should or shouldn't be  trading on .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Nobody keeps them away from investing at all, Veronica.</p><p>DAGHER:  It's the express issue, yeah.  They're even more skeptical.  And  they don't even understand what a dark pool is.  A lot of professionals  don't understand what that is.  So, it's just - it's more confusion and  more skepticism.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  All right, the federal government is set to auction off  $17 million worth of bitcoin today.  This is all courtesy of the shuttered  online market silk road.  The online sell is shrouded in secrecy, speaking  of secrecy, and is attracting some financial power players.  Veronica, I  mean, this is an interesting one.  If they just went ahead and put all this  out on the open market, bitcoin, it would totally depress the price. </p><p>DAGHER:  Yeah, it would sink the price.  It's going to be interesting to  see how the government handles this.  You know, it's not like selling  confiscated Chevys that they have got from drug bust.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAGHER:  So, how this plays out and how the investors, you know, I think  there were investor lists, potential bidder lists released already.  How  that affects the bidding will be interesting to watch.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, Chris, are you watching this one?</p><p>VERSACE:  I'm watching it a little bit.  I'm wondering why the government  doesn't pull in like a currency trader or somebody in the know for dealing  with this .</p><p>FRANCIS:  I thought they were?  They're not doing that? </p><p>VERSACE:  You know, it sounds like they're doing it in-house.  We know that  they are not going to do it well.  So, you know, how well can they leak  this out?  That's the big question.  </p><p>TAVELLA:  What is interesting that they confiscated these bitcoins from a  criminal entity, right?  The criminals are figuring out, bitcoin is the  perfect tool to buy and sell assets without having trunk loads of 100- dollar bills.  So, I think that's what's probably more interesting about  this, is the government has figured it out, criminals figured it out, this  is a perfect vehicle to trade value back and forth.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right, iPhones hitting the bargain bin at  Walmart.  The retailer pricing Apple's smartphone for the - is rolling back  prices to $29.  I mean I can't believe this, the iPhone 5-c, $29.  You have  to buy a two year contract, but come on.  Amazing.  </p><p>DAGHER:  Yeah, it's really cheap.  But I think this is interesting because  Walmart is only applying this deal for people who come into their stores.   And I think this speaks to Walmart really needing to drive traffic.   They're losing out on foot traffic.  They're doing pretty good online, but  they're trying to find a way to how to get people in these huge stores and  that is a real issue.  This might be a strategy to .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, pretty smart thing for us.</p><p>VERSACE:  Well, you know, two things.  One I think it is smart for Walmart  to bring people in to get them to shop and buy all these things.  But also,  I think it's smart for Apple.  Remember the 5C was not a big volume device.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>VERSACE:  It's a nice way for them to kind of flush out all the inventory  in the channel potentially ahead of the iPhone 6.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I think it's also interesting to me it means that, Apple has  power to sell all across the price spectrum.  Because it used to be the  really high cost phone and you saw everybody, you know, couldn't afford it.  </p><p>VERSACE:  We don't know, necessarily know that it is Apple who is selling  it for $29 through Walmart.  Walmart could actually be buying the phone and  subsidizing it to bring people in, kind of a loss leader.</p><p>TAVELLA:  You know, Melissa, I will take the opposite of this one.  Steve  Jobs is going to be turning in his grave.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA:  But it's only with Apple cutting-edge technology, but this posh,  this mystique, it was a Gucci bag, it was the Armani.  Now, they are  selling it on the discount bin in Walmart.  I think it takes some of the  luster away from Apple.  I don't know.  I think it takes the shine off.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I think - interesting.  All right.  Life on Wall Street proving  no piece of cake for Crumbs Bakery.  The one time king of cupcakes will be  dropped by the NASDAQ after falling by more than 80 percent in the past  year.  I mean I don't know if you guys notice this, they're on every corner  right now.  They have 70 stores.  22 of which were open in the last year.   There is one on my block.  There is another cupcake store within the next  block.  How many cupcake stores do we need, Chris?</p><p>VERSACE:  Not that many apparently.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Apparently, not that many.</p><p>VERSACE:  And the thing is, you know, you can go almost anywhere now and  get cupcakes.  You can go to Starbucks and get cupcakes.  You can go to .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Big cupcakes.  </p><p>VERSACE:  Panera Bread and all this ...</p><p>TAVELLA:  You can actually buy their cupcakes at BJ's.  So, again, this  idea, this mystique, this great store, you walk into, now they have kind of  tarnished their brand.  Competitors are coming.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Isn't that a warning, so we have this huge IPO rush going on  right now.  I mean, you know, that it is - it's going to be the biggest  week since 2006.  I remember when Crumbs went public and I thought it was  the most ridiculous thing.  So, I'm like how can you be a public company  when all you do is sell cupcakes?  Is this the warning to Yo or all these  other things?  What do you think of it?</p><p>DAGHER:  That is the point.  Maybe not everyone should go public.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER:  Maybe it's not a good idea.  </p><p>TAVELLA:  So, let's look at Starbucks, right?  Same theme.  It's just  coffee instead of a cupcake.  They reinvented themselves, reinvented  themselves, reinvented themselves and expanded intelligently.  This company  didn't single product.  Lots of competition.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I guess, although you - almost everybody needs a cup of coffee to  get through the day.  I don't need a cupcake.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA:  I probably need it, but .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, I'm going to lose my job.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Riding shotgun wedding.  Uber expanding its reach into marital  bliss, bringing free full service weddings to some lucky couples tomorrow.   So I thought, you know, Uber is the king of this, we'll do something, you  know, within an hour, bring it to you.  They always have a gimmick on in  order to promote themselves.  But this one is really special.  Because they  say you just need to bring enough legal documents to get a marriage license  with you, but they will provide the notary and a qualified officiate to  handle the paperwork - ceremony, not to mention all the other accoutrements  that go with it.  Veronica.</p><p>DAGHER:  Oh, man, I just got married.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAGHER:  And I wish that .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAGHER:  Actually, no.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Will they do on demand divorce next?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA:  That might drive volume.   FRANCIS:  I don't know.  I mean in Vegas it's easy to get married proving  that you really shouldn't most of the time.  Like they make it too easy.   So, maybe these guys are doing the same thing.  </p><p>VERSACE:  You know, Melissa, I'm going to turn it back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>VERSACE:  Would you say that nothing says romance like Uber? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't know.  Quickie wedding, it is very romantic.  </p><p>TAVELLA:  But Uber has done a lot of these kinds of gimmicks, right?</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's funny.</p><p>TAVELLA:  It's a hell of a lot cheaper than hiring a Park Avenue  advertising firm. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>TAVELLA:  Lots of PR.  Get the name out there.  It's fabulous.  We laugh  about it.  It's good stuff.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You guys were fantastic.  Thank you so much. </p><p>Coming up the great band of China.  Why Hillary Clinton's new book won't be  hitting the bestseller's list in Shanghai anytime soon.  </p><p>Plus, consumer sentiment is on the rise, but will feelings be enough to  beat what lies beneath?  \"THE MONEY\" hard truth coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Walking on sunshine.  Consumer sentiment on the rise of beating  street expectations today.  Is this a ray of hope?  Here now, Fox  Business's Charlie Gasparino along with Veronica Dagher and former CBO  director Doug Holtz-Eakin.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Doug, I'm going  to let you go first.</p><p>DOUGH HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CBO DIRECTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Because you're on the road there.  Consumer sentiment rising  higher today.  The consumer is what was missing from the GDP report.   Consumer spending was very weak.  That was one of the big reasons we saw  the big contraction.  Does this mean things are about to get better? </p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I don't think so.  If you look inside the numbers, they're  happier about what is going on right now, but they are not more confident  about the future.  And if you look at the monthly data, we've seen in the  past two months, the first two months of the second quarter, real declines  in personal consumption expenditures.  So, there is not a lot out there to  suggest the households are going to pick up this economy and carry it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You know, Charlie, I always laugh when I see the consumer  sentiment numbers.  Because it's like asking people what they will do.   It's not what they're actually doing. </p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, Fox BUSINESS:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean it's like how you are feeling. </p><p>GASPARINO:  What they might do .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  In the future maybe, possibly.  I would just say this about - I  think that negative GDP print was probably somewhat of an aberration.  I  don't think we're in a recession right now.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It certainly make the recipe - you look like .</p><p>GASPARINO:  It's not - it's not - I'm not going to say that's good.  But  you know, one thing about the Obama economy.  We've seen this one before,  where you have a blip up in GDP you have a blip up in consumer confidence.   And then you get a blip down and then you really have very, very little  economic growth. </p><p>FRANCIS:  And it all nets out to just standing still.  That's right.  </p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Charlie, may I point something out? </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah. </p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I mean here is the thing, Charlie.  With the first quarter  that we got, we'd have to go to 3.7 percent every quarter for the rest of  the year, just to hit two percent for the year.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  OK.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Never seen that in this presidency.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And Veronica, I would say on the horizon, I mean, we have the  specter of potential inflation.  Have you heard James Bullard here on Fox  Business earlier this week, he's already saying it's going to be hotter  than we thought.  Consumers as they go to the store every day, they  certainly feel it being hotter every day.  I mean is that a real threat,  inflation? </p><p>DAGHER:  Yeah, I think it is.  Yes, you go to the grocery store now, things  cost more than they did a couple of months ago.  So, I think that is a real  issue.  And also, if you look at the personal spending numbers we got for  May.  If you adjust for inflation, those numbers actually went down.  So, I  think between that and people's fears about the economy, they are still  seeing people - their neighbors without a job for a long time, people are  underemployed.  They're afraid to spend.  So, we're going to see the  savings rates continue to go up until we feel more secure.  I don't know  what that's going to take, though, to make them feel more secure.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean Doug you are saying, you know, we would have to be above  three percent for the rest of year in order to even out to something.  What  do you think is going to happen for the rest of the year?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  What this economy has done for years - is it's along the two  percent.  That's been the average consumption for growth, household  spending growth, there's no evidence that they are going to change their  behavior.  They don't have the income or the sentiment to do it.   Businesses are the wildcard. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  And if they somehow get some animal spirits and go with the  big cap-ex expansion then we can get a good year, but I don't see that,  Charlie.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  I agree with you.  If you're talking about two percent growth  and you have .</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I am.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  And you're talking about inflation in certain sectors where the  Fed has to raise rates, we're heading for a recession.  I mean Hillary  Clinton runs for office.  If she runs in 2015, 2016, she is very possible,  that she runs in the middle of an economic downturn.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Interesting.  Meanwhile, you always make the point, Charlie, and  you are right, the only one who's getting rich in this economy right now  are people who are in the market.  Because that is what all this Fed work  has done, it's just stimulated the stock market.  It's ironic that these  policies out of Washington, all they've helped the one percent, who they  say they hate.  So, very interesting.  Guys, thanks to all of you for  joining us.  From the U.S. to every corner of globe money is flying around  the world today starting in Germany which has canceled the contract with  Verizon over fears that the U.S. is spying on them.  It all goes back to  documents leaked by Edward Snowden, which revealed we had kind of an  eavesdropping on calls made by Chancellor Angela Merkel.  You remember  that, right?  Germans, they were not so amused by that, especially as the  U.S. still refuses to agree with a no spy deal with the country.  Verizon  now bearing the brunt of that.  It has been providing a communications  network to the German government since 2010.</p><p>Over to Japan, which is now exporting square watermelons to grow throughout  the globe. They curious, look at that are grown in boxes from a very young  age.  It sounds cruel.  Which forces them into a cube-like shape.  They  weigh 13-pounds a apiece.  Look at them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Well, I think about it, no, no, no.   Now they are making way to  fruit stand in Canada.  They don't come cheap.  One sold in Moscow last  year, went for more than 800 bucks.  Juicy profits indeed.  Landing in  China where Hillary Clinton is getting the cold shoulder by officials.   Publishers there say they will not be purchasing the translation rights to  her new book.  Local agencies have banned the English language version from  being imported.   There are a few parts of book where she is somewhat  critical of the Chinese government.  You know, we kind of saw that one  coming, right? </p><p>Crying wolves of Wall Street.  The hottest week for IPOs in years and still  not enough for some of the tech heavyweights.  That picture is going to  come back to haunt that guy.  Plus, if you can't win them, beer them.  One  job hunter's clever case to seal the deal.  We're raking in the money  coming up next.  See this of this guy.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Hold on tight.  Shares of the venture camera maker GoPro powering  higher in the second day of trading.  Let's go to Ashley Webster on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  For more on this, when even higher  today, Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, Fox BUSINESS:  You know what they should do, Melissa.   Scrap one of those GoPro cameras on the stock, of what you go up and down.   Mostly up.  But as we know, when - yesterday, the price was set at $24.  It  shot up yesterday and today.  Look at this, it actually went above the $40  mark briefly before coming back down, still up 17percent.  What else would  you expect from this Adrenalin play on GoPro?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Absolutely, still, Michael's not looking like a masterpiece,  though, on its return to the market? </p><p>WEBSTER:  No, a tale of two IPOs.  Really, although that said, Michael's  pricing it $17, debuting on the NASDAQ today, came out very slowly.   Actually, went down below the IPO price.  But it since inched its way up,  and at least showing some positive signs, up 17, 1363 on the day.  Up about  three quarters of a percent.  The arts and crafts.  You know, by the way, I  didn't realize, they also own the Aaron Brothers chain as well.  So they go  public finally.  And up about 17, as I say, 14 cents above the share price  that was listed.  So, a slow but steady start I guess we'll call it.  No  GoPro.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK. All right, Ashley, thanks so much.  So, the market wrapping  up its biggest week for IPOs in eight years.  Some big tech investors are  not breaking out the champagne.  Rather, they're crying about how hard it  is to go public.  Somewhere alone violin plays for them.  Is this a sign of  the top?  Charlie is back with us, along with Scott Martin from United  Advisors and Jonathan Hoenig from CapitalistPig Hedge Fund.  They're both  Fox News contributors.  So, I mean it has been the week of endless IPOs.   Still, you have Marc Andreessen up there saying, it comes across like I'm  complaining about how hard it is to be public.  Of course, the answer is,  you just need to suck it up.  I mean poor IPO guys getting out there and  making a fortune.  Jonathan, ridiculous?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG HEDGE FUND:  No, but we should be happy  they're getting out there making a fortune, Melissa.  We should be happy  that deals are getting done and still being priced.  I don't think this is  the death of the IPO market at all, as you pointed out.  It was an  extremely busy week for IPOs.  And you know, you'll the death comes when  you see the IPOs starts coming public and just falling flat.  It happened  in 1999 .</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, I know, but Scott . -- </p><p>HOENIG:  In 2000.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't think it's so much the death of the IPO.  I think it is  more of a sign of the top.  That you have a zillion coming out.  It's the  most in whatever we - you know, eight years.  And then you have people  complaining about how hard it is when here, everyone is doing it.  How hard  could it be?  What do you think?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS:  Well ..</p><p>FRANCIS:  Everybody's got.</p><p>MARTIN:  You're right, everybody is doing it.  But here's the thing,  Melissa.  I mean Andreessen is complaining about the pricing I think more  than anything.  And he's talking about back in the '90s with Netscape and  some of these other companies coming out at 2 billion valuation was kind of  the status quo.  Now you have got companies like Uber that are in - you  know, $17 billion-dollar range.  Even interest is somewhere between five  and six billion.  Here is the funny thing, right?  GoPro is somewhere  around 3 billion, but the stock is up gigantically, since it's IPO, because  probably too cheap.  So, it's more about pricing issue, but like Jonathan  said I will never disagree with somebody in a seersucker suit, by the way. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MARTIN:  That's the - stock, and that is why the prices are going up.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Charlie.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  I'm not quite sure what Andreessen is complaining about.  I  mean is he complaining about the regulations?</p><p>FRANCIS:  He's talking about for the young companies, you know, there is  such a microscope on you.  Every part of your business ends up being  connected and end up being tied back to your self-pricing and morale.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Well, too bad, pal.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I mean, you know, that's what - you want to be a public  company, you are going to have some regulations you have to follow.  I will  say this, though.  Listen, it is great that they're coming public.  We  should point out that the NASDAQ has been overshadowed.  This has been  overshadowed.  NASDAQ has done 100 tech IPOs in the past year.  That's what  I'm .</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's amazing. </p><p>HOENIG:  Can I just comment quickly?</p><p>GASPARINO:  And, you know, they didn't win the Alibaba one, but they won  some other ones.  We had Ashley on the floor of the stock exchange. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO:  NASDAQ won, I think, GoPro, right?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO:  To make this point.  You guys can jump in.  Let me make this  point, Jonathan.  When you are getting numbers like this you're getting  close to a top.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>GASPARINO:  It is not general .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jonathan, real quick, last comment, go ahead.  </p><p>HOENIG:  What's - I don't know, Charlie has been - I know calling for a  tough for at least a couple of weeks or months now.  And you say boo-hoo  hoo for companies that are trying to become public.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Months.  </p><p>HOENIG:  Think back to before Sarbanes-Oxley.  It has been harder and  harder for small companies to raise money.  That's why now some of them are  trying to use the Jobs Act to raise money. </p><p>GASPARINO:  Why are we seeing .?</p><p>HOENIG:  Because those regulations are so extensive.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We have got to go.  You guys can keep fighting in the break.   That's fine.  Thanks, guys.  All right, there is no margin of error for  this comeback.  American demand for natural ingredients just keeps on  growing, and the likes of butter are on a roll, get it?  Get it?  I know,  one too many jokes in there for me.  Plus, as good as Goldberg.  Whoopee is  the last one standing after complete overhaul on \"The View.\"  Find out how  she ended up the lone survivor.  \"Piles of Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS HOST:  As the situation in Iraq escalates,  other countries in the region are getting sucked in.  Surveillance drones  from Iran are flying over the country.  The White House is looking to  Syrian rebels to potentially play a role.</p><p>Joining me now, Chris Harmer, from the Institute for the Study of War and  Fox News Middle East expert, Walid Phares.  Chris, let me start with you.   I mean, this situation is intensifying.</p><p>CHRIS HARMER, INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR:  Melissa, it's a pleasure to  be here, thanks for having me.  Yes, the situation is intensifying.  If you  look at is the snapshot, it looks like ISIS is culminating with this  massive offensive.  In fact, if you look closer at what they have been  doing the past two years they have been building towards this.</p><p>They have done all the small building blocks they need to organize their  terrorist state and using that to attack the  government in Mosul, which  they've already won and they are now taking over the western desert areas  of Iraq that used to be dominated by the Sunni tribes.</p><p>The real question here is, is the Iraqi security force going to be able to  respond to this?  So far the answer is no.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Walid, I mean, it's not about just about Iraq.  It's about the  entire region being sucked into this conflict as we said.  Look at the  White House proposing to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels, how do you  identify a moderate Syrian rebels are?</p><p>DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS MIDDLE EAST EXPERT:  Speaking of how many  countries, let's do the count, Syria was involved, and they are considering  those.  Lebanon may go in because Lebanon also has pro and against ISIS.   Iran by sending the drones into Iraq will shoot against them.  How will we  identify the market?</p><p>We're five years late.  We have been urging the administration since the  Arabs spring to do so in civil society.  Now it will be time to find a less  Islamist and jihadists on the ground, this is not something that will have  a bright future.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So if everyone in the region is getting involved, is that an  argument for us to get involved or to stand back?  Chris, what do you  think?</p><p>HARMER:  It's wrong for the U.S. to get involve.  Look, we have strategic  interests in Syria whether we want to acknowledge it or not.  We have  strategic interests in Iraq whether we want to acknowledge it or not.  It  is easy to embrace the isolationist argument, but in today's interconnected  world it's not possible.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What are the interests?</p><p>HARMER:  We do not want to see a caliphate organized in Eastern Syria and  Western Iraq where ISIS has the complete safe haven.  If you look at what  al Qaeda had in Afghanistan, they had a safe haven as guests of the  Taliban.  What they are organizing is a nation state where they are guests  of nobody and beholden to no one.  They can do whatever they want.</p><p>In fact, one of the arguments between ISIS and al Qaeda, al Qaeda saw how  many fighters that ISIS was attracting, Europe, North America.  They said  you should use those guys right now to export terror back.  ISIS said no.   We will win the war here first and then have this cadres of several  thousand battle hardened formerly trained terrorists going back to Europe  and North America with passports and terrorist attacks here.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So Walid, is it realistic to think that we can do something to  break up that safe phase?</p><p>PHARES:  We could have, should have and continue to consider those  situations.  Let me say this.  If ISIS or (inaudible) organization is not  going to be stop, they will carve up this piece of Iraq and the other side  of Syria.  A large section of Syria not in Lebanon and put pressure on  Jordan across the border with Saudi Arabia, it's not going to stop there.</p><p>And of course, as the gentleman has said, they are going to have launching  pad much stronger that the United States and the west.  We need to begin  acting with our allies.  For example, I would recommend to support the  Kurds in the north and mildly support the south in the situation.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Gentlemen, thanks for your expertise.  We really appreciate it.   It seems to be easing somewhat, crude-oil prices are lower after two  consecutive weeks of gains.  Let's go to trader, Andrew Keene at the CME.   This is the dichotomy.  You heard from the guests before you that this  situation is getting much bigger, the whole region is being pulled into it.   At the same time, if traders get used to it as background noise, what is  going on?</p><p>ANDREW KEENE, KEENEONTHEMARKET.COM:  We talk about it a couple times.  A  lot of the oil price factor in this the fact we haven't had a resolution,  effective in the oil price over the last 12 trading days we have been stuck  in a  tight race between 105 and 108.  I will look at the break out, which  is to the downside.  If there is resolution overseas over the weekend, out  we will see oil embracing 105, 101 in a heartbeat or go to 120.  The fact  there isn't a resolution and they after day the price of oil goes cotter is  not factoring that in.  That is a fear to the downside.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Andrew Keene, thank you so much.  It's a natural state of mind  how food label using every antioxidants in the book to make your spending  anything but organic.  At the end of the day it is all about money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I am Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief.  Nike reaping  ahead today after earnings surpassed expectations with 18 percent sales  growth in Europe.  World Cup giving the company boost with some better  numbers out of the soccer division.  Banks importing risky borrowers with  $4 million in credit cards issued to, 4 million credit cards issued for  sub-prime borrowers in the first quarter.  That is up around 40 percent  from last year and is highest amount since the financial crisis.</p><p>Hundreds of Oklahoma residents met with oil and gas regulators to ask if  recent earthquakes were the results of drilling operations.  Many of them  have urged the industry to start banning the wells they use to dispose of  waste water with some suspect, seismic activity.  That is the latest from  the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Profits come naturally to brands catching in on the nutrition  crazed, but consumers getting wary of the labels on their groceries.  It  turns out some of these healthy buzzwords sound great, but they mean  absolutely nothing.</p><p>Here now supermarket guru, Phil Lampert, natural labels when you see  something labels natural, bring in $40 billion a year.  The FDA says there  is no definition of natural.  Actually doesn't mean anything.  I am  outraged.  Are you outrage?</p><p>PHIL LAMPERT, SUPERMARKET EXPERT:  No.  Because this is a 15-year-old scam  that we have been living with.  This is nearly 70s.  This is not something  new.  All those companies started using the word natural and it can't have  artificial flavors.  And when we see one of these products, we think it  came out of the ground that way.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Really means those things because the FDA says it doesn't mean  anything and consumer reports is petitioning the FDA to ban the word  natural from labels because they are saying it doesn't guarantee anything.</p><p>LAMPERT:  And it should be banned and there's no FDA regulation that  specifies that, but FDA from the web site and the regulations do specified  that they will allow the word natural to be used under those three  conditions if they are met some there isn't a rule, but there have been  complaints where people have used those having added color for example and  FDA -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  At the checkout counter there were fried potato chips that were  there and a set of natural and for a moment on is like maybe these aren't  so bad for you.  But the reality comes flooding back in and you know is a  lot.  University of Houston found people are more likely to think that  foods with labels like organic and natural are healthy even when the food  was candy or soda.  Is organic another one that is a fraud?</p><p>LAMPERT:  There are certified organic regulations, number one, but when it  comes to nutrition, there is no difference between something that is  organic and conventionally grown nutritionally.  You can use pesticides  with organics, that is something people don't realize, but there are  regulations in place so at least that is better than we think.  We pay more  for organic or natural.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We do and at the same time people I shunning things  that are  frozen or in cans, just across the board even things  like healthy choice,  lean  cuisine, struggling.  Now that people have this perception that  natural and organic is better so they see something in the aisle.  Are we  going to see these brands go away?</p><p>LAMPERT:  Absolutely not.  In the case of Conagra Foods, for example, you  look at Healthy Choice, what they have done over the past few years has  been dramatic to your point, people don't understand fresh and frozen what  that really means.  USDA came out a couple years ago talking about their  studies, lot of frozen products have more nutrients.  But Conagra has  educed sodium.  It limited ingredients, taking out ingredients, using  apples instead.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't want to run out of time because I have one more for you.   I can't believe it is butter.  The kitchen favorite melting its way into  hearts and arteries across the country, the \"Wall Street Journal\" even  calling butter one of the great comeback stories in U.S. food history.</p><p>Check out this chart showing the recent consumption decline of greasy  margarine and the rise of delicious fluffy golden butter.  Look at that  spread.  Get it?  Look at that spread.  What do you think?</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"THE WALL STREE JOURNAL\":  I love butter.  I think is  delicious, one of those simple luxuries.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Why is it making a comeback in your opinion?</p><p>LAMPERT:  A couple things.  One is taste certainly, but also let's not  forget everything Julia Child told us was true.  Use a little bit of  butter, you will have flavor and it will cook better and that a lot of  other artificial product.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Heading into the last hour of trading, let's check with Liz  Claman to see what she has coming up -- Liz.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  This is jam packed because as we go to the end  element is the end of the month for the trading session.  We are watching  markets.  And the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who's breaking news right  and left on the grand jury that now has brand new evidence that does not  look good for top executives of General Motors.  We are watching that.</p><p>But also when we talk about the market's the best way to proceed going into  the month of July.  We have a bond guide and equity guide talk about why  each one feels the way they do about that.  John Miller, and billions in  assets under management, close to 100 billion just to be exact and they are  calling it the Uber or the Zafor wine.  You can photograph wine labels when  you are at dinner or lunch or breakfast depending.</p><p>And it will put you into a database, you can order wine or do anything when  it comes to, we  have the founder and CEO, this is the most popular apps on  iTunes when it comes to that,  food and wine, the best new apps in all  categories.  Alex Fishman is the CEO and founder of \"Delectable.\"</p><p>FRANCIS:  I am downloading that at the moment the show is over.  It is  Friday.  Perfect.  Whether it is on Wall Street are mainstream here's who's  making or losing money.  Anyone with a piece of either Dollar General or  Family Dollar, those are taking a hit today after dollar general CEO said,  investors Carl Icahn to merge the two companies.  Shares for -- don't go  feeling financial strains from all this.  He has run 11 million shares of  family dollar meaning he has already lost $16.5 million since this morning.</p><p>I am telling you, hoping to make some money, employees stirring -- suing  her boss over stressful daily commute, commute, a New Jersey woman says  rush-hour traffic has during to send depressed and management should have  allowed her to come in a later each day.  Her lawyers are demanding an  unspecified amount in damages.  I wonder she has ever been on the New York  subway.</p><p>Still making money, everyone else is shown the door, Whoopi Goldberg, the  Oscar winner is the sole survivor of a major cleanup of the TV show \"The  View.\"  Reports say talks broke out new deals with former co-host Sheri  Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy leaving her as the last one at the table until  the replacements are found.  No wireless in the woods.  Tech addicts go  cold turkey a digital detox cam.  All of a sudden my cruise isn't sounding  so bad.  Smart money on the way.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Time for fun with spare change.  Putting down your phone can be  hard to do, so much so that some are willing to pay to have it taken away.   Camp Grounded is an adult summer camp where people completely unplug.  Levi  Felix joins me now.  Why do I need a camp for this?  Can't put my phone in  a drawer for the weekend?</p><p>LEVI FELIX, CAMP GROUNDED FOUNDER:  Of course, you can put your phone away  in a drawer and go camping but most people find when they go on vacation  they spent a fourth of their vacation on e-mail or on their phone checking  it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Has anyone ever tried to cheat?  What is the deal?  You have the  phones under your hat?</p><p>FELIX:  No.  Actually I got a nice haircut when I was at camp last week.   They decided to give me a bulkhead.  Campers show up and turn the devices  into a safe.  Anything of value, locked up for four days and we never had  anyone try to sneak out.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Why do I want to go to a camp and pay for this?  I want to detox,  I can put it to the side.  People need to go somewhere and have it  physically taken from them in order to do it?</p><p>FELIX:  We are focused on the unplugging, it is what you are looking to  reconnect with.  There is yoga, meditation, hiking, different arts and  crafts programs, our jury, full on summer camp for adults.  We trade space  where people can put away their phones so they are not going to get work e- mail's for calls anywhere from 385 to 574 four days, we do all organic  sustainable food.  Basically like a cruise ship but in the redwoods for  four days and pretty amazing what happens when you have 300 adults  altogether, everyone is hanging out and singing together.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I am about to go on a cruise and trying to think of which two  vacations I would rather do.  Levi, thank you so much.  No phones for this  one.  Instead of e-mailing his resume look at what this guy did.  He  printed his resume on a pack of beer.</p><p>Graphic designer, Brennan Gleeson started Resumemail at the University of  Frazier Valley in addition to his crafty labeling, he broods the beer  himself.  Apparently the companies he sent it to drank up the idea.  He  says he got a few offers right away.  What do you think of this?  Pretty  clever.</p><p>DAGHER:  Nice to see an entrepreneur.  These ideas don't often work.   People sending balloons and flowers and kind of tacky, but for a graphic  designer he is showing talent.  It is really creative.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I heard someone wrapping up resume around a pineapple.  Put on  coffee because it perks everyone up.  There you go.  If there is one thing  Americans are great at in a World Cup is the ability to lose a game and  still get ahead.  Asking anything about the point system and how it works,  listen to who is getting that hilariously and publicly wrong.  At the end  of the day it is all about money and a very complex score keeping.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Well, we didn't win it, but we're in it.  Team USA advances in  the World Cup game despite its loss to Germany yesterday all thanks to the  point system.  If you didn't get the math of sports here, you are not  alone.  Dennys made the same mistake, going to eat my wait in ice cream now  because of sadness.</p><p>Jonathan Hoenig and Scott Martin are back with me now.  I mean, they're  trying to tweet and stay on top of it, but apparently they didn't realize  we were still in.  What do you think, Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, soccer is still just an  unknown entity for so many of us here in the states, Melissa, so I take the  same approach that I do with stocks, you have to kind of go where the  action is.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>HOENIG:  Call me when we're in the finals.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN:  Come on -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Go ahead, Scott.</p><p>MARTIN:  Jonathan, don't make my come over there again.  This is big for  the country though.  Everybody is getting fired up about this.  The sad  thing about Dennys, Melissa, they didn't give out free food because the USA  lost.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I didn't really watch yesterday.  I tried to, but apparently all  of Wall Street did.  Volume of shares traded during the game yesterday, 25  percent lower than the same time as last year.  Scott, you were watching,  yes?  Were you trading or watching?</p><p>MARTIN:  I was definitely watching.  And the funny thing is, you know, if  you're at a restaurant watch how many people pile in there, and the second  the game is over, it's like a stampede out the door.  But it's good  business for these restaurants.  If you open up your business for some of  these fans, you get people spending money, and I think it's good.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Absolutely, Jonathan, I guess I wasn't alone not watching because  even astronauts in space tuned in, American and German astronauts at the  International Space Station celebrated their teams advancing with a little  victory dancing.  Do we have that video?  What do you think?  Jonathan, did  you see this? </p><p>HOENIG:  I didn't see that, but I'm not surprised.  I mean, sporting events  like this, Melissa, give us the opportunity to come together for a shared  experience and celebrate the good, the good for being the good, the heroic  nature of these really incredible athletes who are able to run for I don't  know how long, how hard, their endurance is remarkable.  So the fact that  we can all get together and cheer, a positive thing.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Absolutely.  Gentlemen, thanks to both of you.  Happy Friday to  everyone out there.  I don't know about you, but these guys here in the  studio are ready to get the weekend started, right, guys?  Yes.  All right,  \"COUNTDOWN\" starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

For some big-time tech investors still aren't happy.  Could this be  a sign of the top?  Buyer beware, the one word that sells $40 billion worth  of food each year and means absolutely nothing.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And paying up for some will power.  We'll introduce you to the company that  will help you unplug for a price.  Because even when they say it's not it  is always about money.  Economic realities hitting home for more than 40  million American families.  A new study out of Harvard University finding  that 35 percent of U.S. households can't afford their current living  situation.  With me now, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Veronica Dagher,  editor of \"Power Trend Profits, Chris Versace and Dominick Tavella of  Diversified Financial.  Thanks to all of you for joining us.  So, what that  means is that their rent or their mortgage consumes 30 percent of their  monthly income.  I mean this is huge.  This is 40 million Americans.  For a  lot of them it consumes 50 percent! Veronica, this is a disaster.  </p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, Fox BUSINESS:  It is a disaster especially because the  more you spend on housing the less you have to spend on other things like  consumer discretionary goods.  And so that has larger effects to our  economy.  These people are spending so much on their rent they can't go be  buying, you know, new cars or taking vacations.  They just don't have the  money.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And a lot of the problems has to do with the fact that incomes  aren't growing, right, Chris? </p><p>CHRIS VERSACE, POWERTREND PROFIST:  Absolutely.  I mean you look at all the  jobs that we've seen created, but we look at the mix of those jobs, lower  income jobs.  So, there's not a lot of wage growth.  We are seeing  inflation across food and energy, and to your point, Veronica, disposable  income is going to be tapped, so where are these people going to live?</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, I mean among the other problems that creates when you look at  the GDP print that we saw this week and just the big pullback, a lot of it  had to do with consumer spending.  You're not spending on discretionary  goods if you have this much of your money going to your rent and mortgage,  right? </p><p>DOMINICK TAVELLA, DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL:  Not only that.  But it's the tax  consequence what is happened in the first quarter.  So, people paying much  higher taxes than they were before.  They are paying much higher in cost of  living issues, even though the government says there is no cost of living.   Cost of housing has gone through the roof.  It really as depressed the  average consumer what they can actually do out there.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, more fallout from Barclays, over alleged dark pool fraud.   Charlie Gasparino first reported New York's lawsuit against Barclay's right  here on \"MONEY.\"  Now, they're getting the cold shoulder from several big  name brokerage firms, including Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada.   Chris, this is an interesting one.  Because it seems like dark pools, if  you look at this, we may die their own death.  If now people are afraid  when they stay away from them.  What do you think?</p><p>VERSACE:  I think you're absolutely right on that.  We are ultimately  designed for, which was to allow large pools to be traded, you know, it's  very anonymously, so people can move in and out.  But where there is lot of  smoke there is fire.  The SEC is investigating.  And all of a sudden what  may have been once so safe may not be.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Veronica.  </p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  I think investors are going to be  demanding more transparency in this case.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER:  They want to see what's going on.  They're called dark pools for a  reason. </p><p>FRANCIS:  For a reason, right.</p><p>DAGHER:  Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It is the opposite of transparency.  That is the whole point.</p><p>DAGHER:  That's right, yeah.  And I think a lot of these firms that are  stepping away from their connections to Barclays right now.  You know,  there is a PR component to this, too.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER:  Nobody wants to be associated with a firm that could be saying  false things to investors.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What is so appalling about this, if it is true, Dominick, you  know, the charges that on one hand they were saying that they weren't  allowing traders to have preference a step ahead of others at the very same  time that they were doing exactly that within their dark pools.  And  really, I mean, once again, it's just like such a big knock on Wall Street.  </p><p>TAVELLA:  Yeah, two things - first this is not a small investor problem.   This is really institutional.  Traders were looking to do big block trades  and not let the whole world know what they're doing.  Having said that they  need to have a credibility, a trust with the institution that they're doing  it.  That they're getting fair pricing.  That trades are being done orderly  and efficiently.  And when that doesn't happen the trust gets cut.</p><p>FRANCIS:  But it does have to do with the small investor because it's this  idea that Wall Street is rigged.  And there's more and more of these  stories come out.  It makes a little guy feel like why in the world should  I even get involved and why should I invest?  Meanwhile, I mean the stock  market has this thing that has really gone up in this recovery.  So, if  you're on the sidelines because you're paranoid you really lost out</p><p>TAVELLA:  If the small investor out there trading 100 shares of Facebook,  this is not their world, OK?  And whether they should or shouldn't be  trading on .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Nobody keeps them away from investing at all, Veronica.</p><p>DAGHER:  It's the express issue, yeah.  They're even more skeptical.  And  they don't even understand what a dark pool is.  A lot of professionals  don't understand what that is.  So, it's just - it's more confusion and  more skepticism.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  All right, the federal government is set to auction off  $17 million worth of bitcoin today.  This is all courtesy of the shuttered  online market silk road.  The online sell is shrouded in secrecy, speaking  of secrecy, and is attracting some financial power players.  Veronica, I  mean, this is an interesting one.  If they just went ahead and put all this  out on the open market, bitcoin, it would totally depress the price. </p><p>DAGHER:  Yeah, it would sink the price.  It's going to be interesting to  see how the government handles this.  You know, it's not like selling  confiscated Chevys that they have got from drug bust.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAGHER:  So, how this plays out and how the investors, you know, I think  there were investor lists, potential bidder lists released already.  How  that affects the bidding will be interesting to watch.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, Chris, are you watching this one?</p><p>VERSACE:  I'm watching it a little bit.  I'm wondering why the government  doesn't pull in like a currency trader or somebody in the know for dealing  with this .</p><p>FRANCIS:  I thought they were?  They're not doing that? </p><p>VERSACE:  You know, it sounds like they're doing it in-house.  We know that  they are not going to do it well.  So, you know, how well can they leak  this out?  That's the big question.  </p><p>TAVELLA:  What is interesting that they confiscated these bitcoins from a  criminal entity, right?  The criminals are figuring out, bitcoin is the  perfect tool to buy and sell assets without having trunk loads of 100- dollar bills.  So, I think that's what's probably more interesting about  this, is the government has figured it out, criminals figured it out, this  is a perfect vehicle to trade value back and forth.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right, iPhones hitting the bargain bin at  Walmart.  The retailer pricing Apple's smartphone for the - is rolling back  prices to $29.  I mean I can't believe this, the iPhone 5-c, $29.  You have  to buy a two year contract, but come on.  Amazing.  </p><p>DAGHER:  Yeah, it's really cheap.  But I think this is interesting because  Walmart is only applying this deal for people who come into their stores.   And I think this speaks to Walmart really needing to drive traffic.   They're losing out on foot traffic.  They're doing pretty good online, but  they're trying to find a way to how to get people in these huge stores and  that is a real issue.  This might be a strategy to .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, pretty smart thing for us.</p><p>VERSACE:  Well, you know, two things.  One I think it is smart for Walmart  to bring people in to get them to shop and buy all these things.  But also,  I think it's smart for Apple.  Remember the 5C was not a big volume device.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>VERSACE:  It's a nice way for them to kind of flush out all the inventory  in the channel potentially ahead of the iPhone 6.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I think it's also interesting to me it means that, Apple has  power to sell all across the price spectrum.  Because it used to be the  really high cost phone and you saw everybody, you know, couldn't afford it.  </p><p>VERSACE:  We don't know, necessarily know that it is Apple who is selling  it for $29 through Walmart.  Walmart could actually be buying the phone and  subsidizing it to bring people in, kind of a loss leader.</p><p>TAVELLA:  You know, Melissa, I will take the opposite of this one.  Steve  Jobs is going to be turning in his grave.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA:  But it's only with Apple cutting-edge technology, but this posh,  this mystique, it was a Gucci bag, it was the Armani.  Now, they are  selling it on the discount bin in Walmart.  I think it takes some of the  luster away from Apple.  I don't know.  I think it takes the shine off.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I think - interesting.  All right.  Life on Wall Street proving  no piece of cake for Crumbs Bakery.  The one time king of cupcakes will be  dropped by the NASDAQ after falling by more than 80 percent in the past  year.  I mean I don't know if you guys notice this, they're on every corner  right now.  They have 70 stores.  22 of which were open in the last year.   There is one on my block.  There is another cupcake store within the next  block.  How many cupcake stores do we need, Chris?</p><p>VERSACE:  Not that many apparently.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Apparently, not that many.</p><p>VERSACE:  And the thing is, you know, you can go almost anywhere now and  get cupcakes.  You can go to Starbucks and get cupcakes.  You can go to .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Big cupcakes.  </p><p>VERSACE:  Panera Bread and all this ...</p><p>TAVELLA:  You can actually buy their cupcakes at BJ's.  So, again, this  idea, this mystique, this great store, you walk into, now they have kind of  tarnished their brand.  Competitors are coming.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Isn't that a warning, so we have this huge IPO rush going on  right now.  I mean, you know, that it is - it's going to be the biggest  week since 2006.  I remember when Crumbs went public and I thought it was  the most ridiculous thing.  So, I'm like how can you be a public company  when all you do is sell cupcakes?  Is this the warning to Yo or all these  other things?  What do you think of it?</p><p>DAGHER:  That is the point.  Maybe not everyone should go public.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER:  Maybe it's not a good idea.  </p><p>TAVELLA:  So, let's look at Starbucks, right?  Same theme.  It's just  coffee instead of a cupcake.  They reinvented themselves, reinvented  themselves, reinvented themselves and expanded intelligently.  This company  didn't single product.  Lots of competition.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I guess, although you - almost everybody needs a cup of coffee to  get through the day.  I don't need a cupcake.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA:  I probably need it, but .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, I'm going to lose my job.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Riding shotgun wedding.  Uber expanding its reach into marital  bliss, bringing free full service weddings to some lucky couples tomorrow.   So I thought, you know, Uber is the king of this, we'll do something, you  know, within an hour, bring it to you.  They always have a gimmick on in  order to promote themselves.  But this one is really special.  Because they  say you just need to bring enough legal documents to get a marriage license  with you, but they will provide the notary and a qualified officiate to  handle the paperwork - ceremony, not to mention all the other accoutrements  that go with it.  Veronica.</p><p>DAGHER:  Oh, man, I just got married.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAGHER:  And I wish that .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAGHER:  Actually, no.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Will they do on demand divorce next?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA:  That might drive volume.   FRANCIS:  I don't know.  I mean in Vegas it's easy to get married proving  that you really shouldn't most of the time.  Like they make it too easy.   So, maybe these guys are doing the same thing.  </p><p>VERSACE:  You know, Melissa, I'm going to turn it back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>VERSACE:  Would you say that nothing says romance like Uber? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't know.  Quickie wedding, it is very romantic.  </p><p>TAVELLA:  But Uber has done a lot of these kinds of gimmicks, right?</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's funny.</p><p>TAVELLA:  It's a hell of a lot cheaper than hiring a Park Avenue  advertising firm. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>TAVELLA:  Lots of PR.  Get the name out there.  It's fabulous.  We laugh  about it.  It's good stuff.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  You guys were fantastic.  Thank you so much. </p><p>Coming up the great band of China.  Why Hillary Clinton's new book won't be  hitting the bestseller's list in Shanghai anytime soon.  </p><p>Plus, consumer sentiment is on the rise, but will feelings be enough to  beat what lies beneath?  \"THE MONEY\" hard truth coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Walking on sunshine.  Consumer sentiment on the rise of beating  street expectations today.  Is this a ray of hope?  Here now, Fox  Business's Charlie Gasparino along with Veronica Dagher and former CBO  director Doug Holtz-Eakin.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Doug, I'm going  to let you go first.</p><p>DOUGH HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CBO DIRECTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Because you're on the road there.  Consumer sentiment rising  higher today.  The consumer is what was missing from the GDP report.   Consumer spending was very weak.  That was one of the big reasons we saw  the big contraction.  Does this mean things are about to get better? </p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I don't think so.  If you look inside the numbers, they're  happier about what is going on right now, but they are not more confident  about the future.  And if you look at the monthly data, we've seen in the  past two months, the first two months of the second quarter, real declines  in personal consumption expenditures.  So, there is not a lot out there to  suggest the households are going to pick up this economy and carry it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You know, Charlie, I always laugh when I see the consumer  sentiment numbers.  Because it's like asking people what they will do.   It's not what they're actually doing. </p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, Fox BUSINESS:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean it's like how you are feeling. </p><p>GASPARINO:  What they might do .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  In the future maybe, possibly.  I would just say this about - I  think that negative GDP print was probably somewhat of an aberration.  I  don't think we're in a recession right now.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It certainly make the recipe - you look like .</p><p>GASPARINO:  It's not - it's not - I'm not going to say that's good.  But  you know, one thing about the Obama economy.  We've seen this one before,  where you have a blip up in GDP you have a blip up in consumer confidence.   And then you get a blip down and then you really have very, very little  economic growth. </p><p>FRANCIS:  And it all nets out to just standing still.  That's right.  </p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Charlie, may I point something out? </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah. </p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I mean here is the thing, Charlie.  With the first quarter  that we got, we'd have to go to 3.7 percent every quarter for the rest of  the year, just to hit two percent for the year.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  OK.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Never seen that in this presidency.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And Veronica, I would say on the horizon, I mean, we have the  specter of potential inflation.  Have you heard James Bullard here on Fox  Business earlier this week, he's already saying it's going to be hotter  than we thought.  Consumers as they go to the store every day, they  certainly feel it being hotter every day.  I mean is that a real threat,  inflation? </p><p>DAGHER:  Yeah, I think it is.  Yes, you go to the grocery store now, things  cost more than they did a couple of months ago.  So, I think that is a real  issue.  And also, if you look at the personal spending numbers we got for  May.  If you adjust for inflation, those numbers actually went down.  So, I  think between that and people's fears about the economy, they are still  seeing people - their neighbors without a job for a long time, people are  underemployed.  They're afraid to spend.  So, we're going to see the  savings rates continue to go up until we feel more secure.  I don't know  what that's going to take, though, to make them feel more secure.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean Doug you are saying, you know, we would have to be above  three percent for the rest of year in order to even out to something.  What  do you think is going to happen for the rest of the year?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  What this economy has done for years - is it's along the two  percent.  That's been the average consumption for growth, household  spending growth, there's no evidence that they are going to change their  behavior.  They don't have the income or the sentiment to do it.   Businesses are the wildcard. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  And if they somehow get some animal spirits and go with the  big cap-ex expansion then we can get a good year, but I don't see that,  Charlie.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  I agree with you.  If you're talking about two percent growth  and you have .</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I am.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  And you're talking about inflation in certain sectors where the  Fed has to raise rates, we're heading for a recession.  I mean Hillary  Clinton runs for office.  If she runs in 2015, 2016, she is very possible,  that she runs in the middle of an economic downturn.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Interesting.  Meanwhile, you always make the point, Charlie, and  you are right, the only one who's getting rich in this economy right now  are people who are in the market.  Because that is what all this Fed work  has done, it's just stimulated the stock market.  It's ironic that these  policies out of Washington, all they've helped the one percent, who they  say they hate.  So, very interesting.  Guys, thanks to all of you for  joining us.  From the U.S. to every corner of globe money is flying around  the world today starting in Germany which has canceled the contract with  Verizon over fears that the U.S. is spying on them.  It all goes back to  documents leaked by Edward Snowden, which revealed we had kind of an  eavesdropping on calls made by Chancellor Angela Merkel.  You remember  that, right?  Germans, they were not so amused by that, especially as the  U.S. still refuses to agree with a no spy deal with the country.  Verizon  now bearing the brunt of that.  It has been providing a communications  network to the German government since 2010.</p><p>Over to Japan, which is now exporting square watermelons to grow throughout  the globe. They curious, look at that are grown in boxes from a very young  age.  It sounds cruel.  Which forces them into a cube-like shape.  They  weigh 13-pounds a apiece.  Look at them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Well, I think about it, no, no, no.   Now they are making way to  fruit stand in Canada.  They don't come cheap.  One sold in Moscow last  year, went for more than 800 bucks.  Juicy profits indeed.  Landing in  China where Hillary Clinton is getting the cold shoulder by officials.   Publishers there say they will not be purchasing the translation rights to  her new book.  Local agencies have banned the English language version from  being imported.   There are a few parts of book where she is somewhat  critical of the Chinese government.  You know, we kind of saw that one  coming, right? </p><p>Crying wolves of Wall Street.  The hottest week for IPOs in years and still  not enough for some of the tech heavyweights.  That picture is going to  come back to haunt that guy.  Plus, if you can't win them, beer them.  One  job hunter's clever case to seal the deal.  We're raking in the money  coming up next.  See this of this guy.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Hold on tight.  Shares of the venture camera maker GoPro powering  higher in the second day of trading.  Let's go to Ashley Webster on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  For more on this, when even higher  today, Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, Fox BUSINESS:  You know what they should do, Melissa.   Scrap one of those GoPro cameras on the stock, of what you go up and down.   Mostly up.  But as we know, when - yesterday, the price was set at $24.  It  shot up yesterday and today.  Look at this, it actually went above the $40  mark briefly before coming back down, still up 17percent.  What else would  you expect from this Adrenalin play on GoPro?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Absolutely, still, Michael's not looking like a masterpiece,  though, on its return to the market? </p><p>WEBSTER:  No, a tale of two IPOs.  Really, although that said, Michael's  pricing it $17, debuting on the NASDAQ today, came out very slowly.   Actually, went down below the IPO price.  But it since inched its way up,  and at least showing some positive signs, up 17, 1363 on the day.  Up about  three quarters of a percent.  The arts and crafts.  You know, by the way, I  didn't realize, they also own the Aaron Brothers chain as well.  So they go  public finally.  And up about 17, as I say, 14 cents above the share price  that was listed.  So, a slow but steady start I guess we'll call it.  No  GoPro.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK. All right, Ashley, thanks so much.  So, the market wrapping  up its biggest week for IPOs in eight years.  Some big tech investors are  not breaking out the champagne.  Rather, they're crying about how hard it  is to go public.  Somewhere alone violin plays for them.  Is this a sign of  the top?  Charlie is back with us, along with Scott Martin from United  Advisors and Jonathan Hoenig from CapitalistPig Hedge Fund.  They're both  Fox News contributors.  So, I mean it has been the week of endless IPOs.   Still, you have Marc Andreessen up there saying, it comes across like I'm  complaining about how hard it is to be public.  Of course, the answer is,  you just need to suck it up.  I mean poor IPO guys getting out there and  making a fortune.  Jonathan, ridiculous?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG HEDGE FUND:  No, but we should be happy  they're getting out there making a fortune, Melissa.  We should be happy  that deals are getting done and still being priced.  I don't think this is  the death of the IPO market at all, as you pointed out.  It was an  extremely busy week for IPOs.  And you know, you'll the death comes when  you see the IPOs starts coming public and just falling flat.  It happened  in 1999 .</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, I know, but Scott . -- </p><p>HOENIG:  In 2000.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't think it's so much the death of the IPO.  I think it is  more of a sign of the top.  That you have a zillion coming out.  It's the  most in whatever we - you know, eight years.  And then you have people  complaining about how hard it is when here, everyone is doing it.  How hard  could it be?  What do you think?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS:  Well ..</p><p>FRANCIS:  Everybody's got.</p><p>MARTIN:  You're right, everybody is doing it.  But here's the thing,  Melissa.  I mean Andreessen is complaining about the pricing I think more  than anything.  And he's talking about back in the '90s with Netscape and  some of these other companies coming out at 2 billion valuation was kind of  the status quo.  Now you have got companies like Uber that are in - you  know, $17 billion-dollar range.  Even interest is somewhere between five  and six billion.  Here is the funny thing, right?  GoPro is somewhere  around 3 billion, but the stock is up gigantically, since it's IPO, because  probably too cheap.  So, it's more about pricing issue, but like Jonathan  said I will never disagree with somebody in a seersucker suit, by the way. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MARTIN:  That's the - stock, and that is why the prices are going up.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Charlie.  </p><p>GASPARINO:  I'm not quite sure what Andreessen is complaining about.  I  mean is he complaining about the regulations?</p><p>FRANCIS:  He's talking about for the young companies, you know, there is  such a microscope on you.  Every part of your business ends up being  connected and end up being tied back to your self-pricing and morale.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Well, too bad, pal.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I mean, you know, that's what - you want to be a public  company, you are going to have some regulations you have to follow.  I will  say this, though.  Listen, it is great that they're coming public.  We  should point out that the NASDAQ has been overshadowed.  This has been  overshadowed.  NASDAQ has done 100 tech IPOs in the past year.  That's what  I'm .</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's amazing. </p><p>HOENIG:  Can I just comment quickly?</p><p>GASPARINO:  And, you know, they didn't win the Alibaba one, but they won  some other ones.  We had Ashley on the floor of the stock exchange. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO:  NASDAQ won, I think, GoPro, right?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO:  To make this point.  You guys can jump in.  Let me make this  point, Jonathan.  When you are getting numbers like this you're getting  close to a top.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>GASPARINO:  It is not general .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Jonathan, real quick, last comment, go ahead.  </p><p>HOENIG:  What's - I don't know, Charlie has been - I know calling for a  tough for at least a couple of weeks or months now.  And you say boo-hoo  hoo for companies that are trying to become public.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Months.  </p><p>HOENIG:  Think back to before Sarbanes-Oxley.  It has been harder and  harder for small companies to raise money.  That's why now some of them are  trying to use the Jobs Act to raise money. </p><p>GASPARINO:  Why are we seeing .?</p><p>HOENIG:  Because those regulations are so extensive.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We have got to go.  You guys can keep fighting in the break.   That's fine.  Thanks, guys.  All right, there is no margin of error for  this comeback.  American demand for natural ingredients just keeps on  growing, and the likes of butter are on a roll, get it?  Get it?  I know,  one too many jokes in there for me.  Plus, as good as Goldberg.  Whoopee is  the last one standing after complete overhaul on \"The View.\"  Find out how  she ended up the lone survivor.  \"Piles of Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS HOST:  As the situation in Iraq escalates,  other countries in the region are getting sucked in.  Surveillance drones  from Iran are flying over the country.  The White House is looking to  Syrian rebels to potentially play a role.</p><p>Joining me now, Chris Harmer, from the Institute for the Study of War and  Fox News Middle East expert, Walid Phares.  Chris, let me start with you.   I mean, this situation is intensifying.</p><p>CHRIS HARMER, INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR:  Melissa, it's a pleasure to  be here, thanks for having me.  Yes, the situation is intensifying.  If you  look at is the snapshot, it looks like ISIS is culminating with this  massive offensive.  In fact, if you look closer at what they have been  doing the past two years they have been building towards this.</p><p>They have done all the small building blocks they need to organize their  terrorist state and using that to attack the  government in Mosul, which  they've already won and they are now taking over the western desert areas  of Iraq that used to be dominated by the Sunni tribes.</p><p>The real question here is, is the Iraqi security force going to be able to  respond to this?  So far the answer is no.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Walid, I mean, it's not about just about Iraq.  It's about the  entire region being sucked into this conflict as we said.  Look at the  White House proposing to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels, how do you  identify a moderate Syrian rebels are?</p><p>DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS MIDDLE EAST EXPERT:  Speaking of how many  countries, let's do the count, Syria was involved, and they are considering  those.  Lebanon may go in because Lebanon also has pro and against ISIS.   Iran by sending the drones into Iraq will shoot against them.  How will we  identify the market?</p><p>We're five years late.  We have been urging the administration since the  Arabs spring to do so in civil society.  Now it will be time to find a less  Islamist and jihadists on the ground, this is not something that will have  a bright future.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So if everyone in the region is getting involved, is that an  argument for us to get involved or to stand back?  Chris, what do you  think?</p><p>HARMER:  It's wrong for the U.S. to get involve.  Look, we have strategic  interests in Syria whether we want to acknowledge it or not.  We have  strategic interests in Iraq whether we want to acknowledge it or not.  It  is easy to embrace the isolationist argument, but in today's interconnected  world it's not possible.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What are the interests?</p><p>HARMER:  We do not want to see a caliphate organized in Eastern Syria and  Western Iraq where ISIS has the complete safe haven.  If you look at what  al Qaeda had in Afghanistan, they had a safe haven as guests of the  Taliban.  What they are organizing is a nation state where they are guests  of nobody and beholden to no one.  They can do whatever they want.</p><p>In fact, one of the arguments between ISIS and al Qaeda, al Qaeda saw how  many fighters that ISIS was attracting, Europe, North America.  They said  you should use those guys right now to export terror back.  ISIS said no.   We will win the war here first and then have this cadres of several  thousand battle hardened formerly trained terrorists going back to Europe  and North America with passports and terrorist attacks here.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So Walid, is it realistic to think that we can do something to  break up that safe phase?</p><p>PHARES:  We could have, should have and continue to consider those  situations.  Let me say this.  If ISIS or (inaudible) organization is not  going to be stop, they will carve up this piece of Iraq and the other side  of Syria.  A large section of Syria not in Lebanon and put pressure on  Jordan across the border with Saudi Arabia, it's not going to stop there.</p><p>And of course, as the gentleman has said, they are going to have launching  pad much stronger that the United States and the west.  We need to begin  acting with our allies.  For example, I would recommend to support the  Kurds in the north and mildly support the south in the situation.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Gentlemen, thanks for your expertise.  We really appreciate it.   It seems to be easing somewhat, crude-oil prices are lower after two  consecutive weeks of gains.  Let's go to trader, Andrew Keene at the CME.   This is the dichotomy.  You heard from the guests before you that this  situation is getting much bigger, the whole region is being pulled into it.   At the same time, if traders get used to it as background noise, what is  going on?</p><p>ANDREW KEENE, KEENEONTHEMARKET.COM:  We talk about it a couple times.  A  lot of the oil price factor in this the fact we haven't had a resolution,  effective in the oil price over the last 12 trading days we have been stuck  in a  tight race between 105 and 108.  I will look at the break out, which  is to the downside.  If there is resolution overseas over the weekend, out  we will see oil embracing 105, 101 in a heartbeat or go to 120.  The fact  there isn't a resolution and they after day the price of oil goes cotter is  not factoring that in.  That is a fear to the downside.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Andrew Keene, thank you so much.  It's a natural state of mind  how food label using every antioxidants in the book to make your spending  anything but organic.  At the end of the day it is all about money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I am Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief.  Nike reaping  ahead today after earnings surpassed expectations with 18 percent sales  growth in Europe.  World Cup giving the company boost with some better  numbers out of the soccer division.  Banks importing risky borrowers with  $4 million in credit cards issued to, 4 million credit cards issued for  sub-prime borrowers in the first quarter.  That is up around 40 percent  from last year and is highest amount since the financial crisis.</p><p>Hundreds of Oklahoma residents met with oil and gas regulators to ask if  recent earthquakes were the results of drilling operations.  Many of them  have urged the industry to start banning the wells they use to dispose of  waste water with some suspect, seismic activity.  That is the latest from  the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Profits come naturally to brands catching in on the nutrition  crazed, but consumers getting wary of the labels on their groceries.  It  turns out some of these healthy buzzwords sound great, but they mean  absolutely nothing.</p><p>Here now supermarket guru, Phil Lampert, natural labels when you see  something labels natural, bring in $40 billion a year.  The FDA says there  is no definition of natural.  Actually doesn't mean anything.  I am  outraged.  Are you outrage?</p><p>PHIL LAMPERT, SUPERMARKET EXPERT:  No.  Because this is a 15-year-old scam  that we have been living with.  This is nearly 70s.  This is not something  new.  All those companies started using the word natural and it can't have  artificial flavors.  And when we see one of these products, we think it  came out of the ground that way.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Really means those things because the FDA says it doesn't mean  anything and consumer reports is petitioning the FDA to ban the word  natural from labels because they are saying it doesn't guarantee anything.</p><p>LAMPERT:  And it should be banned and there's no FDA regulation that  specifies that, but FDA from the web site and the regulations do specified  that they will allow the word natural to be used under those three  conditions if they are met some there isn't a rule, but there have been  complaints where people have used those having added color for example and  FDA -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  At the checkout counter there were fried potato chips that were  there and a set of natural and for a moment on is like maybe these aren't  so bad for you.  But the reality comes flooding back in and you know is a  lot.  University of Houston found people are more likely to think that  foods with labels like organic and natural are healthy even when the food  was candy or soda.  Is organic another one that is a fraud?</p><p>LAMPERT:  There are certified organic regulations, number one, but when it  comes to nutrition, there is no difference between something that is  organic and conventionally grown nutritionally.  You can use pesticides  with organics, that is something people don't realize, but there are  regulations in place so at least that is better than we think.  We pay more  for organic or natural.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We do and at the same time people I shunning things  that are  frozen or in cans, just across the board even things  like healthy choice,  lean  cuisine, struggling.  Now that people have this perception that  natural and organic is better so they see something in the aisle.  Are we  going to see these brands go away?</p><p>LAMPERT:  Absolutely not.  In the case of Conagra Foods, for example, you  look at Healthy Choice, what they have done over the past few years has  been dramatic to your point, people don't understand fresh and frozen what  that really means.  USDA came out a couple years ago talking about their  studies, lot of frozen products have more nutrients.  But Conagra has  educed sodium.  It limited ingredients, taking out ingredients, using  apples instead.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't want to run out of time because I have one more for you.   I can't believe it is butter.  The kitchen favorite melting its way into  hearts and arteries across the country, the \"Wall Street Journal\" even  calling butter one of the great comeback stories in U.S. food history.</p><p>Check out this chart showing the recent consumption decline of greasy  margarine and the rise of delicious fluffy golden butter.  Look at that  spread.  Get it?  Look at that spread.  What do you think?</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"THE WALL STREE JOURNAL\":  I love butter.  I think is  delicious, one of those simple luxuries.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Why is it making a comeback in your opinion?</p><p>LAMPERT:  A couple things.  One is taste certainly, but also let's not  forget everything Julia Child told us was true.  Use a little bit of  butter, you will have flavor and it will cook better and that a lot of  other artificial product.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Heading into the last hour of trading, let's check with Liz  Claman to see what she has coming up -- Liz.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS:  This is jam packed because as we go to the end  element is the end of the month for the trading session.  We are watching  markets.  And the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who's breaking news right  and left on the grand jury that now has brand new evidence that does not  look good for top executives of General Motors.  We are watching that.</p><p>But also when we talk about the market's the best way to proceed going into  the month of July.  We have a bond guide and equity guide talk about why  each one feels the way they do about that.  John Miller, and billions in  assets under management, close to 100 billion just to be exact and they are  calling it the Uber or the Zafor wine.  You can photograph wine labels when  you are at dinner or lunch or breakfast depending.</p><p>And it will put you into a database, you can order wine or do anything when  it comes to, we  have the founder and CEO, this is the most popular apps on  iTunes when it comes to that,  food and wine, the best new apps in all  categories.  Alex Fishman is the CEO and founder of \"Delectable.\"</p><p>FRANCIS:  I am downloading that at the moment the show is over.  It is  Friday.  Perfect.  Whether it is on Wall Street are mainstream here's who's  making or losing money.  Anyone with a piece of either Dollar General or  Family Dollar, those are taking a hit today after dollar general CEO said,  investors Carl Icahn to merge the two companies.  Shares for -- don't go  feeling financial strains from all this.  He has run 11 million shares of  family dollar meaning he has already lost $16.5 million since this morning.</p><p>I am telling you, hoping to make some money, employees stirring -- suing  her boss over stressful daily commute, commute, a New Jersey woman says  rush-hour traffic has during to send depressed and management should have  allowed her to come in a later each day.  Her lawyers are demanding an  unspecified amount in damages.  I wonder she has ever been on the New York  subway.</p><p>Still making money, everyone else is shown the door, Whoopi Goldberg, the  Oscar winner is the sole survivor of a major cleanup of the TV show \"The  View.\"  Reports say talks broke out new deals with former co-host Sheri  Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy leaving her as the last one at the table until  the replacements are found.  No wireless in the woods.  Tech addicts go  cold turkey a digital detox cam.  All of a sudden my cruise isn't sounding  so bad.  Smart money on the way.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Time for fun with spare change.  Putting down your phone can be  hard to do, so much so that some are willing to pay to have it taken away.   Camp Grounded is an adult summer camp where people completely unplug.  Levi  Felix joins me now.  Why do I need a camp for this?  Can't put my phone in  a drawer for the weekend?</p><p>LEVI FELIX, CAMP GROUNDED FOUNDER:  Of course, you can put your phone away  in a drawer and go camping but most people find when they go on vacation  they spent a fourth of their vacation on e-mail or on their phone checking  it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Has anyone ever tried to cheat?  What is the deal?  You have the  phones under your hat?</p><p>FELIX:  No.  Actually I got a nice haircut when I was at camp last week.   They decided to give me a bulkhead.  Campers show up and turn the devices  into a safe.  Anything of value, locked up for four days and we never had  anyone try to sneak out.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Why do I want to go to a camp and pay for this?  I want to detox,  I can put it to the side.  People need to go somewhere and have it  physically taken from them in order to do it?</p><p>FELIX:  We are focused on the unplugging, it is what you are looking to  reconnect with.  There is yoga, meditation, hiking, different arts and  crafts programs, our jury, full on summer camp for adults.  We trade space  where people can put away their phones so they are not going to get work e- mail's for calls anywhere from 385 to 574 four days, we do all organic  sustainable food.  Basically like a cruise ship but in the redwoods for  four days and pretty amazing what happens when you have 300 adults  altogether, everyone is hanging out and singing together.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I am about to go on a cruise and trying to think of which two  vacations I would rather do.  Levi, thank you so much.  No phones for this  one.  Instead of e-mailing his resume look at what this guy did.  He  printed his resume on a pack of beer.</p><p>Graphic designer, Brennan Gleeson started Resumemail at the University of  Frazier Valley in addition to his crafty labeling, he broods the beer  himself.  Apparently the companies he sent it to drank up the idea.  He  says he got a few offers right away.  What do you think of this?  Pretty  clever.</p><p>DAGHER:  Nice to see an entrepreneur.  These ideas don't often work.   People sending balloons and flowers and kind of tacky, but for a graphic  designer he is showing talent.  It is really creative.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I heard someone wrapping up resume around a pineapple.  Put on  coffee because it perks everyone up.  There you go.  If there is one thing  Americans are great at in a World Cup is the ability to lose a game and  still get ahead.  Asking anything about the point system and how it works,  listen to who is getting that hilariously and publicly wrong.  At the end  of the day it is all about money and a very complex score keeping.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Well, we didn't win it, but we're in it.  Team USA advances in  the World Cup game despite its loss to Germany yesterday all thanks to the  point system.  If you didn't get the math of sports here, you are not  alone.  Dennys made the same mistake, going to eat my wait in ice cream now  because of sadness.</p><p>Jonathan Hoenig and Scott Martin are back with me now.  I mean, they're  trying to tweet and stay on top of it, but apparently they didn't realize  we were still in.  What do you think, Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, soccer is still just an  unknown entity for so many of us here in the states, Melissa, so I take the  same approach that I do with stocks, you have to kind of go where the  action is.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>HOENIG:  Call me when we're in the finals.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN:  Come on -- </p><p>FRANCIS:  Go ahead, Scott.</p><p>MARTIN:  Jonathan, don't make my come over there again.  This is big for  the country though.  Everybody is getting fired up about this.  The sad  thing about Dennys, Melissa, they didn't give out free food because the USA  lost.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I didn't really watch yesterday.  I tried to, but apparently all  of Wall Street did.  Volume of shares traded during the game yesterday, 25  percent lower than the same time as last year.  Scott, you were watching,  yes?  Were you trading or watching?</p><p>MARTIN:  I was definitely watching.  And the funny thing is, you know, if  you're at a restaurant watch how many people pile in there, and the second  the game is over, it's like a stampede out the door.  But it's good  business for these restaurants.  If you open up your business for some of  these fans, you get people spending money, and I think it's good.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Absolutely, Jonathan, I guess I wasn't alone not watching because  even astronauts in space tuned in, American and German astronauts at the  International Space Station celebrated their teams advancing with a little  victory dancing.  Do we have that video?  What do you think?  Jonathan, did  you see this? </p><p>HOENIG:  I didn't see that, but I'm not surprised.  I mean, sporting events  like this, Melissa, give us the opportunity to come together for a shared  experience and celebrate the good, the good for being the good, the heroic  nature of these really incredible athletes who are able to run for I don't  know how long, how hard, their endurance is remarkable.  So the fact that  we can all get together and cheer, a positive thing.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Absolutely.  Gentlemen, thanks to both of you.  Happy Friday to  everyone out there.  I don't know about you, but these guys here in the  studio are ready to get the weekend started, right, guys?  Yes.  All right,  \"COUNTDOWN\" starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

For some big-time tech investors still aren't happy. Could this be a sign of the top? Buyer beware, the one word that sells $40 billion worth of food each year and means absolutely nothing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And paying up for some will power. We'll introduce you to the company that will help you unplug for a price. Because even when they say it's not it is always about money. Economic realities hitting home for more than 40 million American families. A new study out of Harvard University finding that 35 percent of U.S. households can't afford their current living situation. With me now, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Veronica Dagher, editor of \"Power Trend Profits, Chris Versace and Dominick Tavella of Diversified Financial. Thanks to all of you for joining us. So, what that means is that their rent or their mortgage consumes 30 percent of their monthly income. I mean this is huge. This is 40 million Americans. For a lot of them it consumes 50 percent! Veronica, this is a disaster.</p><p/><p>VERONICA DAGHER, Fox BUSINESS: It is a disaster especially because the more you spend on housing the less you have to spend on other things like consumer discretionary goods. And so that has larger effects to our economy. These people are spending so much on their rent they can't go be buying, you know, new cars or taking vacations. They just don't have the money.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: And a lot of the problems has to do with the fact that incomes aren't growing, right, Chris?</p><p/><p>CHRIS VERSACE, POWERTREND PROFIST: Absolutely. I mean you look at all the jobs that we've seen created, but we look at the mix of those jobs, lower income jobs. So, there's not a lot of wage growth. We are seeing inflation across food and energy, and to your point, Veronica, disposable income is going to be tapped, so where are these people going to live?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: No, I mean among the other problems that creates when you look at the GDP print that we saw this week and just the big pullback, a lot of it had to do with consumer spending. You're not spending on discretionary goods if you have this much of your money going to your rent and mortgage, right?</p><p/><p>DOMINICK TAVELLA, DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL: Not only that. But it's the tax consequence what is happened in the first quarter. So, people paying much higher taxes than they were before. They are paying much higher in cost of living issues, even though the government says there is no cost of living. Cost of housing has gone through the roof. It really as depressed the average consumer what they can actually do out there.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK, more fallout from Barclays, over alleged dark pool fraud. Charlie Gasparino first reported New York's lawsuit against Barclay's right here on \"MONEY.\" Now, they're getting the cold shoulder from several big name brokerage firms, including Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada. Chris, this is an interesting one. Because it seems like dark pools, if you look at this, we may die their own death. If now people are afraid when they stay away from them. What do you think?</p><p/><p>VERSACE: I think you're absolutely right on that. We are ultimately designed for, which was to allow large pools to be traded, you know, it's very anonymously, so people can move in and out. But where there is lot of smoke there is fire. The SEC is investigating. And all of a sudden what may have been once so safe may not be.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Veronica.</p><p/><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think investors are going to be demanding more transparency in this case.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: They want to see what's going on. They're called dark pools for a reason.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: For a reason, right.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Yes.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It is the opposite of transparency. That is the whole point.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: That's right, yeah. And I think a lot of these firms that are stepping away from their connections to Barclays right now. You know, there is a PR component to this, too.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Nobody wants to be associated with a firm that could be saying false things to investors.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What is so appalling about this, if it is true, Dominick, you know, the charges that on one hand they were saying that they weren't allowing traders to have preference a step ahead of others at the very same time that they were doing exactly that within their dark pools. And really, I mean, once again, it's just like such a big knock on Wall Street.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: Yeah, two things - first this is not a small investor problem. This is really institutional. Traders were looking to do big block trades and not let the whole world know what they're doing. Having said that they need to have a credibility, a trust with the institution that they're doing it. That they're getting fair pricing. That trades are being done orderly and efficiently. And when that doesn't happen the trust gets cut.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: But it does have to do with the small investor because it's this idea that Wall Street is rigged. And there's more and more of these stories come out. It makes a little guy feel like why in the world should I even get involved and why should I invest? Meanwhile, I mean the stock market has this thing that has really gone up in this recovery. So, if you're on the sidelines because you're paranoid you really lost out</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: If the small investor out there trading 100 shares of Facebook, this is not their world, OK? And whether they should or shouldn't be trading on .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Nobody keeps them away from investing at all, Veronica.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: It's the express issue, yeah. They're even more skeptical. And they don't even understand what a dark pool is. A lot of professionals don't understand what that is. So, it's just - it's more confusion and more skepticism.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. All right, the federal government is set to auction off $17 million worth of bitcoin today. This is all courtesy of the shuttered online market silk road. The online sell is shrouded in secrecy, speaking of secrecy, and is attracting some financial power players. Veronica, I mean, this is an interesting one. If they just went ahead and put all this out on the open market, bitcoin, it would totally depress the price.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Yeah, it would sink the price. It's going to be interesting to see how the government handles this. You know, it's not like selling confiscated Chevys that they have got from drug bust.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>DAGHER: So, how this plays out and how the investors, you know, I think there were investor lists, potential bidder lists released already. How that affects the bidding will be interesting to watch.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, Chris, are you watching this one?</p><p/><p>VERSACE: I'm watching it a little bit. I'm wondering why the government doesn't pull in like a currency trader or somebody in the know for dealing with this .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I thought they were? They're not doing that?</p><p/><p>VERSACE: You know, it sounds like they're doing it in-house. We know that they are not going to do it well. So, you know, how well can they leak this out? That's the big question.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: What is interesting that they confiscated these bitcoins from a criminal entity, right? The criminals are figuring out, bitcoin is the perfect tool to buy and sell assets without having trunk loads of 100- dollar bills. So, I think that's what's probably more interesting about this, is the government has figured it out, criminals figured it out, this is a perfect vehicle to trade value back and forth.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Absolutely. All right, iPhones hitting the bargain bin at Walmart. The retailer pricing Apple's smartphone for the - is rolling back prices to $29. I mean I can't believe this, the iPhone 5-c, $29. You have to buy a two year contract, but come on. Amazing.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Yeah, it's really cheap. But I think this is interesting because Walmart is only applying this deal for people who come into their stores. And I think this speaks to Walmart really needing to drive traffic. They're losing out on foot traffic. They're doing pretty good online, but they're trying to find a way to how to get people in these huge stores and that is a real issue. This might be a strategy to .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, pretty smart thing for us.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: Well, you know, two things. One I think it is smart for Walmart to bring people in to get them to shop and buy all these things. But also, I think it's smart for Apple. Remember the 5C was not a big volume device.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: It's a nice way for them to kind of flush out all the inventory in the channel potentially ahead of the iPhone 6.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I think it's also interesting to me it means that, Apple has power to sell all across the price spectrum. Because it used to be the really high cost phone and you saw everybody, you know, couldn't afford it.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: We don't know, necessarily know that it is Apple who is selling it for $29 through Walmart. Walmart could actually be buying the phone and subsidizing it to bring people in, kind of a loss leader.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: You know, Melissa, I will take the opposite of this one. Steve Jobs is going to be turning in his grave.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: But it's only with Apple cutting-edge technology, but this posh, this mystique, it was a Gucci bag, it was the Armani. Now, they are selling it on the discount bin in Walmart. I think it takes some of the luster away from Apple. I don't know. I think it takes the shine off.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I think - interesting. All right. Life on Wall Street proving no piece of cake for Crumbs Bakery. The one time king of cupcakes will be dropped by the NASDAQ after falling by more than 80 percent in the past year. I mean I don't know if you guys notice this, they're on every corner right now. They have 70 stores. 22 of which were open in the last year. There is one on my block. There is another cupcake store within the next block. How many cupcake stores do we need, Chris?</p><p/><p>VERSACE: Not that many apparently.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Apparently, not that many.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: And the thing is, you know, you can go almost anywhere now and get cupcakes. You can go to Starbucks and get cupcakes. You can go to .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Big cupcakes.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: Panera Bread and all this ...</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: You can actually buy their cupcakes at BJ's. So, again, this idea, this mystique, this great store, you walk into, now they have kind of tarnished their brand. Competitors are coming.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Isn't that a warning, so we have this huge IPO rush going on right now. I mean, you know, that it is - it's going to be the biggest week since 2006. I remember when Crumbs went public and I thought it was the most ridiculous thing. So, I'm like how can you be a public company when all you do is sell cupcakes? Is this the warning to Yo or all these other things? What do you think of it?</p><p/><p>DAGHER: That is the point. Maybe not everyone should go public.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Maybe it's not a good idea.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: So, let's look at Starbucks, right? Same theme. It's just coffee instead of a cupcake. They reinvented themselves, reinvented themselves, reinvented themselves and expanded intelligently. This company didn't single product. Lots of competition.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I guess, although you - almost everybody needs a cup of coffee to get through the day. I don't need a cupcake.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: I probably need it, but .</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: All right, I'm going to lose my job.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Riding shotgun wedding. Uber expanding its reach into marital bliss, bringing free full service weddings to some lucky couples tomorrow. So I thought, you know, Uber is the king of this, we'll do something, you know, within an hour, bring it to you. They always have a gimmick on in order to promote themselves. But this one is really special. Because they say you just need to bring enough legal documents to get a marriage license with you, but they will provide the notary and a qualified officiate to handle the paperwork - ceremony, not to mention all the other accoutrements that go with it. Veronica.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Oh, man, I just got married.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>DAGHER: And I wish that .</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Actually, no.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Will they do on demand divorce next?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: That might drive volume. FRANCIS: I don't know. I mean in Vegas it's easy to get married proving that you really shouldn't most of the time. Like they make it too easy. So, maybe these guys are doing the same thing.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: You know, Melissa, I'm going to turn it back to you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: Would you say that nothing says romance like Uber?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. Quickie wedding, it is very romantic.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: But Uber has done a lot of these kinds of gimmicks, right?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It's funny.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: It's a hell of a lot cheaper than hiring a Park Avenue advertising firm.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: Lots of PR. Get the name out there. It's fabulous. We laugh about it. It's good stuff.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You guys were fantastic. Thank you so much.</p><p/><p>Coming up the great band of China. Why Hillary Clinton's new book won't be hitting the bestseller's list in Shanghai anytime soon.</p><p/><p>Plus, consumer sentiment is on the rise, but will feelings be enough to beat what lies beneath? \"THE MONEY\" hard truth coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Walking on sunshine. Consumer sentiment on the rise of beating street expectations today. Is this a ray of hope? Here now, Fox Business's Charlie Gasparino along with Veronica Dagher and former CBO director Doug Holtz-Eakin. Thanks so much for joining us. Doug, I'm going to let you go first.</p><p/><p>DOUGH HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CBO DIRECTOR: Thank you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Because you're on the road there. Consumer sentiment rising higher today. The consumer is what was missing from the GDP report. Consumer spending was very weak. That was one of the big reasons we saw the big contraction. Does this mean things are about to get better?</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I don't think so. If you look inside the numbers, they're happier about what is going on right now, but they are not more confident about the future. And if you look at the monthly data, we've seen in the past two months, the first two months of the second quarter, real declines in personal consumption expenditures. So, there is not a lot out there to suggest the households are going to pick up this economy and carry it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You know, Charlie, I always laugh when I see the consumer sentiment numbers. Because it's like asking people what they will do. It's not what they're actually doing.</p><p/><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, Fox BUSINESS: Right.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I mean it's like how you are feeling.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: What they might do .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: In the future maybe, possibly. I would just say this about - I think that negative GDP print was probably somewhat of an aberration. I don't think we're in a recession right now.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It certainly make the recipe - you look like .</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: It's not - it's not - I'm not going to say that's good. But you know, one thing about the Obama economy. We've seen this one before, where you have a blip up in GDP you have a blip up in consumer confidence. And then you get a blip down and then you really have very, very little economic growth.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: And it all nets out to just standing still. That's right.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Charlie, may I point something out?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I mean here is the thing, Charlie. With the first quarter that we got, we'd have to go to 3.7 percent every quarter for the rest of the year, just to hit two percent for the year.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: OK.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Never seen that in this presidency.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: And Veronica, I would say on the horizon, I mean, we have the specter of potential inflation. Have you heard James Bullard here on Fox Business earlier this week, he's already saying it's going to be hotter than we thought. Consumers as they go to the store every day, they certainly feel it being hotter every day. I mean is that a real threat, inflation?</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Yeah, I think it is. Yes, you go to the grocery store now, things cost more than they did a couple of months ago. So, I think that is a real issue. And also, if you look at the personal spending numbers we got for May. If you adjust for inflation, those numbers actually went down. So, I think between that and people's fears about the economy, they are still seeing people - their neighbors without a job for a long time, people are underemployed. They're afraid to spend. So, we're going to see the savings rates continue to go up until we feel more secure. I don't know what that's going to take, though, to make them feel more secure.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I mean Doug you are saying, you know, we would have to be above three percent for the rest of year in order to even out to something. What do you think is going to happen for the rest of the year?</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: What this economy has done for years - is it's along the two percent. That's been the average consumption for growth, household spending growth, there's no evidence that they are going to change their behavior. They don't have the income or the sentiment to do it. Businesses are the wildcard.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: And if they somehow get some animal spirits and go with the big cap-ex expansion then we can get a good year, but I don't see that, Charlie.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: I agree with you. If you're talking about two percent growth and you have .</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I am.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: And you're talking about inflation in certain sectors where the Fed has to raise rates, we're heading for a recession. I mean Hillary Clinton runs for office. If she runs in 2015, 2016, she is very possible, that she runs in the middle of an economic downturn.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Interesting. Meanwhile, you always make the point, Charlie, and you are right, the only one who's getting rich in this economy right now are people who are in the market. Because that is what all this Fed work has done, it's just stimulated the stock market. It's ironic that these policies out of Washington, all they've helped the one percent, who they say they hate. So, very interesting. Guys, thanks to all of you for joining us. From the U.S. to every corner of globe money is flying around the world today starting in Germany which has canceled the contract with Verizon over fears that the U.S. is spying on them. It all goes back to documents leaked by Edward Snowden, which revealed we had kind of an eavesdropping on calls made by Chancellor Angela Merkel. You remember that, right? Germans, they were not so amused by that, especially as the U.S. still refuses to agree with a no spy deal with the country. Verizon now bearing the brunt of that. It has been providing a communications network to the German government since 2010.</p><p/><p>Over to Japan, which is now exporting square watermelons to grow throughout the globe. They curious, look at that are grown in boxes from a very young age. It sounds cruel. Which forces them into a cube-like shape. They weigh 13-pounds a apiece. Look at them.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Well, I think about it, no, no, no. Now they are making way to fruit stand in Canada. They don't come cheap. One sold in Moscow last year, went for more than 800 bucks. Juicy profits indeed. Landing in China where Hillary Clinton is getting the cold shoulder by officials. Publishers there say they will not be purchasing the translation rights to her new book. Local agencies have banned the English language version from being imported. There are a few parts of book where she is somewhat critical of the Chinese government. You know, we kind of saw that one coming, right?</p><p/><p>Crying wolves of Wall Street. The hottest week for IPOs in years and still not enough for some of the tech heavyweights. That picture is going to come back to haunt that guy. Plus, if you can't win them, beer them. One job hunter's clever case to seal the deal. We're raking in the money coming up next. See this of this guy.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Hold on tight. Shares of the venture camera maker GoPro powering higher in the second day of trading. Let's go to Ashley Webster on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. For more on this, when even higher today, Ashley.</p><p/><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, Fox BUSINESS: You know what they should do, Melissa. Scrap one of those GoPro cameras on the stock, of what you go up and down. Mostly up. But as we know, when - yesterday, the price was set at $24. It shot up yesterday and today. Look at this, it actually went above the $40 mark briefly before coming back down, still up 17percent. What else would you expect from this Adrenalin play on GoPro?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely, still, Michael's not looking like a masterpiece, though, on its return to the market?</p><p/><p>WEBSTER: No, a tale of two IPOs. Really, although that said, Michael's pricing it $17, debuting on the NASDAQ today, came out very slowly. Actually, went down below the IPO price. But it since inched its way up, and at least showing some positive signs, up 17, 1363 on the day. Up about three quarters of a percent. The arts and crafts. You know, by the way, I didn't realize, they also own the Aaron Brothers chain as well. So they go public finally. And up about 17, as I say, 14 cents above the share price that was listed. So, a slow but steady start I guess we'll call it. No GoPro.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK. All right, Ashley, thanks so much. So, the market wrapping up its biggest week for IPOs in eight years. Some big tech investors are not breaking out the champagne. Rather, they're crying about how hard it is to go public. Somewhere alone violin plays for them. Is this a sign of the top? Charlie is back with us, along with Scott Martin from United Advisors and Jonathan Hoenig from CapitalistPig Hedge Fund. They're both Fox News contributors. So, I mean it has been the week of endless IPOs. Still, you have Marc Andreessen up there saying, it comes across like I'm complaining about how hard it is to be public. Of course, the answer is, you just need to suck it up. I mean poor IPO guys getting out there and making a fortune. Jonathan, ridiculous?</p><p/><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG HEDGE FUND: No, but we should be happy they're getting out there making a fortune, Melissa. We should be happy that deals are getting done and still being priced. I don't think this is the death of the IPO market at all, as you pointed out. It was an extremely busy week for IPOs. And you know, you'll the death comes when you see the IPOs starts coming public and just falling flat. It happened in 1999 .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: No, I know, but Scott . --</p><p/><p>HOENIG: In 2000.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I don't think it's so much the death of the IPO. I think it is more of a sign of the top. That you have a zillion coming out. It's the most in whatever we - you know, eight years. And then you have people complaining about how hard it is when here, everyone is doing it. How hard could it be? What do you think?</p><p/><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS: Well ..</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Everybody's got.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: You're right, everybody is doing it. But here's the thing, Melissa. I mean Andreessen is complaining about the pricing I think more than anything. And he's talking about back in the '90s with Netscape and some of these other companies coming out at 2 billion valuation was kind of the status quo. Now you have got companies like Uber that are in - you know, $17 billion-dollar range. Even interest is somewhere between five and six billion. Here is the funny thing, right? GoPro is somewhere around 3 billion, but the stock is up gigantically, since it's IPO, because probably too cheap. So, it's more about pricing issue, but like Jonathan said I will never disagree with somebody in a seersucker suit, by the way.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>MARTIN: That's the - stock, and that is why the prices are going up.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Charlie.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: I'm not quite sure what Andreessen is complaining about. I mean is he complaining about the regulations?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: He's talking about for the young companies, you know, there is such a microscope on you. Every part of your business ends up being connected and end up being tied back to your self-pricing and morale.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: Well, too bad, pal.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: I mean, you know, that's what - you want to be a public company, you are going to have some regulations you have to follow. I will say this, though. Listen, it is great that they're coming public. We should point out that the NASDAQ has been overshadowed. This has been overshadowed. NASDAQ has done 100 tech IPOs in the past year. That's what I'm .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It's amazing.</p><p/><p>HOENIG: Can I just comment quickly?</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: And, you know, they didn't win the Alibaba one, but they won some other ones. We had Ashley on the floor of the stock exchange.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: NASDAQ won, I think, GoPro, right?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: To make this point. You guys can jump in. Let me make this point, Jonathan. When you are getting numbers like this you're getting close to a top.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: It is not general .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Jonathan, real quick, last comment, go ahead.</p><p/><p>HOENIG: What's - I don't know, Charlie has been - I know calling for a tough for at least a couple of weeks or months now. And you say boo-hoo hoo for companies that are trying to become public.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: Months.</p><p/><p>HOENIG: Think back to before Sarbanes-Oxley. It has been harder and harder for small companies to raise money. That's why now some of them are trying to use the Jobs Act to raise money.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: Why are we seeing .?</p><p/><p>HOENIG: Because those regulations are so extensive.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: We have got to go. You guys can keep fighting in the break. That's fine. Thanks, guys. All right, there is no margin of error for this comeback. American demand for natural ingredients just keeps on growing, and the likes of butter are on a roll, get it? Get it? I know, one too many jokes in there for me. Plus, as good as Goldberg. Whoopee is the last one standing after complete overhaul on \"The View.\" Find out how she ended up the lone survivor. \"Piles of Money\" coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS HOST: As the situation in Iraq escalates, other countries in the region are getting sucked in. Surveillance drones from Iran are flying over the country. The White House is looking to Syrian rebels to potentially play a role.</p><p/><p>Joining me now, Chris Harmer, from the Institute for the Study of War and Fox News Middle East expert, Walid Phares. Chris, let me start with you. I mean, this situation is intensifying.</p><p/><p>CHRIS HARMER, INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR: Melissa, it's a pleasure to be here, thanks for having me. Yes, the situation is intensifying. If you look at is the snapshot, it looks like ISIS is culminating with this massive offensive. In fact, if you look closer at what they have been doing the past two years they have been building towards this.</p><p/><p>They have done all the small building blocks they need to organize their terrorist state and using that to attack the government in Mosul, which they've already won and they are now taking over the western desert areas of Iraq that used to be dominated by the Sunni tribes.</p><p/><p>The real question here is, is the Iraqi security force going to be able to respond to this? So far the answer is no.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Walid, I mean, it's not about just about Iraq. It's about the entire region being sucked into this conflict as we said. Look at the White House proposing to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels, how do you identify a moderate Syrian rebels are?</p><p/><p>DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS MIDDLE EAST EXPERT: Speaking of how many countries, let's do the count, Syria was involved, and they are considering those. Lebanon may go in because Lebanon also has pro and against ISIS. Iran by sending the drones into Iraq will shoot against them. How will we identify the market?</p><p/><p>We're five years late. We have been urging the administration since the Arabs spring to do so in civil society. Now it will be time to find a less Islamist and jihadists on the ground, this is not something that will have a bright future.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So if everyone in the region is getting involved, is that an argument for us to get involved or to stand back? Chris, what do you think?</p><p/><p>HARMER: It's wrong for the U.S. to get involve. Look, we have strategic interests in Syria whether we want to acknowledge it or not. We have strategic interests in Iraq whether we want to acknowledge it or not. It is easy to embrace the isolationist argument, but in today's interconnected world it's not possible.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What are the interests?</p><p/><p>HARMER: We do not want to see a caliphate organized in Eastern Syria and Western Iraq where ISIS has the complete safe haven. If you look at what al Qaeda had in Afghanistan, they had a safe haven as guests of the Taliban. What they are organizing is a nation state where they are guests of nobody and beholden to no one. They can do whatever they want.</p><p/><p>In fact, one of the arguments between ISIS and al Qaeda, al Qaeda saw how many fighters that ISIS was attracting, Europe, North America. They said you should use those guys right now to export terror back. ISIS said no. We will win the war here first and then have this cadres of several thousand battle hardened formerly trained terrorists going back to Europe and North America with passports and terrorist attacks here.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So Walid, is it realistic to think that we can do something to break up that safe phase?</p><p/><p>PHARES: We could have, should have and continue to consider those situations. Let me say this. If ISIS or (inaudible) organization is not going to be stop, they will carve up this piece of Iraq and the other side of Syria. A large section of Syria not in Lebanon and put pressure on Jordan across the border with Saudi Arabia, it's not going to stop there.</p><p/><p>And of course, as the gentleman has said, they are going to have launching pad much stronger that the United States and the west. We need to begin acting with our allies. For example, I would recommend to support the Kurds in the north and mildly support the south in the situation.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Gentlemen, thanks for your expertise. We really appreciate it. It seems to be easing somewhat, crude-oil prices are lower after two consecutive weeks of gains. Let's go to trader, Andrew Keene at the CME. This is the dichotomy. You heard from the guests before you that this situation is getting much bigger, the whole region is being pulled into it. At the same time, if traders get used to it as background noise, what is going on?</p><p/><p>ANDREW KEENE, KEENEONTHEMARKET.COM: We talk about it a couple times. A lot of the oil price factor in this the fact we haven't had a resolution, effective in the oil price over the last 12 trading days we have been stuck in a tight race between 105 and 108. I will look at the break out, which is to the downside. If there is resolution overseas over the weekend, out we will see oil embracing 105, 101 in a heartbeat or go to 120. The fact there isn't a resolution and they after day the price of oil goes cotter is not factoring that in. That is a fear to the downside.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Andrew Keene, thank you so much. It's a natural state of mind how food label using every antioxidants in the book to make your spending anything but organic. At the end of the day it is all about money.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I am Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief. Nike reaping ahead today after earnings surpassed expectations with 18 percent sales growth in Europe. World Cup giving the company boost with some better numbers out of the soccer division. Banks importing risky borrowers with $4 million in credit cards issued to, 4 million credit cards issued for sub-prime borrowers in the first quarter. That is up around 40 percent from last year and is highest amount since the financial crisis.</p><p/><p>Hundreds of Oklahoma residents met with oil and gas regulators to ask if recent earthquakes were the results of drilling operations. Many of them have urged the industry to start banning the wells they use to dispose of waste water with some suspect, seismic activity. That is the latest from the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Profits come naturally to brands catching in on the nutrition crazed, but consumers getting wary of the labels on their groceries. It turns out some of these healthy buzzwords sound great, but they mean absolutely nothing.</p><p/><p>Here now supermarket guru, Phil Lampert, natural labels when you see something labels natural, bring in $40 billion a year. The FDA says there is no definition of natural. Actually doesn't mean anything. I am outraged. Are you outrage?</p><p/><p>PHIL LAMPERT, SUPERMARKET EXPERT: No. Because this is a 15-year-old scam that we have been living with. This is nearly 70s. This is not something new. All those companies started using the word natural and it can't have artificial flavors. And when we see one of these products, we think it came out of the ground that way.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Really means those things because the FDA says it doesn't mean anything and consumer reports is petitioning the FDA to ban the word natural from labels because they are saying it doesn't guarantee anything.</p><p/><p>LAMPERT: And it should be banned and there's no FDA regulation that specifies that, but FDA from the web site and the regulations do specified that they will allow the word natural to be used under those three conditions if they are met some there isn't a rule, but there have been complaints where people have used those having added color for example and FDA --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: At the checkout counter there were fried potato chips that were there and a set of natural and for a moment on is like maybe these aren't so bad for you. But the reality comes flooding back in and you know is a lot. University of Houston found people are more likely to think that foods with labels like organic and natural are healthy even when the food was candy or soda. Is organic another one that is a fraud?</p><p/><p>LAMPERT: There are certified organic regulations, number one, but when it comes to nutrition, there is no difference between something that is organic and conventionally grown nutritionally. You can use pesticides with organics, that is something people don't realize, but there are regulations in place so at least that is better than we think. We pay more for organic or natural.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: We do and at the same time people I shunning things that are frozen or in cans, just across the board even things like healthy choice, lean cuisine, struggling. Now that people have this perception that natural and organic is better so they see something in the aisle. Are we going to see these brands go away?</p><p/><p>LAMPERT: Absolutely not. In the case of Conagra Foods, for example, you look at Healthy Choice, what they have done over the past few years has been dramatic to your point, people don't understand fresh and frozen what that really means. USDA came out a couple years ago talking about their studies, lot of frozen products have more nutrients. But Conagra has educed sodium. It limited ingredients, taking out ingredients, using apples instead.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I don't want to run out of time because I have one more for you. I can't believe it is butter. The kitchen favorite melting its way into hearts and arteries across the country, the \"Wall Street Journal\" even calling butter one of the great comeback stories in U.S. food history.</p><p/><p>Check out this chart showing the recent consumption decline of greasy margarine and the rise of delicious fluffy golden butter. Look at that spread. Get it? Look at that spread. What do you think?</p><p/><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"THE WALL STREE JOURNAL\": I love butter. I think is delicious, one of those simple luxuries.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Why is it making a comeback in your opinion?</p><p/><p>LAMPERT: A couple things. One is taste certainly, but also let's not forget everything Julia Child told us was true. Use a little bit of butter, you will have flavor and it will cook better and that a lot of other artificial product.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Heading into the last hour of trading, let's check with Liz Claman to see what she has coming up -- Liz.</p><p/><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS: This is jam packed because as we go to the end element is the end of the month for the trading session. We are watching markets. And the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who's breaking news right and left on the grand jury that now has brand new evidence that does not look good for top executives of General Motors. We are watching that.</p><p/><p>But also when we talk about the market's the best way to proceed going into the month of July. We have a bond guide and equity guide talk about why each one feels the way they do about that. John Miller, and billions in assets under management, close to 100 billion just to be exact and they are calling it the Uber or the Zafor wine. You can photograph wine labels when you are at dinner or lunch or breakfast depending.</p><p/><p>And it will put you into a database, you can order wine or do anything when it comes to, we have the founder and CEO, this is the most popular apps on iTunes when it comes to that, food and wine, the best new apps in all categories. Alex Fishman is the CEO and founder of \"Delectable.\"</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I am downloading that at the moment the show is over. It is Friday. Perfect. Whether it is on Wall Street are mainstream here's who's making or losing money. Anyone with a piece of either Dollar General or Family Dollar, those are taking a hit today after dollar general CEO said, investors Carl Icahn to merge the two companies. Shares for -- don't go feeling financial strains from all this. He has run 11 million shares of family dollar meaning he has already lost $16.5 million since this morning.</p><p/><p>I am telling you, hoping to make some money, employees stirring -- suing her boss over stressful daily commute, commute, a New Jersey woman says rush-hour traffic has during to send depressed and management should have allowed her to come in a later each day. Her lawyers are demanding an unspecified amount in damages. I wonder she has ever been on the New York subway.</p><p/><p>Still making money, everyone else is shown the door, Whoopi Goldberg, the Oscar winner is the sole survivor of a major cleanup of the TV show \"The View.\" Reports say talks broke out new deals with former co-host Sheri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy leaving her as the last one at the table until the replacements are found. No wireless in the woods. Tech addicts go cold turkey a digital detox cam. All of a sudden my cruise isn't sounding so bad. Smart money on the way.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Time for fun with spare change. Putting down your phone can be hard to do, so much so that some are willing to pay to have it taken away. Camp Grounded is an adult summer camp where people completely unplug. Levi Felix joins me now. Why do I need a camp for this? Can't put my phone in a drawer for the weekend?</p><p/><p>LEVI FELIX, CAMP GROUNDED FOUNDER: Of course, you can put your phone away in a drawer and go camping but most people find when they go on vacation they spent a fourth of their vacation on e-mail or on their phone checking it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Has anyone ever tried to cheat? What is the deal? You have the phones under your hat?</p><p/><p>FELIX: No. Actually I got a nice haircut when I was at camp last week. They decided to give me a bulkhead. Campers show up and turn the devices into a safe. Anything of value, locked up for four days and we never had anyone try to sneak out.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Why do I want to go to a camp and pay for this? I want to detox, I can put it to the side. People need to go somewhere and have it physically taken from them in order to do it?</p><p/><p>FELIX: We are focused on the unplugging, it is what you are looking to reconnect with. There is yoga, meditation, hiking, different arts and crafts programs, our jury, full on summer camp for adults. We trade space where people can put away their phones so they are not going to get work e- mail's for calls anywhere from 385 to 574 four days, we do all organic sustainable food. Basically like a cruise ship but in the redwoods for four days and pretty amazing what happens when you have 300 adults altogether, everyone is hanging out and singing together.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I am about to go on a cruise and trying to think of which two vacations I would rather do. Levi, thank you so much. No phones for this one. Instead of e-mailing his resume look at what this guy did. He printed his resume on a pack of beer.</p><p/><p>Graphic designer, Brennan Gleeson started Resumemail at the University of Frazier Valley in addition to his crafty labeling, he broods the beer himself. Apparently the companies he sent it to drank up the idea. He says he got a few offers right away. What do you think of this? Pretty clever.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Nice to see an entrepreneur. These ideas don't often work. People sending balloons and flowers and kind of tacky, but for a graphic designer he is showing talent. It is really creative.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I heard someone wrapping up resume around a pineapple. Put on coffee because it perks everyone up. There you go. If there is one thing Americans are great at in a World Cup is the ability to lose a game and still get ahead. Asking anything about the point system and how it works, listen to who is getting that hilariously and publicly wrong. At the end of the day it is all about money and a very complex score keeping.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Well, we didn't win it, but we're in it. Team USA advances in the World Cup game despite its loss to Germany yesterday all thanks to the point system. If you didn't get the math of sports here, you are not alone. Dennys made the same mistake, going to eat my wait in ice cream now because of sadness.</p><p/><p>Jonathan Hoenig and Scott Martin are back with me now. I mean, they're trying to tweet and stay on top of it, but apparently they didn't realize we were still in. What do you think, Jonathan?</p><p/><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, soccer is still just an unknown entity for so many of us here in the states, Melissa, so I take the same approach that I do with stocks, you have to kind of go where the action is.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>HOENIG: Call me when we're in the finals.</p><p/><p>SCOTT MARTIN: Come on --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead, Scott.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: Jonathan, don't make my come over there again. This is big for the country though. Everybody is getting fired up about this. The sad thing about Dennys, Melissa, they didn't give out free food because the USA lost.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I didn't really watch yesterday. I tried to, but apparently all of Wall Street did. Volume of shares traded during the game yesterday, 25 percent lower than the same time as last year. Scott, you were watching, yes? Were you trading or watching?</p><p/><p>MARTIN: I was definitely watching. And the funny thing is, you know, if you're at a restaurant watch how many people pile in there, and the second the game is over, it's like a stampede out the door. But it's good business for these restaurants. If you open up your business for some of these fans, you get people spending money, and I think it's good.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely, Jonathan, I guess I wasn't alone not watching because even astronauts in space tuned in, American and German astronauts at the International Space Station celebrated their teams advancing with a little victory dancing. Do we have that video? What do you think? Jonathan, did you see this?</p><p/><p>HOENIG: I didn't see that, but I'm not surprised. I mean, sporting events like this, Melissa, give us the opportunity to come together for a shared experience and celebrate the good, the good for being the good, the heroic nature of these really incredible athletes who are able to run for I don't know how long, how hard, their endurance is remarkable. So the fact that we can all get together and cheer, a positive thing.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely. Gentlemen, thanks to both of you. Happy Friday to everyone out there. I don't know about you, but these guys here in the studio are ready to get the weekend started, right, guys? Yes.

For some big-time tech investors still aren't happy. Could this be a sign of the top? Buyer beware, the one word that sells $40 billion worth of food each year and means absolutely nothing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And paying up for some will power. We'll introduce you to the company that will help you unplug for a price. Because even when they say it's not it is always about money. Economic realities hitting home for more than 40 million American families. A new study out of Harvard University finding that 35 percent of U.S. households can't afford their current living situation. With me now, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Veronica Dagher, editor of \"Power Trend Profits, Chris Versace and Dominick Tavella of Diversified Financial. Thanks to all of you for joining us. So, what that means is that their rent or their mortgage consumes 30 percent of their monthly income. I mean this is huge. This is 40 million Americans. For a lot of them it consumes 50 percent! Veronica, this is a disaster.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, Fox BUSINESS: It is a disaster especially because the more you spend on housing the less you have to spend on other things like consumer discretionary goods. And so that has larger effects to our economy. These people are spending so much on their rent they can't go be buying, you know, new cars or taking vacations. They just don't have the money.</p><p>FRANCIS: And a lot of the problems has to do with the fact that incomes aren't growing, right, Chris?</p><p>CHRIS VERSACE, POWERTREND PROFIST: Absolutely. I mean you look at all the jobs that we've seen created, but we look at the mix of those jobs, lower income jobs. So, there's not a lot of wage growth. We are seeing inflation across food and energy, and to your point, Veronica, disposable income is going to be tapped, so where are these people going to live?</p><p>FRANCIS: No, I mean among the other problems that creates when you look at the GDP print that we saw this week and just the big pullback, a lot of it had to do with consumer spending. You're not spending on discretionary goods if you have this much of your money going to your rent and mortgage, right?</p><p>DOMINICK TAVELLA, DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL: Not only that. But it's the tax consequence what is happened in the first quarter. So, people paying much higher taxes than they were before. They are paying much higher in cost of living issues, even though the government says there is no cost of living. Cost of housing has gone through the roof. It really as depressed the average consumer what they can actually do out there.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, more fallout from Barclays, over alleged dark pool fraud. Charlie Gasparino first reported New York's lawsuit against Barclay's right here on \"MONEY.\" Now, they're getting the cold shoulder from several big name brokerage firms, including Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada. Chris, this is an interesting one. Because it seems like dark pools, if you look at this, we may die their own death. If now people are afraid when they stay away from them. What do you think?</p><p>VERSACE: I think you're absolutely right on that. We are ultimately designed for, which was to allow large pools to be traded, you know, it's very anonymously, so people can move in and out. But where there is lot of smoke there is fire. The SEC is investigating. And all of a sudden what may have been once so safe may not be.</p><p>FRANCIS: Veronica.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think investors are going to be demanding more transparency in this case.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER: They want to see what's going on. They're called dark pools for a reason.</p><p>FRANCIS: For a reason, right.</p><p>DAGHER: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is the opposite of transparency. That is the whole point.</p><p>DAGHER: That's right, yeah. And I think a lot of these firms that are stepping away from their connections to Barclays right now. You know, there is a PR component to this, too.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER: Nobody wants to be associated with a firm that could be saying false things to investors.</p><p>FRANCIS: What is so appalling about this, if it is true, Dominick, you know, the charges that on one hand they were saying that they weren't allowing traders to have preference a step ahead of others at the very same time that they were doing exactly that within their dark pools. And really, I mean, once again, it's just like such a big knock on Wall Street.</p><p>TAVELLA: Yeah, two things - first this is not a small investor problem. This is really institutional. Traders were looking to do big block trades and not let the whole world know what they're doing. Having said that they need to have a credibility, a trust with the institution that they're doing it. That they're getting fair pricing. That trades are being done orderly and efficiently. And when that doesn't happen the trust gets cut.</p><p>FRANCIS: But it does have to do with the small investor because it's this idea that Wall Street is rigged. And there's more and more of these stories come out. It makes a little guy feel like why in the world should I even get involved and why should I invest? Meanwhile, I mean the stock market has this thing that has really gone up in this recovery. So, if you're on the sidelines because you're paranoid you really lost out</p><p>TAVELLA: If the small investor out there trading 100 shares of Facebook, this is not their world, OK? And whether they should or shouldn't be trading on .</p><p>FRANCIS: Nobody keeps them away from investing at all, Veronica.</p><p>DAGHER: It's the express issue, yeah. They're even more skeptical. And they don't even understand what a dark pool is. A lot of professionals don't understand what that is. So, it's just - it's more confusion and more skepticism.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. All right, the federal government is set to auction off $17 million worth of bitcoin today. This is all courtesy of the shuttered online market silk road. The online sell is shrouded in secrecy, speaking of secrecy, and is attracting some financial power players. Veronica, I mean, this is an interesting one. If they just went ahead and put all this out on the open market, bitcoin, it would totally depress the price.</p><p>DAGHER: Yeah, it would sink the price. It's going to be interesting to see how the government handles this. You know, it's not like selling confiscated Chevys that they have got from drug bust.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAGHER: So, how this plays out and how the investors, you know, I think there were investor lists, potential bidder lists released already. How that affects the bidding will be interesting to watch.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, Chris, are you watching this one?</p><p>VERSACE: I'm watching it a little bit. I'm wondering why the government doesn't pull in like a currency trader or somebody in the know for dealing with this .</p><p>FRANCIS: I thought they were? They're not doing that?</p><p>VERSACE: You know, it sounds like they're doing it in-house. We know that they are not going to do it well. So, you know, how well can they leak this out? That's the big question.</p><p>TAVELLA: What is interesting that they confiscated these bitcoins from a criminal entity, right? The criminals are figuring out, bitcoin is the perfect tool to buy and sell assets without having trunk loads of 100- dollar bills. So, I think that's what's probably more interesting about this, is the government has figured it out, criminals figured it out, this is a perfect vehicle to trade value back and forth.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Absolutely. All right, iPhones hitting the bargain bin at Walmart. The retailer pricing Apple's smartphone for the - is rolling back prices to $29. I mean I can't believe this, the iPhone 5-c, $29. You have to buy a two year contract, but come on. Amazing.</p><p>DAGHER: Yeah, it's really cheap. But I think this is interesting because Walmart is only applying this deal for people who come into their stores. And I think this speaks to Walmart really needing to drive traffic. They're losing out on foot traffic. They're doing pretty good online, but they're trying to find a way to how to get people in these huge stores and that is a real issue. This might be a strategy to .</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, pretty smart thing for us.</p><p>VERSACE: Well, you know, two things. One I think it is smart for Walmart to bring people in to get them to shop and buy all these things. But also, I think it's smart for Apple. Remember the 5C was not a big volume device.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>VERSACE: It's a nice way for them to kind of flush out all the inventory in the channel potentially ahead of the iPhone 6.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think it's also interesting to me it means that, Apple has power to sell all across the price spectrum. Because it used to be the really high cost phone and you saw everybody, you know, couldn't afford it.</p><p>VERSACE: We don't know, necessarily know that it is Apple who is selling it for $29 through Walmart. Walmart could actually be buying the phone and subsidizing it to bring people in, kind of a loss leader.</p><p>TAVELLA: You know, Melissa, I will take the opposite of this one. Steve Jobs is going to be turning in his grave.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA: But it's only with Apple cutting-edge technology, but this posh, this mystique, it was a Gucci bag, it was the Armani. Now, they are selling it on the discount bin in Walmart. I think it takes some of the luster away from Apple. I don't know. I think it takes the shine off.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think - interesting. All right. Life on Wall Street proving no piece of cake for Crumbs Bakery. The one time king of cupcakes will be dropped by the NASDAQ after falling by more than 80 percent in the past year. I mean I don't know if you guys notice this, they're on every corner right now. They have 70 stores. 22 of which were open in the last year. There is one on my block. There is another cupcake store within the next block. How many cupcake stores do we need, Chris?</p><p>VERSACE: Not that many apparently.</p><p>FRANCIS: Apparently, not that many.</p><p>VERSACE: And the thing is, you know, you can go almost anywhere now and get cupcakes. You can go to Starbucks and get cupcakes. You can go to .</p><p>FRANCIS: Big cupcakes.</p><p>VERSACE: Panera Bread and all this ...</p><p>TAVELLA: You can actually buy their cupcakes at BJ's. So, again, this idea, this mystique, this great store, you walk into, now they have kind of tarnished their brand. Competitors are coming.</p><p>FRANCIS: Isn't that a warning, so we have this huge IPO rush going on right now. I mean, you know, that it is - it's going to be the biggest week since 2006. I remember when Crumbs went public and I thought it was the most ridiculous thing. So, I'm like how can you be a public company when all you do is sell cupcakes? Is this the warning to Yo or all these other things? What do you think of it?</p><p>DAGHER: That is the point. Maybe not everyone should go public.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER: Maybe it's not a good idea.</p><p>TAVELLA: So, let's look at Starbucks, right? Same theme. It's just coffee instead of a cupcake. They reinvented themselves, reinvented themselves, reinvented themselves and expanded intelligently. This company didn't single product. Lots of competition.</p><p>FRANCIS: I guess, although you - almost everybody needs a cup of coffee to get through the day. I don't need a cupcake.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA: I probably need it, but .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, I'm going to lose my job.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Riding shotgun wedding. Uber expanding its reach into marital bliss, bringing free full service weddings to some lucky couples tomorrow. So I thought, you know, Uber is the king of this, we'll do something, you know, within an hour, bring it to you. They always have a gimmick on in order to promote themselves. But this one is really special. Because they say you just need to bring enough legal documents to get a marriage license with you, but they will provide the notary and a qualified officiate to handle the paperwork - ceremony, not to mention all the other accoutrements that go with it. Veronica.</p><p>DAGHER: Oh, man, I just got married.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAGHER: And I wish that .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAGHER: Actually, no.</p><p>FRANCIS: Will they do on demand divorce next?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA: That might drive volume. FRANCIS: I don't know. I mean in Vegas it's easy to get married proving that you really shouldn't most of the time. Like they make it too easy. So, maybe these guys are doing the same thing.</p><p>VERSACE: You know, Melissa, I'm going to turn it back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>VERSACE: Would you say that nothing says romance like Uber?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. Quickie wedding, it is very romantic.</p><p>TAVELLA: But Uber has done a lot of these kinds of gimmicks, right?</p><p>FRANCIS: It's funny.</p><p>TAVELLA: It's a hell of a lot cheaper than hiring a Park Avenue advertising firm.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>TAVELLA: Lots of PR. Get the name out there. It's fabulous. We laugh about it. It's good stuff.</p><p>FRANCIS: You guys were fantastic. Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up the great band of China. Why Hillary Clinton's new book won't be hitting the bestseller's list in Shanghai anytime soon.</p><p>Plus, consumer sentiment is on the rise, but will feelings be enough to beat what lies beneath? \"THE MONEY\" hard truth coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Walking on sunshine. Consumer sentiment on the rise of beating street expectations today. Is this a ray of hope? Here now, Fox Business's Charlie Gasparino along with Veronica Dagher and former CBO director Doug Holtz-Eakin. Thanks so much for joining us. Doug, I'm going to let you go first.</p><p>DOUGH HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CBO DIRECTOR: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Because you're on the road there. Consumer sentiment rising higher today. The consumer is what was missing from the GDP report. Consumer spending was very weak. That was one of the big reasons we saw the big contraction. Does this mean things are about to get better?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I don't think so. If you look inside the numbers, they're happier about what is going on right now, but they are not more confident about the future. And if you look at the monthly data, we've seen in the past two months, the first two months of the second quarter, real declines in personal consumption expenditures. So, there is not a lot out there to suggest the households are going to pick up this economy and carry it.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, Charlie, I always laugh when I see the consumer sentiment numbers. Because it's like asking people what they will do. It's not what they're actually doing.</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, Fox BUSINESS: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean it's like how you are feeling.</p><p>GASPARINO: What they might do .</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: In the future maybe, possibly. I would just say this about - I think that negative GDP print was probably somewhat of an aberration. I don't think we're in a recession right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: It certainly make the recipe - you look like .</p><p>GASPARINO: It's not - it's not - I'm not going to say that's good. But you know, one thing about the Obama economy. We've seen this one before, where you have a blip up in GDP you have a blip up in consumer confidence. And then you get a blip down and then you really have very, very little economic growth.</p><p>FRANCIS: And it all nets out to just standing still. That's right.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Charlie, may I point something out?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I mean here is the thing, Charlie. With the first quarter that we got, we'd have to go to 3.7 percent every quarter for the rest of the year, just to hit two percent for the year.</p><p>GASPARINO: OK.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Never seen that in this presidency.</p><p>FRANCIS: And Veronica, I would say on the horizon, I mean, we have the specter of potential inflation. Have you heard James Bullard here on Fox Business earlier this week, he's already saying it's going to be hotter than we thought. Consumers as they go to the store every day, they certainly feel it being hotter every day. I mean is that a real threat, inflation?</p><p>DAGHER: Yeah, I think it is. Yes, you go to the grocery store now, things cost more than they did a couple of months ago. So, I think that is a real issue. And also, if you look at the personal spending numbers we got for May. If you adjust for inflation, those numbers actually went down. So, I think between that and people's fears about the economy, they are still seeing people - their neighbors without a job for a long time, people are underemployed. They're afraid to spend. So, we're going to see the savings rates continue to go up until we feel more secure. I don't know what that's going to take, though, to make them feel more secure.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean Doug you are saying, you know, we would have to be above three percent for the rest of year in order to even out to something. What do you think is going to happen for the rest of the year?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: What this economy has done for years - is it's along the two percent. That's been the average consumption for growth, household spending growth, there's no evidence that they are going to change their behavior. They don't have the income or the sentiment to do it. Businesses are the wildcard.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: And if they somehow get some animal spirits and go with the big cap-ex expansion then we can get a good year, but I don't see that, Charlie.</p><p>GASPARINO: I agree with you. If you're talking about two percent growth and you have .</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I am.</p><p>GASPARINO: And you're talking about inflation in certain sectors where the Fed has to raise rates, we're heading for a recession. I mean Hillary Clinton runs for office. If she runs in 2015, 2016, she is very possible, that she runs in the middle of an economic downturn.</p><p>FRANCIS: Interesting. Meanwhile, you always make the point, Charlie, and you are right, the only one who's getting rich in this economy right now are people who are in the market. Because that is what all this Fed work has done, it's just stimulated the stock market. It's ironic that these policies out of Washington, all they've helped the one percent, who they say they hate. So, very interesting. Guys, thanks to all of you for joining us. From the U.S. to every corner of globe money is flying around the world today starting in Germany which has canceled the contract with Verizon over fears that the U.S. is spying on them. It all goes back to documents leaked by Edward Snowden, which revealed we had kind of an eavesdropping on calls made by Chancellor Angela Merkel. You remember that, right? Germans, they were not so amused by that, especially as the U.S. still refuses to agree with a no spy deal with the country. Verizon now bearing the brunt of that. It has been providing a communications network to the German government since 2010.</p><p>Over to Japan, which is now exporting square watermelons to grow throughout the globe. They curious, look at that are grown in boxes from a very young age. It sounds cruel. Which forces them into a cube-like shape. They weigh 13-pounds a apiece. Look at them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, I think about it, no, no, no. Now they are making way to fruit stand in Canada. They don't come cheap. One sold in Moscow last year, went for more than 800 bucks. Juicy profits indeed. Landing in China where Hillary Clinton is getting the cold shoulder by officials. Publishers there say they will not be purchasing the translation rights to her new book. Local agencies have banned the English language version from being imported. There are a few parts of book where she is somewhat critical of the Chinese government. You know, we kind of saw that one coming, right?</p><p>Crying wolves of Wall Street. The hottest week for IPOs in years and still not enough for some of the tech heavyweights. That picture is going to come back to haunt that guy. Plus, if you can't win them, beer them. One job hunter's clever case to seal the deal. We're raking in the money coming up next. See this of this guy.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Hold on tight. Shares of the venture camera maker GoPro powering higher in the second day of trading. Let's go to Ashley Webster on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. For more on this, when even higher today, Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, Fox BUSINESS: You know what they should do, Melissa. Scrap one of those GoPro cameras on the stock, of what you go up and down. Mostly up. But as we know, when - yesterday, the price was set at $24. It shot up yesterday and today. Look at this, it actually went above the $40 mark briefly before coming back down, still up 17percent. What else would you expect from this Adrenalin play on GoPro?</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely, still, Michael's not looking like a masterpiece, though, on its return to the market?</p><p>WEBSTER: No, a tale of two IPOs. Really, although that said, Michael's pricing it $17, debuting on the NASDAQ today, came out very slowly. Actually, went down below the IPO price. But it since inched its way up, and at least showing some positive signs, up 17, 1363 on the day. Up about three quarters of a percent. The arts and crafts. You know, by the way, I didn't realize, they also own the Aaron Brothers chain as well. So they go public finally. And up about 17, as I say, 14 cents above the share price that was listed. So, a slow but steady start I guess we'll call it. No GoPro.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. All right, Ashley, thanks so much. So, the market wrapping up its biggest week for IPOs in eight years. Some big tech investors are not breaking out the champagne. Rather, they're crying about how hard it is to go public. Somewhere alone violin plays for them. Is this a sign of the top? Charlie is back with us, along with Scott Martin from United Advisors and Jonathan Hoenig from CapitalistPig Hedge Fund. They're both Fox News contributors. So, I mean it has been the week of endless IPOs. Still, you have Marc Andreessen up there saying, it comes across like I'm complaining about how hard it is to be public. Of course, the answer is, you just need to suck it up. I mean poor IPO guys getting out there and making a fortune. Jonathan, ridiculous?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG HEDGE FUND: No, but we should be happy they're getting out there making a fortune, Melissa. We should be happy that deals are getting done and still being priced. I don't think this is the death of the IPO market at all, as you pointed out. It was an extremely busy week for IPOs. And you know, you'll the death comes when you see the IPOs starts coming public and just falling flat. It happened in 1999 .</p><p>FRANCIS: No, I know, but Scott . --</p><p>HOENIG: In 2000.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't think it's so much the death of the IPO. I think it is more of a sign of the top. That you have a zillion coming out. It's the most in whatever we - you know, eight years. And then you have people complaining about how hard it is when here, everyone is doing it. How hard could it be? What do you think?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS: Well ..</p><p>FRANCIS: Everybody's got.</p><p>MARTIN: You're right, everybody is doing it. But here's the thing, Melissa. I mean Andreessen is complaining about the pricing I think more than anything. And he's talking about back in the '90s with Netscape and some of these other companies coming out at 2 billion valuation was kind of the status quo. Now you have got companies like Uber that are in - you know, $17 billion-dollar range. Even interest is somewhere between five and six billion. Here is the funny thing, right? GoPro is somewhere around 3 billion, but the stock is up gigantically, since it's IPO, because probably too cheap. So, it's more about pricing issue, but like Jonathan said I will never disagree with somebody in a seersucker suit, by the way.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MARTIN: That's the - stock, and that is why the prices are going up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Charlie.</p><p>GASPARINO: I'm not quite sure what Andreessen is complaining about. I mean is he complaining about the regulations?</p><p>FRANCIS: He's talking about for the young companies, you know, there is such a microscope on you. Every part of your business ends up being connected and end up being tied back to your self-pricing and morale.</p><p>GASPARINO: Well, too bad, pal.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, you know, that's what - you want to be a public company, you are going to have some regulations you have to follow. I will say this, though. Listen, it is great that they're coming public. We should point out that the NASDAQ has been overshadowed. This has been overshadowed. NASDAQ has done 100 tech IPOs in the past year. That's what I'm .</p><p>FRANCIS: It's amazing.</p><p>HOENIG: Can I just comment quickly?</p><p>GASPARINO: And, you know, they didn't win the Alibaba one, but they won some other ones. We had Ashley on the floor of the stock exchange.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: NASDAQ won, I think, GoPro, right?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: To make this point. You guys can jump in. Let me make this point, Jonathan. When you are getting numbers like this you're getting close to a top.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>GASPARINO: It is not general .</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonathan, real quick, last comment, go ahead.</p><p>HOENIG: What's - I don't know, Charlie has been - I know calling for a tough for at least a couple of weeks or months now. And you say boo-hoo hoo for companies that are trying to become public.</p><p>GASPARINO: Months.</p><p>HOENIG: Think back to before Sarbanes-Oxley. It has been harder and harder for small companies to raise money. That's why now some of them are trying to use the Jobs Act to raise money.</p><p>GASPARINO: Why are we seeing .?</p><p>HOENIG: Because those regulations are so extensive.</p><p>FRANCIS: We have got to go. You guys can keep fighting in the break. That's fine. Thanks, guys. All right, there is no margin of error for this comeback. American demand for natural ingredients just keeps on growing, and the likes of butter are on a roll, get it? Get it? I know, one too many jokes in there for me. Plus, as good as Goldberg. Whoopee is the last one standing after complete overhaul on \"The View.\" Find out how she ended up the lone survivor. \"Piles of Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS HOST: As the situation in Iraq escalates, other countries in the region are getting sucked in. Surveillance drones from Iran are flying over the country. The White House is looking to Syrian rebels to potentially play a role.</p><p>Joining me now, Chris Harmer, from the Institute for the Study of War and Fox News Middle East expert, Walid Phares. Chris, let me start with you. I mean, this situation is intensifying.</p><p>CHRIS HARMER, INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR: Melissa, it's a pleasure to be here, thanks for having me. Yes, the situation is intensifying. If you look at is the snapshot, it looks like ISIS is culminating with this massive offensive. In fact, if you look closer at what they have been doing the past two years they have been building towards this.</p><p>They have done all the small building blocks they need to organize their terrorist state and using that to attack the government in Mosul, which they've already won and they are now taking over the western desert areas of Iraq that used to be dominated by the Sunni tribes.</p><p>The real question here is, is the Iraqi security force going to be able to respond to this? So far the answer is no.</p><p>FRANCIS: Walid, I mean, it's not about just about Iraq. It's about the entire region being sucked into this conflict as we said. Look at the White House proposing to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels, how do you identify a moderate Syrian rebels are?</p><p>DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS MIDDLE EAST EXPERT: Speaking of how many countries, let's do the count, Syria was involved, and they are considering those. Lebanon may go in because Lebanon also has pro and against ISIS. Iran by sending the drones into Iraq will shoot against them. How will we identify the market?</p><p>We're five years late. We have been urging the administration since the Arabs spring to do so in civil society. Now it will be time to find a less Islamist and jihadists on the ground, this is not something that will have a bright future.</p><p>FRANCIS: So if everyone in the region is getting involved, is that an argument for us to get involved or to stand back? Chris, what do you think?</p><p>HARMER: It's wrong for the U.S. to get involve. Look, we have strategic interests in Syria whether we want to acknowledge it or not. We have strategic interests in Iraq whether we want to acknowledge it or not. It is easy to embrace the isolationist argument, but in today's interconnected world it's not possible.</p><p>FRANCIS: What are the interests?</p><p>HARMER: We do not want to see a caliphate organized in Eastern Syria and Western Iraq where ISIS has the complete safe haven. If you look at what al Qaeda had in Afghanistan, they had a safe haven as guests of the Taliban. What they are organizing is a nation state where they are guests of nobody and beholden to no one. They can do whatever they want.</p><p>In fact, one of the arguments between ISIS and al Qaeda, al Qaeda saw how many fighters that ISIS was attracting, Europe, North America. They said you should use those guys right now to export terror back. ISIS said no. We will win the war here first and then have this cadres of several thousand battle hardened formerly trained terrorists going back to Europe and North America with passports and terrorist attacks here.</p><p>FRANCIS: So Walid, is it realistic to think that we can do something to break up that safe phase?</p><p>PHARES: We could have, should have and continue to consider those situations. Let me say this. If ISIS or (inaudible) organization is not going to be stop, they will carve up this piece of Iraq and the other side of Syria. A large section of Syria not in Lebanon and put pressure on Jordan across the border with Saudi Arabia, it's not going to stop there.</p><p>And of course, as the gentleman has said, they are going to have launching pad much stronger that the United States and the west. We need to begin acting with our allies. For example, I would recommend to support the Kurds in the north and mildly support the south in the situation.</p><p>FRANCIS: Gentlemen, thanks for your expertise. We really appreciate it. It seems to be easing somewhat, crude-oil prices are lower after two consecutive weeks of gains. Let's go to trader, Andrew Keene at the CME. This is the dichotomy. You heard from the guests before you that this situation is getting much bigger, the whole region is being pulled into it. At the same time, if traders get used to it as background noise, what is going on?</p><p>ANDREW KEENE, KEENEONTHEMARKET.COM: We talk about it a couple times. A lot of the oil price factor in this the fact we haven't had a resolution, effective in the oil price over the last 12 trading days we have been stuck in a tight race between 105 and 108. I will look at the break out, which is to the downside. If there is resolution overseas over the weekend, out we will see oil embracing 105, 101 in a heartbeat or go to 120. The fact there isn't a resolution and they after day the price of oil goes cotter is not factoring that in. That is a fear to the downside.</p><p>FRANCIS: Andrew Keene, thank you so much. It's a natural state of mind how food label using every antioxidants in the book to make your spending anything but organic. At the end of the day it is all about money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I am Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief. Nike reaping ahead today after earnings surpassed expectations with 18 percent sales growth in Europe. World Cup giving the company boost with some better numbers out of the soccer division. Banks importing risky borrowers with $4 million in credit cards issued to, 4 million credit cards issued for sub-prime borrowers in the first quarter. That is up around 40 percent from last year and is highest amount since the financial crisis.</p><p>Hundreds of Oklahoma residents met with oil and gas regulators to ask if recent earthquakes were the results of drilling operations. Many of them have urged the industry to start banning the wells they use to dispose of waste water with some suspect, seismic activity. That is the latest from the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Profits come naturally to brands catching in on the nutrition crazed, but consumers getting wary of the labels on their groceries. It turns out some of these healthy buzzwords sound great, but they mean absolutely nothing.</p><p>Here now supermarket guru, Phil Lampert, natural labels when you see something labels natural, bring in $40 billion a year. The FDA says there is no definition of natural. Actually doesn't mean anything. I am outraged. Are you outrage?</p><p>PHIL LAMPERT, SUPERMARKET EXPERT: No. Because this is a 15-year-old scam that we have been living with. This is nearly 70s. This is not something new. All those companies started using the word natural and it can't have artificial flavors. And when we see one of these products, we think it came out of the ground that way.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really means those things because the FDA says it doesn't mean anything and consumer reports is petitioning the FDA to ban the word natural from labels because they are saying it doesn't guarantee anything.</p><p>LAMPERT: And it should be banned and there's no FDA regulation that specifies that, but FDA from the web site and the regulations do specified that they will allow the word natural to be used under those three conditions if they are met some there isn't a rule, but there have been complaints where people have used those having added color for example and FDA --</p><p>FRANCIS: At the checkout counter there were fried potato chips that were there and a set of natural and for a moment on is like maybe these aren't so bad for you. But the reality comes flooding back in and you know is a lot. University of Houston found people are more likely to think that foods with labels like organic and natural are healthy even when the food was candy or soda. Is organic another one that is a fraud?</p><p>LAMPERT: There are certified organic regulations, number one, but when it comes to nutrition, there is no difference between something that is organic and conventionally grown nutritionally. You can use pesticides with organics, that is something people don't realize, but there are regulations in place so at least that is better than we think. We pay more for organic or natural.</p><p>FRANCIS: We do and at the same time people I shunning things that are frozen or in cans, just across the board even things like healthy choice, lean cuisine, struggling. Now that people have this perception that natural and organic is better so they see something in the aisle. Are we going to see these brands go away?</p><p>LAMPERT: Absolutely not. In the case of Conagra Foods, for example, you look at Healthy Choice, what they have done over the past few years has been dramatic to your point, people don't understand fresh and frozen what that really means. USDA came out a couple years ago talking about their studies, lot of frozen products have more nutrients. But Conagra has educed sodium. It limited ingredients, taking out ingredients, using apples instead.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't want to run out of time because I have one more for you. I can't believe it is butter. The kitchen favorite melting its way into hearts and arteries across the country, the \"Wall Street Journal\" even calling butter one of the great comeback stories in U.S. food history.</p><p>Check out this chart showing the recent consumption decline of greasy margarine and the rise of delicious fluffy golden butter. Look at that spread. Get it? Look at that spread. What do you think?</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"THE WALL STREE JOURNAL\": I love butter. I think is delicious, one of those simple luxuries.</p><p>FRANCIS: Why is it making a comeback in your opinion?</p><p>LAMPERT: A couple things. One is taste certainly, but also let's not forget everything Julia Child told us was true. Use a little bit of butter, you will have flavor and it will cook better and that a lot of other artificial product.</p><p>FRANCIS: Heading into the last hour of trading, let's check with Liz Claman to see what she has coming up -- Liz.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS: This is jam packed because as we go to the end element is the end of the month for the trading session. We are watching markets. And the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who's breaking news right and left on the grand jury that now has brand new evidence that does not look good for top executives of General Motors.

Putting down your phone can be hard to do, so much so that some are willing to pay to have it taken away. Camp Grounded is an adult summer camp where people completely unplug. Levi Felix joins me now. Why do I need a camp for this? Can't put my phone in a drawer for the weekend?</p><p>LEVI FELIX, CAMP GROUNDED FOUNDER: Of course, you can put your phone away in a drawer and go camping but most people find when they go on vacation they spent a fourth of their vacation on e-mail or on their phone checking it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Has anyone ever tried to cheat? What is the deal? You have the phones under your hat?</p><p>FELIX: No. Actually I got a nice haircut when I was at camp last week. They decided to give me a bulkhead. Campers show up and turn the devices into a safe. Anything of value, locked up for four days and we never had anyone try to sneak out.</p><p>FRANCIS: Why do I want to go to a camp and pay for this? I want to detox, I can put it to the side. People need to go somewhere and have it physically taken from them in order to do it?</p><p>FELIX: We are focused on the unplugging, it is what you are looking to reconnect with. There is yoga, meditation, hiking, different arts and crafts programs, our jury, full on summer camp for adults. We trade space where people can put away their phones so they are not going to get work e- mail's for calls anywhere from 385 to 574 four days, we do all organic sustainable food. Basically like a cruise ship but in the redwoods for four days and pretty amazing what happens when you have 300 adults altogether, everyone is hanging out and singing together.</p><p>FRANCIS: I am about to go on a cruise and trying to think of which two vacations I would rather do. Levi, thank you so much. No phones for this one. Instead of e-mailing his resume look at what this guy did. He printed his resume on a pack of beer.</p><p>Graphic designer, Brennan Gleeson started Resumemail at the University of Frazier Valley in addition to his crafty labeling, he broods the beer himself.

These ideas don't often work. People sending balloons and flowers and kind of tacky, but for a graphic designer he is showing talent. It is really creative.</p><p>FRANCIS: I heard someone wrapping up resume around a pineapple. Put on coffee because it perks everyone up. There you go. If there is one thing Americans are great at in a World Cup is the ability to lose a game and still get ahead.

What do you think, Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, soccer is still just an unknown entity for so many of us here in the states, Melissa, so I take the same approach that I do with stocks, you have to kind of go where the action is.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>HOENIG: Call me when we're in the finals.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN: Come on --</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead, Scott.</p><p>MARTIN: Jonathan, don't make my come over there again.

The sad thing about Dennys, Melissa, they didn't give out free food because the USA lost.</p><p>FRANCIS: I didn't really watch yesterday. I tried to, but apparently all of Wall Street did. Volume of shares traded during the game yesterday, 25 percent lower than the same time as last year. Scott, you were watching, yes? Were you trading or watching?</p><p>MARTIN: I was definitely watching. And the funny thing is, you know, if you're at a restaurant watch how many people pile in there, and the second the game is over, it's like a stampede out the door. But it's good business for these restaurants. If you open up your business for some of these fans, you get people spending money, and I think it's good.</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely, Jonathan, I guess I wasn't alone not watching because even astronauts in space tuned in, American and German astronauts at the International Space Station celebrated their teams advancing with a little victory dancing. Do we have that video? What do you think? Jonathan, did you see this?</p><p>HOENIG: I didn't see that, but I'm not surprised. I mean, sporting events like this, Melissa, give us the opportunity to come together for a shared experience and celebrate the good, the good for being the good, the heroic nature of these really incredible athletes who are able to run for I don't know how long, how hard, their endurance is remarkable. So the fact that we can all get together and cheer, a positive thing.</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely. Gentlemen, thanks to both of you. Happy Friday to everyone out there. I don't know about you, but these guys here in the studio are ready to get the weekend started, right, guys? Yes. All right, \"COUNTDOWN\" starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

For some big-time tech investors still aren't happy. Could this be a sign of the top? Buyer beware, the one word that sells $40 billion worth of food each year and means absolutely nothing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And paying up for some will power. We'll introduce you to the company that will help you unplug for a price. Because even when they say it's not it is always about money. Economic realities hitting home for more than 40 million American families. A new study out of Harvard University finding that 35 percent of U.S. households can't afford their current living situation. With me now, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Veronica Dagher, editor of \"Power Trend Profits, Chris Versace and Dominick Tavella of Diversified Financial. Thanks to all of you for joining us. So, what that means is that their rent or their mortgage consumes 30 percent of their monthly income. I mean this is huge. This is 40 million Americans. For a lot of them it consumes 50 percent! Veronica, this is a disaster.</p><p/><p>VERONICA DAGHER, Fox BUSINESS: It is a disaster especially because the more you spend on housing the less you have to spend on other things like consumer discretionary goods. And so that has larger effects to our economy. These people are spending so much on their rent they can't go be buying, you know, new cars or taking vacations. They just don't have the money.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: And a lot of the problems has to do with the fact that incomes aren't growing, right, Chris?</p><p/><p>CHRIS VERSACE, POWERTREND PROFIST: Absolutely. I mean you look at all the jobs that we've seen created, but we look at the mix of those jobs, lower income jobs. So, there's not a lot of wage growth. We are seeing inflation across food and energy, and to your point, Veronica, disposable income is going to be tapped, so where are these people going to live?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: No, I mean among the other problems that creates when you look at the GDP print that we saw this week and just the big pullback, a lot of it had to do with consumer spending. You're not spending on discretionary goods if you have this much of your money going to your rent and mortgage, right?</p><p/><p>DOMINICK TAVELLA, DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL: Not only that. But it's the tax consequence what is happened in the first quarter. So, people paying much higher taxes than they were before. They are paying much higher in cost of living issues, even though the government says there is no cost of living. Cost of housing has gone through the roof. It really as depressed the average consumer what they can actually do out there.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK, more fallout from Barclays, over alleged dark pool fraud. Charlie Gasparino first reported New York's lawsuit against Barclay's right here on \"MONEY.\" Now, they're getting the cold shoulder from several big name brokerage firms, including Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada. Chris, this is an interesting one. Because it seems like dark pools, if you look at this, we may die their own death. If now people are afraid when they stay away from them. What do you think?</p><p/><p>VERSACE: I think you're absolutely right on that. We are ultimately designed for, which was to allow large pools to be traded, you know, it's very anonymously, so people can move in and out. But where there is lot of smoke there is fire. The SEC is investigating. And all of a sudden what may have been once so safe may not be.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Veronica.</p><p/><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think investors are going to be demanding more transparency in this case.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: They want to see what's going on. They're called dark pools for a reason.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: For a reason, right.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Yes.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It is the opposite of transparency. That is the whole point.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: That's right, yeah. And I think a lot of these firms that are stepping away from their connections to Barclays right now. You know, there is a PR component to this, too.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Nobody wants to be associated with a firm that could be saying false things to investors.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What is so appalling about this, if it is true, Dominick, you know, the charges that on one hand they were saying that they weren't allowing traders to have preference a step ahead of others at the very same time that they were doing exactly that within their dark pools. And really, I mean, once again, it's just like such a big knock on Wall Street.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: Yeah, two things - first this is not a small investor problem. This is really institutional. Traders were looking to do big block trades and not let the whole world know what they're doing. Having said that they need to have a credibility, a trust with the institution that they're doing it. That they're getting fair pricing. That trades are being done orderly and efficiently. And when that doesn't happen the trust gets cut.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: But it does have to do with the small investor because it's this idea that Wall Street is rigged. And there's more and more of these stories come out. It makes a little guy feel like why in the world should I even get involved and why should I invest? Meanwhile, I mean the stock market has this thing that has really gone up in this recovery. So, if you're on the sidelines because you're paranoid you really lost out</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: If the small investor out there trading 100 shares of Facebook, this is not their world, OK? And whether they should or shouldn't be trading on .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Nobody keeps them away from investing at all, Veronica.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: It's the express issue, yeah. They're even more skeptical. And they don't even understand what a dark pool is. A lot of professionals don't understand what that is. So, it's just - it's more confusion and more skepticism.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. All right, the federal government is set to auction off $17 million worth of bitcoin today. This is all courtesy of the shuttered online market silk road. The online sell is shrouded in secrecy, speaking of secrecy, and is attracting some financial power players. Veronica, I mean, this is an interesting one. If they just went ahead and put all this out on the open market, bitcoin, it would totally depress the price.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Yeah, it would sink the price. It's going to be interesting to see how the government handles this. You know, it's not like selling confiscated Chevys that they have got from drug bust.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>DAGHER: So, how this plays out and how the investors, you know, I think there were investor lists, potential bidder lists released already. How that affects the bidding will be interesting to watch.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, Chris, are you watching this one?</p><p/><p>VERSACE: I'm watching it a little bit. I'm wondering why the government doesn't pull in like a currency trader or somebody in the know for dealing with this .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I thought they were? They're not doing that?</p><p/><p>VERSACE: You know, it sounds like they're doing it in-house. We know that they are not going to do it well. So, you know, how well can they leak this out? That's the big question.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: What is interesting that they confiscated these bitcoins from a criminal entity, right? The criminals are figuring out, bitcoin is the perfect tool to buy and sell assets without having trunk loads of 100- dollar bills. So, I think that's what's probably more interesting about this, is the government has figured it out, criminals figured it out, this is a perfect vehicle to trade value back and forth.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Absolutely. All right, iPhones hitting the bargain bin at Walmart. The retailer pricing Apple's smartphone for the - is rolling back prices to $29. I mean I can't believe this, the iPhone 5-c, $29. You have to buy a two year contract, but come on. Amazing.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Yeah, it's really cheap. But I think this is interesting because Walmart is only applying this deal for people who come into their stores. And I think this speaks to Walmart really needing to drive traffic. They're losing out on foot traffic. They're doing pretty good online, but they're trying to find a way to how to get people in these huge stores and that is a real issue. This might be a strategy to .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, pretty smart thing for us.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: Well, you know, two things. One I think it is smart for Walmart to bring people in to get them to shop and buy all these things. But also, I think it's smart for Apple. Remember the 5C was not a big volume device.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: It's a nice way for them to kind of flush out all the inventory in the channel potentially ahead of the iPhone 6.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I think it's also interesting to me it means that, Apple has power to sell all across the price spectrum. Because it used to be the really high cost phone and you saw everybody, you know, couldn't afford it.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: We don't know, necessarily know that it is Apple who is selling it for $29 through Walmart. Walmart could actually be buying the phone and subsidizing it to bring people in, kind of a loss leader.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: You know, Melissa, I will take the opposite of this one. Steve Jobs is going to be turning in his grave.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: But it's only with Apple cutting-edge technology, but this posh, this mystique, it was a Gucci bag, it was the Armani. Now, they are selling it on the discount bin in Walmart. I think it takes some of the luster away from Apple. I don't know. I think it takes the shine off.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I think - interesting. All right. Life on Wall Street proving no piece of cake for Crumbs Bakery. The one time king of cupcakes will be dropped by the NASDAQ after falling by more than 80 percent in the past year. I mean I don't know if you guys notice this, they're on every corner right now. They have 70 stores. 22 of which were open in the last year. There is one on my block. There is another cupcake store within the next block. How many cupcake stores do we need, Chris?</p><p/><p>VERSACE: Not that many apparently.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Apparently, not that many.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: And the thing is, you know, you can go almost anywhere now and get cupcakes. You can go to Starbucks and get cupcakes. You can go to .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Big cupcakes.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: Panera Bread and all this ...</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: You can actually buy their cupcakes at BJ's. So, again, this idea, this mystique, this great store, you walk into, now they have kind of tarnished their brand. Competitors are coming.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Isn't that a warning, so we have this huge IPO rush going on right now. I mean, you know, that it is - it's going to be the biggest week since 2006. I remember when Crumbs went public and I thought it was the most ridiculous thing. So, I'm like how can you be a public company when all you do is sell cupcakes? Is this the warning to Yo or all these other things? What do you think of it?</p><p/><p>DAGHER: That is the point. Maybe not everyone should go public.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Maybe it's not a good idea.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: So, let's look at Starbucks, right? Same theme. It's just coffee instead of a cupcake. They reinvented themselves, reinvented themselves, reinvented themselves and expanded intelligently. This company didn't single product. Lots of competition.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I guess, although you - almost everybody needs a cup of coffee to get through the day. I don't need a cupcake.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: I probably need it, but .</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: All right, I'm going to lose my job.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Riding shotgun wedding. Uber expanding its reach into marital bliss, bringing free full service weddings to some lucky couples tomorrow. So I thought, you know, Uber is the king of this, we'll do something, you know, within an hour, bring it to you. They always have a gimmick on in order to promote themselves. But this one is really special. Because they say you just need to bring enough legal documents to get a marriage license with you, but they will provide the notary and a qualified officiate to handle the paperwork - ceremony, not to mention all the other accoutrements that go with it. Veronica.</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Oh, man, I just got married.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>DAGHER: And I wish that .</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Actually, no.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Will they do on demand divorce next?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: That might drive volume. FRANCIS: I don't know. I mean in Vegas it's easy to get married proving that you really shouldn't most of the time. Like they make it too easy. So, maybe these guys are doing the same thing.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: You know, Melissa, I'm going to turn it back to you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p/><p>VERSACE: Would you say that nothing says romance like Uber?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. Quickie wedding, it is very romantic.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: But Uber has done a lot of these kinds of gimmicks, right?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It's funny.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: It's a hell of a lot cheaper than hiring a Park Avenue advertising firm.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>TAVELLA: Lots of PR. Get the name out there. It's fabulous. We laugh about it. It's good stuff.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You guys were fantastic. Thank you so much.</p><p/><p>Coming up the great band of China. Why Hillary Clinton's new book won't be hitting the bestseller's list in Shanghai anytime soon.</p><p/><p>Plus, consumer sentiment is on the rise, but will feelings be enough to beat what lies beneath? \"THE MONEY\" hard truth coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Walking on sunshine. Consumer sentiment on the rise of beating street expectations today. Is this a ray of hope? Here now, Fox Business's Charlie Gasparino along with Veronica Dagher and former CBO director Doug Holtz-Eakin. Thanks so much for joining us. Doug, I'm going to let you go first.</p><p/><p>DOUGH HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CBO DIRECTOR: Thank you.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Because you're on the road there. Consumer sentiment rising higher today. The consumer is what was missing from the GDP report. Consumer spending was very weak. That was one of the big reasons we saw the big contraction. Does this mean things are about to get better?</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I don't think so. If you look inside the numbers, they're happier about what is going on right now, but they are not more confident about the future. And if you look at the monthly data, we've seen in the past two months, the first two months of the second quarter, real declines in personal consumption expenditures. So, there is not a lot out there to suggest the households are going to pick up this economy and carry it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: You know, Charlie, I always laugh when I see the consumer sentiment numbers. Because it's like asking people what they will do. It's not what they're actually doing.</p><p/><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, Fox BUSINESS: Right.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I mean it's like how you are feeling.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: What they might do .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: In the future maybe, possibly. I would just say this about - I think that negative GDP print was probably somewhat of an aberration. I don't think we're in a recession right now.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It certainly make the recipe - you look like .</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: It's not - it's not - I'm not going to say that's good. But you know, one thing about the Obama economy. We've seen this one before, where you have a blip up in GDP you have a blip up in consumer confidence. And then you get a blip down and then you really have very, very little economic growth.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: And it all nets out to just standing still. That's right.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Charlie, may I point something out?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I mean here is the thing, Charlie. With the first quarter that we got, we'd have to go to 3.7 percent every quarter for the rest of the year, just to hit two percent for the year.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: OK.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Never seen that in this presidency.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: And Veronica, I would say on the horizon, I mean, we have the specter of potential inflation. Have you heard James Bullard here on Fox Business earlier this week, he's already saying it's going to be hotter than we thought. Consumers as they go to the store every day, they certainly feel it being hotter every day. I mean is that a real threat, inflation?</p><p/><p>DAGHER: Yeah, I think it is. Yes, you go to the grocery store now, things cost more than they did a couple of months ago. So, I think that is a real issue. And also, if you look at the personal spending numbers we got for May. If you adjust for inflation, those numbers actually went down. So, I think between that and people's fears about the economy, they are still seeing people - their neighbors without a job for a long time, people are underemployed. They're afraid to spend. So, we're going to see the savings rates continue to go up until we feel more secure. I don't know what that's going to take, though, to make them feel more secure.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I mean Doug you are saying, you know, we would have to be above three percent for the rest of year in order to even out to something. What do you think is going to happen for the rest of the year?</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: What this economy has done for years - is it's along the two percent. That's been the average consumption for growth, household spending growth, there's no evidence that they are going to change their behavior. They don't have the income or the sentiment to do it. Businesses are the wildcard.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: And if they somehow get some animal spirits and go with the big cap-ex expansion then we can get a good year, but I don't see that, Charlie.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: I agree with you. If you're talking about two percent growth and you have .</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I am.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: And you're talking about inflation in certain sectors where the Fed has to raise rates, we're heading for a recession. I mean Hillary Clinton runs for office. If she runs in 2015, 2016, she is very possible, that she runs in the middle of an economic downturn.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Interesting. Meanwhile, you always make the point, Charlie, and you are right, the only one who's getting rich in this economy right now are people who are in the market. Because that is what all this Fed work has done, it's just stimulated the stock market. It's ironic that these policies out of Washington, all they've helped the one percent, who they say they hate. So, very interesting. Guys, thanks to all of you for joining us. From the U.S. to every corner of globe money is flying around the world today starting in Germany which has canceled the contract with Verizon over fears that the U.S. is spying on them. It all goes back to documents leaked by Edward Snowden, which revealed we had kind of an eavesdropping on calls made by Chancellor Angela Merkel. You remember that, right? Germans, they were not so amused by that, especially as the U.S. still refuses to agree with a no spy deal with the country. Verizon now bearing the brunt of that. It has been providing a communications network to the German government since 2010.</p><p/><p>Over to Japan, which is now exporting square watermelons to grow throughout the globe. They curious, look at that are grown in boxes from a very young age. It sounds cruel. Which forces them into a cube-like shape. They weigh 13-pounds a apiece. Look at them.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Well, I think about it, no, no, no. Now they are making way to fruit stand in Canada. They don't come cheap. One sold in Moscow last year, went for more than 800 bucks. Juicy profits indeed. Landing in China where Hillary Clinton is getting the cold shoulder by officials. Publishers there say they will not be purchasing the translation rights to her new book. Local agencies have banned the English language version from being imported. There are a few parts of book where she is somewhat critical of the Chinese government. You know, we kind of saw that one coming, right?</p><p/><p>Crying wolves of Wall Street. The hottest week for IPOs in years and still not enough for some of the tech heavyweights. That picture is going to come back to haunt that guy. Plus, if you can't win them, beer them. One job hunter's clever case to seal the deal. We're raking in the money coming up next. See this of this guy.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Hold on tight. Shares of the venture camera maker GoPro powering higher in the second day of trading. Let's go to Ashley Webster on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. For more on this, when even higher today, Ashley.</p><p/><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, Fox BUSINESS: You know what they should do, Melissa. Scrap one of those GoPro cameras on the stock, of what you go up and down. Mostly up. But as we know, when - yesterday, the price was set at $24. It shot up yesterday and today. Look at this, it actually went above the $40 mark briefly before coming back down, still up 17percent. What else would you expect from this Adrenalin play on GoPro?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely, still, Michael's not looking like a masterpiece, though, on its return to the market?</p><p/><p>WEBSTER: No, a tale of two IPOs. Really, although that said, Michael's pricing it $17, debuting on the NASDAQ today, came out very slowly. Actually, went down below the IPO price. But it since inched its way up, and at least showing some positive signs, up 17, 1363 on the day. Up about three quarters of a percent. The arts and crafts. You know, by the way, I didn't realize, they also own the Aaron Brothers chain as well. So they go public finally. And up about 17, as I say, 14 cents above the share price that was listed. So, a slow but steady start I guess we'll call it. No GoPro.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK. All right, Ashley, thanks so much. So, the market wrapping up its biggest week for IPOs in eight years. Some big tech investors are not breaking out the champagne. Rather, they're crying about how hard it is to go public. Somewhere alone violin plays for them. Is this a sign of the top? Charlie is back with us, along with Scott Martin from United Advisors and Jonathan Hoenig from CapitalistPig Hedge Fund. They're both Fox News contributors. So, I mean it has been the week of endless IPOs. Still, you have Marc Andreessen up there saying, it comes across like I'm complaining about how hard it is to be public. Of course, the answer is, you just need to suck it up. I mean poor IPO guys getting out there and making a fortune. Jonathan, ridiculous?</p><p/><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG HEDGE FUND: No, but we should be happy they're getting out there making a fortune, Melissa. We should be happy that deals are getting done and still being priced. I don't think this is the death of the IPO market at all, as you pointed out. It was an extremely busy week for IPOs. And you know, you'll the death comes when you see the IPOs starts coming public and just falling flat. It happened in 1999 .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: No, I know, but Scott . --</p><p/><p>HOENIG: In 2000.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I don't think it's so much the death of the IPO. I think it is more of a sign of the top. That you have a zillion coming out. It's the most in whatever we - you know, eight years. And then you have people complaining about how hard it is when here, everyone is doing it. How hard could it be? What do you think?</p><p/><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS: Well ..</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Everybody's got.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: You're right, everybody is doing it. But here's the thing, Melissa. I mean Andreessen is complaining about the pricing I think more than anything. And he's talking about back in the '90s with Netscape and some of these other companies coming out at 2 billion valuation was kind of the status quo. Now you have got companies like Uber that are in - you know, $17 billion-dollar range. Even interest is somewhere between five and six billion. Here is the funny thing, right? GoPro is somewhere around 3 billion, but the stock is up gigantically, since it's IPO, because probably too cheap. So, it's more about pricing issue, but like Jonathan said I will never disagree with somebody in a seersucker suit, by the way.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>MARTIN: That's the - stock, and that is why the prices are going up.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Charlie.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: I'm not quite sure what Andreessen is complaining about. I mean is he complaining about the regulations?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: He's talking about for the young companies, you know, there is such a microscope on you. Every part of your business ends up being connected and end up being tied back to your self-pricing and morale.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: Well, too bad, pal.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: I mean, you know, that's what - you want to be a public company, you are going to have some regulations you have to follow. I will say this, though. Listen, it is great that they're coming public. We should point out that the NASDAQ has been overshadowed. This has been overshadowed. NASDAQ has done 100 tech IPOs in the past year. That's what I'm .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: It's amazing.</p><p/><p>HOENIG: Can I just comment quickly?</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: And, you know, they didn't win the Alibaba one, but they won some other ones. We had Ashley on the floor of the stock exchange.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: NASDAQ won, I think, GoPro, right?</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: To make this point. You guys can jump in. Let me make this point, Jonathan. When you are getting numbers like this you're getting close to a top.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: It is not general .</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Jonathan, real quick, last comment, go ahead.</p><p/><p>HOENIG: What's - I don't know, Charlie has been - I know calling for a tough for at least a couple of weeks or months now. And you say boo-hoo hoo for companies that are trying to become public.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: Months.</p><p/><p>HOENIG: Think back to before Sarbanes-Oxley. It has been harder and harder for small companies to raise money. That's why now some of them are trying to use the Jobs Act to raise money.</p><p/><p>GASPARINO: Why are we seeing .?</p><p/><p>HOENIG: Because those regulations are so extensive.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: We have got to go. You guys can keep fighting in the break. That's fine. Thanks, guys. All right, there is no margin of error for this comeback. American demand for natural ingredients just keeps on growing, and the likes of butter are on a roll, get it? Get it? I know, one too many jokes in there for me. Plus, as good as Goldberg. Whoopee is the last one standing after complete overhaul on \"The View.\" Find out how she ended up the lone survivor. \"Piles of Money\" coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS HOST: As the situation in Iraq escalates, other countries in the region are getting sucked in. Surveillance drones from Iran are flying over the country. The White House is looking to Syrian rebels to potentially play a role.</p><p/><p>Joining me now, Chris Harmer, from the Institute for the Study of War and Fox News Middle East expert, Walid Phares. Chris, let me start with you. I mean, this situation is intensifying.</p><p/><p>CHRIS HARMER, INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR: Melissa, it's a pleasure to be here, thanks for having me. Yes, the situation is intensifying. If you look at is the snapshot, it looks like ISIS is culminating with this massive offensive. In fact, if you look closer at what they have been doing the past two years they have been building towards this.</p><p/><p>They have done all the small building blocks they need to organize their terrorist state and using that to attack the government in Mosul, which they've already won and they are now taking over the western desert areas of Iraq that used to be dominated by the Sunni tribes.</p><p/><p>The real question here is, is the Iraqi security force going to be able to respond to this? So far the answer is no.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Walid, I mean, it's not about just about Iraq. It's about the entire region being sucked into this conflict as we said. Look at the White House proposing to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels, how do you identify a moderate Syrian rebels are?</p><p/><p>DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS MIDDLE EAST EXPERT: Speaking of how many countries, let's do the count, Syria was involved, and they are considering those. Lebanon may go in because Lebanon also has pro and against ISIS. Iran by sending the drones into Iraq will shoot against them. How will we identify the market?</p><p/><p>We're five years late. We have been urging the administration since the Arabs spring to do so in civil society. Now it will be time to find a less Islamist and jihadists on the ground, this is not something that will have a bright future.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So if everyone in the region is getting involved, is that an argument for us to get involved or to stand back? Chris, what do you think?</p><p/><p>HARMER: It's wrong for the U.S. to get involve. Look, we have strategic interests in Syria whether we want to acknowledge it or not. We have strategic interests in Iraq whether we want to acknowledge it or not. It is easy to embrace the isolationist argument, but in today's interconnected world it's not possible.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: What are the interests?</p><p/><p>HARMER: We do not want to see a caliphate organized in Eastern Syria and Western Iraq where ISIS has the complete safe haven. If you look at what al Qaeda had in Afghanistan, they had a safe haven as guests of the Taliban. What they are organizing is a nation state where they are guests of nobody and beholden to no one. They can do whatever they want.</p><p/><p>In fact, one of the arguments between ISIS and al Qaeda, al Qaeda saw how many fighters that ISIS was attracting, Europe, North America. They said you should use those guys right now to export terror back. ISIS said no. We will win the war here first and then have this cadres of several thousand battle hardened formerly trained terrorists going back to Europe and North America with passports and terrorist attacks here.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: So Walid, is it realistic to think that we can do something to break up that safe phase?</p><p/><p>PHARES: We could have, should have and continue to consider those situations. Let me say this. If ISIS or (inaudible) organization is not going to be stop, they will carve up this piece of Iraq and the other side of Syria. A large section of Syria not in Lebanon and put pressure on Jordan across the border with Saudi Arabia, it's not going to stop there.</p><p/><p>And of course, as the gentleman has said, they are going to have launching pad much stronger that the United States and the west. We need to begin acting with our allies. For example, I would recommend to support the Kurds in the north and mildly support the south in the situation.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Gentlemen, thanks for your expertise. We really appreciate it. It seems to be easing somewhat, crude-oil prices are lower after two consecutive weeks of gains. Let's go to trader, Andrew Keene at the CME. This is the dichotomy. You heard from the guests before you that this situation is getting much bigger, the whole region is being pulled into it. At the same time, if traders get used to it as background noise, what is going on?</p><p/><p>ANDREW KEENE, KEENEONTHEMARKET.COM: We talk about it a couple times. A lot of the oil price factor in this the fact we haven't had a resolution, effective in the oil price over the last 12 trading days we have been stuck in a tight race between 105 and 108. I will look at the break out, which is to the downside. If there is resolution overseas over the weekend, out we will see oil embracing 105, 101 in a heartbeat or go to 120. The fact there isn't a resolution and they after day the price of oil goes cotter is not factoring that in. That is a fear to the downside.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Andrew Keene, thank you so much. It's a natural state of mind how food label using every antioxidants in the book to make your spending anything but organic. At the end of the day it is all about money.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I am Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief. Nike reaping ahead today after earnings surpassed expectations with 18 percent sales growth in Europe. World Cup giving the company boost with some better numbers out of the soccer division. Banks importing risky borrowers with $4 million in credit cards issued to, 4 million credit cards issued for sub-prime borrowers in the first quarter.

Many of them have urged the industry to start banning the wells they use to dispose of waste water with some suspect, seismic activity. That is the latest from the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Profits come naturally to brands catching in on the nutrition crazed, but consumers getting wary of the labels on their groceries. It turns out some of these healthy buzzwords sound great, but they mean absolutely nothing.</p><p/><p>Here now supermarket guru, Phil Lampert, natural labels when you see something labels natural, bring in $40 billion a year. The FDA says there is no definition of natural. Actually doesn't mean anything. I am outraged. Are you outrage?</p><p/><p>PHIL LAMPERT, SUPERMARKET EXPERT: No. Because this is a 15-year-old scam that we have been living with. This is nearly 70s. This is not something new. All those companies started using the word natural and it can't have artificial flavors. And when we see one of these products, we think it came out of the ground that way.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Really means those things because the FDA says it doesn't mean anything and consumer reports is petitioning the FDA to ban the word natural from labels because they are saying it doesn't guarantee anything.</p><p/><p>LAMPERT: And it should be banned and there's no FDA regulation that specifies that, but FDA from the web site and the regulations do specified that they will allow the word natural to be used under those three conditions if they are met some there isn't a rule, but there have been complaints where people have used those having added color for example and FDA --</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: At the checkout counter there were fried potato chips that were there and a set of natural and for a moment on is like maybe these aren't so bad for you. But the reality comes flooding back in and you know is a lot. University of Houston found people are more likely to think that foods with labels like organic and natural are healthy even when the food was candy or soda. Is organic another one that is a fraud?</p><p/><p>LAMPERT: There are certified organic regulations, number one, but when it comes to nutrition, there is no difference between something that is organic and conventionally grown nutritionally. You can use pesticides with organics, that is something people don't realize, but there are regulations in place so at least that is better than we think. We pay more for organic or natural.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: We do and at the same time people I shunning things that are frozen or in cans, just across the board even things like healthy choice, lean cuisine, struggling. Now that people have this perception that natural and organic is better so they see something in the aisle. Are we going to see these brands go away?</p><p/><p>LAMPERT: Absolutely not. In the case of Conagra Foods, for example, you look at Healthy Choice, what they have done over the past few years has been dramatic to your point, people don't understand fresh and frozen what that really means. USDA came out a couple years ago talking about their studies, lot of frozen products have more nutrients. But Conagra has educed sodium. It limited ingredients, taking out ingredients, using apples instead.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: I don't want to run out of time because I have one more for you. I can't believe it is butter. The kitchen favorite melting its way into hearts and arteries across the country, the \"Wall Street Journal\" even calling butter one of the great comeback stories in U.S. food history.</p><p/><p>Check out this chart showing the recent consumption decline of greasy margarine and the rise of delicious fluffy golden butter. Look at that spread. Get it? Look at that spread. What do you think?</p><p/><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"THE WALL STREE JOURNAL\": I love butter. I think is delicious, one of those simple luxuries.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Why is it making a comeback in your opinion?</p><p/><p>LAMPERT: A couple things. One is taste certainly, but also let's not forget everything Julia Child told us was true. Use a little bit of butter, you will have flavor and it will cook better and that a lot of other artificial product.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Heading into the last hour of trading, let's check with Liz Claman to see what she has coming up -- Liz.</p><p/><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS: This is jam packed because as we go to the end element is the end of the month for the trading session.

Levi Felix joins me now. Why do I need a camp for this? Can't put my phone in a drawer for the weekend?</p><p/><p>LEVI FELIX, CAMP GROUNDED FOUNDER: Of course, you can put your phone away in a drawer and go camping but most people find when they go on vacation they spent a fourth of their vacation on e-mail or on their phone checking it.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Has anyone ever tried to cheat? What is the deal? You have the phones under your hat?</p><p/><p>FELIX: No. Actually I got a nice haircut when I was at camp last week. They decided to give me a bulkhead. Campers show up and turn the devices into a safe. Anything of value, locked up for four days and we never had anyone try to sneak out.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Why do I want to go to a camp and pay for this? I want to detox, I can put it to the side. People need to go somewhere and have it physically taken from them in order to do it?</p><p/><p>FELIX: We are focused on the unplugging, it is what you are looking to reconnect with. There is yoga, meditation, hiking, different arts and crafts programs, our jury, full on summer camp for adults. We trade space where people can put away their phones so they are not going to get work e- mail's for calls anywhere from 385 to 574 four days, we do all organic sustainable food.

Volume of shares traded during the game yesterday, 25 percent lower than the same time as last year. Scott, you were watching, yes? Were you trading or watching?</p><p/><p>MARTIN: I was definitely watching. And the funny thing is, you know, if you're at a restaurant watch how many people pile in there, and the second the game is over, it's like a stampede out the door. But it's good business for these restaurants. If you open up your business for some of these fans, you get people spending money, and I think it's good.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely, Jonathan, I guess I wasn't alone not watching because even astronauts in space tuned in, American and German astronauts at the International Space Station celebrated their teams advancing with a little victory dancing. Do we have that video? What do you think? Jonathan, did you see this?</p><p/><p>HOENIG: I didn't see that, but I'm not surprised. I mean, sporting events like this, Melissa, give us the opportunity to come together for a shared experience and celebrate the good, the good for being the good, the heroic nature of these really incredible athletes who are able to run for I don't know how long, how hard, their endurance is remarkable. So the fact that we can all get together and cheer, a positive thing.</p><p/><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely. Gentlemen, thanks to both of you. Happy Friday to everyone out there. I don't know about you, but these guys here in the studio are ready to get the weekend started, right, guys? Yes. All right, \"COUNTDOWN\" starts right now.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

For some big-time tech investors still aren't happy. Could this be a sign of the top? Buyer beware, the one word that sells $40 billion worth of food each year and means absolutely nothing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And paying up for some will power. We'll introduce you to the company that will help you unplug for a price. Because even when they say it's not it is always about money. Economic realities hitting home for more than 40 million American families. A new study out of Harvard University finding that 35 percent of U.S. households can't afford their current living situation. With me now, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Veronica Dagher, editor of \"Power Trend Profits, Chris Versace and Dominick Tavella of Diversified Financial. Thanks to all of you for joining us. So, what that means is that their rent or their mortgage consumes 30 percent of their monthly income. I mean this is huge. This is 40 million Americans. For a lot of them it consumes 50 percent! Veronica, this is a disaster.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, Fox BUSINESS: It is a disaster especially because the more you spend on housing the less you have to spend on other things like consumer discretionary goods. And so that has larger effects to our economy. These people are spending so much on their rent they can't go be buying, you know, new cars or taking vacations. They just don't have the money.</p><p>FRANCIS: And a lot of the problems has to do with the fact that incomes aren't growing, right, Chris?</p><p>CHRIS VERSACE, POWERTREND PROFIST: Absolutely. I mean you look at all the jobs that we've seen created, but we look at the mix of those jobs, lower income jobs. So, there's not a lot of wage growth. We are seeing inflation across food and energy, and to your point, Veronica, disposable income is going to be tapped, so where are these people going to live?</p><p>FRANCIS: No, I mean among the other problems that creates when you look at the GDP print that we saw this week and just the big pullback, a lot of it had to do with consumer spending. You're not spending on discretionary goods if you have this much of your money going to your rent and mortgage, right?</p><p>DOMINICK TAVELLA, DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL: Not only that. But it's the tax consequence what is happened in the first quarter. So, people paying much higher taxes than they were before. They are paying much higher in cost of living issues, even though the government says there is no cost of living. Cost of housing has gone through the roof. It really as depressed the average consumer what they can actually do out there.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, more fallout from Barclays, over alleged dark pool fraud. Charlie Gasparino first reported New York's lawsuit against Barclay's right here on \"MONEY.\" Now, they're getting the cold shoulder from several big name brokerage firms, including Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada. Chris, this is an interesting one. Because it seems like dark pools, if you look at this, we may die their own death. If now people are afraid when they stay away from them. What do you think?</p><p>VERSACE: I think you're absolutely right on that. We are ultimately designed for, which was to allow large pools to be traded, you know, it's very anonymously, so people can move in and out. But where there is lot of smoke there is fire. The SEC is investigating. And all of a sudden what may have been once so safe may not be.</p><p>FRANCIS: Veronica.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think investors are going to be demanding more transparency in this case.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER: They want to see what's going on. They're called dark pools for a reason.</p><p>FRANCIS: For a reason, right.</p><p>DAGHER: Yes.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is the opposite of transparency. That is the whole point.</p><p>DAGHER: That's right, yeah. And I think a lot of these firms that are stepping away from their connections to Barclays right now. You know, there is a PR component to this, too.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER: Nobody wants to be associated with a firm that could be saying false things to investors.</p><p>FRANCIS: What is so appalling about this, if it is true, Dominick, you know, the charges that on one hand they were saying that they weren't allowing traders to have preference a step ahead of others at the very same time that they were doing exactly that within their dark pools. And really, I mean, once again, it's just like such a big knock on Wall Street.</p><p>TAVELLA: Yeah, two things - first this is not a small investor problem. This is really institutional. Traders were looking to do big block trades and not let the whole world know what they're doing. Having said that they need to have a credibility, a trust with the institution that they're doing it. That they're getting fair pricing. That trades are being done orderly and efficiently. And when that doesn't happen the trust gets cut.</p><p>FRANCIS: But it does have to do with the small investor because it's this idea that Wall Street is rigged. And there's more and more of these stories come out. It makes a little guy feel like why in the world should I even get involved and why should I invest? Meanwhile, I mean the stock market has this thing that has really gone up in this recovery. So, if you're on the sidelines because you're paranoid you really lost out</p><p>TAVELLA: If the small investor out there trading 100 shares of Facebook, this is not their world, OK? And whether they should or shouldn't be trading on .</p><p>FRANCIS: Nobody keeps them away from investing at all, Veronica.</p><p>DAGHER: It's the express issue, yeah. They're even more skeptical. And they don't even understand what a dark pool is. A lot of professionals don't understand what that is. So, it's just - it's more confusion and more skepticism.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. All right, the federal government is set to auction off $17 million worth of bitcoin today. This is all courtesy of the shuttered online market silk road. The online sell is shrouded in secrecy, speaking of secrecy, and is attracting some financial power players. Veronica, I mean, this is an interesting one. If they just went ahead and put all this out on the open market, bitcoin, it would totally depress the price.</p><p>DAGHER: Yeah, it would sink the price. It's going to be interesting to see how the government handles this. You know, it's not like selling confiscated Chevys that they have got from drug bust.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAGHER: So, how this plays out and how the investors, you know, I think there were investor lists, potential bidder lists released already. How that affects the bidding will be interesting to watch.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, Chris, are you watching this one?</p><p>VERSACE: I'm watching it a little bit. I'm wondering why the government doesn't pull in like a currency trader or somebody in the know for dealing with this .</p><p>FRANCIS: I thought they were? They're not doing that?</p><p>VERSACE: You know, it sounds like they're doing it in-house. We know that they are not going to do it well. So, you know, how well can they leak this out? That's the big question.</p><p>TAVELLA: What is interesting that they confiscated these bitcoins from a criminal entity, right? The criminals are figuring out, bitcoin is the perfect tool to buy and sell assets without having trunk loads of 100- dollar bills. So, I think that's what's probably more interesting about this, is the government has figured it out, criminals figured it out, this is a perfect vehicle to trade value back and forth.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Absolutely. All right, iPhones hitting the bargain bin at Walmart. The retailer pricing Apple's smartphone for the - is rolling back prices to $29. I mean I can't believe this, the iPhone 5-c, $29. You have to buy a two year contract, but come on. Amazing.</p><p>DAGHER: Yeah, it's really cheap. But I think this is interesting because Walmart is only applying this deal for people who come into their stores. And I think this speaks to Walmart really needing to drive traffic. They're losing out on foot traffic. They're doing pretty good online, but they're trying to find a way to how to get people in these huge stores and that is a real issue. This might be a strategy to .</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, pretty smart thing for us.</p><p>VERSACE: Well, you know, two things. One I think it is smart for Walmart to bring people in to get them to shop and buy all these things. But also, I think it's smart for Apple. Remember the 5C was not a big volume device.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>VERSACE: It's a nice way for them to kind of flush out all the inventory in the channel potentially ahead of the iPhone 6.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think it's also interesting to me it means that, Apple has power to sell all across the price spectrum. Because it used to be the really high cost phone and you saw everybody, you know, couldn't afford it.</p><p>VERSACE: We don't know, necessarily know that it is Apple who is selling it for $29 through Walmart. Walmart could actually be buying the phone and subsidizing it to bring people in, kind of a loss leader.</p><p>TAVELLA: You know, Melissa, I will take the opposite of this one. Steve Jobs is going to be turning in his grave.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA: But it's only with Apple cutting-edge technology, but this posh, this mystique, it was a Gucci bag, it was the Armani. Now, they are selling it on the discount bin in Walmart. I think it takes some of the luster away from Apple. I don't know. I think it takes the shine off.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think - interesting. All right. Life on Wall Street proving no piece of cake for Crumbs Bakery. The one time king of cupcakes will be dropped by the NASDAQ after falling by more than 80 percent in the past year. I mean I don't know if you guys notice this, they're on every corner right now. They have 70 stores. 22 of which were open in the last year. There is one on my block. There is another cupcake store within the next block. How many cupcake stores do we need, Chris?</p><p>VERSACE: Not that many apparently.</p><p>FRANCIS: Apparently, not that many.</p><p>VERSACE: And the thing is, you know, you can go almost anywhere now and get cupcakes. You can go to Starbucks and get cupcakes. You can go to .</p><p>FRANCIS: Big cupcakes.</p><p>VERSACE: Panera Bread and all this ...</p><p>TAVELLA: You can actually buy their cupcakes at BJ's. So, again, this idea, this mystique, this great store, you walk into, now they have kind of tarnished their brand. Competitors are coming.</p><p>FRANCIS: Isn't that a warning, so we have this huge IPO rush going on right now. I mean, you know, that it is - it's going to be the biggest week since 2006. I remember when Crumbs went public and I thought it was the most ridiculous thing. So, I'm like how can you be a public company when all you do is sell cupcakes? Is this the warning to Yo or all these other things? What do you think of it?</p><p>DAGHER: That is the point. Maybe not everyone should go public.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>DAGHER: Maybe it's not a good idea.</p><p>TAVELLA: So, let's look at Starbucks, right? Same theme. It's just coffee instead of a cupcake. They reinvented themselves, reinvented themselves, reinvented themselves and expanded intelligently. This company didn't single product. Lots of competition.</p><p>FRANCIS: I guess, although you - almost everybody needs a cup of coffee to get through the day. I don't need a cupcake.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA: I probably need it, but .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, I'm going to lose my job.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Riding shotgun wedding. Uber expanding its reach into marital bliss, bringing free full service weddings to some lucky couples tomorrow. So I thought, you know, Uber is the king of this, we'll do something, you know, within an hour, bring it to you. They always have a gimmick on in order to promote themselves. But this one is really special. Because they say you just need to bring enough legal documents to get a marriage license with you, but they will provide the notary and a qualified officiate to handle the paperwork - ceremony, not to mention all the other accoutrements that go with it. Veronica.</p><p>DAGHER: Oh, man, I just got married.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DAGHER: And I wish that .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAGHER: Actually, no.</p><p>FRANCIS: Will they do on demand divorce next?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TAVELLA: That might drive volume. FRANCIS: I don't know. I mean in Vegas it's easy to get married proving that you really shouldn't most of the time. Like they make it too easy. So, maybe these guys are doing the same thing.</p><p>VERSACE: You know, Melissa, I'm going to turn it back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>VERSACE: Would you say that nothing says romance like Uber?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. Quickie wedding, it is very romantic.</p><p>TAVELLA: But Uber has done a lot of these kinds of gimmicks, right?</p><p>FRANCIS: It's funny.</p><p>TAVELLA: It's a hell of a lot cheaper than hiring a Park Avenue advertising firm.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>TAVELLA: Lots of PR. Get the name out there. It's fabulous. We laugh about it. It's good stuff.</p><p>FRANCIS: You guys were fantastic. Thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up the great band of China. Why Hillary Clinton's new book won't be hitting the bestseller's list in Shanghai anytime soon.</p><p>Plus, consumer sentiment is on the rise, but will feelings be enough to beat what lies beneath? \"THE MONEY\" hard truth coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Walking on sunshine. Consumer sentiment on the rise of beating street expectations today. Is this a ray of hope? Here now, Fox Business's Charlie Gasparino along with Veronica Dagher and former CBO director Doug Holtz-Eakin. Thanks so much for joining us. Doug, I'm going to let you go first.</p><p>DOUGH HOLTZ-EAKIN, FORMER CBO DIRECTOR: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Because you're on the road there. Consumer sentiment rising higher today. The consumer is what was missing from the GDP report. Consumer spending was very weak. That was one of the big reasons we saw the big contraction. Does this mean things are about to get better?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I don't think so. If you look inside the numbers, they're happier about what is going on right now, but they are not more confident about the future. And if you look at the monthly data, we've seen in the past two months, the first two months of the second quarter, real declines in personal consumption expenditures. So, there is not a lot out there to suggest the households are going to pick up this economy and carry it.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, Charlie, I always laugh when I see the consumer sentiment numbers. Because it's like asking people what they will do. It's not what they're actually doing.</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, Fox BUSINESS: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean it's like how you are feeling.</p><p>GASPARINO: What they might do .</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: In the future maybe, possibly. I would just say this about - I think that negative GDP print was probably somewhat of an aberration. I don't think we're in a recession right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: It certainly make the recipe - you look like .</p><p>GASPARINO: It's not - it's not - I'm not going to say that's good. But you know, one thing about the Obama economy. We've seen this one before, where you have a blip up in GDP you have a blip up in consumer confidence. And then you get a blip down and then you really have very, very little economic growth.</p><p>FRANCIS: And it all nets out to just standing still. That's right.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Charlie, may I point something out?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I mean here is the thing, Charlie. With the first quarter that we got, we'd have to go to 3.7 percent every quarter for the rest of the year, just to hit two percent for the year.</p><p>GASPARINO: OK.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Never seen that in this presidency.</p><p>FRANCIS: And Veronica, I would say on the horizon, I mean, we have the specter of potential inflation. Have you heard James Bullard here on Fox Business earlier this week, he's already saying it's going to be hotter than we thought. Consumers as they go to the store every day, they certainly feel it being hotter every day. I mean is that a real threat, inflation?</p><p>DAGHER: Yeah, I think it is. Yes, you go to the grocery store now, things cost more than they did a couple of months ago. So, I think that is a real issue. And also, if you look at the personal spending numbers we got for May. If you adjust for inflation, those numbers actually went down. So, I think between that and people's fears about the economy, they are still seeing people - their neighbors without a job for a long time, people are underemployed. They're afraid to spend. So, we're going to see the savings rates continue to go up until we feel more secure. I don't know what that's going to take, though, to make them feel more secure.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean Doug you are saying, you know, we would have to be above three percent for the rest of year in order to even out to something. What do you think is going to happen for the rest of the year?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: What this economy has done for years - is it's along the two percent. That's been the average consumption for growth, household spending growth, there's no evidence that they are going to change their behavior. They don't have the income or the sentiment to do it. Businesses are the wildcard.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: And if they somehow get some animal spirits and go with the big cap-ex expansion then we can get a good year, but I don't see that, Charlie.</p><p>GASPARINO: I agree with you. If you're talking about two percent growth and you have .</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I am.</p><p>GASPARINO: And you're talking about inflation in certain sectors where the Fed has to raise rates, we're heading for a recession. I mean Hillary Clinton runs for office. If she runs in 2015, 2016, she is very possible, that she runs in the middle of an economic downturn.</p><p>FRANCIS: Interesting. Meanwhile, you always make the point, Charlie, and you are right, the only one who's getting rich in this economy right now are people who are in the market. Because that is what all this Fed work has done, it's just stimulated the stock market. It's ironic that these policies out of Washington, all they've helped the one percent, who they say they hate. So, very interesting. Guys, thanks to all of you for joining us. From the U.S. to every corner of globe money is flying around the world today starting in Germany which has canceled the contract with Verizon over fears that the U.S. is spying on them. It all goes back to documents leaked by Edward Snowden, which revealed we had kind of an eavesdropping on calls made by Chancellor Angela Merkel. You remember that, right? Germans, they were not so amused by that, especially as the U.S. still refuses to agree with a no spy deal with the country. Verizon now bearing the brunt of that. It has been providing a communications network to the German government since 2010.</p><p>Over to Japan, which is now exporting square watermelons to grow throughout the globe. They curious, look at that are grown in boxes from a very young age. It sounds cruel. Which forces them into a cube-like shape. They weigh 13-pounds a apiece. Look at them.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, I think about it, no, no, no. Now they are making way to fruit stand in Canada. They don't come cheap. One sold in Moscow last year, went for more than 800 bucks. Juicy profits indeed. Landing in China where Hillary Clinton is getting the cold shoulder by officials. Publishers there say they will not be purchasing the translation rights to her new book. Local agencies have banned the English language version from being imported. There are a few parts of book where she is somewhat critical of the Chinese government. You know, we kind of saw that one coming, right?</p><p>Crying wolves of Wall Street. The hottest week for IPOs in years and still not enough for some of the tech heavyweights. That picture is going to come back to haunt that guy. Plus, if you can't win them, beer them. One job hunter's clever case to seal the deal. We're raking in the money coming up next. See this of this guy.</p><p>FRANCIS: Hold on tight. Shares of the venture camera maker GoPro powering higher in the second day of trading. Let's go to Ashley Webster on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. For more on this, when even higher today, Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, Fox BUSINESS: You know what they should do, Melissa. Scrap one of those GoPro cameras on the stock, of what you go up and down. Mostly up. But as we know, when - yesterday, the price was set at $24. It shot up yesterday and today. Look at this, it actually went above the $40 mark briefly before coming back down, still up 17percent. What else would you expect from this Adrenalin play on GoPro?</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely, still, Michael's not looking like a masterpiece, though, on its return to the market?</p><p>WEBSTER: No, a tale of two IPOs. Really, although that said, Michael's pricing it $17, debuting on the NASDAQ today, came out very slowly. Actually, went down below the IPO price. But it since inched its way up, and at least showing some positive signs, up 17, 1363 on the day. Up about three quarters of a percent. The arts and crafts. You know, by the way, I didn't realize, they also own the Aaron Brothers chain as well. So they go public finally. And up about 17, as I say, 14 cents above the share price that was listed. So, a slow but steady start I guess we'll call it. No GoPro.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. All right, Ashley, thanks so much. So, the market wrapping up its biggest week for IPOs in eight years. Some big tech investors are not breaking out the champagne. Rather, they're crying about how hard it is to go public. Somewhere alone violin plays for them. Is this a sign of the top? Charlie is back with us, along with Scott Martin from United Advisors and Jonathan Hoenig from CapitalistPig Hedge Fund. They're both Fox News contributors. So, I mean it has been the week of endless IPOs. Still, you have Marc Andreessen up there saying, it comes across like I'm complaining about how hard it is to be public. Of course, the answer is, you just need to suck it up. I mean poor IPO guys getting out there and making a fortune. Jonathan, ridiculous?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG HEDGE FUND: No, but we should be happy they're getting out there making a fortune, Melissa. We should be happy that deals are getting done and still being priced. I don't think this is the death of the IPO market at all, as you pointed out. It was an extremely busy week for IPOs. And you know, you'll the death comes when you see the IPOs starts coming public and just falling flat. It happened in 1999 .</p><p>FRANCIS: No, I know, but Scott . --</p><p>HOENIG: In 2000.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't think it's so much the death of the IPO. I think it is more of a sign of the top. That you have a zillion coming out. It's the most in whatever we - you know, eight years. And then you have people complaining about how hard it is when here, everyone is doing it. How hard could it be? What do you think?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS: Well ..</p><p>FRANCIS: Everybody's got.</p><p>MARTIN: You're right, everybody is doing it. But here's the thing, Melissa. I mean Andreessen is complaining about the pricing I think more than anything. And he's talking about back in the '90s with Netscape and some of these other companies coming out at 2 billion valuation was kind of the status quo. Now you have got companies like Uber that are in - you know, $17 billion-dollar range. Even interest is somewhere between five and six billion. Here is the funny thing, right? GoPro is somewhere around 3 billion, but the stock is up gigantically, since it's IPO, because probably too cheap. So, it's more about pricing issue, but like Jonathan said I will never disagree with somebody in a seersucker suit, by the way.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MARTIN: That's the - stock, and that is why the prices are going up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Charlie.</p><p>GASPARINO: I'm not quite sure what Andreessen is complaining about. I mean is he complaining about the regulations?</p><p>FRANCIS: He's talking about for the young companies, you know, there is such a microscope on you. Every part of your business ends up being connected and end up being tied back to your self-pricing and morale.</p><p>GASPARINO: Well, too bad, pal.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, you know, that's what - you want to be a public company, you are going to have some regulations you have to follow. I will say this, though. Listen, it is great that they're coming public. We should point out that the NASDAQ has been overshadowed. This has been overshadowed. NASDAQ has done 100 tech IPOs in the past year. That's what I'm .</p><p>FRANCIS: It's amazing.</p><p>HOENIG: Can I just comment quickly?</p><p>GASPARINO: And, you know, they didn't win the Alibaba one, but they won some other ones. We had Ashley on the floor of the stock exchange.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: NASDAQ won, I think, GoPro, right?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GASPARINO: To make this point. You guys can jump in. Let me make this point, Jonathan. When you are getting numbers like this you're getting close to a top.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>GASPARINO: It is not general .</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonathan, real quick, last comment, go ahead.</p><p>HOENIG: What's - I don't know, Charlie has been - I know calling for a tough for at least a couple of weeks or months now. And you say boo-hoo hoo for companies that are trying to become public.</p><p>GASPARINO: Months.</p><p>HOENIG: Think back to before Sarbanes-Oxley. It has been harder and harder for small companies to raise money. That's why now some of them are trying to use the Jobs Act to raise money.</p><p>GASPARINO: Why are we seeing .?</p><p>HOENIG: Because those regulations are so extensive.</p><p>FRANCIS: We have got to go. You guys can keep fighting in the break. That's fine. Thanks, guys. All right, there is no margin of error for this comeback. American demand for natural ingredients just keeps on growing, and the likes of butter are on a roll, get it? Get it? I know, one too many jokes in there for me. Plus, as good as Goldberg.

Surveillance drones from Iran are flying over the country. The White House is looking to Syrian rebels to potentially play a role.</p><p>Joining me now, Chris Harmer, from the Institute for the Study of War and Fox News Middle East expert, Walid Phares. Chris, let me start with you. I mean, this situation is intensifying.</p><p>CHRIS HARMER, INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR: Melissa, it's a pleasure to be here, thanks for having me. Yes, the situation is intensifying. If you look at is the snapshot, it looks like ISIS is culminating with this massive offensive. In fact, if you look closer at what they have been doing the past two years they have been building towards this.</p><p>They have done all the small building blocks they need to organize their terrorist state and using that to attack the government in Mosul, which they've already won and they are now taking over the western desert areas of Iraq that used to be dominated by the Sunni tribes.</p><p>The real question here is, is the Iraqi security force going to be able to respond to this? So far the answer is no.</p><p>FRANCIS: Walid, I mean, it's not about just about Iraq. It's about the entire region being sucked into this conflict as we said. Look at the White House proposing to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels, how do you identify a moderate Syrian rebels are?</p><p>DR. WALID PHARES, FOX NEWS MIDDLE EAST EXPERT: Speaking of how many countries, let's do the count, Syria was involved, and they are considering those. Lebanon may go in because Lebanon also has pro and against ISIS. Iran by sending the drones into Iraq will shoot against them. How will we identify the market?</p><p>We're five years late. We have been urging the administration since the Arabs spring to do so in civil society. Now it will be time to find a less Islamist and jihadists on the ground, this is not something that will have a bright future.</p><p>FRANCIS: So if everyone in the region is getting involved, is that an argument for us to get involved or to stand back? Chris, what do you think?</p><p>HARMER: It's wrong for the U.S. to get involve. Look, we have strategic interests in Syria whether we want to acknowledge it or not. We have strategic interests in Iraq whether we want to acknowledge it or not. It is easy to embrace the isolationist argument, but in today's interconnected world it's not possible.</p><p>FRANCIS: What are the interests?</p><p>HARMER: We do not want to see a caliphate organized in Eastern Syria and Western Iraq where ISIS has the complete safe haven. If you look at what al Qaeda had in Afghanistan, they had a safe haven as guests of the Taliban. What they are organizing is a nation state where they are guests of nobody and beholden to no one. They can do whatever they want.</p><p>In fact, one of the arguments between ISIS and al Qaeda, al Qaeda saw how many fighters that ISIS was attracting, Europe, North America. They said you should use those guys right now to export terror back. ISIS said no. We will win the war here first and then have this cadres of several thousand battle hardened formerly trained terrorists going back to Europe and North America with passports and terrorist attacks here.</p><p>FRANCIS: So Walid, is it realistic to think that we can do something to break up that safe phase?</p><p>PHARES: We could have, should have and continue to consider those situations. Let me say this. If ISIS or (inaudible) organization is not going to be stop, they will carve up this piece of Iraq and the other side of Syria. A large section of Syria not in Lebanon and put pressure on Jordan across the border with Saudi Arabia, it's not going to stop there.</p><p>And of course, as the gentleman has said, they are going to have launching pad much stronger that the United States and the west. We need to begin acting with our allies. For example, I would recommend to support the Kurds in the north and mildly support the south in the situation.</p><p>FRANCIS: Gentlemen, thanks for your expertise. We really appreciate it. It seems to be easing somewhat, crude-oil prices are lower after two consecutive weeks of gains. Let's go to trader, Andrew Keene at the CME. This is the dichotomy. You heard from the guests before you that this situation is getting much bigger, the whole region is being pulled into it. At the same time, if traders get used to it as background noise, what is going on?</p><p>ANDREW KEENE, KEENEONTHEMARKET.COM: We talk about it a couple times. A lot of the oil price factor in this the fact we haven't had a resolution, effective in the oil price over the last 12 trading days we have been stuck in a tight race between 105 and 108. I will look at the break out, which is to the downside. If there is resolution overseas over the weekend, out we will see oil embracing 105, 101 in a heartbeat or go to 120. The fact there isn't a resolution and they after day the price of oil goes cotter is not factoring that in. That is a fear to the downside.</p><p>FRANCIS: Andrew Keene, thank you so much. It's a natural state of mind how food label using every antioxidants in the book to make your spending anything but organic. At the end of the day it is all about money.</p><p>FRANCIS: I am Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief. Nike reaping ahead today after earnings surpassed expectations with 18 percent sales growth in Europe. World Cup giving the company boost with some better numbers out of the soccer division. Banks importing risky borrowers with $4 million in credit cards issued to, 4 million credit cards issued for sub-prime borrowers in the first quarter.

Many of them have urged the industry to start banning the wells they use to dispose of waste water with some suspect, seismic activity. That is the latest from the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>FRANCIS: Profits come naturally to brands catching in on the nutrition crazed, but consumers getting wary of the labels on their groceries. It turns out some of these healthy buzzwords sound great, but they mean absolutely nothing.</p><p>Here now supermarket guru, Phil Lampert, natural labels when you see something labels natural, bring in $40 billion a year. The FDA says there is no definition of natural. Actually doesn't mean anything. I am outraged. Are you outrage?</p><p>PHIL LAMPERT, SUPERMARKET EXPERT: No. Because this is a 15-year-old scam that we have been living with. This is nearly 70s. This is not something new. All those companies started using the word natural and it can't have artificial flavors. And when we see one of these products, we think it came out of the ground that way.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really means those things because the FDA says it doesn't mean anything and consumer reports is petitioning the FDA to ban the word natural from labels because they are saying it doesn't guarantee anything.</p><p>LAMPERT: And it should be banned and there's no FDA regulation that specifies that, but FDA from the web site and the regulations do specified that they will allow the word natural to be used under those three conditions if they are met some there isn't a rule, but there have been complaints where people have used those having added color for example and FDA --</p><p>FRANCIS: At the checkout counter there were fried potato chips that were there and a set of natural and for a moment on is like maybe these aren't so bad for you. But the reality comes flooding back in and you know is a lot. University of Houston found people are more likely to think that foods with labels like organic and natural are healthy even when the food was candy or soda. Is organic another one that is a fraud?</p><p>LAMPERT: There are certified organic regulations, number one, but when it comes to nutrition, there is no difference between something that is organic and conventionally grown nutritionally. You can use pesticides with organics, that is something people don't realize, but there are regulations in place so at least that is better than we think. We pay more for organic or natural.</p><p>FRANCIS: We do and at the same time people I shunning things that are frozen or in cans, just across the board even things like healthy choice, lean cuisine, struggling. Now that people have this perception that natural and organic is better so they see something in the aisle. Are we going to see these brands go away?</p><p>LAMPERT: Absolutely not. In the case of Conagra Foods, for example, you look at Healthy Choice, what they have done over the past few years has been dramatic to your point, people don't understand fresh and frozen what that really means. USDA came out a couple years ago talking about their studies, lot of frozen products have more nutrients. But Conagra has educed sodium. It limited ingredients, taking out ingredients, using apples instead.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't want to run out of time because I have one more for you. I can't believe it is butter. The kitchen favorite melting its way into hearts and arteries across the country, the \"Wall Street Journal\" even calling butter one of the great comeback stories in U.S. food history.</p><p>Check out this chart showing the recent consumption decline of greasy margarine and the rise of delicious fluffy golden butter. Look at that spread. Get it? Look at that spread. What do you think?</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, \"THE WALL STREE JOURNAL\": I love butter. I think is delicious, one of those simple luxuries.</p><p>FRANCIS: Why is it making a comeback in your opinion?</p><p>LAMPERT: A couple things. One is taste certainly, but also let's not forget everything Julia Child told us was true. Use a little bit of butter, you will have flavor and it will cook better and that a lot of other artificial product.</p><p>FRANCIS: Heading into the last hour of trading, let's check with Liz Claman to see what she has coming up -- Liz.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS: This is jam packed because as we go to the end element is the end of the month for the trading session. We are watching markets. And the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who's breaking news right and left on the grand jury that now has brand new evidence that does not look good for top executives of General Motors.

Putting down your phone can be hard to do, so much so that some are willing to pay to have it taken away. Camp Grounded is an adult summer camp where people completely unplug. Levi Felix joins me now. Why do I need a camp for this? Can't put my phone in a drawer for the weekend?</p><p>LEVI FELIX, CAMP GROUNDED FOUNDER: Of course, you can put your phone away in a drawer and go camping but most people find when they go on vacation they spent a fourth of their vacation on e-mail or on their phone checking it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Has anyone ever tried to cheat? What is the deal? You have the phones under your hat?</p><p>FELIX: No. Actually I got a nice haircut when I was at camp last week. They decided to give me a bulkhead. Campers show up and turn the devices into a safe. Anything of value, locked up for four days and we never had anyone try to sneak out.</p><p>FRANCIS: Why do I want to go to a camp and pay for this? I want to detox, I can put it to the side. People need to go somewhere and have it physically taken from them in order to do it?</p><p>FELIX: We are focused on the unplugging, it is what you are looking to reconnect with. There is yoga, meditation, hiking, different arts and crafts programs, our jury, full on summer camp for adults. We trade space where people can put away their phones so they are not going to get work e- mail's for calls anywhere from 385 to 574 four days, we do all organic sustainable food. Basically like a cruise ship but in the redwoods for four days and pretty amazing what happens when you have 300 adults altogether, everyone is hanging out and singing together.</p><p>FRANCIS: I am about to go on a cruise and trying to think of which two vacations I would rather do. Levi, thank you so much. No phones for this one. Instead of e-mailing his resume look at what this guy did. He printed his resume on a pack of beer.</p><p>Graphic designer, Brennan Gleeson started Resumemail at the University of Frazier Valley in addition to his crafty labeling, he broods the beer himself.

These ideas don't often work. People sending balloons and flowers and kind of tacky, but for a graphic designer he is showing talent. It is really creative.</p><p>FRANCIS: I heard someone wrapping up resume around a pineapple. Put on coffee because it perks everyone up. There you go. If there is one thing Americans are great at in a World Cup is the ability to lose a game and still get ahead. Asking anything about the point system and how it works, listen to who is getting that hilariously and publicly wrong. At the end of the day it is all about money and a very complex score keeping.</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, we didn't win it, but we're in it. Team USA advances in the World Cup game despite its loss to Germany yesterday all thanks to the point system. If you didn't get the math of sports here, you are not alone. Dennys made the same mistake, going to eat my wait in ice cream now because of sadness.</p><p>Jonathan Hoenig and Scott Martin are back with me now. I mean, they're trying to tweet and stay on top of it, but apparently they didn't realize we were still in. What do you think, Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, soccer is still just an unknown entity for so many of us here in the states, Melissa, so I take the same approach that I do with stocks, you have to kind of go where the action is.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>HOENIG: Call me when we're in the finals.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN: Come on --</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead, Scott.</p><p>MARTIN: Jonathan, don't make my come over there again. This is big for the country though. Everybody is getting fired up about this. The sad thing about Dennys, Melissa, they didn't give out free food because the USA lost.</p><p>FRANCIS: I didn't really watch yesterday. I tried to, but apparently all of Wall Street did. Volume of shares traded during the game yesterday, 25 percent lower than the same time as last year. Scott, you were watching, yes? Were you trading or watching?</p><p>MARTIN: I was definitely watching. And the funny thing is, you know, if you're at a restaurant watch how many people pile in there, and the second the game is over, it's like a stampede out the door. But it's good business for these restaurants. If you open up your business for some of these fans, you get people spending money, and I think it's good.</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely, Jonathan, I guess I wasn't alone not watching because even astronauts in space tuned in, American and German astronauts at the International Space Station celebrated their teams advancing with a little victory dancing. Do we have that video? What do you think? Jonathan, did you see this?</p><p>HOENIG: I didn't see that, but I'm not surprised. I mean, sporting events like this, Melissa, give us the opportunity to come together for a shared experience and celebrate the good, the good for being the good, the heroic nature of these really incredible athletes who are able to run for I don't know how long, how hard, their endurance is remarkable. So the fact that we can all get together and cheer, a positive thing.</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely. Gentlemen, thanks to both of you. Happy Friday to everyone out there. I don't know about you, but these guys here in the studio are ready to get the weekend started, right, guys? Yes. All right, \"COUNTDOWN\" starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONEY-2014062701cb230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CJ2-PNW1-DXH2-60MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7267\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MONEY</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>June 27, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>WMT (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iraq</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Foods</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Housing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Families</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Walmart</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Rules &amp;

Beto O'Rourke, hoping to be the state's first Democratic senator in 25 years. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Now, live from San Antonio, both candidates face-to-face in the Texas debate. </p><p>SARAH FORGANY, ANCHOR, KENS 5:  Good evening again.  Thank you for joining us tonight.  I'm Sarah Forgany, news anchor at KENS 5 in San Antonio. </p><p>JASON WHITELY, POLITICAL REPORTER, WFAA:  And I'm Jason Whitely, political reporter and host of \"Inside Texas Politics\" at WFAA in Dallas-Fort Worth.  We welcome all our viewers from across the state watching this debate live tonight in all corners of Texas.  So let's get right to it.</p><p>FORGANY:  Both campaigns have agreed to these rules tonight.  For each question, the candidate will get 90 seconds to answer, his opponent will have 90 seconds for a response, and we will turn back for a final rebuttal of 60 seconds. </p><p>WHITELY:  Let's first, though, turn to Dallas, to our Victory Park studios where we have a social media response team there.  So as you watch this debate on television with us tonight, joining the conversation online using the hashtag #TexasDebate. </p><p>FORGANY:  And we also have a live audience with us here tonight in the studio, so we ask you to please hold your applause during this debate, except for now, as we welcome the two candidates running for the United States Senate in Texas.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>FORGANY:  Good evening. </p><p>WHITELY:  Please welcome Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke here.  Gentlemen, welcome tonight.  Senator Cruz, you won the coin toss to have the final word tonight at the end of this program, so therefore we start with you, Congressman O'Rourke.  Welcome to you. </p><p>Twenty one days away from election and there's still uncertainty about the security of our ballot boxes.  And just yesterday, new cyber attacks again reported on election databases in several states.  But misinformation online can be just as dangerous as so many people know.  The question is, should Congress enact regulations on social media to protect voters from that misinformation? </p><p>O'ROURKE:  First, Jason, let me thank you and Sarah for moderating tonight's debate, KENS 5 for hosting us, the people of San Antonio for being here, and the people of Texas for watching this and participating in one of the most important decisions of our lifetimes.  Es una honor estar aqui con ustedes otra ves aqui en San Antonio.</p><p>Yes, the integrity of our ballot box.  Two hundred and forty two years into this experiment, the American democracy, that is the exception, not the rule in world history, is sacred.  And it's essential that we continue to protect it.  It's under attack unlike any other time in this nation's past. </p><p>We know because the intelligence community has reached a unanimous conclusion on this, that the Russian government sought to undermine our democracy.  In fact, President Trump's own administration announced the indictment of 12 Russian nationals who compromised the voter data of more than half a million of our fellow Americans.  And we know they will attack us again in this election and the next unless we stand up to them now. </p><p>So, yes, let's protect the integrity of our ballot box, which is why I'm a little surprised that Senator Cruz has voted against the funding to protect access to the ballot box and to ensure that your vote goes to the candidate of your choice.</p><p>And, yes, we must also ensure that on social media, where so many of us now have become the product on Twitter, on Facebook, that we are not manipulated and that opinions that we hold are not shaped by those from other countries. </p><p>So I want to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, work with this administration, to make sure that we do that and every single voter can make an informed decision based on accurate information. </p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that is your time.  Ninety second response, Mr. Cruz.</p><p>CRUZ:  Of course we should do more to protect the integrity of elections.  And I'm proud to have supported, number one, funding from the federal government to the states to help secure our elections, but number two, just a week ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed legislation that I co-sponsored called the DETER Act that would punish anyone that comes to this country with the purpose of undermining elections.  We need to make sure our elections are safe and secure. </p><p>Now, your question was, should Congress be regulating social media companies and what they allow to be said.  I believe in the First Amendment.  I don't believe Congress should be in the business of regulating conduct, because I don't think it's government's job to regulating content, rather, online.</p><p>That being said, I am very concerned -- and I know there are millions of Texans who are concerned, about the political bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google, skewing and silencing the voices of those who politically they disagree with.  You may remember several months ago Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, testified before the Senate, and I asked him a series of vigorous questions about the political bias at Facebook.</p><p>Now, even though Congress shouldn't regulate the content, there are two things we should think about doing.  Number one, right now, big tech enjoys an immunity from liability on the assumption that they would be neutral and fair.  If they're not going to be neutral and fair, if they're going to be biased, we should repeal the immunity from liability so they should be liable like the rest of us.</p><p>Number two, the giant tech companies, by any measure of bigger than AT&amp;amp;T was when it was broken up under the antitrust laws, bigger than Standard Oil, and if they're abusing market powers and monopoly, the antitrust laws should be enforced. </p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time.  Congressman, to be clear, he said that, yes, we should enact -- Congress should enact regulations on social media.  Yes or no, in the remaining 60 second rebuttal here for you, yes or no for regulations on social media?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Yes, I think we can have thoughtful regulations that ensure that we're making informed decisions based on facts and the truth, and we're not being manipulated by foreign powers.  But it's interesting that Ted Cruz invested more than $5 million in Cambridge Analytica, which is the very company that helped to undermine our democracy, to feed false news and false opinions to our fellow Americans to manipulate the world's greatest democracy, $5 million from Ted Cruz that funded Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>He voted against supporting and safeguarding the integrity of our ballot box.  And our junior senator will not stand up to President Trump, someone who apologizes for Russia, defends that country, Vladimir Putin, the leader of the country that sought to undermine our democracy.  He won't stand up against him and he won't stand up for us to make sure that our elections are free and fair, that your vote goes to the intended candidate.</p><p>This is beyond party politics.  This is getting -- this is getting our democracy back our track.  And we need a senator from Texas who will do that.</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that is your time.</p><p>FORGANY:  Senator Cruz, Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in 11 days ago.  The U.S. Supreme Court now has five justices who have either directly stated or suggested that Roe v.  Wade was wrongly decided.  Should we prepare for changes to abortion law in this country?</p><p>CRUZ:  Well, listen, I believe that every human life is a gift from God, is a precious gift from God and it should be protected.  It should be protected and cherished.  I'm pro-life. </p><p>And now the question of what will happen at the Supreme Court on Roe v.  Wade or anything else, we'll have to see when cases are decided.  Justice Kavanaugh, just like his predecessors, just like Justice Ginsburg, just like Justice Kagan, declined to answer those questions.  And that's been the standard at the Supreme Court for many, many years.</p><p>I would note, though, on the question of life there is an enormous difference between me and Congressman O'Rourke.  On the question of life, Congressman O'Rourke is at the extreme pro-abortion side.  So he has repeatedly voted in favor of late-term abortions.  He has repeatedly voted in favor of taxpayer funding for abortions.  I've got to say, that's not consistent with the views of the people of Texas.</p><p>The people of Texas, and I will say especially the Hispanic community, we don't want to see taxpayer-funded, Medicaid funding abortions and late term abortions.  I think that's extreme and that's disconnected.</p><p>And I will note, as well, on the question of judges, judges is a massive divide between Congressman O'Rourke and me.  I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.  I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the court.  Congressman O'Rourke would have voted against both of them.  And he wants to see, like Hillary Clinton, promise to appoint left-wing judicial activists who impose their own policy preferences from the bench.</p><p>I don't think that's what the people of Texas want.  We want judges...</p><p>FORGANY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>CRUZ:  ... and justices who will follow the Constitution and follow the law.</p><p>FORGANY:  That's your time.  Thank you.  Congressman, you have 90 seconds for a response.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Senator Cruz has a very troubling record when it comes to judicial nominations and confirmations.  He supported the nomination of a judge, Jeff Mateer, who described transgender children as part of Satan's plan, believes in conversion therapy.  He supported the nomination of a judge -- someone to be a judge who'd never tried a case before, another potential judge who could not tell us whether Brown v.  The Board of Education was correctly decided.</p><p>From our perspective, in a state where you can be fired for being gay, I want a justice who believes in civil rights.  From the perspective of a state that ranks 50th in voter turnout in the country, not by accident, by design some people drawn out of their democracy, I want a justice who believes in voting rights.</p><p>And for a state that is at the epicenter of the maternal mortality crisis, as we made it harder and harder for women to get access to the health care that they need to get that cervical cancer screening, to see that family planning provider, to see a provider of any kind, we're losing them faster here than in almost any other state, almost any other developed country in the world.</p><p>I will only vote to confirm a Supreme Court justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body and who has the health care access to be able to do so. </p><p>We should be able -- and the next junior senator from the state of Texas -- to work with our colleagues, to work with the administration, to have justices who will rule in favor of people and our needs, not corporations, not special interests, not the political action committees.  Those are some very significant needs that we have in Texas right now, not represented by Judge, now Justice Kavanaugh.  And so...</p><p>FORGANY:  Congressman...</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Yeah, this is a decision that I'm concerned about.</p><p>FORGANY:  That's your time.  Thank you.  Senator, in your 60 second rebuttal, what should abortion law in Texas look like?</p><p>CRUZ:  Well, you know, it's striking that Congressman O'Rourke didn't dispute his extreme record on abortion, supporting late-term abortions, supporting taxpayer funding for abortion, supporting taxpayer funding for abortions late term even for illegal aliens.  That is an -- and he's voted for that.  That is an extreme position, fewer than 9 percent of Texans agree with him.</p><p>He also didn't dispute that he opposed Justice Gorsuch, he opposed Justice Kavanaugh.  And if you listen to what Congressman O'Rourke said, he said he wants justices that agree with his own left-wing policy views.  That's not the job of the court.</p><p>The job of the court is to follow the law.  If you want to change the law, you do it through elections.  You do it -- the Constitution gives the power to the people, not five unelected lawyers in Washington.  And let me note, the same judges that Congressman O'Rourke wants to see would also undermine the First Amendment, would undermine free speech, would undermine religious liberty, would undermine the Second Amendment.</p><p>Hillary Clinton promised to appoint justices who would undermine the Second Amendment.  And Congressman O'Rourke enthusiastically supported her doing so.</p><p>FORGANY:  Senator, that's your time.  Thank you very much.</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator Cruz, President Trump said on Sunday that something is changing in regards to the climate.  You're clearly on record for years saying there's no evidence to just back that up, nothing exists yet to back that up.  But major oil companies, including Texas-based ExxonMobil, says even on its website the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action.  That's ExxonMobil's own words there.</p><p>So what do you tell Texas companies who think this really is a problem?</p><p>CRUZ:  Well, listen, of course the climate is changing.  The climate has been changing from the dawn of time.  The climate will change as long as -- as we have a planet Earth.</p><p>I am the son of two mathematicians and computer programmers.  I believe in science.  I chair the Science and Space Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee.  And indeed, in that capacity, I chaired a hearing looking on the science and data behind global warming.  And we heard testimony, we heard actual science and data.</p><p>Far too many Democrats approach this issue not as a matter of science -- I think we should follow the science and follow the evidence -- but instead what they approach it as, as a matter of government power.  They want the power to control the economy.</p><p>That has led, for example, Congressman O'Rourke to cast some votes that I think are really harmful to the people of Texas.  For example, Congressman O'Rourke voted in favor of a $10 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state of Texas.  That would have been absolutely devastating to the state of Texas.  By the way, $10 a barrel, that works out to about 24 cents a gallon that every one of us would pay when you go fill up your car or truck.  That would hurt the people of Texas. </p><p>And let me point out, look, a robust energy sector is good for all of Texas.  There are millions of jobs that depend on a robust oil and gas sector.  And Congressman O'Rourke's record voting against Texas oil and gas, voting against energy, that hurts the economy, it hurts jobs, it's not right for Texas.</p><p>And let me point out:  All of those oil and gas workers, they buy homes.  They buy cars and trucks.  They get health care.  They give to churches and schools.  And by the way, the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;amp;M...</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>CRUZ:  ... get hundreds of millions of dollars from our energy sector...</p><p>WHITELY:  That's your time, Senator.  Let's move on to a 90 second response from Mr. O'Rourke.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  This is what you can expect over the course of this debate.  Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you.  He's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever taken.  He's dishonest.  It's why the president called him lying Ted.  And it's why the nickname stuck, because it's true.</p><p>Look, the climate is changing.  And manmade climate change is a fact.  Three hundred years after the enlightenment, we should be able to listen to the scientists and follow their advice and guidance.  And they tell us that we still have time, but the window is closing to get this right.  If we're going to make our commitment to the generations that follow and not just think about the next election or our political career or pursuit of the White House, then we can make the right decisions.</p><p>Now, we can support Texas being a proud energy leader in oil and in gas, but also in renewable energy.  Today, Texas leads the country -- we're number one in the nation in the generation of renewable wind power.  We're number five and moving up quick when it comes to solar.  The two fastest-growing jobs in the United States of America today:  Wind and solar jobs.  We can continue to grow this economy, we can reject the false choice between oil and gas and renewable energy, make sure that we produce and refine and transport and use our energy resources more responsibly.</p><p>And listen, this isn't one political party saying this.  This is people of both parties in every single county in Texas that we've had the chance to listen to people.  These are folks who work in the energy industry.  Amy and I were in Iraan, Texas, listening to those who work in some of these fracking operations.  What they want is predictability and consistency in the regulations, and then they will perform to them.</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time.  Mr. Cruz, 60 second rebuttal.  The question is, does ExxonMobil have it wrong here?</p><p>CRUZ:  Well, it's clear Congressman O'Rourke's pollsters have told him to come out on the attack.  So if he wants to insult me and call me a liar, that's fine.  But, you know, John Adams famously said, Facts are stubborn things.</p><p>So if you want to see the vote he cast for a $10 a barrel tax on oil, go to our website.  It's tedcruz.org.  And we will put up the exact text of the vote and a link to Congressman O'Rourke's vote against the people of Texas.</p><p>Let me say, if you work in energy, if you work in oil and gas, Congressman O'Rourke's record on this is extreme.  He didn't just vote for a $10 a barrel tax on oil.  He's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking, aggressive regulations of exporting liquefied natural gas.  He's a prominent supporter of President Obama's Paris climate deal, which would have killed thousands of jobs in the state of Texas.</p><p>That's not good for Texas.  And it's an example of over and over again Congressman O'Rourke sides with liberal extremists on the national level, instead of the people of Texas, instead of jobs of Texas.  And -- and -- and by the way...</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>CRUZ:  ... alternatives are great, too.  Texas leads in energy across the board.</p><p>FORGANY:  Representative, this question is about immigration policy.  We know your position and passion for the Dreamers.  And we know that you are adamantly against extending the existing border fence.  This question here is specifically about border security.</p><p>If we don't need a border wall, can you please look at the people of Texas tonight and tell them what we do need?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  I'd be happy to.  And listen, I don't know if there's another person who has a greater stake in this issue than I do.  Amy and I are raising Ulysses and Molly and Henry in El Paso, Texas, one-half of the largest binational community on the border, the defining border community.</p><p>We care about our kids' safety.  I care about the safety of those that I represent in Congress.  I care about the safety of every single person in the state of Texas.  El Paso, in fact, is one of, if not the safest cities in the United States of America.  It's because we have world-class law enforcement, police and sheriff's deputies, but it's also because we are a city of immigrants.</p><p>A quarter of those that I represent were born in a country -- another country, chose us, came here to this country, and by their very presence made it better.  No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns.  But...</p><p>FORGANY:  But, Congressman...</p><p>O'ROURKE:  ... smart policy will.  And let me describe one of those to you.  Senator John Cornyn and I, though he's a Republican and I'm a Democrat, he's in the Senate and I'm in the House, worked on policy together to invest in our ports of entry.  That's where more than 90 percent of everyone and everything that ever comes into the United States first crosses.  Having a better idea of who and what comes into our country demonstrably makes us safer. </p><p>And at the same time, those customs officers are able to facilitate legitimate trade and travel that's connected to more than a million jobs in the state of Texas.  As we all know, here, the home of Toyota, trade is the lifeblood of the state of Texas.  If we can make our communities more secure, as this bill did, and facilitate more job-growing trade, then we've really figured something out.</p><p>And I think that John Cornyn and I have been able to do it.  Republicans...</p><p>FORGANY:  That's your time, Congressman.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  ... and Democrats working together on an issue that makes Texas better.</p><p>FORGANY:  That's your time.  Thank you.  Senator, you have 90 seconds to respond.</p><p>CRUZ:  So everyone should notice in his answer that he wanted to talk about trade, he wanted to talk about customs, he wanted to talk about everything expect border security.  And let me say, there's no race in the country with a starker divide on immigration than this race here in the state of Texas. </p><p>As for me, I'm incredibly honored to have received the formal endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, the union of the men and women who risk their lives keeping our nation safe.  I will note here at this debate, I'm very pleased we have Brandon Judd and Paul Perez, both from the National Border Patrol Council.  The reason they're supporting me is I've led the fight to secure the border, building the wall, using technology, increasing boots on the ground.  We can keep our communities safe.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke not only opposes a wall, but he has said we have too many fences and walls already on the border, he wants to tear downs the ones we have.  And I'll note, he brought up El Paso.  El Paso is right across from Juarez, one of the most dangerous cities in the world, 3,000 murders last year.  There's a wall there.  That wall is one of the tools you use to protect us. </p><p>But let me give you an example of just how extreme Congressman O'Rourke is on immigration.  Kate's Law, commonsense legislation, overwhelming majority of Texans support it.  I'm the author of Kate's Law in the Senate that says violent criminal illegal aliens, if they're deported repeatedly, should face a mandatory minimum prison sentence.  Congressman O'Rourke has voted against Kate's Law.  That's wrong.  We need -- we should not be releasing violent criminals into our community.</p><p>FORGANY:  Congressman, in your 60 second rebuttal, can you tell your specific plan to secure the border?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Well, as I just told you, Senator John Cornyn and I have worked to invest in our ports of entry.  That means staffing of customs officers.  That means infrastructure at our bridges that connect us with Mexico, where more than 90 percent of everyone and everything first crosses.  And it means investment in the technology that ensures that we do a better, smarter job screening those who first come into this country.  That will make us safer.</p><p>It also means that we support local law enforcement, those police officers and sheriff's deputies who keep this country safe.  We can do that, as well.  But listen, we cannot use this idea of border security to be an impediment to moving forward on those issues that are also demanding our action and which Texans know better than perhaps any other people of any other state.</p><p>On issues of immigration reform, the fate of Dreamers -- nearly 200,000 in the state of Texas -- when the Senate voted to move forward on debate for Dreamers, 98 senators showed up that day, 97 voted to move forward.  Only one senator voted no, stood in the corner while everyone else was at the table.  Ted Cruz has put his career above the interests and priorities of Texas.</p><p>FORGANY:  Congressman, that's your time.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Ted Cruz is for Ted Cruz.</p><p>FORGANY:  That's your time.  Thank you very much.</p><p>CRUZ:  Hold on a second.  Let me -- let me respond to that, please, which is -- I noticed Congressman O'Rourke said we need to support law enforcement.  I think that's striking that he says that now in a debate because his career has been one consistently of opposing law enforcement.  Indeed, someone else who is here today is Detective Mike Helle, who leads the San Antonio Police Officers Association, and Detective Helle has endorsed me.</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator...</p><p>CRUZ:  And I would note, as well, 171 elected Texas sheriffs...</p><p>FORGANY:  Senator, thank you very much.  We have to move on.</p><p>CRUZ:  Hold on.  I get a 60 second response.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Look at his record -- look at his record...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORGANY:  You have both agreed to...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CRUZ:  But we agreed we could have a 60 second...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORGANY:  You have both agreed to these rules.  We need to move on to the next topic.</p><p>CRUZ:  But we agreed -- we agreed on a 60 second rebuttal, if necessary.  And I want to make a point on law enforcement. </p><p>O'ROURKE:  That's not what you said when you established the rules at the outset.</p><p>FORGANY:  He already finished his rebuttal.  We have to move on to the next topic.</p><p>WHITELY:  Gentlemen, let's talk about health care now.  What you're looking at for our television audience is a live picture of our Victory Park Studios in Dallas where that social media response team is listening to our viewers out there, too.  The overwhelming conversation online we're hearing about is about health care, and one post asks you directly, Congressman O'Rourke, if universal health care is going to cost trillions of dollars, what do you cut from the federal budget or how much are you going to raise my taxes to pay for that?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Let's start with the goal.  What is it that we're trying to achieve?  I want to make sure that everyone can see a doctor, afford their prescription medications, take their child to a therapist, be well enough to live to their full potential over the course of their lifetime.  And I want to make sure that working families pay less for health care costs than they do today.</p><p>So here are some steps that we could take to get to your answer.  We could expand Medicaid.  This is a state that left $100 billion on the table.  OK, expand Medicaid.  More working Texans are able to be well enough to go back to work, to be there for their families.</p><p>We could introduce Medicare as an option on the exchanges to drive down the increase in premium costs and expand selection and choice. </p><p>And then we could take the lead, as the state that is the least insured in the United States, who perhaps better understands the consequences of failing to be there, by and for one another, better than anyone else, on guaranteed, high-quality, universal health care.  There are a number of ways to get there from Medicare for all to one where you use a mix of employer-based insurance and the ability for people to pay into Medicare. </p><p>That could come at a cost of around $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years.  If you look at the tax cut that Senator Cruz just voted for, $2 trillion added to $21 trillion in debt, the disproportionate benefit flowing to corporations and the very wealthiest, and move that corporate tax rate not to where it was, but maybe 5 points, from 21 to 26, you would generate the money necessary to pay for access to health care so that everyone lives to their full potential.</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time.  Mr. Cruz, 90 seconds response.</p><p>CRUZ:  You know, I have to say, he really didn't want to answer the question of how to pay for it, so let me be clear what it would cost.  Congressman O'Rourke is proposing socialized medicine, the federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor.</p><p>There are at least three big problems with that.  Number one, every place on Earth that happens, you have rationing and waiting lists.  If you look at the United Kingdom, if a senior needs to get a hip replacement, it takes about 90 days.  In Canada, it takes about 200 days. </p><p>But number two, the cost would be immense.  When Bernie Sanders rolled out this plan -- and Congressman O'Rourke supports the Bernie Sanders plan of socialized medicine -- the Urban Institute, which is a left-leaning institute, scored it as costing $32 trillion over 10 years.  That's $2.5 trillion in the first year.</p><p>Right now, the total we raise from all of our income taxes is $1.5 trillion.  So Congressman O'Rourke's plan would require tripling your taxes.  He said you could do it with five points on the corporate rate.  That doesn't even pass elementary school math. </p><p>We're talking about -- and by the way, his next answer likely will be tax the rich.  Well, let me tell you something.  If you took every person in America making $1 million or more, and you took 100 percent of their income, it would pay for five months of Congressman O'Rourke's socialized medicine.  We can't afford those taxes.</p><p>And third, he wants to put everyone who hasn't paid into Medicare on Medicare.  That would bankrupt Medicare.  It would hurt seniors.  Seniors have paid into Medicare.  They rely on it.  And putting 200 million people, including illegal immigrants...</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, time.</p><p>CRUZ:  ... on it, could bankrupt Medicare.</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator Cruz, that's your time.  Mr. O'Rourke, if elected, in your 60 seconds rebuttal, how do you get that passed?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Look, all you've heard from Senator Cruz is what we should be afraid of.  It's a campaign based on fear.  It's the same person who shut down the government of the United States of America for 16 days perhaps because he thought too many people had too much health care, has voted to take away health care from millions of American families, and vows to repeal protections for pre-existing conditions. </p><p>I want people to have more health care.  I want people to be well enough to finish their education, to go to school.  I want to bring people of Texas together, Republicans and Democrats alike, from all parts of this state, to make sure that we lead on an issue that we understand better than anyone else.</p><p>In a state where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system, in a state where people are dying of the flu and diabetes, in the wealthiest and most powerful country in the year 2018, surely we can do better.  And I've laid out some steps that would allow us to do that, beginning with expanding Medicaid, introducing Medicare as an option on the exchanges, and in describing the goal that we want to get to and ensuring that Republicans and Democrats...</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  ... alike come to the table to work on that.</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that is your time.  Senator Cruz, there's a lot of concern in Texas and all over the country about President Trump increasing the tariffs.  Toyota says Tundra trucks produced right here in San Antonio will increase in cost by $3,000 next year because of rising tariffs on auto parts.  Two nights ago on \"60 Minutes\", President Trump did not rule out increasing tariffs again.</p><p>So the question is, do you believe tariffs threaten Texas growth?  And if so, is it time for the Senate to step in and stop it?</p><p>CRUZ:  I'm against tariffs.  I'm against a trade war.</p><p>WHITELY:  Is it time for the Senate to step in and stop it?</p><p>CRUZ:  Let me answer the question.  I'm against tariffs.  I'm against a trade war.  I have made the case repeatedly to President Trump that in trade we should be expanding our access to foreign markets.  We should be expanding the ability of Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and energy to export our goods and services.</p><p>If we are reducing the barriers, whether it is to Mexico or Canada or China or anywhere else so we're selling more, that's a good thing.  If we're erecting barriers and shutting down trade, that is a bad thing.</p><p>This is one of the few issues on which Congressman O'Rourke and I have some common ground, in that we've both spoken out in favor of trade.  The difference is that I'm able to work with President Trump and make my case to President Trump, and we have seen -- we have seen, for example, the president has negotiated a new NAFTA, a new trade deal, that has benefits that should benefit the state of Texas, that should benefit San Antonio. </p><p>Congressman O'Rourke is not able to work with President Trump.  And indeed, Congressman O'Rourke is the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who has explicitly come out for impeaching President Trump.  That is extreme, and it means if Congressman O'Rourke has his way -- you know, he mentioned a shutdown -- you want to talk about a shutdown?  With Congressman O'Rourke leading the way, two years of a partisan circus shutting down the federal government in a witch hunt on the president, that's not good for the state of Texas.  It's not good for our country.</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time.  Ninety second response from you, Mr. O'Rourke.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus after your last six years in the U.S. Senate.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Listen, if you have this special relationship with President Trump, then where is the result of that?  You were all talk and no action.  The tariffs that the president has levied, the trade wars that he has entered this country into is hurting no state more than it's hurting Texas, our farmers, our ranchers, our producers, our manufacturers, and our exporters.</p><p>Right here in San Antonio, at the Toyota plant, where Amy and I bought our Tundra and met the folks who made it, yes, we have problems with other countries around the world, China dumping aluminum and steel, manipulating their currency -- and I want to make sure that we stand up to China -- but when have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without any allies?  And that's exactly what the president, with Senator Cruz's help, would have us do.</p><p>We've alienated the European Union.  We've alienated Canada and Mexico.  We've alienated all other potential partners, and we're going it alone against China, and it is not working.  Just listen to the farmers.  And I know you haven't had the chance to visit every county, but I have.  And I've listened to them, and they are hurting.  And the anxiety and the uncertainty of not knowing when these trade wars will end or the certainty of knowing that when those trade wars do end, those buyers in those other countries will find other people from whom to have bought from, and they will no longer be coming to Texas to buy what we grow, what we raise, what we export, and what we manufacture.</p><p>We need a senator who will work with the president when we can...</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  ... and stand up to him where we must.  And on these tariffs, we must stand up to him.</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time.  Senator Cruz, 60 seconds for rebuttal.  But I want to ask again, should the Senate step in and stop this?</p><p>CRUZ:  I think we should keep working with the president, which is what we have been doing.  But, you know, Congressman O'Rourke just -- just asked an interesting question.  He said, where are the results?</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke and I were both elected to Congress on the same day six years ago, November of 2012.  We've served exactly the same length of time in Congress.  In those six years, I have authored and passed 34 separate pieces of legislation, major victories for the American people.</p><p>But he asked where are the results.  I'll point to one front-and-center, which is the historic tax cut that I spend thousands of hours bringing senators together, getting passed.  And he -- where are the results?  The state of Texas is booming.  We've got right now the lowest unemployment in 49 years.  African-American employment is the lowest that's ever been recorded.  Hispanic employment is the lowest that's ever been recorded.  Youth employment is the lowest in 52 years.</p><p>Texas is seeing the benefits of low taxes and low regulations.  And Congressman O'Rourke's position is always, always, always in favor of higher taxes.  He said in response to how he'd pay for socialized medicine...</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>CRUZ:  ... higher taxes.  That's not good for Texas.</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>FORGANY:  Senator, thank you very much.  Representative O'Rourke, you supported $15 billion to help victims of Hurricane Harvey, but two weeks after that, you voted against a bill that would have also given them tax relief.  What do you tell those victims who are still struggling financially today, one year later?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  I've been with many of those who were affected by Harvey.  In the immediate aftermath, going to places like Rockport or Port Aransas, Houston, Beaumont, Port Arthur, and continuing to come back again and again to see what we can do to be helpful.  I've voted for more than $136 billion in aid to support those communities who've been hit by natural disasters, including Harvey.</p><p>And in the specific bill that you asked about, the tax relief was not as great as we have seen for those who've been through other natural disasters.  I thought we could get a better deal.  But I am there for those communities each and every single day.  I continue to go back to places like Kashmere Gardens in Houston, Texas, which more than a year later is still not fully rebuilt, and I continue to wonder why Senator Cruz voted against more than $12 billion in FEMA preparedness, knowing full well that we will see more Harveys going forward.</p><p>Mind you, that was the third 500-year flood in just the last five years.  We know that there will be more of these floods coming.  And I want to make sure that the people of Texas, especially southeast Texas, are prepared for the next one.  That $12 billion also included hundreds of millions of dollars in support for volunteer fire departments, like the one that I visited in Rockport, where of those 20 volunteer firefighters, more than half lost all of their worldly possessions and were sleeping on the floor and in the firehouse as they responded to the emergencies in their communities.</p><p>So, yes, I will be there.  I will work with anyone, anytime, anywhere to make sure that those Texans who need the help to rebuild get it and that we invest in their ability to be resilient for the next storm.</p><p>FORGANY:  Congressman, that's your time.  Thank you.  Senator Cruz, you have 90 seconds to respond to that.</p><p>CRUZ:  Houston's my home town.  Hurricane Harvey hit Texas unlike any disaster we've ever seen.  It was devastating.  I was home with Heidi and my girls during the hurricane, and for months thereafter spent time in virtually every community along the Gulf Coast, two, three, four, five times, working with the state and local officials.</p><p>I mentioned earlier 171 sheriffs have endorsed my campaign, including 10 Democrats.  One of the reasons why the overwhelming majority of elected sheriffs have endorsed my campaign is because many of those sheriffs I worked with hand in hand after Harvey. </p><p>In the Senate, I helped lead the effort to pass three major disaster relief bills, working hand in hand with John Cornyn, where we improved and expanded those disaster relief bills.  And the emergency tax relief that you just referenced was legislation that I authored.  I authored, introduced, passed into law, did it jointly with John Cornyn and Marco Rubio.  The Cruz-Cornyn-Rubio emergency tax relief gave over $5 billion in emergency tax relief for families impacted by Hurricane Harvey.  It passed both houses of Congress overwhelmingly, was signed into law, provided immediate relief for those impacted by Harvey.</p><p>Only four Texas Democrats voted no on that legislation.  One of them was Congressman O'Rourke, the congressman from El Paso.  And there was a reason for that.  You know, he gave an answer now.  He said that it didn't provide enough tax relief.  That's not what he said at the time he voted no.  At the time he voted no, he said the reason he voted no is that he wanted -- he wanted to focus on...</p><p>FORGANY:  That's your time, Senator...</p><p>CRUZ:  ... illegal immigrants instead of hurricane relief.</p><p>FORGANY:  That's your time.  Thank you.</p><p>CRUZ:  That was his answer at the time.  And that doesn't -- so...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORGANY:  Representative O'Rourke -- thank you, Senator -- Representative, you get 60 seconds for a rebuttal.  Do you regret that vote?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  I don't.  I will always see what I can do, work with anyone, anytime, anywhere to do better for Texas.  And that was what I was trying to do.</p><p>But, you know, Senator Cruz mentioned listening to and working with local leaders in Houston.  I've listened to and worked with the mayor and the county judge, a Democrat and a Republican, each of whom is still waiting for $1.1 billion awarded to the local governments in community development block grant funding that has still not made its way into the neighborhoods, into the streets, into the homes, into the businesses to rebuild.</p><p>They need a full-time senator, not somebody running for president who's going to focus on their needs and make sure that that money gets there.  They need a full-time senator who would have been at bat for them before the storm on infrastructure projects that they had identified needed funding, but they needed a senator who was going to work for them.</p><p>Army Corps of Engineers approved projects totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars who did not have an advocate because he wasn't in Texas.  He wasn't in Houston.  He was in Iowa.  He was in New Hampshire.  He was running for another office instead of taking care of the concerns and the needs of the people of Texas.</p><p>FORGANY:  Representative, thank you very much.</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator Cruz, a year ago this week, October 18, 2017, you tweeted out the following statement.  When it comes to the deficit and debt, it is immoral the debt we have, we have to turn it around, you wrote.  Yet two months later, last December, as you just mentioned a moment ago, you voted for the Republican tax plan that the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congressional Budget Office, and many other nonpartisans say will add more than $1 trillion to the deficit.  Some people see the tweet and the vote as hypothetical.  Are they not?</p><p>CRUZ:  They are not remotely.  I'm proud to have supported the tax cut.  The tax cut is producing enormous benefits for the state of Texas and for the country.  We're seeing record growth.  We're seeing record low unemployment.  It's benefiting -- 4 million new jobs in the last two years.</p><p>And, by the way, one thing that Democrats never seem to understand, if you want to pay down deficit and debt -- and I care passionately about the deficit and debt -- it is immoral the deficit and debt we've racked up -- if you want to do it, the only force strong enough to do that is economic growth. </p><p>Now, let's go back to a little history.  In the 1960s, John F.  Kennedy, a Democrat, campaigned on tax cuts, cutting individual tax cuts and the corporate tax rate.  He said a rising tide will lift all boats.  He passed it and the economy boomed and federal tax revenue went up.</p><p>In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan campaigned on cutting taxes to get the economy growing.  He passed it.  The economy boomed and federal tax revenues went up.</p><p>We did the same thing this time.  This time, with this tax cut, we're seeing the results.  And today, to date, federal tax revenues have gone up. </p><p>WHITELY:  Senator...</p><p>CRUZ:  Federal tax revenues are higher this year than they were last year, without the tax cut.</p><p>WHITELY:  Respectfully, Senator, I was with you in Iowa.  I've heard you on the campaign trail since 2012 saying how bad the deficit is.</p><p>CRUZ:  Yes.</p><p>WHITELY:  And this vote would add to the deficit, though.</p><p>CRUZ:  Jason, no, it wouldn't.  That projection is wrong.  By the way, that projection also would have said that the Kennedy tax cuts would have added to the deficit and that the Reagan tax cuts would have added to the deficit.  The reason we have deficit and debt is not that we cut taxes and spurred the economy.  The reason we have deficit and debt is because Congress keeps spending.</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that was your time, sir.</p><p>CRUZ:  That's why we need to pass term limits.  It's why we need to pass a balanced budget amendment.  We need to stop the out-of-control spending...</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time.</p><p>CRUZ:  ... things like socialized medicine...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WHITELY:  Ninety second response, Congressman O'Rourke.  Ninety second response.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Speaking of balancing budgets, only one of us has with good friends in El Paso started a small business, met that payroll every week, balanced the books, make sure that we delivered for our clients.  Only one of us has served at the local government level, every single year balancing the budget, seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats, but as councilmembers entrusted with the fiduciary responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers of El Paso, every single year we did.</p><p>And for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of $21 trillion in debt, when we're on track to deficit spend to the tune of a trillion dollars a year, he voted to add $2 trillion.  And those tax cuts disproportionately will flow to corporations, who are already sitting on record piles of cash, and the already wealthy in a country that is riven with income inequality unseen since the last Gilded Age.</p><p>Why?  In the days just before and just after that vote, Senator Cruz accepted $120,000 from the political action committees who represent the corporate interests that benefited from this tax cut.  Why does he vote for this? </p><p>Why does he vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without your consent?  Why does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses 30,000 people to gun violence every year?  Follow the money.</p><p>In each of these cases, if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz, it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupted Congress has become.</p><p>I don't take PAC money.  Not a dime.  I always and only represent the people of Texas.</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that is your time.  Congressman, that is your time.  Senator Cruz, 60 second rebuttal.</p><p>CRUZ:  You know, Congressman O'Rourke is fond of saying he doesn't take PAC money, but the truth is different.  For example, the J Street PAC, which is a rabidly anti-Israel PAC, has raised over $160,000 for Congressman O'Rourke because of his many votes against the nation of Israel.</p><p>Another example, he has a super PAC based up in Dallas that has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars of spending them on ads attacking me and my family.  So when he say he doesn't take PAC money, he just lets others do it for him.</p><p>But let me say more fundamentally, the reason people care about this is they care about who you're fighting for.  Consistently, if you look at Congressman O'Rourke's record, every time there is a choice between left-wing national activists and the people of Texas, he goes with the left-wing national activists and he goes with the left-wing national donors.</p><p>For example, we were talking earlier about his vote for a $10 a barrel tax on oil.  That is a great vote if you're raising money in San Francisco.  It's a terrible vote if you actually care about jobs in the state of Texas...</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time.  We want to keep this debate on track here.  Let me ask you the next question, though, Senator.  Weber Shandwick did a poll this year with almost 70 percent of Americans saying civility is a major problem in America. </p><p>CRUZ:  Yeah.</p><p>WHITELY:  And let's talk about the tone of this campaign and what's happened here in the last half-hour, 45 minutes.  We all watch as activists chased you and your wife, Heidi, out of the restaurant in D.C., and then, Senator, some say you couldn't even give a political-free compliment to your opponent in the first debate in Dallas.  So the question is, what responsibility do you have to bring civility and respect back to the country?</p><p>CRUZ:  Listen, Jason, I think every one of us has a responsibility to bring civility and respect.  That's something I've endeavored to do throughout politics, is to focus on substance, to focus on issues, to focus on record.  And so the personal attacks, the going to the gutter that is so common in politics, I try not to engage in.</p><p>If you look at my disagreements with Congressman O'Rourke, they haven't been personal attacks.  They've been his voting record in Congress that has been markedly out of step with the people of Texas. </p><p>You are right that there is a loss of civility, there is an anger, there is a rage on the far left that is really frightening.  You know, the images of...</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator...</p><p>CRUZ:  Hold on.  Let me answer -- don't interrupt me, Jason.  The images of -- of...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Whoa.</p><p>CRUZ:  ... a left-wing mob beating on the doors of the Supreme Court, that's not good for our country.  We can disagree while treating each other with respect, while treating each other with civility.  I think that's important to do.</p><p>We can discuss, are tax cuts good or is raising taxes good?  That's a discussion we ought to have.  But it shouldn't be personal.  It shouldn't go down to the gutter.  It should focus on actual substance.</p><p>And let me tell you, I think the lowest point we have seen is the confirmation hearings for Justice Kavanaugh, where we saw Senate Democrats be willing to smear Justice Kavanaugh and his family, be willing to repeat unsupported, uncorroborated allegations and go after him in way that -- that I thought was shameful. </p><p>It was important that that process be fair, that Dr. Ford get a full and fair opportunity to tell her story, that she be treated with respect, and she was.  But it was important...</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time.</p><p>CRUZ:  ... that he be treated with respect, as well, and he was not.</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time.  Congressman O'Rourke, 90 seconds for a response.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Every year, Allegany College presents an award for civility in American politics.  One of the first years, it was awarded to Senator John McCain and Vice President Biden.  Another year, it was awarded to the family of late Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  And last year, I was lucky enough, fortunate enough to receive that award, along with Will Hurd.</p><p>Our ability to travel across the country as a Republican and a Democrat in a car and Facebook livestream the whole thing, but then to get to work in Congress and join one another's legislation to do better for our constituents, regardless of the party differences that might otherwise stand between us, was recognized.</p><p>It's the same kind of approach that I take to just about everything that I do in Congress, everything that I do in life.  When we found out that veterans were unable to access mental health care services, that half a million veterans with bad paper discharges were denied the ability to go to the V.A., I worked with my colleague from Colorado, Mike Coffman, though he's a Republican and I'm a Democrat, we were able to bury the differences, compromise -- a four-letter word amongst some in Washington, D.C.  -- and find a consensus piece of legislation that passed the House of Representatives 435-0, passed the Senate, as well, and was signed into law by President Donald J.  Trump.</p><p>Now, President Trump is someone with whom I don't agree on everything.  But where we could make things better for those veterans, we did it.  We buried the differences and we put them aside, and we put this country's interests before us.  That's the kind of leadership that we need from Texas going forward.  That's the kind of leadership this country deserves.</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time.  That is your time.  Mr. Cruz, in your 60 second rebuttal, I was going to ask you, doesn't the inflammatory rhetoric just exacerbate the situation?</p><p>CRUZ:  Absolutely.  And I think we should focus on substance and not inflammatory rhetoric.</p><p>You know, I will say, it was striking at this press conference in D.C.  about civility, Congressman O'Rourke again repeated his call for impeaching President Trump.  That's the very essence of not civility.</p><p>If we had impeachment next year, we'd see utter chaos.  We would see an end to the repeal of the job-killing regulations that's fueling our economic growth.  We would see an end to many -- much of the progress we've seen rebuilding our military, making progress on foreign policy.  Washington would be consumed by partisan investigations.  That's not civility.</p><p>Let me point out more broadly, it's interesting that Congressman O'Rourke points to a bill that another congressman wrote that he was a co-sponsor of.  There's a reason for that.  Have you noticed in his campaign, have you noticed in this debate he doesn't talk about what he has accomplished in Congress?  Because he has scored political points rather than accomplishing victories for the people of Texas.</p><p>We've already talked about emergency tax relief in the wake of Harvey that I authored, passed into law.  That was bipartisan.  We had -- we had Democrats and Republicans...</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>CRUZ:  That was good for Texas.</p><p>WHITELY:  That is your time.</p><p>FORGANY:  Gentlemen, you know, when it comes to the \"Me, Too\" movement, the president said it is a very scary time for young men.  Congressman, you're raising sons.  What do you tell them?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  I'm raising two sons and a daughter.  And I tell each of them that it's critically important that they are treated with respect and that they demand them from everyone in their life and that they treat one another and everyone in their life with respect.</p><p>I'm very grateful for the leadership that we have seen across this country, in positions of public trust in Congress and people at the neighborhood level, meeting the challenge of this moment.  Congress members like Jackie Speier from California, who authored legislation that I co-sponsored that ensures that members of Congress are held to a higher standard, that there's true transparency in their conduct and there's not the ability to cover up, and there's the important training to make sure that everyone in their offices and their lives is treated with respect and a dignity that they deserve.</p><p>I also support the Violence Against Women's Act that makes sure that we have the resources and the training and the funding to protect the lives of the women in our lives, and in this state and throughout country.  Inexplicably, or maybe he'll have an explanation, Senator Cruz voted against the Violence Against Women's Act. </p><p>We have to make sure that we're more than just talk.  We have to have actions that follow this up.  We've got to make sure that, for example, when we're talking about women, we're talking about equal pay for equal work.  When we're talking about women, we talk about ensuring that they can make their own decisions about their own bodies and have access to the health care that allows them to do that.</p><p>It means that our rhetoric has to be followed by our actions.  And in Senator Cruz, we don't have that today. </p><p>FORGANY:  Congressman, thank you.  In response, Senator, what do you tell your daughters?</p><p>CRUZ:  I think the \"Me, Too\" movement has done an incredible amount of good for our country.  Sexual assault is wrong.  Sexual harassment is wrong.  And we've seen in recent months powerful men in Hollywood, powerful men in politics, powerful men in journalism, powerful men in business called to account for abominable behavior.  I believe everyone, men and women, girls and boys, need to be protected, need to be treated with dignity.</p><p>And as you noted, I am the father of two girls.  I want them -- their rights to be protected.  I want them to be valued. </p><p>I'm also the son of my mom, who graduated from Rice in 1956, went to work at Shell as a computer programmer.  She was a professional.  Women in the 1950s faced a very difficult climate.  My wife, Heidi, my best friend in the world, works in the financial sector, again, always a difficult client -- climate.  We need to protect everyone's rights. </p><p>And let me tell you, when it comes to stopping sexual assault and when it comes to dealing with those who commit them, before I was in the Senate, I was the solicitor general of Texas, the chief lawyer for the state in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.  I handled over and over and over again cases dealing with rapists, dealing with those who'd committed sexual assault, dealing with child predators.  And it has been a passion of mine.</p><p>And Congressman O'Rourke mentioned sexual harassment in Congress.  Well, I joined with New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand.  The two of us were the lead authors on legislation to stop the indefensible practice of secret taxpayer settlements for members of Congress who were harassing their staff.  There should be no secret settlements.  That should be public.</p><p>FORGANY:  That's your time, Senator.</p><p>CRUZ:  And it's important that there be accountability.</p><p>FORGANY:  Thank you.  Congressman, you get 60 seconds for rebuttal.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Listen, I pointed out two specific opportunities for Senator Cruz to do the right thing, one of them being the Violence Against Women Act.  Didn't hear a good reason why he failed to support that.</p><p>Look, you've got somebody -- as I mentioned earlier -- who is all talk and no action.  You've got somebody who left the state of Texas within a year of being elected to represent all of us to run for another office.  Hasn't been to all the counties of Texas, but has been to all 99 of Iowa.  Has missed a quarter of the votes in 2015, missed half of them in 2016.</p><p>There's only one other senator from either party over the last 25 years who has a worse -- who has a worse record on bipartisanship.  In other words, Ted Cruz has a harder time working with members across the aisle than almost anyone else to get anything done.</p><p>So if he's not showing up in Texas, if he's not showing up in D.C.  to vote, who is he showing up for?</p><p>I want to make sure that whether it is women -- and the issue that you just asked about now -- or any other priority that we have in the state...</p><p>FORGANY:  Congressman, that's your time.</p><p>WHITELY:  ... we have a senator who shows up every single day for every single one of us.</p><p>FORGANY:  That's your time.  Thank you.</p><p>WHITELY:  Gentlemen, let's move on to something different here, too.  We have 60 seconds for each of you.  We want you to tell us something you've done in the last year that has nothing to do with politics that would give Texans insight to who you are as a person.  Senator Cruz, you first.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CRUZ:  Look, I will say the hardest thing about being in this job is being a dad.  My girls are here.  At the last -- last debate, Congressman O'Rourke and I talked about that.  Both of us are dads of young kids.  And it is tough.  It is tough.</p><p>Our girls are 7 and 10.  Monday morning leaving is really hard.  You know, last year, I was -- helped coach Caroline's girl's basketball team, the fourth grade basketball team.  The basketball practices were Sunday afternoons, so I was able to be at the practices.</p><p>As Caroline will point out many times, in the course of the whole season, I made it to one game.  That's not OK with her.  By the way, one of the games that I thought I was going to make it to was going to be a Friday night game.  I was planning to come back.  It was the night of the vote on the tax cut.</p><p>And so I was in the Senate, and I had to call home and say, Caroline, I'm sorry, I've got to be here to vote on this.  Let me tell you, for a fourth grader, the fact that you're voting to cut taxes is not an explanation for why daddy is not at the game.</p><p>That's really a hard thing.  You know, being a dad -- I mean, part of what we do, we call on Facetime and we try to -- we try to carve out every...</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator...</p><p>CRUZ:  ... Sunday for the family, but that is hard.  And I take being a dad really seriously.</p><p>WHITELY:  Senator, thank you for sharing.  As well to Congressman O'Rourke, 60 seconds.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  You know, I think much of what Senator Cruz just said resonates with me.  We've spent the better part of the last 21 months on the road campaigning in every single county of Texas.  Don't get to see my kids as much as I want to.  I know that Amy takes on the lion's share of the burden, with a child that's just entered sixth grade, another who's in fifth, and Henry, who's in second. </p><p>Every now and then, we get down in the basement where I have a drum kit that ostensibly was purchased for Henry, but really was for me...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... a PA and an amplifier, and me and the kids will rock out.  And Amy allows us to do that for a little while.  We go to Ulysses' travel baseball tournaments.  That last one was in Las Cruces.  I've had them in Alamogordo, as well. </p><p>Just went with Molly, who is nursing back to life a blind squirrel that was picked up in East Texas, dropped off in El Paso at a wildlife animal rescue run by Ms. Julie, got to meet this blind squirrel who's slowly regaining its sight. </p><p>You know, Henry, one of the best parts of my day is when I am at home, getting to walk him to school and just talking about what he dreamed about the night before and what he's into this day.</p><p>So with very little time outside of the campaign or my official job, I spend it with my family.</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, thank you for sharing, as well, too.</p><p>We've asked you both a lot of questions tonight.  Now we want to let you guys address Texas voters directly.  You both get two minutes for closing statements here.  As we mentioned early on, a flip of the coin gives you the final word tonight, Senator Cruz. </p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, you're up first.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Listen, I just want to thank you each for moderating this debate, everyone who has been here to witness it, and all of those who've made this campaign in the election of our lifetime possible.</p><p>I was talking to Amy tonight about this moment that stayed with me after I first met Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.  He's meeting with members of the Armed Services Committee, and he reminded us that the United States historically has enjoyed two principal powers that distinguish us from the rest of the world.  One is the power of intimidation, to feel the most awesome military force the world has ever known.</p><p>The other -- and he thought maybe the greater power -- is the power of inspiration, to continue to be the indispensable nation that lives up to the promise and the potential of our founders, a nation that not just Americans look up to, but the world looks up to.</p><p>And whether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now.  Walls, Muslim bans, the press as the enemy of the people, taking kids away from their parents after they've survived a horrifying 2,000-mile journey seeking asylum here in this country, the bitterness, the partisanship, the pettiness, the dishonesty that defines so much of the national conversation, we are in desperate need right now of inspiration.</p><p>But I'll tell you what.  Traveling the state of Texas, meeting people regardless of their walk of life, their background, their party affiliation, you have inspired me, you've inspired me to transcend the obstacles, to be the big, courageous, bold, strong match for this moment.</p><p>On any issue that challenges us, in Texas, where nearly half of the schoolteachers work a second job just to make ends meet, making sure that we're there for them, pay them a living wage, and ensure that they can teach to the child, not the test; in this state of immigrants, making sure that we lead the national conversation, free Dreamers from any fear of deportation; and the least insured state in the country could take the lead on guaranteed, high-quality universal health care.</p><p>You have inspired me in this race.</p><p>WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  And I'm grateful to have the chance to represent you.  Thank you.</p><p>WHITELY:  That is your time, Congressman.  Senator Cruz, two minutes.</p><p>CRUZ:  The classic question in politics.  Are you better off now than you were two years ago?  Is Texas?  Elections are about choices.  Do we continue on the path we're on or do we turn back? </p><p>The records of Congressman O'Rourke and myself could not be more different.  On taxes, I want to cut your taxes.  Congressman O'Rourke wants to raise them.  On job killing regulations, I want to repeal them.  Congressman O'Rourke wants to increase them.  On Obamacare, I want to repeal Obamacare, reduce premiums, protect pre-existing conditions, and expand access.  Congressman O'Rourke wants socialized medicine, the federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor, which among other things would threaten to bankrupt Medicare.</p><p>I want to keep the economic boom we're experiencing right now going, moving forward.  Congressman O'Rourke wants the next two years to be drawn into the partisan circus of impeachment proceedings against President Trump.</p><p>Elections are about who we are.  Do we choose fear or do we choose hope?  I believe in hope.  My mom was the first one in her family to go to college, and she was a pioneer professional woman.  My dad came from Cuba with nothing, washed dishes making 50 cents an hour, came here seeking the American dream.</p><p>If someone had approached my dad in 1957 and said 50 years hence your son will be a U.S. senator representing the state of Texas, that teenage immigrant could never have believed it.  And yet as I stood on the Senate floor with my hand on my dad's bible, there was my father in the gallery, tears running down his eyes.  Only in America.</p><p>This is a choice about keeping the boom going, keeping -- we have the lowest Hispanic unemployment ever recorded, the lowest African-American unemployment ever recorded.  Why would we want to screw that up?  We need to defend jobs, defend the Constitution, and secure our borders. </p><p>WHITELY:  Senator Cruz, that is your time.  That is your time, sir.  We appreciate it.</p><p>Mr. Cruz, Mr. O'Rourke, thank you for sharing tonight.  We appreciate that. </p><p>FORGANY:  Thank you very much.</p><p>WHITELY:  Quick reminder.  Our social media response team in Dallas is still...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WHITELY:  (OFF-MIKE) reminder to our viewers, as well (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-581449</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5THF-BXW1-DY7X-Y0M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11066\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Federal News Service, Inc.

Thank you for joining us tonight. I'm Sarah Forgany, news anchor at KENS 5 in San Antonio.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JASON WHITELY, POLITICAL REPORTER, WFAA</emphasis>:  And I'm Jason Whitely, political reporter and host of \"Inside Texas Politics\" at WFAA in Dallas-Fort Worth. We welcome all our viewers from across the state watching this debate live tonight in all corners of Texas. So let's get right to it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Both campaigns have agreed to these rules tonight. For each question, the candidate will get 90 seconds to answer, his opponent will have 90 seconds for a response, and we will turn back for a final rebuttal of 60 seconds.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Let's first, though, turn to Dallas, to our Victory Park studios where we have a social media response team there. So as you watch this debate on television with us tonight, joining the conversation online using the hashtag #TexasDebate.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  And we also have a live audience with us here tonight in the studio, so we ask you to please hold your applause during this debate, except for now, as we welcome the two candidates running for the United States Senate in Texas.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Good evening.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Please welcome <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Beto O'Rourke </nameText></person>here. Gentlemen, welcome tonight. Senator Cruz, you won the coin toss to have the final word tonight at the end of this program, so therefore we start with you, Congressman O'Rourke. Welcome to you.   </p><p>      Twenty one days away from election and there's still uncertainty about the security of our ballot boxes. And just yesterday, new cyber attacks again reported on election databases in several states. But misinformation online can be just as dangerous as so many people know. The question is, should Congress enact regulations on social media to protect voters from that misinformation?   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  First, Jason, let me thank you and Sarah for moderating tonight's debate, KENS 5 for hosting us, the people of San Antonio for being here, and the people of Texas for watching this and participating in one of the most important decisions of our lifetimes. Es una honor estar aqui con ustedes otra ves aqui en San Antonio.  </p><p>      Yes, the integrity of our ballot box. Two hundred and forty two years into this experiment, the American democracy, that is the exception, not the rule in world history, is sacred. And it's essential that we continue to protect it. It's under attack unlike any other time in this nation's past.   </p><p>      We know because the intelligence community has reached a unanimous conclusion on this, that the Russian government sought to undermine our democracy. In fact, President Trump's own administration announced the indictment of 12 Russian nationals who compromised the voter data of more than half a million of our fellow Americans. And we know they will attack us again in this election and the next unless we stand up to them now.   </p><p>      So, yes, let's protect the integrity of our ballot box, which is why I'm a little surprised that Senator Cruz has voted against the funding to protect access to the ballot box and to ensure that your vote goes to the candidate of your choice.  </p><p>      And, yes, we must also ensure that on social media, where so many of us now have become the product on Twitter, on Facebook, that we are not manipulated and that opinions that we hold are not shaped by those from other countries.   </p><p>      So I want to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, work with this administration, to make sure that we do that and every single voter can make an informed decision based on accurate information.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that is your time. Ninety second response, Mr. Cruz.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Of course we should do more to protect the integrity of elections. And I'm proud to have supported, number one, funding from the federal government to the states to help secure our elections, but number two, just a week ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed legislation that I co-sponsored called the DETER Act that would punish anyone that comes to this country with the purpose of undermining elections. We need to make sure our elections are safe and secure.   </p><p>      Now, your question was, should Congress be regulating social media companies and what they allow to be said. I believe in the First Amendment. I don't believe Congress should be in the business of regulating conduct, because I don't think it's government's job to regulating content, rather, online.  </p><p>      That being said, I am very concerned -- and I know there are millions of Texans who are concerned, about the political bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google, skewing and silencing the voices of those who politically they disagree with. You may remember several months ago Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, testified before the Senate, and I asked him a series of vigorous questions about the political bias at Facebook.  </p><p>      Now, even though Congress shouldn't regulate the content, there are two things we should think about doing. Number one, right now, big tech enjoys an immunity from liability on the assumption that they would be neutral and fair. If they're not going to be neutral and fair, if they're going to be biased, we should repeal the immunity from liability so they should be liable like the rest of us.  </p><p>      Number two, the giant tech companies, by any measure of bigger than AT&amp;T was when it was broken up under the antitrust laws, bigger than Standard Oil, and if they're abusing market powers and monopoly, the antitrust laws should be enforced.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that is your time. Congressman, to be clear, he said that, yes, we should enact -- Congress should enact regulations on social media. Yes or no, in the remaining 60 second rebuttal here for you, yes or no for regulations on social media?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Yes, I think we can have thoughtful regulations that ensure that we're making informed decisions based on facts and the truth, and we're not being manipulated by foreign powers. But it's interesting that <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>invested more than $5 million in Cambridge Analytica, which is the very company that helped to undermine our democracy, to feed false news and false opinions to our fellow Americans to manipulate the world's greatest democracy, $5 million from <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>that funded Cambridge Analytica.  </p><p>      He voted against supporting and safeguarding the integrity of our ballot box. And our junior senator will not stand up to President Trump, someone who apologizes for Russia, defends that country, Vladimir Putin, the leader of the country that sought to undermine our democracy. He won't stand up against him and he won't stand up for us to make sure that our elections are free and fair, that your vote goes to the intended candidate.  </p><p>      This is beyond party politics. This is getting -- this is getting our democracy back our track. And we need a senator from Texas who will do that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that is your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Senator Cruz, Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in 11 days ago. The U.S. Supreme Court now has five justices who have either directly stated or suggested that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. Should we prepare for changes to abortion law in this country?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Well, listen, I believe that every human life is a gift from God, is a precious gift from God and it should be protected. It should be protected and cherished. I'm pro-life.   </p><p>      And now the question of what will happen at the Supreme Court on Roe v. Wade or anything else, we'll have to see when cases are decided. Justice Kavanaugh, just like his predecessors, just like Justice Ginsburg, just like Justice Kagan, declined to answer those questions. And that's been the standard at the Supreme Court for many, many years.  </p><p>      I would note, though, on the question of life there is an enormous difference between me and Congressman O'Rourke. On the question of life, Congressman O'Rourke is at the extreme pro-abortion side. So he has repeatedly voted in favor of late-term abortions. He has repeatedly voted in favor of taxpayer funding for abortions. I've got to say, that's not consistent with the views of the people of Texas.  </p><p>      The people of Texas, and I will say especially the Hispanic community, we don't want to see taxpayer-funded, Medicaid funding abortions and late term abortions. I think that's extreme and that's disconnected.  </p><p>      And I will note, as well, on the question of judges, judges is a massive divide between Congressman O'Rourke and me. I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the court. Congressman O'Rourke would have voted against both of them. And he wants to see, like Hillary Clinton, promise to appoint left-wing judicial activists who impose their own policy preferences from the bench.  </p><p>      I don't think that's what the people of Texas want. We want judges...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Senator, that's your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  ... and justices who will follow the Constitution and follow the law.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  That's your time. Thank you. Congressman, you have 90 seconds for a response.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Senator Cruz has a very troubling record when it comes to judicial nominations and confirmations. He supported the nomination of a judge, Jeff Mateer, who described transgender children as part of Satan's plan, believes in conversion therapy. He supported the nomination of a judge -- someone to be a judge who'd never tried a case before, another potential judge who could not tell us whether Brown v. The Board of Education was correctly decided.  </p><p>      From our perspective, in a state where you can be fired for being gay, I want a justice who believes in civil rights. From the perspective of a state that ranks 50th in voter turnout in the country, not by accident, by design some people drawn out of their democracy, I want a justice who believes in voting rights.  </p><p>      And for a state that is at the epicenter of the maternal mortality crisis, as we made it harder and harder for women to get access to the health care that they need to get that cervical cancer screening, to see that family planning provider, to see a provider of any kind, we're losing them faster here than in almost any other state, almost any other developed country in the world.  </p><p>      I will only vote to confirm a Supreme Court justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body and who has the health care access to be able to do so.   </p><p>      We should be able -- and the next junior senator from the state of Texas -- to work with our colleagues, to work with the administration, to have justices who will rule in favor of people and our needs, not corporations, not special interests, not the political action committees. Those are some very significant needs that we have in Texas right now, not represented by Judge, now Justice Kavanaugh. And so...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Congressman...  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Yeah, this is a decision that I'm concerned about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  That's your time. Thank you. Senator, in your 60 second rebuttal, what should abortion law in Texas look like?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Well, you know, it's striking that Congressman O'Rourke didn't dispute his extreme record on abortion, supporting late-term abortions, supporting taxpayer funding for abortion, supporting taxpayer funding for abortions late term even for illegal aliens. That is an -- and he's voted for that. That is an extreme position, fewer than 9 percent of Texans agree with him.  </p><p>      He also didn't dispute that he opposed Justice Gorsuch, he opposed Justice Kavanaugh. And if you listen to what Congressman O'Rourke said, he said he wants justices that agree with his own left-wing policy views. That's not the job of the court.  </p><p>      The job of the court is to follow the law. If you want to change the law, you do it through elections. You do it -- the Constitution gives the power to the people, not five unelected lawyers in Washington. And let me note, the same judges that Congressman O'Rourke wants to see would also undermine the First Amendment, would undermine free speech, would undermine religious liberty, would undermine the Second Amendment.  </p><p>      Hillary Clinton promised to appoint justices who would undermine the Second Amendment. And Congressman O'Rourke enthusiastically supported her doing so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Senator, that's your time. Thank you very much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator Cruz, President Trump said on Sunday that something is changing in regards to the climate. You're clearly on record for years saying there's no evidence to just back that up, nothing exists yet to back that up. But major oil companies, including Texas-based ExxonMobil, says even on its website the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action. That's ExxonMobil's own words there.  </p><p>      So what do you tell Texas companies who think this really is a problem?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Well, listen, of course the climate is changing. The climate has been changing from the dawn of time. The climate will change as long as -- as we have a planet Earth.  </p><p>      I am the son of two mathematicians and computer programmers. I believe in science. I chair the Science and Space Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee. And indeed, in that capacity, I chaired a hearing looking on the science and data behind global warming. And we heard testimony, we heard actual science and data.  </p><p>      Far too many Democrats approach this issue not as a matter of science -- I think we should follow the science and follow the evidence -- but instead what they approach it as, as a matter of government power. They want the power to control the economy.  </p><p>      That has led, for example, Congressman O'Rourke to cast some votes that I think are really harmful to the people of Texas. For example, Congressman O'Rourke voted in favor of a $10 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state of Texas. That would have been absolutely devastating to the state of Texas. By the way, $10 a barrel, that works out to about 24 cents a gallon that every one of us would pay when you go fill up your car or truck. That would hurt the people of Texas.   </p><p>      And let me point out, look, a robust energy sector is good for all of Texas. There are millions of jobs that depend on a robust oil and gas sector. And Congressman O'Rourke's record voting against Texas oil and gas, voting against energy, that hurts the economy, it hurts jobs, it's not right for Texas.  </p><p>      And let me point out:  All of those oil and gas workers, they buy homes. They buy cars and trucks. They get health care. They give to churches and schools. And by the way, the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that's your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  ... get hundreds of millions of dollars from our energy sector...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  That's your time, Senator. Let's move on to a 90 second response from Mr. O'Rourke.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  This is what you can expect over the course of this debate. Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you. He's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever taken. He's dishonest. It's why the president called him lying Ted. And it's why the nickname stuck, because it's true.  </p><p>      Look, the climate is changing. And manmade climate change is a fact. Three hundred years after the enlightenment, we should be able to listen to the scientists and follow their advice and guidance. And they tell us that we still have time, but the window is closing to get this right. If we're going to make our commitment to the generations that follow and not just think about the next election or our political career or pursuit of the White House, then we can make the right decisions.  </p><p>      Now, we can support Texas being a proud energy leader in oil and in gas, but also in renewable energy. Today, Texas leads the country -- we're number one in the nation in the generation of renewable wind power. We're number five and moving up quick when it comes to solar. The two fastest-growing jobs in the United States of America today:  Wind and solar jobs. We can continue to grow this economy, we can reject the false choice between oil and gas and renewable energy, make sure that we produce and refine and transport and use our energy resources more responsibly.  </p><p>      And listen, this isn't one political party saying this. This is people of both parties in every single county in Texas that we've had the chance to listen to people. These are folks who work in the energy industry. Amy and I were in Iraan, Texas, listening to those who work in some of these fracking operations. What they want is predictability and consistency in the regulations, and then they will perform to them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that's your time. Mr. Cruz, 60 second rebuttal. The question is, does ExxonMobil have it wrong here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Well, it's clear Congressman O'Rourke's pollsters have told him to come out on the attack. So if he wants to insult me and call me a liar, that's fine. But, you know, John Adams famously said, Facts are stubborn things.  </p><p>      So if you want to see the vote he cast for a $10 a barrel tax on oil, go to our website. It's tedcruz.org. And we will put up the exact text of the vote and a link to Congressman O'Rourke's vote against the people of Texas.  </p><p>      Let me say, if you work in energy, if you work in oil and gas, Congressman O'Rourke's record on this is extreme. He didn't just vote for a $10 a barrel tax on oil. He's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking, aggressive regulations of exporting liquefied natural gas. He's a prominent supporter of President Obama's Paris climate deal, which would have killed thousands of jobs in the state of Texas.  </p><p>      That's not good for Texas. And it's an example of over and over again Congressman O'Rourke sides with liberal extremists on the national level, instead of the people of Texas, instead of jobs of Texas. And -- and -- and by the way...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that's your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  ... alternatives are great, too. Texas leads in energy across the board.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Representative, this question is about immigration policy. We know your position and passion for the Dreamers. And we know that you are adamantly against extending the existing border fence. This question here is specifically about border security.  </p><p>      If we don't need a border wall, can you please look at the people of Texas tonight and tell them what we do need?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I'd be happy to. And listen, I don't know if there's another person who has a greater stake in this issue than I do. Amy and I are raising Ulysses and Molly and Henry in El Paso, Texas, one-half of the largest binational community on the border, the defining border community.  </p><p>      We care about our kids' safety. I care about the safety of those that I represent in Congress. I care about the safety of every single person in the state of Texas. El Paso, in fact, is one of, if not the safest cities in the United States of America. It's because we have world-class law enforcement, police and sheriff's deputies, but it's also because we are a city of immigrants.  </p><p>      A quarter of those that I represent were born in a country -- another country, chose us, came here to this country, and by their very presence made it better. No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns. But...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  But, Congressman...  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... smart policy will. And let me describe one of those to you. Senator John Cornyn and I, though he's a Republican and I'm a Democrat, he's in the Senate and I'm in the House, worked on policy together to invest in our ports of entry. That's where more than 90 percent of everyone and everything that ever comes into the United States first crosses. Having a better idea of who and what comes into our country demonstrably makes us safer.   </p><p>      And at the same time, those customs officers are able to facilitate legitimate trade and travel that's connected to more than a million jobs in the state of Texas. As we all know, here, the home of Toyota, trade is the lifeblood of the state of Texas. If we can make our communities more secure, as this bill did, and facilitate more job-growing trade, then we've really figured something out.  </p><p>      And I think that John Cornyn and I have been able to do it. Republicans...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  That's your time, Congressman.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... and Democrats working together on an issue that makes Texas better.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  That's your time. Thank you. Senator, you have 90 seconds to respond.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  So everyone should notice in his answer that he wanted to talk about trade, he wanted to talk about customs, he wanted to talk about everything expect border security. And let me say, there's no race in the country with a starker divide on immigration than this race here in the state of Texas.   </p><p>      As for me, I'm incredibly honored to have received the formal endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, the union of the men and women who risk their lives keeping our nation safe. I will note here at this debate, I'm very pleased we have Brandon Judd and Paul Perez, both from the National Border Patrol Council. The reason they're supporting me is I've led the fight to secure the border, building the wall, using technology, increasing boots on the ground. We can keep our communities safe.  </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke not only opposes a wall, but he has said we have too many fences and walls already on the border, he wants to tear downs the ones we have. And I'll note, he brought up El Paso. El Paso is right across from Juarez, one of the most dangerous cities in the world, 3,000 murders last year. There's a wall there. That wall is one of the tools you use to protect us.   </p><p>      But let me give you an example of just how extreme Congressman O'Rourke is on immigration. Kate's Law, commonsense legislation, overwhelming majority of Texans support it. I'm the author of Kate's Law in the Senate that says violent criminal illegal aliens, if they're deported repeatedly, should face a mandatory minimum prison sentence. Congressman O'Rourke has voted against Kate's Law. That's wrong. We need -- we should not be releasing violent criminals into our community.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Congressman, in your 60 second rebuttal, can you tell your specific plan to secure the border?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Well, as I just told you, Senator John Cornyn and I have worked to invest in our ports of entry. That means staffing of customs officers. That means infrastructure at our bridges that connect us with Mexico, where more than 90 percent of everyone and everything first crosses. And it means investment in the technology that ensures that we do a better, smarter job screening those who first come into this country. That will make us safer.  </p><p>      It also means that we support local law enforcement, those police officers and sheriff's deputies who keep this country safe. We can do that, as well. But listen, we cannot use this idea of border security to be an impediment to moving forward on those issues that are also demanding our action and which Texans know better than perhaps any other people of any other state.  </p><p>      On issues of immigration reform, the fate of Dreamers -- nearly 200,000 in the state of Texas -- when the Senate voted to move forward on debate for Dreamers, 98 senators showed up that day, 97 voted to move forward. Only one senator voted no, stood in the corner while everyone else was at the table. <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>has put his career above the interests and priorities of Texas.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that's your time.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>is for <person><nameText>Ted Cruz.  </nameText></person></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  That's your time. Thank you very much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Hold on a second. Let me -- let me respond to that, please, which is -- I noticed Congressman O'Rourke said we need to support law enforcement. I think that's striking that he says that now in a debate because his career has been one consistently of opposing law enforcement. Indeed, someone else who is here today is Detective Mike Helle, who leads the San Antonio Police Officers Association, and Detective Helle has endorsed me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  And I would note, as well, 171 elected Texas sheriffs...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you very much. We have to move on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Hold on. I get a 60 second response.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Look at his record -- look at his record...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  You have both agreed to...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  But we agreed we could have a 60 second...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  You have both agreed to these rules. We need to move on to the next topic.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  But we agreed -- we agreed on a 60 second rebuttal, if necessary. And I want to make a point on law enforcement.   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  That's not what you said when you established the rules at the outset.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  He already finished his rebuttal. We have to move on to the next topic.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Gentlemen, let's talk about health care now. What you're looking at for our television audience is a live picture of our Victory Park Studios in Dallas where that social media response team is listening to our viewers out there, too. The overwhelming conversation online we're hearing about is about health care, and one post asks you directly, Congressman O'Rourke, if universal health care is going to cost trillions of dollars, what do you cut from the federal budget or how much are you going to raise my taxes to pay for that?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Let's start with the goal. What is it that we're trying to achieve? I want to make sure that everyone can see a doctor, afford their prescription medications, take their child to a therapist, be well enough to live to their full potential over the course of their lifetime. And I want to make sure that working families pay less for health care costs than they do today.  </p><p>      So here are some steps that we could take to get to your answer. We could expand Medicaid. This is a state that left $100 billion on the table. OK, expand Medicaid. More working Texans are able to be well enough to go back to work, to be there for their families.  </p><p>      We could introduce Medicare as an option on the exchanges to drive down the increase in premium costs and expand selection and choice.   </p><p>      And then we could take the lead, as the state that is the least insured in the United States, who perhaps better understands the consequences of failing to be there, by and for one another, better than anyone else, on guaranteed, high-quality, universal health care. There are a number of ways to get there from Medicare for all to one where you use a mix of employer-based insurance and the ability for people to pay into Medicare.   </p><p>      That could come at a cost of around $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. If you look at the tax cut that Senator Cruz just voted for, $2 trillion added to $21 trillion in debt, the disproportionate benefit flowing to corporations and the very wealthiest, and move that corporate tax rate not to where it was, but maybe 5 points, from 21 to 26, you would generate the money necessary to pay for access to health care so that everyone lives to their full potential.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that's your time. Mr. Cruz, 90 seconds response.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  You know, I have to say, he really didn't want to answer the question of how to pay for it, so let me be clear what it would cost. Congressman O'Rourke is proposing socialized medicine, the federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor.  </p><p>      There are at least three big problems with that. Number one, every place on Earth that happens, you have rationing and waiting lists. If you look at the United Kingdom, if a senior needs to get a hip replacement, it takes about 90 days. In Canada, it takes about 200 days.   </p><p>      But number two, the cost would be immense. When Bernie Sanders rolled out this plan -- and Congressman O'Rourke supports the Bernie Sanders plan of socialized medicine -- the Urban Institute, which is a left-leaning institute, scored it as costing $32 trillion over 10 years. That's $2.5 trillion in the first year.  </p><p>      Right now, the total we raise from all of our income taxes is $1.5 trillion. So Congressman O'Rourke's plan would require tripling your taxes. He said you could do it with five points on the corporate rate. That doesn't even pass elementary school math.   </p><p>      We're talking about -- and by the way, his next answer likely will be tax the rich. Well, let me tell you something. If you took every person in America making $1 million or more, and you took 100 percent of their income, it would pay for five months of Congressman O'Rourke's socialized medicine. We can't afford those taxes.  </p><p>      And third, he wants to put everyone who hasn't paid into Medicare on Medicare. That would bankrupt Medicare. It would hurt seniors. Seniors have paid into Medicare. They rely on it. And putting 200 million people, including illegal immigrants...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  ... on it, could bankrupt Medicare.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator Cruz, that's your time. Mr. O'Rourke, if elected, in your 60 seconds rebuttal, how do you get that passed?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Look, all you've heard from Senator Cruz is what we should be afraid of. It's a campaign based on fear. It's the same person who shut down the government of the United States of America for 16 days perhaps because he thought too many people had too much health care, has voted to take away health care from millions of American families, and vows to repeal protections for pre-existing conditions.   </p><p>      I want people to have more health care. I want people to be well enough to finish their education, to go to school. I want to bring people of Texas together, Republicans and Democrats alike, from all parts of this state, to make sure that we lead on an issue that we understand better than anyone else.  </p><p>      In a state where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system, in a state where people are dying of the flu and diabetes, in the wealthiest and most powerful country in the year 2018, surely we can do better. And I've laid out some steps that would allow us to do that, beginning with expanding Medicaid, introducing Medicare as an option on the exchanges, and in describing the goal that we want to get to and ensuring that Republicans and Democrats...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that's your time.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... alike come to the table to work on that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that is your time. Senator Cruz, there's a lot of concern in Texas and all over the country about President Trump increasing the tariffs. Toyota says Tundra trucks produced right here in San Antonio will increase in cost by $3,000 next year because of rising tariffs on auto parts. Two nights ago on \"60 Minutes\", President Trump did not rule out increasing tariffs again.  </p><p>      So the question is, do you believe tariffs threaten Texas growth? And if so, is it time for the Senate to step in and stop it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  I'm against tariffs. I'm against a trade war.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Is it time for the Senate to step in and stop it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Let me answer the question. I'm against tariffs. I'm against a trade war. I have made the case repeatedly to President Trump that in trade we should be expanding our access to foreign markets. We should be expanding the ability of Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and energy to export our goods and services.  </p><p>      If we are reducing the barriers, whether it is to Mexico or Canada or China or anywhere else so we're selling more, that's a good thing. If we're erecting barriers and shutting down trade, that is a bad thing.  </p><p>      This is one of the few issues on which Congressman O'Rourke and I have some common ground, in that we've both spoken out in favor of trade. The difference is that I'm able to work with President Trump and make my case to President Trump, and we have seen -- we have seen, for example, the president has negotiated a new NAFTA, a new trade deal, that has benefits that should benefit the state of Texas, that should benefit San Antonio.   </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke is not able to work with President Trump. And indeed, Congressman O'Rourke is the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who has explicitly come out for impeaching President Trump. That is extreme, and it means if Congressman O'Rourke has his way -- you know, he mentioned a shutdown -- you want to talk about a shutdown? With Congressman O'Rourke leading the way, two years of a partisan circus shutting down the federal government in a witch hunt on the president, that's not good for the state of Texas. It's not good for our country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that is your time. Ninety second response from you, Mr. O'Rourke.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus after your last six years in the U.S. Senate.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Listen, if you have this special relationship with President Trump, then where is the result of that? You were all talk and no action. The tariffs that the president has levied, the trade wars that he has entered this country into is hurting no state more than it's hurting Texas, our farmers, our ranchers, our producers, our manufacturers, and our exporters.  </p><p>      Right here in San Antonio, at the Toyota plant, where Amy and I bought our Tundra and met the folks who made it, yes, we have problems with other countries around the world, China dumping aluminum and steel, manipulating their currency -- and I want to make sure that we stand up to China -- but when have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without any allies? And that's exactly what the president, with Senator Cruz's help, would have us do.  </p><p>      We've alienated the European Union. We've alienated Canada and Mexico. We've alienated all other potential partners, and we're going it alone against China, and it is not working. Just listen to the farmers. And I know you haven't had the chance to visit every county, but I have. And I've listened to them, and they are hurting. And the anxiety and the uncertainty of not knowing when these trade wars will end or the certainty of knowing that when those trade wars do end, those buyers in those other countries will find other people from whom to have bought from, and they will no longer be coming to Texas to buy what we grow, what we raise, what we export, and what we manufacture.  </p><p>      We need a senator who will work with the president when we can...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that's your time.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... and stand up to him where we must. And on these tariffs, we must stand up to him.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that's your time. Senator Cruz, 60 seconds for rebuttal. But I want to ask again, should the Senate step in and stop this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  I think we should keep working with the president, which is what we have been doing. But, you know, Congressman O'Rourke just -- just asked an interesting question. He said, where are the results?  </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke and I were both elected to Congress on the same day six years ago, November of 2012. We've served exactly the same length of time in Congress. In those six years, I have authored and passed 34 separate pieces of legislation, major victories for the American people.  </p><p>      But he asked where are the results. I'll point to one front-and-center, which is the historic tax cut that I spend thousands of hours bringing senators together, getting passed. And he -- where are the results? The state of Texas is booming. We've got right now the lowest unemployment in 49 years. African-American employment is the lowest that's ever been recorded. Hispanic employment is the lowest that's ever been recorded. Youth employment is the lowest in 52 years.  </p><p>Texas is seeing the benefits of low taxes and low regulations. And Congressman O'Rourke's position is always, always, always in favor of higher taxes. He said in response to how he'd pay for socialized medicine...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that's your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  ... higher taxes. That's not good for Texas.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that's your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you very much. Representative O'Rourke, you supported $15 billion to help victims of Hurricane Harvey, but two weeks after that, you voted against a bill that would have also given them tax relief. What do you tell those victims who are still struggling financially today, one year later?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I've been with many of those who were affected by Harvey. In the immediate aftermath, going to places like Rockport or Port Aransas, Houston, Beaumont, Port Arthur, and continuing to come back again and again to see what we can do to be helpful. I've voted for more than $136 billion in aid to support those communities who've been hit by natural disasters, including Harvey.  </p><p>      And in the specific bill that you asked about, the tax relief was not as great as we have seen for those who've been through other natural disasters. I thought we could get a better deal. But I am there for those communities each and every single day. I continue to go back to places like Kashmere Gardens in Houston, Texas, which more than a year later is still not fully rebuilt, and I continue to wonder why Senator Cruz voted against more than $12 billion in FEMA preparedness, knowing full well that we will see more Harveys going forward.  </p><p>      Mind you, that was the third 500-year flood in just the last five years. We know that there will be more of these floods coming. And I want to make sure that the people of Texas, especially southeast Texas, are prepared for the next one. That $12 billion also included hundreds of millions of dollars in support for volunteer fire departments, like the one that I visited in Rockport, where of those 20 volunteer firefighters, more than half lost all of their worldly possessions and were sleeping on the floor and in the firehouse as they responded to the emergencies in their communities.  </p><p>      So, yes, I will be there. I will work with anyone, anytime, anywhere to make sure that those Texans who need the help to rebuild get it and that we invest in their ability to be resilient for the next storm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that's your time. Thank you. Senator Cruz, you have 90 seconds to respond to that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Houston's my home town. Hurricane Harvey hit Texas unlike any disaster we've ever seen. It was devastating. I was home with Heidi and my girls during the hurricane, and for months thereafter spent time in virtually every community along the Gulf Coast, two, three, four, five times, working with the state and local officials.  </p><p>      I mentioned earlier 171 sheriffs have endorsed my campaign, including 10 Democrats. One of the reasons why the overwhelming majority of elected sheriffs have endorsed my campaign is because many of those sheriffs I worked with hand in hand after Harvey.   </p><p>      In the Senate, I helped lead the effort to pass three major disaster relief bills, working hand in hand with John Cornyn, where we improved and expanded those disaster relief bills. And the emergency tax relief that you just referenced was legislation that I authored. I authored, introduced, passed into law, did it jointly with John Cornyn and Marco Rubio. The Cruz-Cornyn-Rubio emergency tax relief gave over $5 billion in emergency tax relief for families impacted by Hurricane Harvey. It passed both houses of Congress overwhelmingly, was signed into law, provided immediate relief for those impacted by Harvey.  </p><p>      Only four Texas Democrats voted no on that legislation. One of them was Congressman O'Rourke, the congressman from El Paso. And there was a reason for that. You know, he gave an answer now. He said that it didn't provide enough tax relief. That's not what he said at the time he voted no. At the time he voted no, he said the reason he voted no is that he wanted -- he wanted to focus on...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  That's your time, Senator...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  ... illegal immigrants instead of hurricane relief.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  That's your time. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  That was his answer at the time. And that doesn't -- so...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Representative O'Rourke -- thank you, Senator -- Representative, you get 60 seconds for a rebuttal. Do you regret that vote?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I don't. I will always see what I can do, work with anyone, anytime, anywhere to do better for Texas. And that was what I was trying to do.  </p><p>      But, you know, Senator Cruz mentioned listening to and working with local leaders in Houston. I've listened to and worked with the mayor and the county judge, a Democrat and a Republican, each of whom is still waiting for $1.1 billion awarded to the local governments in community development block grant funding that has still not made its way into the neighborhoods, into the streets, into the homes, into the businesses to rebuild.  </p><p>      They need a full-time senator, not somebody running for president who's going to focus on their needs and make sure that that money gets there. They need a full-time senator who would have been at bat for them before the storm on infrastructure projects that they had identified needed funding, but they needed a senator who was going to work for them.  </p><p>      Army Corps of Engineers approved projects totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars who did not have an advocate because he wasn't in Texas. He wasn't in Houston. He was in Iowa. He was in New Hampshire. He was running for another office instead of taking care of the concerns and the needs of the people of Texas.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Representative, thank you very much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator Cruz, a year ago this week, October 18, 2017, you tweeted out the following statement. When it comes to the deficit and debt, it is immoral the debt we have, we have to turn it around, you wrote. Yet two months later, last December, as you just mentioned a moment ago, you voted for the Republican tax plan that the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congressional Budget Office, and many other nonpartisans say will add more than $1 trillion to the deficit. Some people see the tweet and the vote as hypothetical. Are they not?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  They are not remotely. I'm proud to have supported the tax cut. The tax cut is producing enormous benefits for the state of Texas and for the country. We're seeing record growth. We're seeing record low unemployment. It's benefiting -- 4 million new jobs in the last two years.  </p><p>      And, by the way, one thing that Democrats never seem to understand, if you want to pay down deficit and debt -- and I care passionately about the deficit and debt -- it is immoral the deficit and debt we've racked up -- if you want to do it, the only force strong enough to do that is economic growth.   </p><p>      Now, let's go back to a little history. In the 1960s, John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, campaigned on tax cuts, cutting individual tax cuts and the corporate tax rate. He said a rising tide will lift all boats. He passed it and the economy boomed and federal tax revenue went up.  </p><p>      In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan campaigned on cutting taxes to get the economy growing. He passed it. The economy boomed and federal tax revenues went up.  </p><p>      We did the same thing this time. This time, with this tax cut, we're seeing the results. And today, to date, federal tax revenues have gone up.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Federal tax revenues are higher this year than they were last year, without the tax cut.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Respectfully, Senator, I was with you in Iowa. I've heard you on the campaign trail since 2012 saying how bad the deficit is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  And this vote would add to the deficit, though.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Jason, no, it wouldn't. That projection is wrong. By the way, that projection also would have said that the Kennedy tax cuts would have added to the deficit and that the Reagan tax cuts would have added to the deficit. The reason we have deficit and debt is not that we cut taxes and spurred the economy. The reason we have deficit and debt is because Congress keeps spending.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that was your time, sir.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  That's why we need to pass term limits. It's why we need to pass a balanced budget amendment. We need to stop the out-of-control spending...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that is your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  ... things like socialized medicine...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Ninety second response, Congressman O'Rourke. Ninety second response.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Speaking of balancing budgets, only one of us has with good friends in El Paso started a small business, met that payroll every week, balanced the books, make sure that we delivered for our clients. Only one of us has served at the local government level, every single year balancing the budget, seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats, but as councilmembers entrusted with the fiduciary responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers of El Paso, every single year we did.  </p><p>      And for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of $21 trillion in debt, when we're on track to deficit spend to the tune of a trillion dollars a year, he voted to add $2 trillion. And those tax cuts disproportionately will flow to corporations, who are already sitting on record piles of cash, and the already wealthy in a country that is riven with income inequality unseen since the last Gilded Age.  </p><p>      Why? In the days just before and just after that vote, Senator Cruz accepted $120,000 from the political action committees who represent the corporate interests that benefited from this tax cut. Why does he vote for this?   </p><p>      Why does he vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without your consent? Why does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses 30,000 people to gun violence every year? Follow the money.  </p><p>      In each of these cases, if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz, it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupted Congress has become.  </p><p>      I don't take PAC money. Not a dime. I always and only represent the people of Texas.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that is your time. Congressman, that is your time. Senator Cruz, 60 second rebuttal.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  You know, Congressman O'Rourke is fond of saying he doesn't take PAC money, but the truth is different. For example, the J Street PAC, which is a rabidly anti-Israel PAC, has raised over $160,000 for Congressman O'Rourke because of his many votes against the nation of Israel.  </p><p>      Another example, he has a super PAC based up in Dallas that has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars of spending them on ads attacking me and my family. So when he say he doesn't take PAC money, he just lets others do it for him.  </p><p>      But let me say more fundamentally, the reason people care about this is they care about who you're fighting for. Consistently, if you look at Congressman O'Rourke's record, every time there is a choice between left-wing national activists and the people of Texas, he goes with the left-wing national activists and he goes with the left-wing national donors.  </p><p>      For example, we were talking earlier about his vote for a $10 a barrel tax on oil. That is a great vote if you're raising money in San Francisco. It's a terrible vote if you actually care about jobs in the state of Texas...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that is your time. We want to keep this debate on track here. Let me ask you the next question, though, Senator. Weber Shandwick did a poll this year with almost 70 percent of Americans saying civility is a major problem in America.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  And let's talk about the tone of this campaign and what's happened here in the last half-hour, 45 minutes. We all watch as activists chased you and your wife, Heidi, out of the restaurant in D.C., and then, Senator, some say you couldn't even give a political-free compliment to your opponent in the first debate in Dallas. So the question is, what responsibility do you have to bring civility and respect back to the country?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Listen, Jason, I think every one of us has a responsibility to bring civility and respect. That's something I've endeavored to do throughout politics, is to focus on substance, to focus on issues, to focus on record. And so the personal attacks, the going to the gutter that is so common in politics, I try not to engage in.  </p><p>      If you look at my disagreements with Congressman O'Rourke, they haven't been personal attacks. They've been his voting record in Congress that has been markedly out of step with the people of Texas.   </p><p>      You are right that there is a loss of civility, there is an anger, there is a rage on the far left that is really frightening. You know, the images of...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Hold on. Let me answer -- don't interrupt me, Jason. The images of -- of...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Whoa.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  ... a left-wing mob beating on the doors of the Supreme Court, that's not good for our country. We can disagree while treating each other with respect, while treating each other with civility. I think that's important to do.  </p><p>      We can discuss, are tax cuts good or is raising taxes good? That's a discussion we ought to have. But it shouldn't be personal. It shouldn't go down to the gutter. It should focus on actual substance.  </p><p>      And let me tell you, I think the lowest point we have seen is the confirmation hearings for Justice Kavanaugh, where we saw Senate Democrats be willing to smear Justice Kavanaugh and his family, be willing to repeat unsupported, uncorroborated allegations and go after him in way that -- that I thought was shameful.   </p><p>      It was important that that process be fair, that Dr. Ford get a full and fair opportunity to tell her story, that she be treated with respect, and she was. But it was important...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that is your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  ... that he be treated with respect, as well, and he was not.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that is your time. Congressman O'Rourke, 90 seconds for a response.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Every year, Allegany College presents an award for civility in American politics. One of the first years, it was awarded to Senator John McCain and Vice President Biden. Another year, it was awarded to the family of late Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And last year, I was lucky enough, fortunate enough to receive that award, along with Will Hurd.  </p><p>      Our ability to travel across the country as a Republican and a Democrat in a car and Facebook livestream the whole thing, but then to get to work in Congress and join one another's legislation to do better for our constituents, regardless of the party differences that might otherwise stand between us, was recognized.  </p><p>      It's the same kind of approach that I take to just about everything that I do in Congress, everything that I do in life. When we found out that veterans were unable to access mental health care services, that half a million veterans with bad paper discharges were denied the ability to go to the V.A., I worked with my colleague from Colorado, Mike Coffman, though he's a Republican and I'm a Democrat, we were able to bury the differences, compromise -- a four-letter word amongst some in Washington, D.C. -- and find a consensus piece of legislation that passed the House of Representatives 435-0, passed the Senate, as well, and was signed into law by President Donald J. Trump.  </p><p>      Now, President Trump is someone with whom I don't agree on everything. But where we could make things better for those veterans, we did it. We buried the differences and we put them aside, and we put this country's interests before us. That's the kind of leadership that we need from Texas going forward. That's the kind of leadership this country deserves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that's your time. That is your time. Mr. Cruz, in your 60 second rebuttal, I was going to ask you, doesn't the inflammatory rhetoric just exacerbate the situation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Absolutely. And I think we should focus on substance and not inflammatory rhetoric.  </p><p>      You know, I will say, it was striking at this press conference in D.C. about civility, Congressman O'Rourke again repeated his call for impeaching President Trump. That's the very essence of not civility.  </p><p>      If we had impeachment next year, we'd see utter chaos. We would see an end to the repeal of the job-killing regulations that's fueling our economic growth. We would see an end to many -- much of the progress we've seen rebuilding our military, making progress on foreign policy. Washington would be consumed by partisan investigations. That's not civility.  </p><p>      Let me point out more broadly, it's interesting that Congressman O'Rourke points to a bill that another congressman wrote that he was a co-sponsor of. There's a reason for that. Have you noticed in his campaign, have you noticed in this debate he doesn't talk about what he has accomplished in Congress? Because he has scored political points rather than accomplishing victories for the people of Texas.  </p><p>      We've already talked about emergency tax relief in the wake of Harvey that I authored, passed into law. That was bipartisan. We had -- we had Democrats and Republicans...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, that's your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  That was good for Texas.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  That is your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Gentlemen, you know, when it comes to the \"Me, Too\" movement, the president said it is a very scary time for young men. Congressman, you're raising sons. What do you tell them?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I'm raising two sons and a daughter. And I tell each of them that it's critically important that they are treated with respect and that they demand them from everyone in their life and that they treat one another and everyone in their life with respect.  </p><p>      I'm very grateful for the leadership that we have seen across this country, in positions of public trust in Congress and people at the neighborhood level, meeting the challenge of this moment. Congress members like Jackie Speier from California, who authored legislation that I co-sponsored that ensures that members of Congress are held to a higher standard, that there's true transparency in their conduct and there's not the ability to cover up, and there's the important training to make sure that everyone in their offices and their lives is treated with respect and a dignity that they deserve.  </p><p>      I also support the Violence Against Women's Act that makes sure that we have the resources and the training and the funding to protect the lives of the women in our lives, and in this state and throughout country. Inexplicably, or maybe he'll have an explanation, Senator Cruz voted against the Violence Against Women's Act.   </p><p>      We have to make sure that we're more than just talk. We have to have actions that follow this up. We've got to make sure that, for example, when we're talking about women, we're talking about equal pay for equal work. When we're talking about women, we talk about ensuring that they can make their own decisions about their own bodies and have access to the health care that allows them to do that.  </p><p>      It means that our rhetoric has to be followed by our actions. And in Senator Cruz, we don't have that today.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Congressman, thank you. In response, Senator, what do you tell your daughters?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  I think the \"Me, Too\" movement has done an incredible amount of good for our country. Sexual assault is wrong. Sexual harassment is wrong. And we've seen in recent months powerful men in Hollywood, powerful men in politics, powerful men in journalism, powerful men in business called to account for abominable behavior. I believe everyone, men and women, girls and boys, need to be protected, need to be treated with dignity.  </p><p>      And as you noted, I am the father of two girls. I want them -- their rights to be protected. I want them to be valued.   </p><p>      I'm also the son of my mom, who graduated from Rice in 1956, went to work at Shell as a computer programmer. She was a professional. Women in the 1950s faced a very difficult climate. My wife, Heidi, my best friend in the world, works in the financial sector, again, always a difficult client -- climate. We need to protect everyone's rights.   </p><p>      And let me tell you, when it comes to stopping sexual assault and when it comes to dealing with those who commit them, before I was in the Senate, I was the solicitor general of Texas, the chief lawyer for the state in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. I handled over and over and over again cases dealing with rapists, dealing with those who'd committed sexual assault, dealing with child predators. And it has been a passion of mine.  </p><p>      And Congressman O'Rourke mentioned sexual harassment in Congress. Well, I joined with New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand. The two of us were the lead authors on legislation to stop the indefensible practice of secret taxpayer settlements for members of Congress who were harassing their staff. There should be no secret settlements. That should be public.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  That's your time, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  And it's important that there be accountability.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Thank you. Congressman, you get 60 seconds for rebuttal.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Listen, I pointed out two specific opportunities for Senator Cruz to do the right thing, one of them being the Violence Against Women Act. Didn't hear a good reason why he failed to support that.  </p><p>      Look, you've got somebody -- as I mentioned earlier -- who is all talk and no action. You've got somebody who left the state of Texas within a year of being elected to represent all of us to run for another office. Hasn't been to all the counties of Texas, but has been to all 99 of Iowa. Has missed a quarter of the votes in 2015, missed half of them in 2016.  </p><p>      There's only one other senator from either party over the last 25 years who has a worse -- who has a worse record on bipartisanship. In other words, <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>has a harder time working with members across the aisle than almost anyone else to get anything done.  </p><p>      So if he's not showing up in Texas, if he's not showing up in D.C. to vote, who is he showing up for?  </p><p>      I want to make sure that whether it is women -- and the issue that you just asked about now -- or any other priority that we have in the state...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that's your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  ... we have a senator who shows up every single day for every single one of us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  That's your time. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Gentlemen, let's move on to something different here, too. We have 60 seconds for each of you. We want you to tell us something you've done in the last year that has nothing to do with politics that would give Texans insight to who you are as a person. Senator Cruz, you first.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  Look, I will say the hardest thing about being in this job is being a dad. My girls are here. At the last -- last debate, Congressman O'Rourke and I talked about that. Both of us are dads of young kids. And it is tough. It is tough.  </p><p>      Our girls are 7 and 10. Monday morning leaving is really hard. You know, last year, I was -- helped coach Caroline's girl's basketball team, the fourth grade basketball team. The basketball practices were Sunday afternoons, so I was able to be at the practices.  </p><p>      As Caroline will point out many times, in the course of the whole season, I made it to one game. That's not OK with her. By the way, one of the games that I thought I was going to make it to was going to be a Friday night game. I was planning to come back. It was the night of the vote on the tax cut.  </p><p>      And so I was in the Senate, and I had to call home and say, Caroline, I'm sorry, I've got to be here to vote on this. Let me tell you, for a fourth grader, the fact that you're voting to cut taxes is not an explanation for why daddy is not at the game.  </p><p>      That's really a hard thing. You know, being a dad -- I mean, part of what we do, we call on Facetime and we try to -- we try to carve out every...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  ... Sunday for the family, but that is hard. And I take being a dad really seriously.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you for sharing. As well to Congressman O'Rourke, 60 seconds.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  You know, I think much of what Senator Cruz just said resonates with me. We've spent the better part of the last 21 months on the road campaigning in every single county of Texas. Don't get to see my kids as much as I want to. I know that Amy takes on the lion's share of the burden, with a child that's just entered sixth grade, another who's in fifth, and Henry, who's in second.   </p><p>      Every now and then, we get down in the basement where I have a drum kit that ostensibly was purchased for Henry, but really was for me...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      ... a PA and an amplifier, and me and the kids will rock out. And Amy allows us to do that for a little while. We go to Ulysses' travel baseball tournaments. That last one was in Las Cruces. I've had them in Alamogordo, as well.   </p><p>      Just went with Molly, who is nursing back to life a blind squirrel that was picked up in East Texas, dropped off in El Paso at a wildlife animal rescue run by Ms. Julie, got to meet this blind squirrel who's slowly regaining its sight.   </p><p>      You know, Henry, one of the best parts of my day is when I am at home, getting to walk him to school and just talking about what he dreamed about the night before and what he's into this day.  </p><p>      So with very little time outside of the campaign or my official job, I spend it with my family.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, thank you for sharing, as well, too.  </p><p>      We've asked you both a lot of questions tonight. Now we want to let you guys address Texas voters directly. You both get two minutes for closing statements here. As we mentioned early on, a flip of the coin gives you the final word tonight, Senator Cruz.   </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke, you're up first.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Listen, I just want to thank you each for moderating this debate, everyone who has been here to witness it, and all of those who've made this campaign in the election of our lifetime possible.  </p><p>      I was talking to Amy tonight about this moment that stayed with me after I first met Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. He's meeting with members of the Armed Services Committee, and he reminded us that the United States historically has enjoyed two principal powers that distinguish us from the rest of the world. One is the power of intimidation, to feel the most awesome military force the world has ever known.  </p><p>      The other -- and he thought maybe the greater power -- is the power of inspiration, to continue to be the indispensable nation that lives up to the promise and the potential of our founders, a nation that not just Americans look up to, but the world looks up to.  </p><p>      And whether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now. Walls, Muslim bans, the press as the enemy of the people, taking kids away from their parents after they've survived a horrifying 2,000-mile journey seeking asylum here in this country, the bitterness, the partisanship, the pettiness, the dishonesty that defines so much of the national conversation, we are in desperate need right now of inspiration.  </p><p>      But I'll tell you what. Traveling the state of Texas, meeting people regardless of their walk of life, their background, their party affiliation, you have inspired me, you've inspired me to transcend the obstacles, to be the big, courageous, bold, strong match for this moment.  </p><p>      On any issue that challenges us, in Texas, where nearly half of the schoolteachers work a second job just to make ends meet, making sure that we're there for them, pay them a living wage, and ensure that they can teach to the child, not the test; in this state of immigrants, making sure that we lead the national conversation, free Dreamers from any fear of deportation; and the least insured state in the country could take the lead on guaranteed, high-quality universal health care.  </p><p>      You have inspired me in this race.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Congressman, that's your time.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  And I'm grateful to have the chance to represent you. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  That is your time, Congressman. Senator Cruz, two minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRUZ</emphasis>:  The classic question in politics. Are you better off now than you were two years ago? Is Texas? Elections are about choices. Do we continue on the path we're on or do we turn back?   </p><p>      The records of Congressman O'Rourke and myself could not be more different. On taxes, I want to cut your taxes. Congressman O'Rourke wants to raise them. On job killing regulations, I want to repeal them. Congressman O'Rourke wants to increase them. On Obamacare, I want to repeal Obamacare, reduce premiums, protect pre-existing conditions, and expand access. Congressman O'Rourke wants socialized medicine, the federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor, which among other things would threaten to bankrupt Medicare.  </p><p>      I want to keep the economic boom we're experiencing right now going, moving forward. Congressman O'Rourke wants the next two years to be drawn into the partisan circus of impeachment proceedings against President Trump.  </p><p>      Elections are about who we are. Do we choose fear or do we choose hope? I believe in hope. My mom was the first one in her family to go to college, and she was a pioneer professional woman. My dad came from Cuba with nothing, washed dishes making 50 cents an hour, came here seeking the American dream.  </p><p>      If someone had approached my dad in 1957 and said 50 years hence your son will be a U.S. senator representing the state of Texas, that teenage immigrant could never have believed it. And yet as I stood on the Senate floor with my hand on my dad's bible, there was my father in the gallery, tears running down his eyes. Only in America.  </p><p>      This is a choice about keeping the boom going, keeping -- we have the lowest Hispanic unemployment ever recorded, the lowest African-American unemployment ever recorded. Why would we want to screw that up? We need to defend jobs, defend the Constitution, and secure our borders.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Senator Cruz, that is your time. That is your time, sir. We appreciate it.  </p><p>      Mr. Cruz, Mr. O'Rourke, thank you for sharing tonight. We appreciate that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORGANY</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  Quick reminder. Our social media response team in Dallas is still...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITELY</emphasis>:  (OFF-MIKE) reminder to our viewers, as well (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5THD-6NR1-F15W-H193-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS:  There are two different visions for the road Texas wants to be on. </p><p>      ANNOUNCER:  Texas hasn't seen a race like this in decades.</p><p>      REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D), TEXAS:  I am not running against anyone, not running against another party. I'm running for this country. </p><p>      ANNOUNCER:  Republican Ted Cruz asking Texas voters for six more years in the Senate. Beto O'Rourke, hoping to be the state's first Democratic senator in 25 years. </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      ANNOUNCER:  Now, live from San Antonio, both candidates face-to-face in the Texas debate. </p><p>      SARAH FORGANY, ANCHOR, KENS 5:  Good evening again. Thank you for joining us tonight. I'm Sarah Forgany, news anchor at KENS 5 in San Antonio. </p><p>      JASON WHITELY, POLITICAL REPORTER, WFAA:  And I'm Jason Whitely, political reporter and host of \"Inside Texas Politics\" at WFAA in Dallas-Fort Worth. We welcome all our viewers from across the state watching this debate live tonight in all corners of Texas. So let's get right to it.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Both campaigns have agreed to these rules tonight. For each question, the candidate will get 90 seconds to answer, his opponent will have 90 seconds for a response, and we will turn back for a final rebuttal of 60 seconds. </p><p>      WHITELY:  Let's first, though, turn to Dallas, to our Victory Park studios where we have a social media response team there. So as you watch this debate on television with us tonight, joining the conversation online using the hashtag #TexasDebate. </p><p>      FORGANY:  And we also have a live audience with us here tonight in the studio, so we ask you to please hold your applause during this debate, except for now, as we welcome the two candidates running for the United States Senate in Texas.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      FORGANY:  Good evening. </p><p>      WHITELY:  Please welcome Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke here. Gentlemen, welcome tonight. Senator Cruz, you won the coin toss to have the final word tonight at the end of this program, so therefore we start with you, Congressman O'Rourke. Welcome to you. </p><p>      Twenty one days away from election and there's still uncertainty about the security of our ballot boxes. And just yesterday, new cyber attacks again reported on election databases in several states. But misinformation online can be just as dangerous as so many people know. The question is, should Congress enact regulations on social media to protect voters from that misinformation? </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  First, Jason, let me thank you and Sarah for moderating tonight's debate, KENS 5 for hosting us, the people of San Antonio for being here, and the people of Texas for watching this and participating in one of the most important decisions of our lifetimes. Es una honor estar aqui con ustedes otra ves aqui en San Antonio.</p><p>      Yes, the integrity of our ballot box. Two hundred and forty two years into this experiment, the American democracy, that is the exception, not the rule in world history, is sacred. And it's essential that we continue to protect it. It's under attack unlike any other time in this nation's past. </p><p>      We know because the intelligence community has reached a unanimous conclusion on this, that the Russian government sought to undermine our democracy. In fact, President Trump's own administration announced the indictment of 12 Russian nationals who compromised the voter data of more than half a million of our fellow Americans. And we know they will attack us again in this election and the next unless we stand up to them now. </p><p>      So, yes, let's protect the integrity of our ballot box, which is why I'm a little surprised that Senator Cruz has voted against the funding to protect access to the ballot box and to ensure that your vote goes to the candidate of your choice.</p><p>      And, yes, we must also ensure that on social media, where so many of us now have become the product on Twitter, on Facebook, that we are not manipulated and that opinions that we hold are not shaped by those from other countries. </p><p>      So I want to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, work with this administration, to make sure that we do that and every single voter can make an informed decision based on accurate information. </p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that is your time. Ninety second response, Mr. Cruz.</p><p>      CRUZ:  Of course we should do more to protect the integrity of elections. And I'm proud to have supported, number one, funding from the federal government to the states to help secure our elections, but number two, just a week ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed legislation that I co-sponsored called the DETER Act that would punish anyone that comes to this country with the purpose of undermining elections. We need to make sure our elections are safe and secure. </p><p>      Now, your question was, should Congress be regulating social media companies and what they allow to be said. I believe in the First Amendment. I don't believe Congress should be in the business of regulating conduct, because I don't think it's government's job to regulating content, rather, online.</p><p>      That being said, I am very concerned -- and I know there are millions of Texans who are concerned, about the political bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google, skewing and silencing the voices of those who politically they disagree with. You may remember several months ago Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, testified before the Senate, and I asked him a series of vigorous questions about the political bias at Facebook.</p><p>      Now, even though Congress shouldn't regulate the content, there are two things we should think about doing. Number one, right now, big tech enjoys an immunity from liability on the assumption that they would be neutral and fair. If they're not going to be neutral and fair, if they're going to be biased, we should repeal the immunity from liability so they should be liable like the rest of us.</p><p>      Number two, the giant tech companies, by any measure of bigger than AT&amp;T was when it was broken up under the antitrust laws, bigger than Standard Oil, and if they're abusing market powers and monopoly, the antitrust laws should be enforced. </p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time. Congressman, to be clear, he said that, yes, we should enact -- Congress should enact regulations on social media. Yes or no, in the remaining 60 second rebuttal here for you, yes or no for regulations on social media?</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Yes, I think we can have thoughtful regulations that ensure that we're making informed decisions based on facts and the truth, and we're not being manipulated by foreign powers. But it's interesting that Ted Cruz invested more than $5 million in Cambridge Analytica, which is the very company that helped to undermine our democracy, to feed false news and false opinions to our fellow Americans to manipulate the world's greatest democracy, $5 million from Ted Cruz that funded Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>      He voted against supporting and safeguarding the integrity of our ballot box. And our junior senator will not stand up to President Trump, someone who apologizes for Russia, defends that country, Vladimir Putin, the leader of the country that sought to undermine our democracy. He won't stand up against him and he won't stand up for us to make sure that our elections are free and fair, that your vote goes to the intended candidate.</p><p>      This is beyond party politics. This is getting -- this is getting our democracy back our track. And we need a senator from Texas who will do that.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that is your time.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Senator Cruz, Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in 11 days ago. The U.S. Supreme Court now has five justices who have either directly stated or suggested that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. Should we prepare for changes to abortion law in this country?</p><p>      CRUZ:  Well, listen, I believe that every human life is a gift from God, is a precious gift from God and it should be protected. It should be protected and cherished. I'm pro-life. </p><p>      And now the question of what will happen at the Supreme Court on Roe v. Wade or anything else, we'll have to see when cases are decided. Justice Kavanaugh, just like his predecessors, just like Justice Ginsburg, just like Justice Kagan, declined to answer those questions. And that's been the standard at the Supreme Court for many, many years.</p><p>      I would note, though, on the question of life there is an enormous difference between me and Congressman O'Rourke. On the question of life, Congressman O'Rourke is at the extreme pro-abortion side. So he has repeatedly voted in favor of late-term abortions. He has repeatedly voted in favor of taxpayer funding for abortions. I've got to say, that's not consistent with the views of the people of Texas.</p><p>      The people of Texas, and I will say especially the Hispanic community, we don't want to see taxpayer-funded, Medicaid funding abortions and late term abortions. I think that's extreme and that's disconnected.</p><p>      And I will note, as well, on the question of judges, judges is a massive divide between Congressman O'Rourke and me. I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the court. Congressman O'Rourke would have voted against both of them. And he wants to see, like Hillary Clinton, promise to appoint left-wing judicial activists who impose their own policy preferences from the bench.</p><p>      I don't think that's what the people of Texas want. We want judges...</p><p>      FORGANY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>      CRUZ:  ... and justices who will follow the Constitution and follow the law.</p><p>      FORGANY:  That's your time. Thank you. Congressman, you have 90 seconds for a response.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Senator Cruz has a very troubling record when it comes to judicial nominations and confirmations. He supported the nomination of a judge, Jeff Mateer, who described transgender children as part of Satan's plan, believes in conversion therapy. He supported the nomination of a judge -- someone to be a judge who'd never tried a case before, another potential judge who could not tell us whether Brown v. The Board of Education was correctly decided.</p><p>      From our perspective, in a state where you can be fired for being gay, I want a justice who believes in civil rights. From the perspective of a state that ranks 50th in voter turnout in the country, not by accident, by design some people drawn out of their democracy, I want a justice who believes in voting rights.</p><p>      And for a state that is at the epicenter of the maternal mortality crisis, as we made it harder and harder for women to get access to the health care that they need to get that cervical cancer screening, to see that family planning provider, to see a provider of any kind, we're losing them faster here than in almost any other state, almost any other developed country in the world.</p><p>      I will only vote to confirm a Supreme Court justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body and who has the health care access to be able to do so. </p><p>      We should be able -- and the next junior senator from the state of Texas -- to work with our colleagues, to work with the administration, to have justices who will rule in favor of people and our needs, not corporations, not special interests, not the political action committees. Those are some very significant needs that we have in Texas right now, not represented by Judge, now Justice Kavanaugh. And so...</p><p>      FORGANY:  Congressman...</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Yeah, this is a decision that I'm concerned about.</p><p>      FORGANY:  That's your time. Thank you. Senator, in your 60 second rebuttal, what should abortion law in Texas look like?</p><p>      CRUZ:  Well, you know, it's striking that Congressman O'Rourke didn't dispute his extreme record on abortion, supporting late-term abortions, supporting taxpayer funding for abortion, supporting taxpayer funding for abortions late term even for illegal aliens. That is an -- and he's voted for that. That is an extreme position, fewer than 9 percent of Texans agree with him.</p><p>      He also didn't dispute that he opposed Justice Gorsuch, he opposed Justice Kavanaugh. And if you listen to what Congressman O'Rourke said, he said he wants justices that agree with his own left-wing policy views. That's not the job of the court.</p><p>      The job of the court is to follow the law. If you want to change the law, you do it through elections. You do it -- the Constitution gives the power to the people, not five unelected lawyers in Washington. And let me note, the same judges that Congressman O'Rourke wants to see would also undermine the First Amendment, would undermine free speech, would undermine religious liberty, would undermine the Second Amendment.</p><p>      Hillary Clinton promised to appoint justices who would undermine the Second Amendment. And Congressman O'Rourke enthusiastically supported her doing so.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Senator, that's your time. Thank you very much.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator Cruz, President Trump said on Sunday that something is changing in regards to the climate. You're clearly on record for years saying there's no evidence to just back that up, nothing exists yet to back that up. But major oil companies, including Texas-based ExxonMobil, says even on its website the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action. That's ExxonMobil's own words there.</p><p>      So what do you tell Texas companies who think this really is a problem?</p><p>      CRUZ:  Well, listen, of course the climate is changing. The climate has been changing from the dawn of time. The climate will change as long as -- as we have a planet Earth.</p><p>      I am the son of two mathematicians and computer programmers. I believe in science. I chair the Science and Space Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee. And indeed, in that capacity, I chaired a hearing looking on the science and data behind global warming. And we heard testimony, we heard actual science and data.</p><p>      Far too many Democrats approach this issue not as a matter of science -- I think we should follow the science and follow the evidence -- but instead what they approach it as, as a matter of government power. They want the power to control the economy.</p><p>      That has led, for example, Congressman O'Rourke to cast some votes that I think are really harmful to the people of Texas. For example, Congressman O'Rourke voted in favor of a $10 a barrel tax on every barrel of oil produced in the state of Texas. That would have been absolutely devastating to the state of Texas. By the way, $10 a barrel, that works out to about 24 cents a gallon that every one of us would pay when you go fill up your car or truck. That would hurt the people of Texas. </p><p>      And let me point out, look, a robust energy sector is good for all of Texas. There are millions of jobs that depend on a robust oil and gas sector. And Congressman O'Rourke's record voting against Texas oil and gas, voting against energy, that hurts the economy, it hurts jobs, it's not right for Texas.</p><p>      And let me point out:  All of those oil and gas workers, they buy homes. They buy cars and trucks. They get health care. They give to churches and schools. And by the way, the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>      CRUZ:  ... get hundreds of millions of dollars from our energy sector...</p><p>      WHITELY:  That's your time, Senator. Let's move on to a 90 second response from Mr. O'Rourke.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  This is what you can expect over the course of this debate. Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you. He's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held or have ever taken. He's dishonest. It's why the president called him lying Ted. And it's why the nickname stuck, because it's true.</p><p>      Look, the climate is changing. And manmade climate change is a fact. Three hundred years after the enlightenment, we should be able to listen to the scientists and follow their advice and guidance. And they tell us that we still have time, but the window is closing to get this right. If we're going to make our commitment to the generations that follow and not just think about the next election or our political career or pursuit of the White House, then we can make the right decisions.</p><p>      Now, we can support Texas being a proud energy leader in oil and in gas, but also in renewable energy. Today, Texas leads the country -- we're number one in the nation in the generation of renewable wind power. We're number five and moving up quick when it comes to solar. The two fastest-growing jobs in the United States of America today:  Wind and solar jobs. We can continue to grow this economy, we can reject the false choice between oil and gas and renewable energy, make sure that we produce and refine and transport and use our energy resources more responsibly.</p><p>      And listen, this isn't one political party saying this. This is people of both parties in every single county in Texas that we've had the chance to listen to people. These are folks who work in the energy industry. Amy and I were in Iraan, Texas, listening to those who work in some of these fracking operations. What they want is predictability and consistency in the regulations, and then they will perform to them.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time. Mr. Cruz, 60 second rebuttal. The question is, does ExxonMobil have it wrong here?</p><p>      CRUZ:  Well, it's clear Congressman O'Rourke's pollsters have told him to come out on the attack. So if he wants to insult me and call me a liar, that's fine. But, you know, John Adams famously said, Facts are stubborn things.</p><p>      So if you want to see the vote he cast for a $10 a barrel tax on oil, go to our website. It's tedcruz.org. And we will put up the exact text of the vote and a link to Congressman O'Rourke's vote against the people of Texas.</p><p>      Let me say, if you work in energy, if you work in oil and gas, Congressman O'Rourke's record on this is extreme. He didn't just vote for a $10 a barrel tax on oil. He's also voted for aggressive regulations of fracking, aggressive regulations of exporting liquefied natural gas. He's a prominent supporter of President Obama's Paris climate deal, which would have killed thousands of jobs in the state of Texas.</p><p>      That's not good for Texas. And it's an example of over and over again Congressman O'Rourke sides with liberal extremists on the national level, instead of the people of Texas, instead of jobs of Texas. And -- and -- and by the way...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>      CRUZ:  ... alternatives are great, too. Texas leads in energy across the board.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Representative, this question is about immigration policy. We know your position and passion for the Dreamers. And we know that you are adamantly against extending the existing border fence. This question here is specifically about border security.</p><p>      If we don't need a border wall, can you please look at the people of Texas tonight and tell them what we do need?</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I'd be happy to. And listen, I don't know if there's another person who has a greater stake in this issue than I do. Amy and I are raising Ulysses and Molly and Henry in El Paso, Texas, one-half of the largest binational community on the border, the defining border community.</p><p>      We care about our kids' safety. I care about the safety of those that I represent in Congress. I care about the safety of every single person in the state of Texas. El Paso, in fact, is one of, if not the safest cities in the United States of America. It's because we have world-class law enforcement, police and sheriff's deputies, but it's also because we are a city of immigrants.</p><p>      A quarter of those that I represent were born in a country -- another country, chose us, came here to this country, and by their very presence made it better. No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns. But...</p><p>      FORGANY:  But, Congressman...</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... smart policy will. And let me describe one of those to you. Senator John Cornyn and I, though he's a Republican and I'm a Democrat, he's in the Senate and I'm in the House, worked on policy together to invest in our ports of entry. That's where more than 90 percent of everyone and everything that ever comes into the United States first crosses. Having a better idea of who and what comes into our country demonstrably makes us safer. </p><p>      And at the same time, those customs officers are able to facilitate legitimate trade and travel that's connected to more than a million jobs in the state of Texas. As we all know, here, the home of Toyota, trade is the lifeblood of the state of Texas. If we can make our communities more secure, as this bill did, and facilitate more job-growing trade, then we've really figured something out.</p><p>      And I think that John Cornyn and I have been able to do it. Republicans...</p><p>      FORGANY:  That's your time, Congressman.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... and Democrats working together on an issue that makes Texas better.</p><p>      FORGANY:  That's your time. Thank you. Senator, you have 90 seconds to respond.</p><p>      CRUZ:  So everyone should notice in his answer that he wanted to talk about trade, he wanted to talk about customs, he wanted to talk about everything expect border security. And let me say, there's no race in the country with a starker divide on immigration than this race here in the state of Texas. </p><p>      As for me, I'm incredibly honored to have received the formal endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, the union of the men and women who risk their lives keeping our nation safe. I will note here at this debate, I'm very pleased we have Brandon Judd and Paul Perez, both from the National Border Patrol Council. The reason they're supporting me is I've led the fight to secure the border, building the wall, using technology, increasing boots on the ground. We can keep our communities safe.</p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke not only opposes a wall, but he has said we have too many fences and walls already on the border, he wants to tear downs the ones we have. And I'll note, he brought up El Paso. El Paso is right across from Juarez, one of the most dangerous cities in the world, 3,000 murders last year. There's a wall there. That wall is one of the tools you use to protect us. </p><p>      But let me give you an example of just how extreme Congressman O'Rourke is on immigration. Kate's Law, commonsense legislation, overwhelming majority of Texans support it. I'm the author of Kate's Law in the Senate that says violent criminal illegal aliens, if they're deported repeatedly, should face a mandatory minimum prison sentence. Congressman O'Rourke has voted against Kate's Law. That's wrong. We need -- we should not be releasing violent criminals into our community.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Congressman, in your 60 second rebuttal, can you tell your specific plan to secure the border?</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Well, as I just told you, Senator John Cornyn and I have worked to invest in our ports of entry. That means staffing of customs officers. That means infrastructure at our bridges that connect us with Mexico, where more than 90 percent of everyone and everything first crosses. And it means investment in the technology that ensures that we do a better, smarter job screening those who first come into this country. That will make us safer.</p><p>      It also means that we support local law enforcement, those police officers and sheriff's deputies who keep this country safe. We can do that, as well. But listen, we cannot use this idea of border security to be an impediment to moving forward on those issues that are also demanding our action and which Texans know better than perhaps any other people of any other state.</p><p>      On issues of immigration reform, the fate of Dreamers -- nearly 200,000 in the state of Texas -- when the Senate voted to move forward on debate for Dreamers, 98 senators showed up that day, 97 voted to move forward. Only one senator voted no, stood in the corner while everyone else was at the table. Ted Cruz has put his career above the interests and priorities of Texas.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Congressman, that's your time.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Ted Cruz is for Ted Cruz.</p><p>      FORGANY:  That's your time. Thank you very much.</p><p>      CRUZ:  Hold on a second. Let me -- let me respond to that, please, which is -- I noticed Congressman O'Rourke said we need to support law enforcement. I think that's striking that he says that now in a debate because his career has been one consistently of opposing law enforcement. Indeed, someone else who is here today is Detective Mike Helle, who leads the San Antonio Police Officers Association, and Detective Helle has endorsed me.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator...</p><p>      CRUZ:  And I would note, as well, 171 elected Texas sheriffs...</p><p>      FORGANY:  Senator, thank you very much. We have to move on.</p><p>      CRUZ:  Hold on. I get a 60 second response.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Look at his record -- look at his record...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      FORGANY:  You have both agreed to...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      CRUZ:  But we agreed we could have a 60 second...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      FORGANY:  You have both agreed to these rules. We need to move on to the next topic.</p><p>      CRUZ:  But we agreed -- we agreed on a 60 second rebuttal, if necessary. And I want to make a point on law enforcement. </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  That's not what you said when you established the rules at the outset.</p><p>      FORGANY:  He already finished his rebuttal. We have to move on to the next topic.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Gentlemen, let's talk about health care now. What you're looking at for our television audience is a live picture of our Victory Park Studios in Dallas where that social media response team is listening to our viewers out there, too. The overwhelming conversation online we're hearing about is about health care, and one post asks you directly, Congressman O'Rourke, if universal health care is going to cost trillions of dollars, what do you cut from the federal budget or how much are you going to raise my taxes to pay for that?</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Let's start with the goal. What is it that we're trying to achieve? I want to make sure that everyone can see a doctor, afford their prescription medications, take their child to a therapist, be well enough to live to their full potential over the course of their lifetime. And I want to make sure that working families pay less for health care costs than they do today.</p><p>      So here are some steps that we could take to get to your answer. We could expand Medicaid. This is a state that left $100 billion on the table. OK, expand Medicaid. More working Texans are able to be well enough to go back to work, to be there for their families.</p><p>      We could introduce Medicare as an option on the exchanges to drive down the increase in premium costs and expand selection and choice. </p><p>      And then we could take the lead, as the state that is the least insured in the United States, who perhaps better understands the consequences of failing to be there, by and for one another, better than anyone else, on guaranteed, high-quality, universal health care. There are a number of ways to get there from Medicare for all to one where you use a mix of employer-based insurance and the ability for people to pay into Medicare. </p><p>      That could come at a cost of around $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. If you look at the tax cut that Senator Cruz just voted for, $2 trillion added to $21 trillion in debt, the disproportionate benefit flowing to corporations and the very wealthiest, and move that corporate tax rate not to where it was, but maybe 5 points, from 21 to 26, you would generate the money necessary to pay for access to health care so that everyone lives to their full potential.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time. Mr. Cruz, 90 seconds response.</p><p>      CRUZ:  You know, I have to say, he really didn't want to answer the question of how to pay for it, so let me be clear what it would cost. Congressman O'Rourke is proposing socialized medicine, the federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor.</p><p>      There are at least three big problems with that. Number one, every place on Earth that happens, you have rationing and waiting lists. If you look at the United Kingdom, if a senior needs to get a hip replacement, it takes about 90 days. In Canada, it takes about 200 days. </p><p>      But number two, the cost would be immense. When Bernie Sanders rolled out this plan -- and Congressman O'Rourke supports the Bernie Sanders plan of socialized medicine -- the Urban Institute, which is a left-leaning institute, scored it as costing $32 trillion over 10 years. That's $2.5 trillion in the first year.</p><p>      Right now, the total we raise from all of our income taxes is $1.5 trillion. So Congressman O'Rourke's plan would require tripling your taxes. He said you could do it with five points on the corporate rate. That doesn't even pass elementary school math. </p><p>      We're talking about -- and by the way, his next answer likely will be tax the rich. Well, let me tell you something. If you took every person in America making $1 million or more, and you took 100 percent of their income, it would pay for five months of Congressman O'Rourke's socialized medicine. We can't afford those taxes.</p><p>      And third, he wants to put everyone who hasn't paid into Medicare on Medicare. That would bankrupt Medicare. It would hurt seniors. Seniors have paid into Medicare. They rely on it. And putting 200 million people, including illegal immigrants...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, time.</p><p>      CRUZ:  ... on it, could bankrupt Medicare.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator Cruz, that's your time. Mr. O'Rourke, if elected, in your 60 seconds rebuttal, how do you get that passed?</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Look, all you've heard from Senator Cruz is what we should be afraid of. It's a campaign based on fear. It's the same person who shut down the government of the United States of America for 16 days perhaps because he thought too many people had too much health care, has voted to take away health care from millions of American families, and vows to repeal protections for pre-existing conditions. </p><p>      I want people to have more health care. I want people to be well enough to finish their education, to go to school. I want to bring people of Texas together, Republicans and Democrats alike, from all parts of this state, to make sure that we lead on an issue that we understand better than anyone else.</p><p>      In a state where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system, in a state where people are dying of the flu and diabetes, in the wealthiest and most powerful country in the year 2018, surely we can do better. And I've laid out some steps that would allow us to do that, beginning with expanding Medicaid, introducing Medicare as an option on the exchanges, and in describing the goal that we want to get to and ensuring that Republicans and Democrats...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... alike come to the table to work on that.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that is your time. Senator Cruz, there's a lot of concern in Texas and all over the country about President Trump increasing the tariffs. Toyota says Tundra trucks produced right here in San Antonio will increase in cost by $3,000 next year because of rising tariffs on auto parts. Two nights ago on \"60 Minutes\", President Trump did not rule out increasing tariffs again.</p><p>      So the question is, do you believe tariffs threaten Texas growth? And if so, is it time for the Senate to step in and stop it?</p><p>      CRUZ:  I'm against tariffs. I'm against a trade war.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Is it time for the Senate to step in and stop it?</p><p>      CRUZ:  Let me answer the question. I'm against tariffs. I'm against a trade war. I have made the case repeatedly to President Trump that in trade we should be expanding our access to foreign markets. We should be expanding the ability of Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and energy to export our goods and services.</p><p>      If we are reducing the barriers, whether it is to Mexico or Canada or China or anywhere else so we're selling more, that's a good thing. If we're erecting barriers and shutting down trade, that is a bad thing.</p><p>      This is one of the few issues on which Congressman O'Rourke and I have some common ground, in that we've both spoken out in favor of trade. The difference is that I'm able to work with President Trump and make my case to President Trump, and we have seen -- we have seen, for example, the president has negotiated a new NAFTA, a new trade deal, that has benefits that should benefit the state of Texas, that should benefit San Antonio. </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke is not able to work with President Trump. And indeed, Congressman O'Rourke is the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who has explicitly come out for impeaching President Trump. That is extreme, and it means if Congressman O'Rourke has his way -- you know, he mentioned a shutdown -- you want to talk about a shutdown? With Congressman O'Rourke leading the way, two years of a partisan circus shutting down the federal government in a witch hunt on the president, that's not good for the state of Texas. It's not good for our country.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time. Ninety second response from you, Mr. O'Rourke.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus after your last six years in the U.S. Senate.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      Listen, if you have this special relationship with President Trump, then where is the result of that? You were all talk and no action. The tariffs that the president has levied, the trade wars that he has entered this country into is hurting no state more than it's hurting Texas, our farmers, our ranchers, our producers, our manufacturers, and our exporters.</p><p>      Right here in San Antonio, at the Toyota plant, where Amy and I bought our Tundra and met the folks who made it, yes, we have problems with other countries around the world, China dumping aluminum and steel, manipulating their currency -- and I want to make sure that we stand up to China -- but when have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without any allies? And that's exactly what the president, with Senator Cruz's help, would have us do.</p><p>      We've alienated the European Union. We've alienated Canada and Mexico. We've alienated all other potential partners, and we're going it alone against China, and it is not working. Just listen to the farmers. And I know you haven't had the chance to visit every county, but I have. And I've listened to them, and they are hurting. And the anxiety and the uncertainty of not knowing when these trade wars will end or the certainty of knowing that when those trade wars do end, those buyers in those other countries will find other people from whom to have bought from, and they will no longer be coming to Texas to buy what we grow, what we raise, what we export, and what we manufacture.</p><p>      We need a senator who will work with the president when we can...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... and stand up to him where we must. And on these tariffs, we must stand up to him.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time. Senator Cruz, 60 seconds for rebuttal. But I want to ask again, should the Senate step in and stop this?</p><p>      CRUZ:  I think we should keep working with the president, which is what we have been doing. But, you know, Congressman O'Rourke just -- just asked an interesting question. He said, where are the results?</p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke and I were both elected to Congress on the same day six years ago, November of 2012. We've served exactly the same length of time in Congress. In those six years, I have authored and passed 34 separate pieces of legislation, major victories for the American people.</p><p>      But he asked where are the results. I'll point to one front-and-center, which is the historic tax cut that I spend thousands of hours bringing senators together, getting passed. And he -- where are the results? The state of Texas is booming. We've got right now the lowest unemployment in 49 years. African-American employment is the lowest that's ever been recorded. Hispanic employment is the lowest that's ever been recorded. Youth employment is the lowest in 52 years.</p><p>Texas is seeing the benefits of low taxes and low regulations. And Congressman O'Rourke's position is always, always, always in favor of higher taxes. He said in response to how he'd pay for socialized medicine...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>      CRUZ:  ... higher taxes. That's not good for Texas.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Senator, thank you very much. Representative O'Rourke, you supported $15 billion to help victims of Hurricane Harvey, but two weeks after that, you voted against a bill that would have also given them tax relief. What do you tell those victims who are still struggling financially today, one year later?</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I've been with many of those who were affected by Harvey. In the immediate aftermath, going to places like Rockport or Port Aransas, Houston, Beaumont, Port Arthur, and continuing to come back again and again to see what we can do to be helpful. I've voted for more than $136 billion in aid to support those communities who've been hit by natural disasters, including Harvey.</p><p>      And in the specific bill that you asked about, the tax relief was not as great as we have seen for those who've been through other natural disasters. I thought we could get a better deal. But I am there for those communities each and every single day. I continue to go back to places like Kashmere Gardens in Houston, Texas, which more than a year later is still not fully rebuilt, and I continue to wonder why Senator Cruz voted against more than $12 billion in FEMA preparedness, knowing full well that we will see more Harveys going forward.</p><p>      Mind you, that was the third 500-year flood in just the last five years. We know that there will be more of these floods coming. And I want to make sure that the people of Texas, especially southeast Texas, are prepared for the next one. That $12 billion also included hundreds of millions of dollars in support for volunteer fire departments, like the one that I visited in Rockport, where of those 20 volunteer firefighters, more than half lost all of their worldly possessions and were sleeping on the floor and in the firehouse as they responded to the emergencies in their communities.</p><p>      So, yes, I will be there. I will work with anyone, anytime, anywhere to make sure that those Texans who need the help to rebuild get it and that we invest in their ability to be resilient for the next storm.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Congressman, that's your time. Thank you. Senator Cruz, you have 90 seconds to respond to that.</p><p>      CRUZ:  Houston's my home town. Hurricane Harvey hit Texas unlike any disaster we've ever seen. It was devastating. I was home with Heidi and my girls during the hurricane, and for months thereafter spent time in virtually every community along the Gulf Coast, two, three, four, five times, working with the state and local officials.</p><p>      I mentioned earlier 171 sheriffs have endorsed my campaign, including 10 Democrats. One of the reasons why the overwhelming majority of elected sheriffs have endorsed my campaign is because many of those sheriffs I worked with hand in hand after Harvey. </p><p>      In the Senate, I helped lead the effort to pass three major disaster relief bills, working hand in hand with John Cornyn, where we improved and expanded those disaster relief bills. And the emergency tax relief that you just referenced was legislation that I authored. I authored, introduced, passed into law, did it jointly with John Cornyn and Marco Rubio. The Cruz-Cornyn-Rubio emergency tax relief gave over $5 billion in emergency tax relief for families impacted by Hurricane Harvey. It passed both houses of Congress overwhelmingly, was signed into law, provided immediate relief for those impacted by Harvey.</p><p>      Only four Texas Democrats voted no on that legislation. One of them was Congressman O'Rourke, the congressman from El Paso. And there was a reason for that. You know, he gave an answer now. He said that it didn't provide enough tax relief. That's not what he said at the time he voted no. At the time he voted no, he said the reason he voted no is that he wanted -- he wanted to focus on...</p><p>      FORGANY:  That's your time, Senator...</p><p>      CRUZ:  ... illegal immigrants instead of hurricane relief.</p><p>      FORGANY:  That's your time. Thank you.</p><p>      CRUZ:  That was his answer at the time. And that doesn't -- so...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      FORGANY:  Representative O'Rourke -- thank you, Senator -- Representative, you get 60 seconds for a rebuttal. Do you regret that vote?</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I don't. I will always see what I can do, work with anyone, anytime, anywhere to do better for Texas. And that was what I was trying to do.</p><p>      But, you know, Senator Cruz mentioned listening to and working with local leaders in Houston. I've listened to and worked with the mayor and the county judge, a Democrat and a Republican, each of whom is still waiting for $1.1 billion awarded to the local governments in community development block grant funding that has still not made its way into the neighborhoods, into the streets, into the homes, into the businesses to rebuild.</p><p>      They need a full-time senator, not somebody running for president who's going to focus on their needs and make sure that that money gets there. They need a full-time senator who would have been at bat for them before the storm on infrastructure projects that they had identified needed funding, but they needed a senator who was going to work for them.</p><p>      Army Corps of Engineers approved projects totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars who did not have an advocate because he wasn't in Texas. He wasn't in Houston. He was in Iowa. He was in New Hampshire. He was running for another office instead of taking care of the concerns and the needs of the people of Texas.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Representative, thank you very much.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator Cruz, a year ago this week, October 18, 2017, you tweeted out the following statement. When it comes to the deficit and debt, it is immoral the debt we have, we have to turn it around, you wrote. Yet two months later, last December, as you just mentioned a moment ago, you voted for the Republican tax plan that the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congressional Budget Office, and many other nonpartisans say will add more than $1 trillion to the deficit. Some people see the tweet and the vote as hypothetical. Are they not?</p><p>      CRUZ:  They are not remotely. I'm proud to have supported the tax cut. The tax cut is producing enormous benefits for the state of Texas and for the country. We're seeing record growth. We're seeing record low unemployment. It's benefiting -- 4 million new jobs in the last two years.</p><p>      And, by the way, one thing that Democrats never seem to understand, if you want to pay down deficit and debt -- and I care passionately about the deficit and debt -- it is immoral the deficit and debt we've racked up -- if you want to do it, the only force strong enough to do that is economic growth. </p><p>      Now, let's go back to a little history. In the 1960s, John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, campaigned on tax cuts, cutting individual tax cuts and the corporate tax rate. He said a rising tide will lift all boats. He passed it and the economy boomed and federal tax revenue went up.</p><p>      In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan campaigned on cutting taxes to get the economy growing. He passed it. The economy boomed and federal tax revenues went up.</p><p>      We did the same thing this time. This time, with this tax cut, we're seeing the results. And today, to date, federal tax revenues have gone up. </p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator...</p><p>      CRUZ:  Federal tax revenues are higher this year than they were last year, without the tax cut.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Respectfully, Senator, I was with you in Iowa. I've heard you on the campaign trail since 2012 saying how bad the deficit is.</p><p>      CRUZ:  Yes.</p><p>      WHITELY:  And this vote would add to the deficit, though.</p><p>      CRUZ:  Jason, no, it wouldn't. That projection is wrong. By the way, that projection also would have said that the Kennedy tax cuts would have added to the deficit and that the Reagan tax cuts would have added to the deficit. The reason we have deficit and debt is not that we cut taxes and spurred the economy. The reason we have deficit and debt is because Congress keeps spending.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that was your time, sir.</p><p>      CRUZ:  That's why we need to pass term limits. It's why we need to pass a balanced budget amendment. We need to stop the out-of-control spending...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time.</p><p>      CRUZ:  ... things like socialized medicine...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      WHITELY:  Ninety second response, Congressman O'Rourke. Ninety second response.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Speaking of balancing budgets, only one of us has with good friends in El Paso started a small business, met that payroll every week, balanced the books, make sure that we delivered for our clients. Only one of us has served at the local government level, every single year balancing the budget, seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats, but as councilmembers entrusted with the fiduciary responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers of El Paso, every single year we did.</p><p>      And for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of $21 trillion in debt, when we're on track to deficit spend to the tune of a trillion dollars a year, he voted to add $2 trillion. And those tax cuts disproportionately will flow to corporations, who are already sitting on record piles of cash, and the already wealthy in a country that is riven with income inequality unseen since the last Gilded Age.</p><p>      Why? In the days just before and just after that vote, Senator Cruz accepted $120,000 from the political action committees who represent the corporate interests that benefited from this tax cut. Why does he vote for this? </p><p>      Why does he vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without your consent? Why does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses 30,000 people to gun violence every year? Follow the money.</p><p>      In each of these cases, if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz, it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupted Congress has become.</p><p>      I don't take PAC money. Not a dime. I always and only represent the people of Texas.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that is your time. Congressman, that is your time. Senator Cruz, 60 second rebuttal.</p><p>      CRUZ:  You know, Congressman O'Rourke is fond of saying he doesn't take PAC money, but the truth is different. For example, the J Street PAC, which is a rabidly anti-Israel PAC, has raised over $160,000 for Congressman O'Rourke because of his many votes against the nation of Israel.</p><p>      Another example, he has a super PAC based up in Dallas that has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars of spending them on ads attacking me and my family. So when he say he doesn't take PAC money, he just lets others do it for him.</p><p>      But let me say more fundamentally, the reason people care about this is they care about who you're fighting for. Consistently, if you look at Congressman O'Rourke's record, every time there is a choice between left-wing national activists and the people of Texas, he goes with the left-wing national activists and he goes with the left-wing national donors.</p><p>      For example, we were talking earlier about his vote for a $10 a barrel tax on oil. That is a great vote if you're raising money in San Francisco. It's a terrible vote if you actually care about jobs in the state of Texas...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time. We want to keep this debate on track here. Let me ask you the next question, though, Senator. Weber Shandwick did a poll this year with almost 70 percent of Americans saying civility is a major problem in America. </p><p>      CRUZ:  Yeah.</p><p>      WHITELY:  And let's talk about the tone of this campaign and what's happened here in the last half-hour, 45 minutes. We all watch as activists chased you and your wife, Heidi, out of the restaurant in D.C., and then, Senator, some say you couldn't even give a political-free compliment to your opponent in the first debate in Dallas. So the question is, what responsibility do you have to bring civility and respect back to the country?</p><p>      CRUZ:  Listen, Jason, I think every one of us has a responsibility to bring civility and respect. That's something I've endeavored to do throughout politics, is to focus on substance, to focus on issues, to focus on record. And so the personal attacks, the going to the gutter that is so common in politics, I try not to engage in.</p><p>      If you look at my disagreements with Congressman O'Rourke, they haven't been personal attacks. They've been his voting record in Congress that has been markedly out of step with the people of Texas. </p><p>      You are right that there is a loss of civility, there is an anger, there is a rage on the far left that is really frightening. You know, the images of...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator...</p><p>      CRUZ:  Hold on. Let me answer -- don't interrupt me, Jason. The images of -- of...</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Whoa.</p><p>      CRUZ:  ... a left-wing mob beating on the doors of the Supreme Court, that's not good for our country. We can disagree while treating each other with respect, while treating each other with civility. I think that's important to do.</p><p>      We can discuss, are tax cuts good or is raising taxes good? That's a discussion we ought to have. But it shouldn't be personal. It shouldn't go down to the gutter. It should focus on actual substance.</p><p>      And let me tell you, I think the lowest point we have seen is the confirmation hearings for Justice Kavanaugh, where we saw Senate Democrats be willing to smear Justice Kavanaugh and his family, be willing to repeat unsupported, uncorroborated allegations and go after him in way that -- that I thought was shameful. </p><p>      It was important that that process be fair, that Dr. Ford get a full and fair opportunity to tell her story, that she be treated with respect, and she was. But it was important...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time.</p><p>      CRUZ:  ... that he be treated with respect, as well, and he was not.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that is your time. Congressman O'Rourke, 90 seconds for a response.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Every year, Allegany College presents an award for civility in American politics. One of the first years, it was awarded to Senator John McCain and Vice President Biden. Another year, it was awarded to the family of late Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And last year, I was lucky enough, fortunate enough to receive that award, along with Will Hurd.</p><p>      Our ability to travel across the country as a Republican and a Democrat in a car and Facebook livestream the whole thing, but then to get to work in Congress and join one another's legislation to do better for our constituents, regardless of the party differences that might otherwise stand between us, was recognized.</p><p>      It's the same kind of approach that I take to just about everything that I do in Congress, everything that I do in life. When we found out that veterans were unable to access mental health care services, that half a million veterans with bad paper discharges were denied the ability to go to the V.A., I worked with my colleague from Colorado, Mike Coffman, though he's a Republican and I'm a Democrat, we were able to bury the differences, compromise -- a four-letter word amongst some in Washington, D.C. -- and find a consensus piece of legislation that passed the House of Representatives 435-0, passed the Senate, as well, and was signed into law by President Donald J. Trump.</p><p>      Now, President Trump is someone with whom I don't agree on everything. But where we could make things better for those veterans, we did it. We buried the differences and we put them aside, and we put this country's interests before us. That's the kind of leadership that we need from Texas going forward. That's the kind of leadership this country deserves.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time. That is your time. Mr. Cruz, in your 60 second rebuttal, I was going to ask you, doesn't the inflammatory rhetoric just exacerbate the situation?</p><p>      CRUZ:  Absolutely. And I think we should focus on substance and not inflammatory rhetoric.</p><p>      You know, I will say, it was striking at this press conference in D.C. about civility, Congressman O'Rourke again repeated his call for impeaching President Trump. That's the very essence of not civility.</p><p>      If we had impeachment next year, we'd see utter chaos. We would see an end to the repeal of the job-killing regulations that's fueling our economic growth. We would see an end to many -- much of the progress we've seen rebuilding our military, making progress on foreign policy. Washington would be consumed by partisan investigations. That's not civility.</p><p>      Let me point out more broadly, it's interesting that Congressman O'Rourke points to a bill that another congressman wrote that he was a co-sponsor of. There's a reason for that. Have you noticed in his campaign, have you noticed in this debate he doesn't talk about what he has accomplished in Congress? Because he has scored political points rather than accomplishing victories for the people of Texas.</p><p>      We've already talked about emergency tax relief in the wake of Harvey that I authored, passed into law. That was bipartisan. We had -- we had Democrats and Republicans...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, that's your time.</p><p>      CRUZ:  That was good for Texas.</p><p>      WHITELY:  That is your time.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Gentlemen, you know, when it comes to the \"Me, Too\" movement, the president said it is a very scary time for young men. Congressman, you're raising sons. What do you tell them?</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I'm raising two sons and a daughter. And I tell each of them that it's critically important that they are treated with respect and that they demand them from everyone in their life and that they treat one another and everyone in their life with respect.</p><p>      I'm very grateful for the leadership that we have seen across this country, in positions of public trust in Congress and people at the neighborhood level, meeting the challenge of this moment. Congress members like Jackie Speier from California, who authored legislation that I co-sponsored that ensures that members of Congress are held to a higher standard, that there's true transparency in their conduct and there's not the ability to cover up, and there's the important training to make sure that everyone in their offices and their lives is treated with respect and a dignity that they deserve.</p><p>      I also support the Violence Against Women's Act that makes sure that we have the resources and the training and the funding to protect the lives of the women in our lives, and in this state and throughout country. Inexplicably, or maybe he'll have an explanation, Senator Cruz voted against the Violence Against Women's Act. </p><p>      We have to make sure that we're more than just talk. We have to have actions that follow this up. We've got to make sure that, for example, when we're talking about women, we're talking about equal pay for equal work. When we're talking about women, we talk about ensuring that they can make their own decisions about their own bodies and have access to the health care that allows them to do that.</p><p>      It means that our rhetoric has to be followed by our actions. And in Senator Cruz, we don't have that today. </p><p>      FORGANY:  Congressman, thank you. In response, Senator, what do you tell your daughters?</p><p>      CRUZ:  I think the \"Me, Too\" movement has done an incredible amount of good for our country. Sexual assault is wrong. Sexual harassment is wrong. And we've seen in recent months powerful men in Hollywood, powerful men in politics, powerful men in journalism, powerful men in business called to account for abominable behavior. I believe everyone, men and women, girls and boys, need to be protected, need to be treated with dignity.</p><p>      And as you noted, I am the father of two girls. I want them -- their rights to be protected. I want them to be valued. </p><p>      I'm also the son of my mom, who graduated from Rice in 1956, went to work at Shell as a computer programmer. She was a professional. Women in the 1950s faced a very difficult climate. My wife, Heidi, my best friend in the world, works in the financial sector, again, always a difficult client -- climate. We need to protect everyone's rights. </p><p>      And let me tell you, when it comes to stopping sexual assault and when it comes to dealing with those who commit them, before I was in the Senate, I was the solicitor general of Texas, the chief lawyer for the state in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. I handled over and over and over again cases dealing with rapists, dealing with those who'd committed sexual assault, dealing with child predators. And it has been a passion of mine.</p><p>      And Congressman O'Rourke mentioned sexual harassment in Congress. Well, I joined with New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand. The two of us were the lead authors on legislation to stop the indefensible practice of secret taxpayer settlements for members of Congress who were harassing their staff. There should be no secret settlements. That should be public.</p><p>      FORGANY:  That's your time, Senator.</p><p>      CRUZ:  And it's important that there be accountability.</p><p>      FORGANY:  Thank you. Congressman, you get 60 seconds for rebuttal.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Listen, I pointed out two specific opportunities for Senator Cruz to do the right thing, one of them being the Violence Against Women Act. Didn't hear a good reason why he failed to support that.</p><p>      Look, you've got somebody -- as I mentioned earlier -- who is all talk and no action. You've got somebody who left the state of Texas within a year of being elected to represent all of us to run for another office. Hasn't been to all the counties of Texas, but has been to all 99 of Iowa. Has missed a quarter of the votes in 2015, missed half of them in 2016.</p><p>      There's only one other senator from either party over the last 25 years who has a worse -- who has a worse record on bipartisanship. In other words, Ted Cruz has a harder time working with members across the aisle than almost anyone else to get anything done.</p><p>      So if he's not showing up in Texas, if he's not showing up in D.C. to vote, who is he showing up for?</p><p>      I want to make sure that whether it is women -- and the issue that you just asked about now -- or any other priority that we have in the state...</p><p>      FORGANY:  Congressman, that's your time.</p><p>      WHITELY:  ... we have a senator who shows up every single day for every single one of us.</p><p>      FORGANY:  That's your time. Thank you.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Gentlemen, let's move on to something different here, too. We have 60 seconds for each of you. We want you to tell us something you've done in the last year that has nothing to do with politics that would give Texans insight to who you are as a person. Senator Cruz, you first.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      CRUZ:  Look, I will say the hardest thing about being in this job is being a dad. My girls are here. At the last -- last debate, Congressman O'Rourke and I talked about that. Both of us are dads of young kids. And it is tough. It is tough.</p><p>      Our girls are 7 and 10. Monday morning leaving is really hard. You know, last year, I was -- helped coach Caroline's girl's basketball team, the fourth grade basketball team. The basketball practices were Sunday afternoons, so I was able to be at the practices.</p><p>      As Caroline will point out many times, in the course of the whole season, I made it to one game. That's not OK with her. By the way, one of the games that I thought I was going to make it to was going to be a Friday night game. I was planning to come back. It was the night of the vote on the tax cut.</p><p>      And so I was in the Senate, and I had to call home and say, Caroline, I'm sorry, I've got to be here to vote on this. Let me tell you, for a fourth grader, the fact that you're voting to cut taxes is not an explanation for why daddy is not at the game.</p><p>      That's really a hard thing. You know, being a dad -- I mean, part of what we do, we call on Facetime and we try to -- we try to carve out every...</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator...</p><p>      CRUZ:  ... Sunday for the family, but that is hard. And I take being a dad really seriously.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator, thank you for sharing. As well to Congressman O'Rourke, 60 seconds.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  You know, I think much of what Senator Cruz just said resonates with me. We've spent the better part of the last 21 months on the road campaigning in every single county of Texas. Don't get to see my kids as much as I want to. I know that Amy takes on the lion's share of the burden, with a child that's just entered sixth grade, another who's in fifth, and Henry, who's in second. </p><p>      Every now and then, we get down in the basement where I have a drum kit that ostensibly was purchased for Henry, but really was for me...</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      ... a PA and an amplifier, and me and the kids will rock out. And Amy allows us to do that for a little while. We go to Ulysses' travel baseball tournaments. That last one was in Las Cruces. I've had them in Alamogordo, as well. </p><p>      Just went with Molly, who is nursing back to life a blind squirrel that was picked up in East Texas, dropped off in El Paso at a wildlife animal rescue run by Ms. Julie, got to meet this blind squirrel who's slowly regaining its sight. </p><p>      You know, Henry, one of the best parts of my day is when I am at home, getting to walk him to school and just talking about what he dreamed about the night before and what he's into this day.</p><p>      So with very little time outside of the campaign or my official job, I spend it with my family.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, thank you for sharing, as well, too.</p><p>      We've asked you both a lot of questions tonight. Now we want to let you guys address Texas voters directly. You both get two minutes for closing statements here. As we mentioned early on, a flip of the coin gives you the final word tonight, Senator Cruz. </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke, you're up first.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Listen, I just want to thank you each for moderating this debate, everyone who has been here to witness it, and all of those who've made this campaign in the election of our lifetime possible.</p><p>      I was talking to Amy tonight about this moment that stayed with me after I first met Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. He's meeting with members of the Armed Services Committee, and he reminded us that the United States historically has enjoyed two principal powers that distinguish us from the rest of the world. One is the power of intimidation, to feel the most awesome military force the world has ever known.</p><p>      The other -- and he thought maybe the greater power -- is the power of inspiration, to continue to be the indispensable nation that lives up to the promise and the potential of our founders, a nation that not just Americans look up to, but the world looks up to.</p><p>      And whether we will remain the inspiration of the world is an open question right now. Walls, Muslim bans, the press as the enemy of the people, taking kids away from their parents after they've survived a horrifying 2,000-mile journey seeking asylum here in this country, the bitterness, the partisanship, the pettiness, the dishonesty that defines so much of the national conversation, we are in desperate need right now of inspiration.</p><p>      But I'll tell you what. Traveling the state of Texas, meeting people regardless of their walk of life, their background, their party affiliation, you have inspired me, you've inspired me to transcend the obstacles, to be the big, courageous, bold, strong match for this moment.</p><p>      On any issue that challenges us, in Texas, where nearly half of the schoolteachers work a second job just to make ends meet, making sure that we're there for them, pay them a living wage, and ensure that they can teach to the child, not the test; in this state of immigrants, making sure that we lead the national conversation, free Dreamers from any fear of deportation; and the least insured state in the country could take the lead on guaranteed, high-quality universal health care.</p><p>      You have inspired me in this race.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Congressman, that's your time.</p><p>      O'ROURKE:  And I'm grateful to have the chance to represent you. Thank you.</p><p>      WHITELY:  That is your time, Congressman. Senator Cruz, two minutes.</p><p>      CRUZ:  The classic question in politics. Are you better off now than you were two years ago? Is Texas? Elections are about choices. Do we continue on the path we're on or do we turn back? </p><p>      The records of Congressman O'Rourke and myself could not be more different. On taxes, I want to cut your taxes. Congressman O'Rourke wants to raise them. On job killing regulations, I want to repeal them. Congressman O'Rourke wants to increase them. On Obamacare, I want to repeal Obamacare, reduce premiums, protect pre-existing conditions, and expand access. Congressman O'Rourke wants socialized medicine, the federal government in charge of your health care and your doctor, which among other things would threaten to bankrupt Medicare.</p><p>      I want to keep the economic boom we're experiencing right now going, moving forward. Congressman O'Rourke wants the next two years to be drawn into the partisan circus of impeachment proceedings against President Trump.</p><p>      Elections are about who we are. Do we choose fear or do we choose hope? I believe in hope. My mom was the first one in her family to go to college, and she was a pioneer professional woman. My dad came from Cuba with nothing, washed dishes making 50 cents an hour, came here seeking the American dream.</p><p>      If someone had approached my dad in 1957 and said 50 years hence your son will be a U.S. senator representing the state of Texas, that teenage immigrant could never have believed it. And yet as I stood on the Senate floor with my hand on my dad's bible, there was my father in the gallery, tears running down his eyes. Only in America.</p><p>      This is a choice about keeping the boom going, keeping -- we have the lowest Hispanic unemployment ever recorded, the lowest African-American unemployment ever recorded. Why would we want to screw that up? We need to defend jobs, defend the Constitution, and secure our borders. </p><p>      WHITELY:  Senator Cruz, that is your time. That is your time, sir. We appreciate it.</p><p>      Mr. Cruz, Mr. O'Rourke, thank you for sharing tonight. We appreciate that. </p><p>      FORGANY:  Thank you very much.</p><p>      WHITELY:  Quick reminder. Our social media response team in Dallas is still...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      WHITELY:  (OFF-MIKE) reminder to our viewers, as well (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2120652804</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5THF-DK21-DY0W-4542-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11315\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bloomberg Government</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 17, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Texas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>O Rourke, Beto</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cruz, Ted</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Reporters</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social networks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political campaigns</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>False information</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congressional elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National debt</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 518210</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 519130</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Energy &amp;

Next hour, Pelosi will be asked live where she stands on impeachment right now. That's when our Manu Raju sits down with her one-on-one. You'll see it here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meantime, my next guest is ready to get the ball rolling. Joining me now is Congressman Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania. He serves as assistant whip and is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressman, thanks for joining me.</p><p>REP. BRENDAN BOYLE (D-PA): Thanks for having me.</p><p>HARLOW: We'll get to the Ways and Means Committee and the president's taxes in a little bit, but first let's start on the issue of impeachment. Listen to the president on that last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You can't impeach somebody when there's never been anything done wrong. President Nixon never got there. He left. I don't leave. There's a big difference, I don't leave.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: All right, well, you called for impeachment proceedings to begin against the president last month. Right now, Speaker Pelosi is not there.</p><p>Why do you think she's wrong?</p><p>BOYLE: Yes, this has been a tough issue for all of my colleagues. It's something that I've been wrestling with for quite some time. And just speaking privately to a number of my colleagues, whether they come down on starting with the impeachment inquiry now or continuing to hold off, I know everyone has agreed that this is a really difficult thing, just because of the size and the weight and the magnitude of it.</p><p>My position for about two and a half years has been clear, and that was to not push for impeachment, to defer to the special counsel's investigation, to work to make sure that that investigation could proceed and come to its natural conclusion. Then, once the report was in front of us, and I did read all 400-plus pages of the report, it's shocking to me that some of my colleagues may not have. I think we have a responsibility to do so. Upon reading that, and then also watching Mueller's press conference on it, it's quite clear that if Donald Trump were not president of the United States, he would have been indicted on at least ten counts of obstruction.</p><p>HARLOW: But two --</p><p>BOYLE: So based on that, I -- I moved and shifted my position and said, we have enough here to officially launch an impeachment inquiry and hearings --</p><p>HARLOW: OK. So -- so you think she's --</p><p>BOYLE: And bring forward the witnesses ourselves.</p><p>HARLOW: You think Speaker Pelosi is wrong on this. That's clear. If you were interviewing --</p><p>BOYLE: Well, wait a minute, you know, no, that's not quite --</p><p>HARLOW: Wait, well, OK, you disagree with her. I'm going to -- I want to understand the why.</p><p>BOYLE: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: You disagree with her. You want impeachment proceedings to be now. Potentially for -- to make a legislative purpose, to make some of these -- more arguments for these documents like -- like the taxes, et cetera. But if you were -- if you were sitting down with her next hour, one-on-one, just like our Manu Raju is, what would you ask her on this front?</p><p>BOYLE: Well, I -- we have those conversations in caucus every single day that we're in D.C. Myself and a number of others have made the position clear that we think there's enough there to launch an impeachment inquiry.</p><p>To be fair for the speaker, though, we're in different roles. I actually would not want her job. It is not an easy one because my role is as the representative of the second district of Pennsylvania to speak for my 700,000-plus constituents in Philadelphia. Speaker Pelosi's role is quite different. She's the head of 235 House Democrats in addition to her own district. That's a different calculus. So her job is to represent me and my constituents, yes --</p><p>HARLOW: So --</p><p>[09:35:07] BOYLE: But also my colleagues who are not in agreement with me on impeachment. HARLOW: Well, that's an interesting point.</p><p>BOYLE: So -- so that's a nuance, a difference. I don't necessarily disagree with her approach because, frankly, she has a different responsibility than I do.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. So is she right in her approach as speaker because she is reflecting then the majority of Americans, 54 percent in our latest polling, who do not want impeachment proceedings against the president at this time? Is she getting it right for the American people while you, at the same time, think you're getting it right being on the other page for your constituents in your district?</p><p>BOYLE: I hope and trust and believe that I'm getting it right on this issue and, God willing, most issues. I have a hard enough time making sure that I'm getting it right for myself than to sit back and Monday morning quarterback any other one of my colleagues. So I'll defer on that.</p><p>I'll just say, let's get the focus, and this is one of the reasons actually why I would like to see the impeachment inquiry, rather than all the focus being on process of what the House of Representatives leadership should be doing right now. We really should have the focus on the criminality that was found by the special counsel's investigation. So that's actually one of the reasons why, whether you label it an impeachment hearing process or just have hearings, let's get on with it, let's get on -- kind of like the hearings that started yesterday, and actually delve into what was found in the report. Let's call forward the witnesses and let's actually make that the focus, because in the end of the day, that's the most important thing, not the sort of backroom process questions.</p><p>HARLOW: I'd like to get your take on where things stand with your committee's demand for the president's in subpoenaing the president's tax returns through the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p><p>So, several members of your committee, Rep. Lloyd Doggett told me on the show a few weeks ago that he supports fining Mnuchin and the IRS secretary $25,000 to $50,000 a day if needed or to be, quote, subject to confinement, that would mean jailing them for not turning over the tax returns.</p><p>Congressman Bill Pascrell Junior said, I would throw the book at these guys, also suggesting fining Mnuchin.</p><p>We have seen the chairman, Representative Neal, more hesitant to take those moves.</p><p>What should your committee do next to get the president's tax returns? Who's right?</p><p>BOYLE: So, first, just to be clear, the law is completely on our side. As we now know, Secretary Mnuchin's own internal lawyers found he had absolutely no discretion to refuse what is clearly stated in the law, and that is to turn over the tax returns once they've been requested by the -- the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. So in terms of what we do now, obviously this is being fought off -- fought out in court.</p><p>I personally happen to agree with Representative Doggett. We have the ability to fine, I believe, upwards of $25,000 a day, civilly. I think we should do that.</p><p>What this administration is doing, and it's not just on this matter, they are completely refusing every single subpoena and request for testimony that Congress has launched. That is completely unprecedented. And that is really dangerous. And here's why. Put aside the issues for a second, tax returns, what the special counsel's investigation found as it relates to Russia. Just for a constitutional matter, whether or not Congress is going to continue, as it has for two centuries, as a co-equal branch of government. That is really what is at stake. If we suddenly lose the ability to have oversight over the executive, that will completely change the balance of power and almost create a monarchy like system --</p><p>HARLOW: So --</p><p>BOYLE: Where we have a completely unchecked executive. Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill should both be outraged about what this administration is doing.</p><p>HARLOW: So -- all right, so you're saying fine Steven Mnuchin.</p><p>BOYLE: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: I assume you would hold that also for the IRS secretary.</p><p>BOYLE: Correct.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes or no, would you throw Steven Mnuchin in jail? Should he be confined?</p><p>BOYLE: I think when you do that, you run into a lot more sort of practical problems.</p><p>HARLOW: OK.</p><p>BOYLE: I -- once you start fining someone $25,000 a day, I certainly -- I don't have $25,000 even for one day.</p><p>HARLOW: All right, he --</p><p>BOYLE: So I think you get someone's attention, even someone as stinking rich as Steven Mnuchin.</p><p>HARLOW: Congressman Brendan Boyle, appreciate your time. Thanks.</p><p>BOYLE: All right, thank you.</p><p>[09:39:29] All right, so just a day after being shot, Boston Red Sox legend David Ortiz is now back in the U.S. for treatment, as police in the Dominican Republic search for any other suspects. We're live in both places.</p><p>HARLOW: All right, welcome back. I'm Poppy Harlow in New York.</p><p>You are looking at images of Monday morning there in Boston. This is overnight, David Ortiz, legendary baseball player, \"Big Papi,\" arriving at a Boston hospital after being shot in the Dominican Republic. A Red Sox team plane picked him up from Santa Domingo and flew him in last night. You'll remember, Ortiz was shot in the back Sunday after a gunman ambushed him at a bar.</p><p>We're covering this story from the Dominican Republic and from Boston, which is where we start with our Alexandra Field.</p><p>What do we know about his condition this morning?</p><p>ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Poppy, he's in Mass General. He is recovering. And certainly the Red Sox worked quickly to bring him from Santa Domingo to Boston. He retired from baseball, his number has been retired by the team, but he will always be part of the Red Sox family. Certainly they're showing that he is one of their own.</p><p>Look, this was a serious surgery that he underwent in the Dominican Republic. As you point out, he took a bullet in the back. That bullet traveled into his stomach. The doctors in Santa Domingo rushed him into emergency surgery where they were working to repair his intestines, his colon, his gallbladder. They were the ones who initially pronounced that he was out of danger and that he was stable. It was at that point that the Red Sox were able to send in a plane to bring him back to Boston.</p><p>[09:45:19] We understand that when he woke up from the surgery, Poppy, he said that he wanted to see his family. He wanted to see his doctors in Boston. Also, his wife, who was in Boston at the time.</p><p>So he is back here now in the care of the doctors at Mass General. Meanwhile, here in Boston, so many fans, so many people who hold him in the highest regard sending their well wishes, sending their thoughts, sending their prayers. Of course, there was a moment to honor him at home at Fenway Park, where the Red Sox play, just last night. Everyone in that stadium wishing a speedy recovery for \"Big Papi,\" David Ortiz.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, absolutely. What a scene there, seeing them all stand for him last night.</p><p>Alex, thanks for the reporting.</p><p>So while Ortiz is recovering in Boston, police in the Dominican Republic are looking for a second suspect in this shooting.</p><p>Let's bring in our colleague, Patrick Oppmann. He is in Santa Domingo this morning.</p><p>So police have one man in custody, but they believe there's another on the run? PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. They think there was a driver of the motorcycle and they think there was a gunman. And while they say they have no updates for us right now, they say the investigation is very much continuing. They have one man in custody who was actually tackled by bystanders. Police say his name is Eddy Vladimir Felice Garcia (ph). We have a photo of him as well. Police say that he is the man you see in video -- the video that passer-byers shot of getting beaten down, basically almost lynched by people who were just so irate.</p><p>And this really speaks to the love that Dominicans feel for David Ortiz. He's a legend here. He's someone who not only was a great baseball player, but has come back, he spends part of the time here -- part of the year here, has a foundation and gives a lot back to this country. So people are just shocked.</p><p>And while they say there's no motive yet, they do not believe it was a robbery. Every time you ask somebody here, what could have caused this, they say there's no explanation, that he's someone who is just so beloved. Police say they will get to the bottom of it.</p><p>HARLOW: OK, let's hope they do. Thank you very much, Patrick Oppmann, for the reporting.</p><p>Ahead for us, checking big tech's power, or at least trying to. This afternoon, a House committee will dig into new ways to limit some of Silicon Valley's biggest companies.</p><p>[09:51:56] HARLOW: All right, in just a few hours, Congress takes on big tech. This is not a first, but it's important. The House Judiciary Committee is set to hold what this time around is the first of several hearings that lawmakers are holding to try to limit the power, at least look at limiting the power of the biggest tech companies in this country, Amazon, Google, FaceBook, Apple. Today's hearing will focus specifically on what some see as anti-competitive practices, as newspaper lobbyists are pushing a bill they say would even the playing field.</p><p>Our chief media correspondent, Brian Stelter, host of \"Reliable Sources,\" joins me now.</p><p>Why is today important?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Because it is the beginning of a new phase in examining big tech. There's really two things going on at once in Washington, right, Poppy, you've got the Trump administration, the DOJ, the FTC, starting to think about examining Google and FaceBook in a much more serious way, regulating these companies because they've become so big. Then, over on the House side, a Democratic controlled House, you have David Cicilline and other lawmakers starting this series of hearings about the power that Google and FaceBook and Amazon and Apple have. And today is the first of those hearings. There's a little bit of rivalry going on between the Trump administration and the Democrats, both, though, have the same interest. They're both looking at big tech.</p><p>HARLOW: Well, that's -- that's what's so interesting is this is this rare area of total bipartisan agreement, pretty much other than the minutia, Republicans and Democrats arguing they think big tech is too powerful, too big. Whether you break them up or you regulate them, that's the question.</p><p>But the CEOs of these companies, the Google CEO, Sundar, Pichai, Amazon's CEO, FaceBook, Twitter, they have all said publicly, at least, Brian, that they welcome more regulation.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, that they welcome the scrutiny. And it's all about what exactly the regulations are that have helped them.</p><p>HARLOW: But do they -- do they really want like GDPR in Europe?</p><p>STELTER: No, no, they do not. I think the reality is, these companies believe that they need to be as big as they are, and that consumers benefit as a result. And we're going to hear that argument in the months to come from all of these media and these tech companies.</p><p>Today, though, it's interesting, we're seeing the media companies speak out. All these newspaper publishers are coming to Capitol Hill arguing for a bill that would let them negotiate collectively to work in an exemption of anti-trust laws to go against Google and FaceBook. So they're going to promote that law to this bill today.</p><p>There are both Republican and Democratic co-sponsors of this bill in both the House and the Senate. So we may see a rare bipartisan show of support for the newspaper industry going up against Google and FaceBook.</p><p>HARLOW: That's really interesting.</p><p>STELTER: So that's today.</p><p>And then there's going to be a series of these hearings and we're going to, I think, be hearing about this scrutiny for months. The question is whether the lawmakers is more bark than bite. They want to talk about big tech, President Trump does also, but are they actually going to do anything.</p><p>HARLOW: Listen -- let's listen to President Trump. So he called into CNBC, as you know, yesterday morning for 27 minutes, and he was asked an important question, do you think big tech, Google, Amazon, the like, are too big and do they need to be broken up? He didn't answer that, but here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, I can tell you they discriminate against me. You know, people talk about collusion. The real collusion is between the Democrats and these companies because they were so against me during my election run.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:55:00] HARLOW: Look, Google's CEO was questioned about this in Congress, was there a bias in the algorithm? He kept saying no, no, no. There's no evidence for what the president is saying there, is there?</p><p>STELTER: There's not evidence that the tech companies are trying to challenge President Trump, that the algorithms are against him. He does take this all very personally, though. His interest in big tech regulation might be about his personal concerns. But, more importantly, there's a lot of scrutiny at these companies right now and that's probably a good thing. Let's see what these lawmakers decide to do, what President Trump and the Democrats to. But it's a good thing to examine the power that these companies have.</p><p>HARLOW: Brian, thank you.</p><p>STELTER: Thanks.</p><p>HARLOW: Chief media correspondent Brian Stelter, we appreciate it.</p><p>STELTER: Thanks.</p><p>HARLOW: Joe Biden going after the president hard as the two men crisscross Iowa today. They're just like 100 miles apart from one another. We're covering it from all angles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019061102CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9Y-MDK1-JB20-G3MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2915\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>BOSTON RED SOX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Brendan Boyle</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nancy Pelosi</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Steven Mnuchin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Taxes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>IRS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>David Ortiz</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Boston</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Red Sox</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sports</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dominican Republic</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FaceBook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Twitter</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000112</classCode><className>ARRESTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkzMEJFRkNCRUQwNEIyOEE3QTBDOEFFM0ZDRDg0NzU</classCode><className>Arrests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000892</classCode><className>IMPEACHMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjU1Q0FGMTcyM0M5NDQzMkIxQ0Y0NUFFQ0VGRjQ0MjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwQTI5QTZCNDQ4NEM2MUI3NTM4MUYzMDgyRDQwQzE</classCode><className>Contracts Clause</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Ed Case, D-Hawaii, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Would confirm that internet platforms like AirBnB can be held liable for advertising such rentals</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Congressman Ed Case (Hawai'i - District 1) introduced on Friday H.R. 4232, a measure to confirm that Internet platforms who knowingly market illegal short-term vacation rentals can be held liable under state and local law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His \"Protecting Local Authority and Neighborhoods\" (PLAN) Act would end abusive litigation by Internet-based short-term rental platforms like AirBnb, HomeAway, VRBO, Flipkey, and others attempting to avoid accountability for profiting from illegal rentals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Over the past decade-plus, the short-term vacation rental industry has exploded through these platforms,\" said Case.</p><p>\"While some communities welcome these rentals, which is largely conducted in residential neighborhoods, many others are concerned with several negative consequences.\"</p><p>\"These consequences include the loss of affordable housing as residential units are converted to transient accommodations for tourists,\" said Case. \"And many of the owners and operators of these units are failing to comply with basic consumer safety, public accommodations and tax requirements that the legal lodging industry has had to follow in order to do conduct its business.\"</p><p>\"As a result of these negative impacts, states and local governments from Hawai'i to Maine are updating their land use laws to more tightly regulate short-term rental activity including liability for the platforms, which has triggered lawsuits to challenge these regulations by the online platforms who advertise these short-term rentals.\" Case noted lawsuits that have been filed in a number of jurisdictions including New York City, Boston, Miami, Portland in Oregon, Anaheim, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami Beach, Palm Beach and Santa Monica.</p><p>Case said the PLAN Act would amend federal law to make clear that this statute does not shield Internet-based platforms that facilitate bookings of illegal short-term rentals. Currently, these platforms claim that Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act preempts local efforts to stop them from listing and booking illegal rentals.</p><p>\"Platforms would also be held accountable if they fail to stop booking illegal rentals after receiving notice from a private property owner that short-term rentals are prohibited at that location,\" said Case.</p><p>The Hawai'i Chapter of the American Hotel &amp;#38; Lodging Association released a statement in support. Hawai'i Chapter spokesman Kekoa McClellan said \"The PLAN Act will put a stop to the litany of lawsuits filed by hosting platforms who use the courts to shield the brokering of illegal short-term rentals in residential communities across Hawai'i.\"</p><p>\"These illegal short-term rental operators have no aloha for our way of life, take jobs away from locals, and drive up the cost of housing for all of us who actually call Hawai'i home,\" said McClellan. \"We stand with Congressman Case in his fight to protect our neighborhoods, and communities across the country from the explosion of these illegal rentals through the introduction of the PLAN Act.\"</p><p>The Hawai'i Chapter of the AHLA counts 150 members, along with 110,000 employees of members throughout the state. McClellan says other Hawai'i organizations and individuals join in the statement from the Hawai'i Chapter of the AHLA including Save O'ahu's Neighborhoods, Hawai'i Good Neighbor and the Kuli'ou'ou - Kalani Iki Neighborhood Board.</p><p>The national organization of the AHLA also released a statement in support. \"For too long, these Big Tech short-term rental platforms have been hiding behind this antiquated law in order to bully and threaten legal action against local elected officials who are simply trying to protect their residents from illegal rentals that are destroying neighborhoods and access to affordable housing,\" said Chip Rogers, President and CEO of the national American Hotel &amp;#38; Lodging Association. \"These Big Tech rental platforms are invoking a loophole in a federal law to snub their noses at local government leaders across the country, while continuing to profit from illegal business transactions.\"</p><p>Rogers continues \"From an industry perspective, we simply want platforms like Airbnb and HomeAway to abide by the same laws that the hotel industry adheres to, as well as every other law-abiding business, from main street in small towns to central business districts in major cities. Congress should not allow Big Tech rental platforms to operate above the law. We applaud Congressman Case and his bipartisan legislation which will make clear that unlawful short-term rentals and illegal business transactions are not protected under federal law.\"</p><p>The Asian American Hoteliers Association (AAHOA) also issued a statement in support of the measure.</p><p>\"America's hoteliers support Rep. Case's effort to empower state and local governments and their ability to regulate short-term rentals,\" said Rachel Humphrey, President and CEO of the AAHOA. \"This legislation clarifies Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) to prevent the short-term rental industry's willful violations of state and local regulations thoughtfully crafted by lawmakers to protect their communities.\" Humphrey goes on to say that \"Section 230 is intended to protect bloggers and similar website hosts from liability for objectionable third-party generated content posted to their sites, not multi-billion-dollar corporations that profit from the illicit rentals that their online platforms facilitate. Competition thrives on a level playing field, and AAHOA's members are grateful to Congressman Case for standing up for small businesses with this legislation.\"</p><p>From Maui, County Councilmember Tamara Paltin also weighed in, saying \"Online platforms allowing illegal vacation rentals have negatively affected our neighborhoods and communities. Maui County's residents want the issue to be resolved, and this legislation is a good step in the right direction by protecting and preserving home rule for local municipalities.\"</p><p>NOTE: Serving the hospitality industry for more than a century, the American Hotel &amp;#38; Lodging Association (AHLA) is the largest national association solely representing all segments of the eight million jobs the U.S. lodging industry supports, including brands, hotel owners, REITs, chains, franchisees, management companies, independent properties, bed and breakfasts, state hotel associations and industry suppliers. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., AHLA proudly represents a dynamic hotel industry of more than 54,000 properties that supports $1.1 trillion in U.S. sales and generates nearly $170 billion in taxes to local, state and federal governments.</p><p>NOTE: AAHOA is the largest hotel owners association in the world. The over 18,500 AAHOA members own almost one in every two hotels in the United States. With billions of dollars in property assets and hundreds of thousands of employees, AAHOA members are core economic contributors in virtually every community. AAHOA is a proud defender of free enterprise and the foremost current-day example of realizing the American Dream</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6849865 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6849865</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1D-99N1-DYG2-R279-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1205\"/><timeReceived>7:41 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Kathy Castor, D-Florida, issued the following news release on Jan. 30:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor (FL14) introduced the PRotecting the Information of our Vulnerable Children and Youth Act (Kids PRIVCY Act), H.R. 5703, to strengthen the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Castor's bill requires opt-In consent for all individuals under 18 and establishes a first-of-its-kind protected class of \"Young Consumers\" ages 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Online and digital technology, tracking and data gathering have outpaced current privacy protections for children and consumers,\" said Castor. \"Companies shouldn't be allowed to unreasonably use and abuse our children's personal information, yet many companies have been violating the minimal privacy protections in place today, while devices and applications have become more sophisticated in targeting kids. The Kids PRIVCY Act will update the COPPA to provide families with the necessary tools to keep our kids safe and protect their personal privacy.\"</p><p>The legislation specifically strengthens privacy protections for children by:</p><p>* Requiring Opt-In Consent for all Individuals Under 18: Companies must obtain specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent before collecting, retaining, selling, sharing, or using a young consumer or child's personal information.</p><p>* Creating a Protected Class of \"Young Consumers\" Ages 13-17: For the first time in statute, the bill provides protection for teenagers 13-17, allowing them to control who collects their personal information and what companies can do with it.</p><p>* Banning Companies from Providing Targeted Advertisements to Children: Prohibits companies from targeting children based on their personal information and behavior.</p><p>* Creating a Right to Access, Correct, and Delete Personal Information: Companies must provide individuals the opportunity to access, correct, or delete their personal information at any time.</p><p>* Protecting Additional Types of Information: Expands the type of information explicitly covered to include physical characteristics, biometric information, health information, education information, contents of messages and calls, browsing and search history, geolocation information, and latent audio or visual recordings.</p><p>* Requiring User-Friendly Privacy Policies: Companies must make publicly available privacy policies that are clear, easily understood, and written in plain and concise language.</p><p>* Limiting Disclosure to Third Parties: The bill prohibits companies from sharing personal information without consent. Furthermore, it creates additional duties companies must comply with before disclosing any personal information with third parties.</p><p>* Requiring Reasonable Data Security Policies, Practices, and Procedures: Requires companies to have a written security policy, point of contact for information security management and processes to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities.</p><p>* Prohibiting Industry Self-Regulation: Repeals dangerous safe harbor provision that allow for lax enforcement and rubberstamping of potentially unlawful practices.</p><p>* Strengthening FTC Enforcement: Raises the maximum allowable civil penalty per violation by 50 percent and allows the FTC to pursue punitive damages.</p><p>* Providing for Parental Enforcement: Parents will be able to bring civil actions to help enforce the bill and any resulting regulations.</p><p>* Banning Forced Arbitration: In a much-needed reversal of current law, companies will no longer be able force their consumers to waive their right to sue.</p><p>\"We applaud and thank Rep. Castor for her thoughtful efforts to protect children and teens online. This bill would provide much needed updates to COPPA, including prohibiting behavioral ad targeting to children, extending privacy protections to teenagers, and ensuring companies cannot pretend they don't see kids on their sites. It would also dramatically enhance enforcement, limiting the ability of companies to take advantage of the FTC's limited bandwidth and skirt the law,\" said James P. Steyer, CEO and founder of Common Sense.</p><p>\"Rep. Castor's bill gives children and teens real safeguards in our data-driven digital surveillance world. All children under 18 will have automatic built-in protections whenever they download a new app, play a game, use social media on mobile devices or visit a website. Parents will be able to enforce these rights in the courts directly. This important legislation adds new teeth to the law we helped enact in 1998--the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. It will prohibit target marketing to children under 13 and limit other problematic advertising practices that companies have been able to use without any oversight or accountability. Online companies will be less able to evade their obligations to protect the privacy of young people. Our hope is that the House will support this bill and merge it with the Senate's Markey/Hawley COPPA 2.0 proposal to produce strong pro-kids federal privacy legislation,\" said Katharina Kopp, Deputy Director, Center for Digital Democracy.</p><p>\"We applaud Representative Castor for this important update of COPPA. Her legislation rightly recognizes that no child under 13 should be targeted by manipulative data-driven marketing and that teens deserve their own special protections. Just as importantly, the bill contains important enforcement mechanisms including a private right of action for parents that will make it much harder for Big Tech to write off COPPA penalties as the cost of doing business. We now have two serious legislative proposals - Representative Castor's in the House and the Markey/Hawley bill in the Senate - that would offer children and teens the protections they need on mobile and online platforms. We look forward to working with members of both chambers to move these bills forward,\" said Josh Golin, Executive Director, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.</p><p>\"The internet and its role in the lives of children and youth is vastly different today than it was at COPPA's passing in 1998. Congresswoman Castor's bill to amend COPPA is a necessary step to ensure the protection of this vulnerable population, especially in its establishment of rights to access, correct, and delete information collected on children and youth online,\" said Dr. Brandie Nonnecke, Director, CITRIS Policy Lab, UC Berkeley.

David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David N. Cicilline (RI-01) today announced a bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets. The investigation will include a series of hearings held by the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law on the rise of market power online, as well as requests for information that are relevant to the investigation.</p><p>\"The growth of monopoly power across our economy is one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today. Market power in digital markets presents a whole new set of dangers,\" said Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David N. Cicilline (D-RI). \"After four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases, it is critical that Congress step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or whether we need new legislation to respond to this challenge.\"</p><p>The Committee's investigation will focus on three main areas:</p><p>Documenting competition problems in digital markets;</p><p>Examining whether dominant firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct; and</p><p>Assessing whether existing antitrust laws, competition policies, and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these issues.</p><p>\"The open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online,\" said Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). \"But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications. The Committee has a rich tradition of conducting studies and investigations to assess the threat of monopoly power in the U.S. economy. Given the growing tide of concentration and consolidation across our economy, it is vital that we investigate the current state of competition in digital markets and the health of the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>\"Big Tech plays a huge role in our economy and our world,\" said Ranking Member Collins (R-GA). \"As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive. Our bipartisan look at competition in the digital markets gives us the chance to answer these questions and, if necessary, to take action. I appreciate the partnership of Chairman Nadler, Subcommittee Chairman Cicilline and Subcommittee Ranking Member Sensenbrenner on these important issues\"</p><p>\"Technology has become a crucial part of Americans' everyday lives,\" said Antitrust Subcommittee Ranking Member Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI). \"As the world becomes more dependent on a digital marketplace, we must discuss how the regulatory framework is built to ensure fairness and competition. I believe these hearings can be informative, but it is important for us to avoid any predetermined conclusions. I thank Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, and Chairman Cicilline as we begin these bipartisan discussions.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6746430 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6746430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-BSV1-DYG2-R35H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The House overwhelmingly passing a broad resolution condemning many forms of hate, including anti-Semitism, but also anti-Muslimism discrimination. The resolution did not mention Omar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining me now is Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell: of Florida who serves on the Judiciary Committee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congresswoman, it's great to have you on the show. Thanks for taking the time.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL (D), FLORIDA: Good morning, Jim. Thank you for having me.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Let me ask you first about this vote here. There was tremendous debate inside the party about this. The final resolution condemn all forms of hate. And I think a lot of our viewers can understand that. But of course the spark for this were the comments by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. And why was her name or any specific mention of those comments left out?</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: I think that it's important for us to stand together in unity. And that's what we did yesterday when we voted for that resolution. We are standing in -- against all forms of hate, whether it's anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, xenophobia.</p><p>I actually find it interesting, Jim, that we had over 20 Republicans that voted against it. And I don't think that we need to target any individual. I think that, as a caucus, we need to stand united. And you saw what happened yesterday. All of us voted for this resolution. And it's just troubling when I saw some of the members on the other side that voted against it.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Of course, one of the members who did was Steve King, who has his own issues with bigoted comments.</p><p>What is there explanation? And what is your message to the Republican who voted no on this anti-hate resolution? MUCARSEL-POWELL: I think that what we've seen from this White House and this administration is that they have used hateful words to attack people, like myself, immigrant, other people of color. And we need to show the American people that our words matter, that we are held to a higher standard. And my suggestion is for them to understand that we are sending a mixed message when you're sending -- when you're voting against a resolution that is clearly standing against hate.</p><p>I can't speak for any of them that voted against it, but I do worry that it continues to exasperate the problem that we have coming from this White House and this president, which is to use hateful words against people like myself.</p><p>SCIUTTO: On another issue for the Democratic Party, you have a -- you have a debate over really economic policy, over the direction of the party, how far to the left, particularly as you have the 2020 election coming up. You are one of more than 40 Democratic lawmakers who flipped a seat, a district, from red to blue, in a very tight race there. And as you know, the folks like yourself who flipped those districts are pretty moderate, right, and the party made a deliberate decision to run candidates -- moderate candidates with moderate positions.</p><p>Are you concerned that as some in the party pull the party to the left, including people from safe Democratic -- safe blue districts, that that's a danger for the party, not just in the House, but for the presidency in 2020?</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: Jim, I'm not going lie to you. I mean I do think that we can't have on -- extremes on either side. I don't think that's what the American people want. I think that what they're looking for is for government to work and it is why today we are actually voting on a very significant piece of legislation, the For The People Act, HR-1, which is restoring the faith in our democracy.</p><p>And I want -- I think that we all agree that we want the things that some of the progressives are bringing up ideas that we all support, which is being very bold and aggressive and tackling issues that affect climate. Being bold and aggressive lowering healthcare costs. But it's a matter of finding common ground. And I do think that -- you know, we've only been here for about sixty days and there are some learning curves for a lot of us. And --</p><p>SCIUTTO: You said extremes -- just to be clear what you're referencing, you said extremes on both side. Are you concerned that there -- that there are extremes, extremists, if you want to use that term, in your own party pulling the party too far to the left?</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: Well, you know, I -- it's -- I'm not saying that they are right now, but words matter. And sometimes those words that are being used could be seen as an extreme position on an issue. And I think that we as Americans, you know, we're 365 million Americans. We all come from different backgrounds. It's one of the great things about my party, that we have a huge tent. Healthy debate is good. We need to be discussing these issues. [09:35:05] But what we need to do is restore faith in our government. And it's important for us to be united. I think that resolution showed that yesterday. We are united. Yes, we do have differences. We come from very different backgrounds, different districts, different experiences. I was born in Ecuador. I'm an immigrant. I bring a completely different perspective as it relates, for example, to Venezuela.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: And so, you know, and it's OK to have these healthy debates.</p><p>I do feel optimistic that as we have these conversations, I see people understanding where all -- where we are all coming from. And I can tell you from my own personal experience talk about Venezuela to my caucus, bringing that perspective.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Let me ask you about -- I do want to ask you about Venezuela because John Bolton said just in the last 24 hours that all options are on the table. You've heard the president speak publicly about military options there.</p><p>I wonder if it's your concern that the policy of the U.S. -- and I know you have a very strong position against the Maduro government -- but is the policy of the U.S. now regime change in Venezuela? And do you support that?</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: Look, I have to tell you, and I'll start from the beginning, which is my statement. Maduro is an illegitimate regime. We need to support the international organizations, have supported Guaido as the interim president.</p><p>What I don't like to see from the White House, from the Trump administration and from some other Republicans from -- that are using this issue as a political tool to gain points in Florida specifically. I have very good friends that have had to leave Venezuela. I have some family members that live in Venezuela. And what we need to do is put a lot of pressure on this regime.</p><p>I oppose military intervention. And our caucus opposes it. We just had a conversation about that a couple of days ago. But what we do support is humanitarian aid, individualized sanctions, asking the United Nations to work very closely with the American government to put pressure on the Maduro regime.</p><p>So we are watching very closely. And things can change from one minute to the next. But I think the momentum is now to put the pressure on the Maduro regime.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Congresswoman, appreciate you having -- having you on the show. Thanks so much. We look forward to welcoming you back.</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: Thank you. Thank you, Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Five years ago, today, MH-370 left Malaysia for China. There's still no sign of the plane or its passengers? Can something like this happen again? It's still a question, believe it or not. We'll have more.</p><p>[09:41:50] SCIUTTO: This morning, millions of Venezuelans are without power several hours after a crippling blackout began in Caracas and then swept throughout the country. Nationwide schools and businesses are now closed. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is blaming the embattled Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, for the outage, tweeting, quote, no food, no medicine, now no power. Next, no Maduro.</p><p>CNN's Patrick Oppmann is live in Caracas. Of course daytime there now.</p><p>Patrick, this blackout just the latest hardship for Venezuelans. You really get a sense of a country falling apart there. Just basic necessities not available.</p><p>PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And it doesn't get more basic than electricity. Hospitals, schools, people's homes without electricity and largely without water. Just a surreal scene this morning to see thousands of people walking to work because the metro was broken. Of course without electricity you can't gas up your car. Public transportation is falling apart.</p><p>So it really is a sense of a country falling apart, especially when the government, last night, when, you know, nearly 18 hours ago when the crisis first began, the power went out, they said they'd have the power back on very soon. That was just another broken promise though, Jim.</p><p>And the government here is, of course, as they always do, blaming the United States, saying that it was an act of sabotage. But people we've talked to that know something about the electrical grid here say that it's just not possible. That it's a very old, poorly maintained electrical grid and for years people have been warning this could happen. Now apparently it has.</p><p>Venezuelans simply want to know when the power will come back on. And no word yet from the government on when that will take place.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes, interesting how it feeds those narratives and conspiracy theories, right, about what the U.S. is up to there.</p><p>Patrick Oppmann, thanks very much.</p><p>SCIUTTO: It was, if you can believe it, five years ago today that Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappeared en route to China from Malaysia with some 239 passengers and crew on board. Nearly 26 countries joined in that search and rescue mission. Crews found nothing in the end, amazingly. The official search was called off back in January of 2017, but now the Malaysian government is telling families that it will continue the search.</p><p>CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest is following these developments. Of course, Richard, you were on top of this throughout those months following the disappearance five years ago. I mean is there any hope that if they do keep the search they're going find anything? Do they even know where to search?</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: They do and that area of searching gets ever narrower. The only disappointing part, Jim, is that last year there was a private search done by a private company and that was on a no find no fee basis. But the Malaysian government didn't renew their contract to do that, or at least their approvals to do that. So that came to an end.</p><p>And there are people who want to go out there to search. There are private companies that will do it. But they need permission. And so far that has been lacking. Or at least they need cooperation.</p><p>There is geopolitics involved here at the very highest levels. And, Jim, until those are solved, then it's unlikely that it will actually get another search underway.</p><p>[09:45:01] SCIUTTO: I mean I remember when you and I and others were talking about this five years ago, what -- a frequent question was, listen, you know, I lose my iPhone, you know, I can find that, right? I mean there are systems. Why don't planes have, you know, basic systems. They're giant, expensive pieces of technology with a lot of lives onboard. Is that going to change?</p><p>QUESTION: It's changed. It has already changed. New rules came in at the international level from IKO (ph) that mandated the so called reporting time. And many airlines like Emirates and others went much tighter, reporting every few minutes. And now there's even new technology that allows satellite reporting every couple of seconds or even twice a second in one case.</p><p>But to the fundamental point, why don't we have real-time tracking, why aren't the satellites constantly watching and reporting like radar? It's simply too expensive. The data band and the bandwidth simply isn't there. And so you do what's next, which is the planes report as often as they can and that can be extrapolated into exactly where the plane is at any given moment.</p><p>SCIUTTO: But help me understand that, because I know there's always this rush to find the black boxes, as we call them, though they're orange, you know, in the midst of this. You know, if we can -- and it sounds probably over simplistic, but if I could have Wi-Fi on the plane, why isn't the plane constantly sending a stream of information that's important, can help folks figure out what's happening not only with that plane but what might have caused an accident. Why isn't that happening today?</p><p>QUEST: It is. They're working on it even as we speak. And there have been enormous -- remember, you can't just do one thing for one airline. You have to set regulatory standards that everybody is then going follow, which will ensure that it will actually work and it will actually be robust. I'm sounding like a bureaucrat here, but that's the reasons why it's taken so long. There are two things with black boxes. One, ejectable black boxes. Airbus is working on a system where it ejects from the plane the moment it senses something is wrong. And the second, of course, is constant data streaming. That's more likely. That's already happening in some cases. There will be a lot more of that in the future.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Richard Quest, thanks very much.</p><p>A reminder, tonight on CNN, a special look at the past five years, \"Vanished: The Mystery of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370.\" It will air tonight at 10:00 Eastern Time only here on CNN.</p><p>And breaking news, just this hour, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren says that the tech giants FaceBook, Google and others are simply too big. She wants to break then up. Her plan coming up.</p><p>[09:51:58] SCIUTTO: Welcome back.</p><p>The breaking news, Elizabeth Warren, candidate for president, wants to split apart big tech companies. First up, Amazon, FaceBook, Google. She says that these major companies are reducing competition, squashing small businesses. The senator will take her plan to supporters at a presidential campaign event today.</p><p>CNN political correspondent MJ Lee joins me now with more.</p><p>You know, she's not entirely on her own here. I speak to folks in the intelligence agencies who say that these companies may need regulation in some form. But the idea of splitting them up, tell us what she's thinking about here.</p><p>MJ LEE, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, no, Jim, this is a big proposal coming out from Elizabeth Warren this warning, forcing big tech companies to split up or break apart. We're talking about companies like Amazon, like FaceBook and Google. And it essentially says that certain tech companies, if they have annual revenues of $25 billion or more, either need to split up or spin off certain parts of their companies.</p><p>In plain English you can understand this as, if you're a tech company that does too many things -- so, for example, if you are Amazon, you can't both be the marketplace and also be the company that sells things on the marketplace. You essentially need to choose one thing and not do too many things.</p><p>Another huge component of this proposal is that it would unwind very high-profile tech mergers. So we're talking about mergers that you're very familiar with, like Amazon and Whole Foods or FaceBook and Instagram. So that is a big second part of Elizabeth Warren's tech policy proposal that's out this morning.</p><p>And the political implications, of course, are going to be huge, as you noted. We are going to see folks in Silicon Valley, executives, investors, not be very happy about this. But, in the meantime, on the other hand, we are going to see progressive activists and leaders, consumer advocates probably be very happy about this because this is an issue that they have been talking about for a while.</p><p>As you noted, Jim, we are going to see Elizabeth Warren here in New York, on Long Island City, later today. And we are told that she is going to talk about this there in the rally. And significant too because, remember, Long Island City is where we saw Amazon having to pull out of their plans to build a second headquarters there when they face so much backlash, especially from political activists and leaders. So just all goes to show that this is probably going to be a very big issue heading into the 2020 election, Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: No question. And it raises the question, though, how she proposes to do it. Is she talking about legislation? Is she talking about court orders here? Something that I know we're going to continue to follow. And MJ Lee is going to continue to follow.</p><p>This is the president. He spoke just a short time ago to reporters on his departure for Alabama and then Mar-a-Lago. Have a listen.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are seeing wages rise more than they have at any time for a long, long time. Wages are going up, first time for many years. I talked about it during the campaign. For over 20 years. So I'm happy about that.</p><p>The economy is very, very strong. If you look at the stock market over the last few months, it's been great. And certainly since my election, it's up -- getting close to 50 percent, the stock market. So we're obviously very happy with that.</p><p>[09:55:14] We will -- I think as soon as these trade deals are done, if they get done, and we're working with China. We'll see what happens. But I think you're going to see a very big spike.</p><p>A lot of people are waiting to see what happens with the China deal. Mexico/Canada is done. We'll be submitting to Congress very shortly. And that's a great deal for the United States. So we're very happy about that.</p><p>And I am now, as you know, going to Alabama. Some of you are joining me. But I look forward to it. I'll be meeting with Governor Ivy. The people of Alabama, they got hit very hard by the tornados. We're stopping there. Then we're going to Florida. And we're going to do a lot of work. We'll be working very hard.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: I feel very badly for Paul Manafort. I think it's been a very, very tough time for him. But if you notice, both his lawyer, a highly respected man and a very highly respected judge, the judge said there was no collusion with Russia. This had nothing to do with collusion. There was no collusion. It's a collusion hoax. It's a collusion witch hoax. I don't collude with Russia. So I just want to tell you that his lawyer went out of his way, actually, to make a statement last night, no collusion with Russia. There was absolutely none. The judge, I mean, for whatever reason, I was very honored by it, also made the statement that this had nothing to do with collusion with Russia. So, you know, keep it going. Let's go. Keep the hoax going. It's just a hoax.</p><p>Senator Burr said there's no collusion. You look at Devin Nunes and the House Intelligence Commission -- Committee, they said there's no collusion. And, guess what, there is none.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: What?</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Well, it's a step. I think you'll probably find out it averages out. The unemployment rate just went lower. We're down now to 3.8 percent. So we had very good news on that. I think the big news really was that wages went up and that's great for the American worker. That's something people -- I don't know if they ever expected to see it.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I haven't heard that. I think they're doing well. But if it happened that way, we'll do even better. We'll do very well either way, with or without a deal. But you're telling me something that I have not heard.</p><p>QUESTION (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Yes, sure, I'm confident. But if we don't make a very good deal for our country, I wouldn't make a deal. If this isn't a great deal, I won't make a deal.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Say it?</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: I don't even discuss it. I have -- the only one discussing it is you. I haven't discussed it. I know that in watching and seeing you folks at night, that Michael Cohen lied about the pardon. And it was a stone cold lie. And he's lied about a lot of things. But when he lied about the pardon, that was really a lie. And he knew all about pardons. His lawyer said that they went to my lawyers and asked for pardons. And I can go a step above that, but I won't go -- do it now.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Why what? QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: It's the most ridiculous suit I've ever seen. Bad lawyer. I had a bad lawyer.</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>That happens.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE). TRUMP: We'll make a comment (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: You're competing with a helicopter, Jeff (ph).</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I think that it's going very well. At the border, we're doing a great job. We're apprehending record numbers of people, 75,000 over the last short period of time. That's a lot of work. And with a wall we wouldn't have to do it.</p><p>Now, I think we're doing fine in Congress. They understand it's an emergency.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>[09:59:44] TRUMP: Well, time will tell. But I have a feeling that our relationship with North Korea, Kim Jong-un and myself, Chairman Kim, I think it's a very good one. I think it remains good. I would be surprised in a negative way if he did anything that was not per our understanding. But we'll see what happens.</p><p>Look, when I came in, under the Obama</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019030802CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-JK61-DXH2-64DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3537\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>LIVE EVENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Debbie Mucarsel-Powell</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Venezuela</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Utilities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nicolas Maduro</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Juan Guaido</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Aviation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>MH-370</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Malaysia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elizabeth Warren</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FaceBook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DHV1</classCode><className>ANTISEMITISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DA0C</classCode><className>RACISM &amp;

The House overwhelmingly passing a broadresolution condemning many forms of hate, including anti-Semitism, butalso anti-Muslimism discrimination. The resolution did not mentionOmar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining me now is Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell: ofFlorida who serves on the Judiciary Committee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congresswoman, it's great to have you on the show. Thanks for takingthe time.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL (D), FLORIDA: Good morning, Jim. Thank youfor having me.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Let me ask you first about this vote here. There wastremendous debate inside the party about this. The final resolutioncondemn all forms of hate. And I think a lot of our viewers canunderstand that. But of course the spark for this were the comments byCongresswoman Ilhan Omar. And why was her name or any specific mentionof those comments left out?</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: I think that it's important for us to stand togetherin unity. And that's what we did yesterday when we voted for thatresolution. We are standing in -- against all forms of hate, whetherit's anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, xenophobia.</p><p>I actually find it interesting, Jim, that we had over 20 Republicansthat voted against it. And I don't think that we need to target anyindividual. I think that, as a caucus, we need to stand united. Andyou saw what happened yesterday. All of us voted for this resolution.And it's just troubling when I saw some of the members on the otherside that voted against it.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Of course, one of the members who did was Steve King, who hashis own issues with bigoted comments.</p><p>What is there explanation? And what is your message to the Republicanwho voted no on this anti-hate resolution? MUCARSEL-POWELL: I think that what we've seen from this White Houseand this administration is that they have used hateful words to attackpeople, like myself, immigrant, other people of color. And we need toshow the American people that our words matter, that we are held to ahigher standard. And my suggestion is for them to understand that weare sending a mixed message when you're sending -- when you're votingagainst a resolution that is clearly standing against hate.</p><p>I can't speak for any of them that voted against it, but I do worrythat it continues to exasperate the problem that we have coming fromthis White House and this president, which is to use hateful wordsagainst people like myself.</p><p>SCIUTTO: On another issue for the Democratic Party, you have a -- youhave a debate over really economic policy, over the direction of theparty, how far to the left, particularly as you have the 2020 electioncoming up. You are one of more than 40 Democratic lawmakers whoflipped a seat, a district, from red to blue, in a very tight racethere. And as you know, the folks like yourself who flipped thosedistricts are pretty moderate, right, and the party made a deliberatedecision to run candidates -- moderate candidates with moderatepositions.</p><p>Are you concerned that as some in the party pull the party to theleft, including people from safe Democratic -- safe blue districts,that that's a danger for the party, not just in the House, but for thepresidency in 2020?</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: Jim, I'm not going lie to you. I mean I do think thatwe can't have on -- extremes on either side. I don't think that's whatthe American people want. I think that what they're looking for is forgovernment to work and it is why today we are actually voting on avery significant piece of legislation, the For The People Act, HR-1,which is restoring the faith in our democracy.</p><p>And I want -- I think that we all agree that we want the things thatsome of the progressives are bringing up ideas that we all support,which is being very bold and aggressive and tackling issues thataffect climate. Being bold and aggressive lowering healthcare costs.But it's a matter of finding common ground. And I do think that -- youknow, we've only been here for about sixty days and there are somelearning curves for a lot of us. And --</p><p>SCIUTTO: You said extremes -- just to be clear what you'rereferencing, you said extremes on both side. Are you concerned thatthere -- that there are extremes, extremists, if you want to use thatterm, in your own party pulling the party too far to the left?</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: Well, you know, I -- it's -- I'm not saying that theyare right now, but words matter. And sometimes those words that arebeing used could be seen as an extreme position on an issue. And Ithink that we as Americans, you know, we're 365 million Americans. Weall come from different backgrounds. It's one of the great thingsabout my party, that we have a huge tent. Healthy debate is good. Weneed to be discussing these issues. [09:35:05] But what we need to do is restore faith in our government.And it's important for us to be united. I think that resolution showedthat yesterday. We are united. Yes, we do have differences. We comefrom very different backgrounds, different districts, differentexperiences. I was born in Ecuador. I'm an immigrant. I bring acompletely different perspective as it relates, for example, toVenezuela.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: And so, you know, and it's OK to have these healthydebates.</p><p>I do feel optimistic that as we have these conversations, I see peopleunderstanding where all -- where we are all coming from. And I cantell you from my own personal experience talk about Venezuela to mycaucus, bringing that perspective.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Let me ask you about -- I do want to ask you about Venezuelabecause John Bolton said just in the last 24 hours that all optionsare on the table. You've heard the president speak publicly aboutmilitary options there.</p><p>I wonder if it's your concern that the policy of the U.S. -- and Iknow you have a very strong position against the Maduro government --but is the policy of the U.S. now regime change in Venezuela? And doyou support that?</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: Look, I have to tell you, and I'll start from thebeginning, which is my statement. Maduro is an illegitimate regime. Weneed to support the international organizations, have supported Guaidoas the interim president.</p><p>What I don't like to see from the White House, from the Trumpadministration and from some other Republicans from -- that are usingthis issue as a political tool to gain points in Florida specifically.I have very good friends that have had to leave Venezuela. I have somefamily members that live in Venezuela. And what we need to do is put alot of pressure on this regime.</p><p>I oppose military intervention. And our caucus opposes it. We just hada conversation about that a couple of days ago. But what we do supportis humanitarian aid, individualized sanctions, asking the UnitedNations to work very closely with the American government to putpressure on the Maduro regime.</p><p>So we are watching very closely. And things can change from one minuteto the next. But I think the momentum is now to put the pressure onthe Maduro regime.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Congresswoman, appreciate you having -- having you on theshow. Thanks so much. We look forward to welcoming you back.</p><p>MUCARSEL-POWELL: Thank you. Thank you, Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Five years ago, today, MH-370 left Malaysia for China.There's still no sign of the plane or its passengers? Can somethinglike this happen again? It's still a question, believe it or not.We'll have more.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:41:50] SCIUTTO: This morning, millions of Venezuelans are withoutpower several hours after a crippling blackout began in Caracas andthen swept throughout the country. Nationwide schools and businessesare now closed. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is blaming theembattled Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, for the outage,tweeting, quote, no food, no medicine, now no power. Next, no Maduro.</p><p>CNN's Patrick Oppmann is live in Caracas. Of course daytime there now.</p><p>Patrick, this blackout just the latest hardship for Venezuelans. Youreally get a sense of a country falling apart there. Just basicnecessities not available.</p><p>PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And it doesn't get more basic thanelectricity. Hospitals, schools, people's homes without electricityand largely without water. Just a surreal scene this morning to seethousands of people walking to work because the metro was broken. Ofcourse without electricity you can't gas up your car. Publictransportation is falling apart.</p><p>So it really is a sense of a country falling apart, especially whenthe government, last night, when, you know, nearly 18 hours ago whenthe crisis first began, the power went out, they said they'd have thepower back on very soon. That was just another broken promise though,Jim.</p><p>And the government here is, of course, as they always do, blaming theUnited States, saying that it was an act of sabotage. But people we'vetalked to that know something about the electrical grid here say thatit's just not possible. That it's a very old, poorly maintainedelectrical grid and for years people have been warning this couldhappen. Now apparently it has.</p><p>Venezuelans simply want to know when the power will come back on. Andno word yet from the government on when that will take place.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes, interesting how it feeds those narratives and conspiracytheories, right, about what the U.S. is up to there.</p><p>Patrick Oppmann, thanks very much.</p><p>SCIUTTO: It was, if you can believe it, five years ago today thatMalaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappeared en route to China fromMalaysia with some 239 passengers and crew on board. Nearly 26countries joined in that search and rescue mission. Crews foundnothing in the end, amazingly. The official search was called off backin January of 2017, but now the Malaysian government is tellingfamilies that it will continue the search.</p><p>CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest is following thesedevelopments. Of course, Richard, you were on top of this throughout those monthsfollowing the disappearance five years ago. I mean is there any hopethat if they do keep the search they're going find anything? Do theyeven know where to search?</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: They do and that area ofsearching gets ever narrower. The only disappointing part, Jim, isthat last year there was a private search done by a private companyand that was on a no find no fee basis. But the Malaysian governmentdidn't renew their contract to do that, or at least their approvals todo that. So that came to an end.</p><p>And there are people who want to go out there to search. There areprivate companies that will do it. But they need permission. And sofar that has been lacking. Or at least they need cooperation.</p><p>There is geopolitics involved here at the very highest levels. And,Jim, until those are solved, then it's unlikely that it will actuallyget another search underway.</p><p>[09:45:01] SCIUTTO: I mean I remember when you and I and others weretalking about this five years ago, what -- a frequent question was,listen, you know, I lose my iPhone, you know, I can find that, right?I mean there are systems. Why don't planes have, you know, basicsystems. They're giant, expensive pieces of technology with a lot oflives onboard. Is that going to change?</p><p>QUESTION: It's changed. It has already changed. New rules came in atthe international level from IKO (ph) that mandated the so calledreporting time. And many airlines like Emirates and others went muchtighter, reporting every few minutes. And now there's even newtechnology that allows satellite reporting every couple of seconds oreven twice a second in one case.</p><p>But to the fundamental point, why don't we have real-time tracking,why aren't the satellites constantly watching and reporting likeradar? It's simply too expensive. The data band and the bandwidthsimply isn't there. And so you do what's next, which is the planesreport as often as they can and that can be extrapolated into exactlywhere the plane is at any given moment.</p><p>SCIUTTO: But help me understand that, because I know there's alwaysthis rush to find the black boxes, as we call them, though they'reorange, you know, in the midst of this. You know, if we can -- and itsounds probably over simplistic, but if I could have Wi-Fi on theplane, why isn't the plane constantly sending a stream of informationthat's important, can help folks figure out what's happening not onlywith that plane but what might have caused an accident. Why isn't thathappening today?</p><p>QUEST: It is. They're working on it even as we speak. And there havebeen enormous -- remember, you can't just do one thing for oneairline. You have to set regulatory standards that everybody is thengoing follow, which will ensure that it will actually work and it willactually be robust. I'm sounding like a bureaucrat here, but that's the reasons why it'staken so long. There are two things with black boxes. One, ejectableblack boxes. Airbus is working on a system where it ejects from theplane the moment it senses something is wrong. And the second, ofcourse, is constant data streaming. That's more likely. That's alreadyhappening in some cases. There will be a lot more of that in thefuture.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Richard Quest, thanks very much.</p><p>A reminder, tonight on CNN, a special look at the past five years,\"Vanished: The Mystery of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370.\" It will airtonight at 10:00 Eastern Time only here on CNN.</p><p>And breaking news, just this hour, presidential candidate ElizabethWarren says that the tech giants FaceBook, Google and others aresimply too big. She wants to break then up. Her plan coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:51:58] SCIUTTO: Welcome back.</p><p>The breaking news, Elizabeth Warren, candidate for president, wants tosplit apart big tech companies. First up, Amazon, FaceBook, Google.She says that these major companies are reducing competition,squashing small businesses. The senator will take her plan tosupporters at a presidential campaign event today.</p><p>CNN political correspondent MJ Lee joins me now with more.</p><p>You know, she's not entirely on her own here. I speak to folks in theintelligence agencies who say that these companies may need regulationin some form. But the idea of splitting them up, tell us what she'sthinking about here.</p><p>MJ LEE, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, no, Jim, this is a bigproposal coming out from Elizabeth Warren this warning, forcing bigtech companies to split up or break apart. We're talking aboutcompanies like Amazon, like FaceBook and Google. And it essentiallysays that certain tech companies, if they have annual revenues of $25billion or more, either need to split up or spin off certain parts oftheir companies.</p><p>In plain English you can understand this as, if you're a tech companythat does too many things -- so, for example, if you are Amazon, youcan't both be the marketplace and also be the company that sellsthings on the marketplace. You essentially need to choose one thingand not do too many things.</p><p>Another huge component of this proposal is that it would unwind veryhigh-profile tech mergers. So we're talking about mergers that you'revery familiar with, like Amazon and Whole Foods or FaceBook andInstagram. So that is a big second part of Elizabeth Warren's techpolicy proposal that's out this morning.</p><p>And the political implications, of course, are going to be huge, asyou noted. We are going to see folks in Silicon Valley, executives,investors, not be very happy about this. But, in the meantime, on theother hand, we are going to see progressive activists and leaders,consumer advocates probably be very happy about this because this isan issue that they have been talking about for a while.</p><p>As you noted, Jim, we are going to see Elizabeth Warren here in NewYork, on Long Island City, later today. And we are told that she isgoing to talk about this there in the rally. And significant toobecause, remember, Long Island City is where we saw Amazon having topull out of their plans to build a second headquarters there when theyface so much backlash, especially from political activists andleaders. So just all goes to show that this is probably going to be avery big issue heading into the 2020 election, Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: No question. And it raises the question, though, how sheproposes to do it. Is she talking about legislation? Is she talkingabout court orders here? Something that I know we're going to continueto follow. And MJ Lee is going to continue to follow.</p><p>This is the president. He spoke just a short time ago to reporters onhis departure for Alabama and then Mar-a-Lago. Have a listen.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are seeing wages risemore than they have at any time for a long, long time. Wages are goingup, first time for many years. I talked about it during the campaign.For over 20 years. So I'm happy about that.</p><p>The economy is very, very strong. If you look at the stock market overthe last few months, it's been great. And certainly since my election,it's up -- getting close to 50 percent, the stock market. So we'reobviously very happy with that.</p><p>[09:55:14] We will -- I think as soon as these trade deals are done,if they get done, and we're working with China. We'll see whathappens. But I think you're going to see a very big spike.</p><p>A lot of people are waiting to see what happens with the China deal.Mexico/Canada is done. We'll be submitting to Congress very shortly.And that's a great deal for the United States. So we're very happyabout that.</p><p>And I am now, as you know, going to Alabama. Some of you are joiningme. But I look forward to it. I'll be meeting with Governor Ivy. Thepeople of Alabama, they got hit very hard by the tornados. We'restopping there. Then we're going to Florida. And we're going to do alot of work. We'll be working very hard.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: I feel very badly for Paul Manafort. I think it's been a very,very tough time for him. But if you notice, both his lawyer, a highlyrespected man and a very highly respected judge, the judge said therewas no collusion with Russia. This had nothing to do with collusion.There was no collusion. It's a collusion hoax. It's a collusion witchhoax. I don't collude with Russia.So I just want to tell you that his lawyer went out of his way,actually, to make a statement last night, no collusion with Russia.There was absolutely none. The judge, I mean, for whatever reason, Iwas very honored by it, also made the statement that this had nothingto do with collusion with Russia. So, you know, keep it going. Let'sgo. Keep the hoax going. It's just a hoax.</p><p>Senator Burr said there's no collusion. You look at Devin Nunes andthe House Intelligence Commission -- Committee, they said there's nocollusion. And, guess what, there is none.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: What?</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Well, it's a step. I think you'll probably find out it averagesout. The unemployment rate just went lower. We're down now to 3.8percent. So we had very good news on that. I think the big news reallywas that wages went up and that's great for the American worker.That's something people -- I don't know if they ever expected to seeit.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I haven't heard that. I think they're doing well. But ifit happened that way, we'll do even better. We'll do very well eitherway, with or without a deal. But you're telling me something that Ihave not heard.</p><p>QUESTION (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Yes, sure, I'm confident. But if we don't make a very good dealfor our country, I wouldn't make a deal. If this isn't a great deal, Iwon't make a deal.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Say it?</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: I don't even discuss it. I have -- the only one discussing itis you. I haven't discussed it. I know that in watching and seeing youfolks at night, that Michael Cohen lied about the pardon. And it was astone cold lie. And he's lied about a lot of things. But when he liedabout the pardon, that was really a lie. And he knew all aboutpardons. His lawyer said that they went to my lawyers and asked forpardons. And I can go a step above that, but I won't go -- do it now.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Why what?QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: It's the most ridiculous suit I've ever seen. Bad lawyer. I hada bad lawyer.</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>That happens.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).TRUMP: We'll make a comment (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: You're competing with a helicopter, Jeff (ph).</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I think that it's going very well. At the border, we'redoing a great job. We're apprehending record numbers of people, 75,000over the last short period of time. That's a lot of work. And with awall we wouldn't have to do it.</p><p>Now, I think we're doing fine in Congress. They understand it's anemergency.</p><p>QUESTION: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>[09:59:44] TRUMP: Well, time will tell. But I have a feeling that ourrelationship with North Korea, Kim Jong-un and myself, Chairman Kim, Ithink it's a very good one. I think it remains good. I would besurprised in a negative way if he did anything that was not per ourunderstanding. But we'll see what happens.</p><p>Look, when I came in, under the Obama</p><p>END</p><p>[Byline: Poppy Harlow, Jim Sciutto, Patrick Oppmann, Richard Quest, MJLee][Guest: Debbie Mucarsel-Powell][High: Rep.

DEVIN NUNES, R-CA</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FNC</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]     MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  And we begin this morningwith former Trump attorney Michael Cohen scheduled for another roundof now closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committeethis Wednesday, this as Democrats ramp up their own investigationinto the proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is the rankingmember of that committee. He is Republican Congressman fromCalifornia Devin Nunes. He also sits on the House Ways and MeansCommittee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>First, reaction to Michael Cohen this past week, and give us asense of why it's important to go from the public hearing last week.Now he's going to be in front of your committee behind closed doorsthis upcoming week.</p><p>NUNES:  So, remember, he was in public with the OversightCommittee. Then he came behind closed doors with us for no reason atall. This is not a man who has any classified informationwhatsoever.</p><p>We interviewed him for some eight, nine hours. In fact,Republicans were pretty much done with interviewing after a coupleof sessions. We didn't have any more questions to ask him. We're notsure why he's coming back, but he will be back this week once againin a classified setting, for someone who has no classifiedinformation.</p><p>So, from my perspective, it's all about building out anarrative. They want to keep it behind closed doors, so that theycan conveniently say, well, we can't talk about what happened behindclosed doors, when the reality is, we can talk about whatever wewant to talk about, because the guy has no classified information.It's ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said a couple things this past week that somepeople are wondering if he perjured himself again by saying he neverwanted a job in the White House.</p><p>And then I thought there was something really interesting interms of the work you have done so well for the last year-and-a-halfon the dossier. He said he was never in Prague.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And isn't it true that, in the dossier, the dossiersaid that he went to Prague to go meet with Russian officials tomeddle into the U.S. election?</p><p>NUNES:  Yes. This is why they don't want him outside. They don't-- they want him behind closed doors, so that we can't talk aboutthe testimony.</p><p>The bottom line is, is that Cohen was great for Republicans. Itwas great for Donald Trump, because we now know that the dossier wastotal bunk. There was no truth to it. And we know that because of --that Cohen has testified now publicly that he wasn't in Prague, andthere was no truth to anything in the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said there was no collusion, by the way.</p><p>NUNES:  No collusion -- no collusion conspiracy, no obstruction.</p><p>You know, these are all issues that were essentially made inthat dossier that was the Democrat -- remember, for the viewers outthere -- and I think a lot of people forget -- this was theDemocratic campaign committee working with the Clinton campaign thatproduced this dirt, fed it into the FBI to start this investigationin the first place.</p><p>It was totally debunked this week, and it will be debunkedagain next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have been investigating this now for upwardsof two years.</p><p>You have told us a lot. You have informed the public a lot interms of what took place in the 2016 election. I don't think,without you and your colleagues, we would even know what really tookplace by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI and the DOJ.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes. There's still more to come. We're going to keepinterviewing people. We're going to get this information out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about that, because you're wrapping upyour investigation. You have got a couple of things to do.</p><p>One of them is, you have provided a list of the people that youwould like to come down to speak to you and get testimony of them.So we have got this list. Go through some of these names and whythey're important, Tashina Gauhar, Gregory Brower, John Carlin,Kevin Clinesmith.</p><p>Tashina Gauhar is important why?</p><p>NUNES:  So, these are all names that we had sent to ourRepublican task force at the end of the last Congress.</p><p>These names are all important, because we need to know if thesepeople were involved in the chain of custody of the dossier that wejust referred to, because the dossier makes claims that thisinformation came from Russians.</p><p>So all the names that are on this list that we didn't get tolast year that still need to be interviewed, if we're really lookingfor Russian collusion, we need to know if any of those people wereactually talking to Russians on behalf of the Clinton campaign orany operative, whether it's Fusion GPS, what Russians were theyactually talking to, because, look, they could be the problem.</p><p>They could be -- these Clinton people could be the ones thatwere in bed with Russians, for all we know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, these are all...</p><p>NUNES:  Or it could be total nonsense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Many of these names are associated with HillaryClinton.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, obviously, names like Jake Sullivan, who was aP.R. guy, I believe, for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robby Mook, another P.R. guy for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Sidney Blumenthal, tell me why he's on your list.</p><p>NUNES:  Well, he was also involved in one of the dossiers. Sothere's several versions of the dossiers, OK?</p><p>So this was dirt he was feeding into through friends andacquaintances that got into the State Department, right? So,remember, the dossier came at very different angles all over theplace into the FBI and DOJ.</p><p>Some of those people in the Clinton campaign -- I think a lotof people forget this -- why would people in the Clinton campaign betweeting out messages about Trump's involvement with Russia? It'sbecause they had the dossier. They were promoting this message, thisdirt out there in 2016.</p><p>And we need to ask these Clinton campaign people where they gotit from. Did they get it from Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS, thedossier that they were paying for, or did they get it from someRussian friends of theirs that they know of?</p><p>The bottom line is, is that everything that was in thatdossier, all the accusations that were made, whether it was tweetsfrom the Hillary campaign, press releases from the Hillary campaign,it was all nonsense. It was stuff they were feeding into the press.The press was writing about it, they were tweeting it out andpromoting it out. And they were all in on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a part of -- it was part of their strategy toget this narrative out that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians.Give it to the media, let the media drive the bus on all of it.</p><p>And it actually worked, because...</p><p>NUNES:  At the end of the day -- at the end of the day, itworked.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... a year-and-a-half later, we're still talkingabout the potential of this.</p><p>NUNES:  That's right. That's right.</p><p>And that's why we're trying to get to the bottom of who wasinvolved. That's why we have all these lists of people we need tointerview. We need to know what their involvement was in all this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, so this is a list of 32 people.</p><p>Do you think you're ever going to get these people to come downand give you testimony? You don't have subpoena power anymore. Yourcolleagues are trying to lift every rock and look for a crime aroundDonald Trump.</p><p>NUNES:  So, the Democrats claim that they're going to be so muchnicer than we were to them.</p><p>So, remember, we gave them every single witness they wantedover the last two years when we were in the majority. They claimthey're going to give us witnesses. So far, they have given us zerowitnesses.</p><p>So, if they continue not to give us any witnesses, we will askall of these people to voluntarily come into Congress to talk to us.If they won't come in, we will either do it through the courts, orwe will send it over to the Senate, and hope that Lindsey Graham andhis team can get to the bottom of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Senator Graham has been with us many times overthe last several weeks.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said he's doing a deep dive. He's going tobring the necessary people to testify. In fact, he's going tointerview definitely the people who signed the FISA warrant.</p><p>So as you wrap up your investigation, you have got these 32names you want to interview. You have got, number two,declassification. Are we ever going to see declassification for someof the documents that you think are most important to educate theAmerican people about this?</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, I kind of sum it up this way.</p><p>There's really five areas, the interviews we just talked about.There's the criminal referrals that have to be made. There's thedeclassification, radical declassification. We need to havedeclassification across from everyone we interview to everyone thatMueller interviewed.</p><p>Then we're going to have to have a fundamental FISA reform. Wecan never again let the FISA process be used to target politicalcampaigns, right? We can't let our intelligence capabilities betargeted and pointed at political campaigns.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they went to the FISA court. And they said,look, we have this dirty dossier, and that's the reason that we'regoing to spy on the Trump campaign, essentially.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, and not only that. Not only did they get a warrantto get into somebody's e-mails on the campaign and get -- to be ableto suck all that up, e-mails and listen to phone calls and all ofthat.</p><p>They also opened a counterintelligence investigation into apolitical campaign. Now, these are tools that are supposed to beused to go after terrorists, you know, the people that destroyed thebuildings here in New York.</p><p>And then the final thing that we have to deal with is, themedia was involved in all of this, this disinformation campaign.They were given the dossier, and they spread it out. They spreadnumerous fake news stories about myself, the work that we were doingon the committee, many members on our committee, staff on ourcommittee.</p><p>That's going to have to be dealt with too, this disinformationcampaign. The slander and the libel will all have to be dealt with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're saying you're going to deal with themisinformation out there. How do you deal with that? You havereferred to them in the past as tech oligarchs to me.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.</p><p>So, there's two ways that they're doing it. So, the fake newsmedia, they're putting out fake news stories. Sometimes, it comesfrom the Democrats, right, and the dossier. They feed it to themedia. The media runs a story</p><p>And then the numerous tech companies out there that are reallycontrolling what all Americans see, right? So, what these techcompanies have become is, they try to pretend they're not, butthey're content developers. They're developing content, OK, throughtwo ways, one, algorithms. So they're controlling what you and I seewhen we get on our device.</p><p>So for them to say that they're not developing content isnonsense. The other thing that they're doing is, they're monetizingthis. So there are some people that will not get rewarded. Like, ifyou're a conservative out there putting conservative videostogether, you're not going to get money for that, right? People arenot going to advertise on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NUNES:  So, all this has -- has got to be dealt with, I think,in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me get back to that, because I wantto find out how are you going to do that.</p><p>But speaking of interviews and your team looking at who youwant to speak to, I want to talk about this letter that yourcolleagues Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan sent to the attorney general,William Barr.</p><p>And, basically, they are asking for a number of things from theA.G. And they mention in particular Andrew Weissmann and ZainabAhmad. These are two individuals that worked at the Department ofJustice and now work at the special counsel 's office.</p><p>Can you tell me about Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad?</p><p>NUNES:  So, Weissmann is the number two. It's Mueller's deputy.He was involved in the custody of the dossier. So, in early 2016, hewas given the dossier.</p><p>This is somebody, him and the other individual that's mentionedthere, both DOJ people, both on the Mueller team. They shouldn't beinvolved in this investigation. I don't know -- well, and thequestions that my colleagues are asking is...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  ... is, you know, there's clear regulations that DOJ hasthat you can't be conflicted. And so they're asking questions.</p><p>Look, did they disclose to Mueller before Mueller picked themthat they were involved in the chain of custody of this dossier?Because I will tell you, if I was -- I don't know that they're goingto have any criminal indictments or not, but, if I was any attorney,I would be saying, look, these people that are bringing thisforward, they shouldn't be involved in this because they are biased.</p><p>We already know the people that were kicked off were biased.But you also have the fact that these two individuals that JimJordan and Mark Meadows are asking about were involved in the chainof custody of important evidence, the dossier, the dirt from theClinton campaign, that is the basis for this entire hoax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is important, because, for a long time, I havebeen asking the question, can the Robert Mueller special counselreport have credibility if it doesn't look at what we know to havebeen wrongdoing by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI?</p><p>So, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows write to Bill Barr. And theysay this. Number one, we'd like you to identify all actions taken byWeissmann and Ahmad, including disclosures to apprise the departmentor the special counsel's office of their role in the events BruceOhr testified to about supplying the FBI with information relatingto the Trump campaign.</p><p>So, they also want to explain all the actions taken byWeissmann and Ahmad after learning that Steele, Simpson and NellieOhr were providing Bruce Ohr information for the purpose of relayingit to the FBI, provide all documents and communications referring orrelating to disclosures made by Weissmann and Ahmad, and providedocuments and communications related to the process the departmentused to evaluate prosecutors and investigators' independence.</p><p>So they're right now still working on the special counsel'sinvestigation, Robert Mueller.</p><p>NUNES:  Right. And they're not -- they're not independentinvestigators. These are people that were in on this from thebeginning. They knew about the dossier. They were -- they broughtthis dossier forward.</p><p>I don't know if they told -- maybe they told Mueller, andMueller decided to waive these requirements that are there. Also,let's not forget, we also have evidence that, at one time, thatWeissmann was meeting with reporters.</p><p>And so you have this. And this is part of this wholedisinformation campaign. I should have said this earlier. It's notjust the media. It's not just that they were getting it from theClinton campaign. You also had people within the Department ofJustice and the FBI that were briefing reporters.</p><p>Now, what on earth are you doing briefing reporters? What wasWeissmann doing talking to AP reporters, right? We have asked thosequestions and never got the answers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>Well, it's a good point that you make. Jordan and Meadows wantthis information from the A.G. by March 15 at 5:00 p.m.</p><p>I want to take a short break, but we have got more to coverhere.</p><p>Number one, do you think they are going to get this informationby March 15? And, also, Mueller's report going to drop soon. Got toget your expectations.</p><p>Congressman Devin Nunes is with us this morning. He's stayingwith us.</p><p>Quick break, and then we will talk about the concerns aboutChina technology giant Huawei as well and the red flags being raisedby U.S. lawmakers on how Beijing may be infiltrating Americanuniversities to spread its propaganda.</p><p>Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures. Let meknow what you would like to know from Devin Nunes on Instagram@SundayFutures.</p><p>Stay with us, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\"right now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>And I am back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking memberon the House Intel Committee.</p><p>And, Congressman, you just said that you want to get thesepeople a list of 32 people down, so that you can interview them.</p><p>What happens next? I mean, our audience wants to seeaccountability. What are you expecting in terms of accountability?How will Bill Barr response to this letter that Meadows and Jordanjust sent him?</p><p>And do you think -- I mean, when you say criminal charges, whatdoes that mean, criminal referrals?</p><p>NUNES:  Let me start with this.</p><p>All of us want to see justice equal under the law, right? So wewant to see everyone held accountable.</p><p>I believe that, if the new attorney general and the Departmentof Justice, if they don't take all of this on, and do a full scruband have full accountability and transparency for the Americanpeople, you're going to see generations of conservatives who willnot trust the Department of Justice, they will not trust the FBI,and they for sure will not trust the FISA process.</p><p>So I mentioned this in things that we have left to do earlier.And I don't want to gloss over it, because it's very important. TheFISA laws were first written in the '70s. They need to be completelyrewritten because of what the Clinton campaign and the former peopleat DOJ and FBI were able to do.</p><p>That's going to be a whole undertaking that Congress has toundertake. If that's not done -- so we need accountability by --from the attorney general and the Department of Justice for all thepeople that were involved in this mess. And, at the same time,Congress is going to have to rewrite the laws that allow theintelligence agencies to go after American citizens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have brought all of this information forward.You have put it right there in front of Bill Barr.</p><p>Is he going to act on it, do you think? What are yourindications...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NUNES:  Well, we're going to -- yes, we will continue -- we willcontinue to work with the Justice Department. Barr just got inthere, so let's give him some time here.</p><p>I think, once the new deputy attorney general gets in, and thenwe will slowly get to work, and start to work with them to try tobring accountability to everyone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Last week, a federal judge in Florida ordered therelease of the depositions given by former British spy ChristopherSteele and an associate.</p><p>What are you expecting in terms of getting these depositionsunsealed?</p><p>NUNES:  So, this is great, because this is going to -- I thinkit's going to be on March 14 is going to be the day.</p><p>So, remember, Christopher Steele is the guy who was hired bythe Democrats to go get information from the Russians. He wouldn'tcome and talk to us, right? He's already been criminally referred tothe Justice Department. He was supposedly an asset for the FBI. Wenever got to interview him.</p><p>Luckily, someone sued him and a guy named, I think, DavidKramer, who was also involved in the creation and -- creation anddissemination of the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NUNES:  So, he pled the Fifth to us.</p><p>So between Christopher Steele and Kramer, we really want toknow, what did they tell the court? So this is going to befascinating information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the Mueller report? Are you expecting itto drop soon? What's going on there?</p><p>NUNES:  You know, you're going to interview Ken Starr a littlelater.</p><p>I don't understand. If Mueller doesn't have any crimes thathe's -- that he's going to prosecute on, then I don't know whatreport we'd be looking for, because, as far as I can tell, theMueller investigation was stood up for one reason, and one reasononly, and that was based on the dossier.</p><p>And, remember, we have never seen the scope memo that started-- we have talked about it many times on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  I hope people understand this.</p><p>There's a classified scope memo of what Mueller is supposed tobe doing. It's been hidden from Congress. It's been hidden from theAmerican people. My guess is, all it is, is the information from thedossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, real quick, Adam Schiff is looking fora crime. And he's doubling down on investigations.</p><p>Let's take a short break, and then I have got to ask you aboutyour colleague Adam Schiff.</p><p>Then, Senator Rick Scott and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney arehere.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the rankingmember on the House Intel Committee.</p><p>Your colleague who is the chairman of the Intel Committee isAdam Schiff. He said a long time ago he had more than circumstantialevidence that there's collusion between the president. He's stillout there looking for a crime, as you're trying to finish up yourinvestigation to indicate wrongdoing that he continues to push backon.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, it's a lot like looking for, like, some mythicalcreature, right, this collusion creature?</p><p>So I often say -- I joke that it's like in search of Sasquatch,or Loch Ness Monster, or Chupacabra, which is like this mythicalanimal supposedly in the Southwest. They just don't exist.</p><p>And so he's just doing a lot of chasing the ghost around in thecloset. He's made lots of promises, and now he's basically movingthe goalposts to where they're no longer on collusion anymore.They're on to basically every single one of Donald Trump's businessventures that he was ever involved in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  So, it's gotten way out of control, in terms, this is nolonger -- this has nothing to do with Russia anymore. This is justlike going after Trump, which is not the job of the IntelligenceCommittee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they want him out. I mean, let's face it.</p><p>I want to move on to China, because you have done aninvestigation for multi years at the Intel Committee.</p><p>And this week, I had the opportunity to speak with the chiefsecurity officer of Huawei Telecom. You have said for many yearsthat China has been stealing our intellectual property for years.</p><p>Listen to this exchange I have got to get your reaction to,Andy Purdy from Huawei.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You just said there have been no major issues aroundHuawei.</p><p>But, in fact, over the last year, years, several years, I cancite a list of companies that have sued you and you have donesettlements with, Motorola Solutions, T-Mobile, Cisco.</p><p>All of those companies sued Huawei for stealing trade secrets.</p><p>ANDY PURDY, HUAWEI CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER:  There have been nomajor cybersecurity incidents in the world involving Huawei.</p><p>That industry and the fact that we have had some lawsuits inthe past has characterized the industry for the last 20 years. Wehave resolved those issues, and we're moving forward. The remainingissues, we hope to resolve in the next year or so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy, it's not accurate to say that there were noissues around Huawei, when you had lawsuits for stealing tradesecrets. Huawei settled a lawsuit with Motorola Solutions forstealing trade secrets.</p><p>You settled a lawsuit with Cisco for stealing router tradesecrets. So are you saying that, yes, these issues and lawsuits wenton in the past, and we settled them, and now we're not going tosteal anymore? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>PURDY:  I'm saying two things.</p><p>I'm saying that, but I'm also saying there have been no majorcybersecurity incidents in the world in the 170 countries in whichwe do business. Our customers trust us around the world. And webelieve there are additional mechanisms that can be done, so we canprovide assurance and transparency, so that we can help make the --America benefit from us being allowed to compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you are on this P.R. triptoday, and you have this whole-page ad in The Journal. And I agreethat Huawei needs to convince the world that we can actually trustthe products of the company.</p><p>But to say there have been no issues with Huawei is just 100percent inaccurate. I just listed the number of companies that havesued you for stealing trade secrets and the settlements that youhave done.</p><p>PURDY:  Maria, I didn't disagree with the facts of those cases.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there you go.</p><p>What do people need to understand about Huawei and China?</p><p>NUNES:  Like all major companies in China, they're owned by theChinese Communist Party. They're owned by the leadership.</p><p>Huawei especially is one of the largest. They are developingconnections across the entire globe, the entire communicationsnetwork around the globe, so that they can have -- they can suck upanyone's e-mails, phone calls, text messages.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>NUNES:  That's what they're working on.</p><p>And any of the countries that allow Huawei to come in and putin the backbone of their architecture, they're absolutely crazy,because everything from their government is going to be headedstraight to Chinese intelligence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have a report here by IPVM. And they callthemselves the leading researcher on all video -- all things videocameras.</p><p>They report that Huawei Telecom components are currently in 60percent of all video cameras across the world. That's -- I don'twant to be an alarmist, but that tells me that China is not justlistening to us. They're watching us.</p><p>NUNES:  Well, and don't forget, the big tech companies are ableto do that too.</p><p>And so -- but, as it relates to Huawei, the challenge is, thisis not a private company, as much as it is a government-ownedcompany from the Chinese communists.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>I want to ask you about the so-called Confucius centers,because you and I have spoken about this in the past. But there wasa new Senate investigation. And they're warning that these Chinesestate-run centers are at -- in more than 100 U.S. colleges.</p><p>You have got Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley,like near Stanford. They're sharing research. What do you make ofConfucius centers?</p><p>NUNES:  Well, I would say first that Senate report that youreferred to, great report done by Senator Portman and his team.</p><p>It's not just the 100 universities that they're involved in.It's what they do there, right? So they're bringing in what arelikely either intelligence officers or people that are working withChinese intelligence.</p><p>They're doing -- they're seeding people into companies. They'rerecruiting people. These are all things that are in this SenateIntelligence -- or the Senate report by Rob Portman that I wouldencourage all of your viewers to go and take a Sunday and read it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not only that, but China has an enormous amount ofmoney. So they're buying up companies, like energy companies andbanks, and getting American data that way too, another way to...</p><p>NUNES:  And that's a whole 'nother -- yes. And they're doingthat all over the globe, which that could be a whole show just onthat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>NUNES:  Thank you. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Congressman Devin Nunes joiningus.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

He is Republican Congressman from California Devin Nunes. He also sits on the House Ways and Means Committee.  </p><p>      And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA</emphasis>:  Great to be with you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>      First, reaction to Michael Cohen this past week, and give us a sense of why it's important to go from the public hearing last week. Now he's going to be in front of your committee behind closed doors this upcoming week.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  So, remember, he was in public with the Oversight Committee. Then he came behind closed doors with us for no reason at all. This is not a man who has any classified information whatsoever.   </p><p>      We interviewed him for some eight, nine hours. In fact, Republicans were pretty much done with interviewing after a couple of sessions. We didn't have any more questions to ask him. We're not sure why he's coming back, but he will be back this week once again in a classified setting, for someone who has no classified information.   </p><p>      So, from my perspective, it's all about building out a narrative. They want to keep it behind closed doors, so that they can conveniently say, well, we can't talk about what happened behind closed doors, when the reality is, we can talk about whatever we want to talk about, because the guy has no classified information. It's ridiculous.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  He said a couple things this past week that some people are wondering if he perjured himself again by saying he never wanted a job in the White House.  </p><p>      And then I thought there was something really interesting in terms of the work you have done so well for the last year-and-a-half on the dossier. He said he was never in Prague.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And isn't it true that, in the dossier, the dossier said that he went to Prague to go meet with Russian officials to meddle into the U.S. election?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Yes. This is why they don't want him outside. They don't -- they want him behind closed doors, so that we can't talk about the testimony.  </p><p>      The bottom line is, is that Cohen was great for Republicans. It was great for Donald Trump, because we now know that the dossier was total bunk. There was no truth to it. And we know that because of -- that Cohen has testified now publicly that he wasn't in Prague, and there was no truth to anything in the dossier.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And he said there was no collusion, by the way.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  No collusion -- no collusion conspiracy, no obstruction.   </p><p>      You know, these are all issues that were essentially made in that dossier that was the Democrat -- remember, for the viewers out there -- and I think a lot of people forget -- this was the Democratic campaign committee working with the Clinton campaign that produced this dirt, fed it into the FBI to start this investigation in the first place.  </p><p>      It was totally debunked this week, and it will be debunked again next week.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And you have been investigating this now for upwards of two years.  </p><p>      You have told us a lot. You have informed the public a lot in terms of what took place in the 2016 election. I don't think, without you and your colleagues, we would even know what really took place by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI and the DOJ.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Yes. There's still more to come. We're going to keep interviewing people. We're going to get this information out.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So, tell us about that, because you're wrapping up your investigation. You have got a couple of things to do.   </p><p>      One of them is, you have provided a list of the people that you would like to come down to speak to you and get testimony of them. So we have got this list. Go through some of these names and why they're important, Tashina Gauhar, Gregory Brower, John Carlin, Kevin Clinesmith.  </p><p>      Tashina Gauhar is important why?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  So, these are all names that we had sent to our Republican task force at the end of the last Congress.   </p><p>      These names are all important, because we need to know if these people were involved in the chain of custody of the dossier that we just referred to, because the dossier makes claims that this information came from Russians.  </p><p>      So all the names that are on this list that we didn't get to last year that still need to be interviewed, if we're really looking for Russian collusion, we need to know if any of those people were actually talking to Russians on behalf of the Clinton campaign or any operative, whether it's Fusion GPS, what Russians were they actually talking to, because, look, they could be the problem.  </p><p>      They could be -- these Clinton people could be the ones that were in bed with Russians, for all we know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So, these are all...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Or it could be total nonsense.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Many of these names are associated with Hillary Clinton.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And, obviously, names like Jake Sullivan, who was a P.R. guy, I believe, for Hillary Clinton.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Robby Mook, another P.R. guy for Hillary Clinton.  </p><p>      Sidney Blumenthal, tell me why he's on your list.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Well, he was also involved in one of the dossiers. So there's several versions of the dossiers, OK?  </p><p>      So this was dirt he was feeding into through friends and acquaintances that got into the State Department, right? So, remember, the dossier came at very different angles all over the place into the FBI and DOJ.   </p><p>      Some of those people in the Clinton campaign -- I think a lot of people forget this -- why would people in the Clinton campaign be tweeting out messages about Trump's involvement with Russia? It's because they had the dossier. They were promoting this message, this dirt out there in 2016.  </p><p>      And we need to ask these Clinton campaign people where they got it from. Did they get it from Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS, the dossier that they were paying for, or did they get it from some Russian friends of theirs that they know of?  </p><p>      The bottom line is, is that everything that was in that dossier, all the accusations that were made, whether it was tweets from the Hillary campaign, press releases from the Hillary campaign, it was all nonsense. It was stuff they were feeding into the press. The press was writing about it, they were tweeting it out and promoting it out. And they were all in on it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  It was a part of -- it was part of their strategy to get this narrative out that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians. Give it to the media, let the media drive the bus on all of it.  </p><p>      And it actually worked, because...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  At the end of the day -- at the end of the day, it worked.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  ... a year-and-a-half later, we're still talking about the potential of this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  That's right. That's right.   </p><p>      And that's why we're trying to get to the bottom of who was involved. That's why we have all these lists of people we need to interview. We need to know what their involvement was in all this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right, so this is a list of 32 people.   </p><p>      Do you think you're ever going to get these people to come down and give you testimony? You don't have subpoena power anymore. Your colleagues are trying to lift every rock and look for a crime around Donald Trump.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  So, the Democrats claim that they're going to be so much nicer than we were to them.  </p><p>      So, remember, we gave them every single witness they wanted over the last two years when we were in the majority. They claim they're going to give us witnesses. So far, they have given us zero witnesses.  </p><p>      So, if they continue not to give us any witnesses, we will ask all of these people to voluntarily come into Congress to talk to us. If they won't come in, we will either do it through the courts, or we will send it over to the Senate, and hope that Lindsey Graham and his team can get to the bottom of it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And Senator Graham has been with us many times over the last several weeks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And he said he's doing a deep dive. He's going to bring the necessary people to testify. In fact, he's going to interview definitely the people who signed the FISA warrant.  </p><p>      So as you wrap up your investigation, you have got these 32 names you want to interview. You have got, number two, declassification. Are we ever going to see declassification for some of the documents that you think are most important to educate the American people about this?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Yes, I kind of sum it up this way.  </p><p>      There's really five areas, the interviews we just talked about. There's the criminal referrals that have to be made. There's the declassification, radical declassification. We need to have declassification across from everyone we interview to everyone that Mueller interviewed.  </p><p>      Then we're going to have to have a fundamental FISA reform. We can never again let the FISA process be used to target political campaigns, right? We can't let our intelligence capabilities be targeted and pointed at political campaigns.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes, they went to the FISA court. And they said, look, we have this dirty dossier, and that's the reason that we're going to spy on the Trump campaign, essentially.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Yes, and not only that. Not only did they get a warrant to get into somebody's e-mails on the campaign and get -- to be able to suck all that up, e-mails and listen to phone calls and all of that.  </p><p>      They also opened a counterintelligence investigation into a political campaign. Now, these are tools that are supposed to be used to go after terrorists, you know, the people that destroyed the buildings here in New York.  </p><p>      And then the final thing that we have to deal with is, the media was involved in all of this, this disinformation campaign. They were given the dossier, and they spread it out. They spread numerous fake news stories about myself, the work that we were doing on the committee, many members on our committee, staff on our committee.   </p><p>      That's going to have to be dealt with too, this disinformation campaign. The slander and the libel will all have to be dealt with.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  You're saying you're going to deal with the misinformation out there. How do you deal with that? You have referred to them in the past as tech oligarchs to me.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p>      So, there's two ways that they're doing it. So, the fake news media, they're putting out fake news stories. Sometimes, it comes from the Democrats, right, and the dossier. They feed it to the media. The media runs a story  </p><p>      And then the numerous tech companies out there that are really controlling what all Americans see, right? So, what these tech companies have become is, they try to pretend they're not, but they're content developers. They're developing content, OK, through two ways, one, algorithms. So they're controlling what you and I see when we get on our device.  </p><p>      So for them to say that they're not developing content is nonsense. The other thing that they're doing is, they're monetizing this. So there are some people that will not get rewarded. Like, if you're a conservative out there putting conservative videos together, you're not going to get money for that, right? People are not going to advertise on that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  So, all this has -- has got to be dealt with, I think, in the future.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right, let me get back to that, because I want to find out how are you going to do that.  </p><p>      But speaking of interviews and your team looking at who you want to speak to, I want to talk about this letter that your colleagues Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan sent to the attorney general, William Barr.  </p><p>      And, basically, they are asking for a number of things from the A.G. And they mention in particular Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad. These are two individuals that worked at the Department of Justice and now work at the special counsel 's office.   </p><p>      Can you tell me about Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  So, Weissmann is the number two. It's Mueller's deputy. He was involved in the custody of the dossier. So, in early 2016, he was given the dossier.   </p><p>      This is somebody, him and the other individual that's mentioned there, both DOJ people, both on the Mueller team. They shouldn't be involved in this investigation. I don't know -- well, and the questions that my colleagues are asking is...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  ... is, you know, there's clear regulations that DOJ has that you can't be conflicted. And so they're asking questions.   </p><p>      Look, did they disclose to Mueller before Mueller picked them that they were involved in the chain of custody of this dossier? Because I will tell you, if I was -- I don't know that they're going to have any criminal indictments or not, but, if I was any attorney, I would be saying, look, these people that are bringing this forward, they shouldn't be involved in this because they are biased.  </p><p>      We already know the people that were kicked off were biased. But you also have the fact that these two individuals that Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows are asking about were involved in the chain of custody of important evidence, the dossier, the dirt from the Clinton campaign, that is the basis for this entire hoax.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  This is important, because, for a long time, I have been asking the question, can the Robert Mueller special counsel report have credibility if it doesn't look at what we know to have been wrongdoing by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI?  </p><p>      So, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows write to Bill Barr. And they say this. Number one, we'd like you to identify all actions taken by Weissmann and Ahmad, including disclosures to apprise the department or the special counsel's office of their role in the events Bruce Ohr testified to about supplying the FBI with information relating to the Trump campaign.   </p><p>      So, they also want to explain all the actions taken by Weissmann and Ahmad after learning that Steele, Simpson and Nellie Ohr were providing Bruce Ohr information for the purpose of relaying it to the FBI, provide all documents and communications referring or relating to disclosures made by Weissmann and Ahmad, and provide documents and communications related to the process the department used to evaluate prosecutors and investigators' independence.  </p><p>      So they're right now still working on the special counsel's investigation, Robert Mueller.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Right. And they're not -- they're not independent investigators. These are people that were in on this from the beginning. They knew about the dossier. They were -- they brought this dossier forward.  </p><p>      I don't know if they told -- maybe they told Mueller, and Mueller decided to waive these requirements that are there. Also, let's not forget, we also have evidence that, at one time, that Weissmann was meeting with reporters.  </p><p>      And so you have this. And this is part of this whole disinformation campaign. I should have said this earlier. It's not just the media. It's not just that they were getting it from the Clinton campaign. You also had people within the Department of Justice and the FBI that were briefing reporters.  </p><p>      Now, what on earth are you doing briefing reporters? What was Weissmann doing talking to AP reporters, right? We have asked those questions and never got the answers.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p>      Well, it's a good point that you make. Jordan and Meadows want this information from the A.G. by March 15 at 5:00 p.m.   </p><p>      I want to take a short break, but we have got more to cover here.   </p><p>      Number one, do you think they are going to get this information by March 15? And, also, Mueller's report going to drop soon. Got to get your expectations.  </p><p>      Congressman Devin Nunes is with us this morning. He's staying with us.   </p><p>      Quick break, and then we will talk about the concerns about China technology giant Huawei as well and the red flags being raised by U.S. lawmakers on how Beijing may be infiltrating American universities to spread its propaganda.   </p><p>      Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures. Let me know what you would like to know from Devin Nunes on Instagram @SundayFutures.   </p><p>      Stay with us, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Welcome back.  </p><p>      And I am back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the House Intel Committee.  </p><p>      And, Congressman, you just said that you want to get these people a list of 32 people down, so that you can interview them.   </p><p>      What happens next? I mean, our audience wants to see accountability. What are you expecting in terms of accountability? How will Bill Barr response to this letter that Meadows and Jordan just sent him?  </p><p>      And do you think -- I mean, when you say criminal charges, what does that mean, criminal referrals?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Let me start with this.   </p><p>      All of us want to see justice equal under the law, right? So we want to see everyone held accountable.   </p><p>      I believe that, if the new attorney general and the Department of Justice, if they don't take all of this on, and do a full scrub and have full accountability and transparency for the American people, you're going to see generations of conservatives who will not trust the Department of Justice, they will not trust the FBI, and they for sure will not trust the FISA process.  </p><p>      So I mentioned this in things that we have left to do earlier. And I don't want to gloss over it, because it's very important. The FISA laws were first written in the '70s. They need to be completely rewritten because of what the Clinton campaign and the former people at DOJ and FBI were able to do.   </p><p>      That's going to be a whole undertaking that Congress has to undertake. If that's not done -- so we need accountability by -- from the attorney general and the Department of Justice for all the people that were involved in this mess. And, at the same time, Congress is going to have to rewrite the laws that allow the intelligence agencies to go after American citizens.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  You have brought all of this information forward. You have put it right there in front of Bill Barr.  </p><p>      Is he going to act on it, do you think? What are your indications...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Well, we're going to -- yes, we will continue -- we will continue to work with the Justice Department. Barr just got in there, so let's give him some time here.  </p><p>      I think, once the new deputy attorney general gets in, and then we will slowly get to work, and start to work with them to try to bring accountability to everyone.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Last week, a federal judge in Florida ordered the release of the depositions given by former British spy Christopher Steele and an associate.   </p><p>      What are you expecting in terms of getting these depositions unsealed?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  So, this is great, because this is going to -- I think it's going to be on March 14 is going to be the day.   </p><p>      So, remember, Christopher Steele is the guy who was hired by the Democrats to go get information from the Russians. He wouldn't come and talk to us, right? He's already been criminally referred to the Justice Department. He was supposedly an asset for the FBI. We never got to interview him.   </p><p>      Luckily, someone sued him and a guy named, I think, David Kramer, who was also involved in the creation and -- creation and dissemination of the dossier.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Right.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  So, he pled the Fifth to us.  </p><p>      So between Christopher Steele and Kramer, we really want to know, what did they tell the court? So this is going to be fascinating information.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  What about the Mueller report? Are you expecting it to drop soon? What's going on there?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  You know, you're going to interview Ken Starr a little later.   </p><p>      I don't understand. If Mueller doesn't have any crimes that he's -- that he's going to prosecute on, then I don't know what report we'd be looking for, because, as far as I can tell, the Mueller investigation was stood up for one reason, and one reason only, and that was based on the dossier.   </p><p>      And, remember, we have never seen the scope memo that started -- we have talked about it many times on your show.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  I hope people understand this.  </p><p>      There's a classified scope memo of what Mueller is supposed to be doing. It's been hidden from Congress. It's been hidden from the American people. My guess is, all it is, is the information from the dossier.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, real quick, Adam Schiff is looking for a crime. And he's doubling down on investigations.  </p><p>      Let's take a short break, and then I have got to ask you about your colleague Adam Schiff.  </p><p>      Then, Senator Rick Scott and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney are here.  </p><p>      Back in a minute.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I'm back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the House Intel Committee.  </p><p>      Your colleague who is the chairman of the Intel Committee is Adam Schiff. He said a long time ago he had more than circumstantial evidence that there's collusion between the president. He's still out there looking for a crime, as you're trying to finish up your investigation to indicate wrongdoing that he continues to push back on.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Yes, it's a lot like looking for, like, some mythical creature, right, this collusion creature?  </p><p>      So I often say -- I joke that it's like in search of Sasquatch, or Loch Ness Monster, or Chupacabra, which is like this mythical animal supposedly in the Southwest. They just don't exist.  </p><p>      And so he's just doing a lot of chasing the ghost around in the closet. He's made lots of promises, and now he's basically moving the goalposts to where they're no longer on collusion anymore. They're on to basically every single one of Donald Trump's business ventures that he was ever involved in.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  So, it's gotten way out of control, in terms, this is no longer -- this has nothing to do with Russia anymore. This is just like going after Trump, which is not the job of the Intelligence Committee.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well, they want him out. I mean, let's face it.   </p><p>      I want to move on to China, because you have done an investigation for multi years at the Intel Committee.   </p><p>      And this week, I had the opportunity to speak with the chief security officer of Huawei Telecom. You have said for many years that China has been stealing our intellectual property for years.   </p><p>      Listen to this exchange I have got to get your reaction to, Andy Purdy from Huawei.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  You just said there have been no major issues around Huawei.  </p><p>      But, in fact, over the last year, years, several years, I can cite a list of companies that have sued you and you have done settlements with, Motorola Solutions, T-Mobile, Cisco.  </p><p>      All of those companies sued Huawei for stealing trade secrets.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ANDY PURDY, HUAWEI CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER</emphasis>:  There have been no major cybersecurity incidents in the world involving Huawei.   </p><p>      That industry and the fact that we have had some lawsuits in the past has characterized the industry for the last 20 years. We have resolved those issues, and we're moving forward. The remaining issues, we hope to resolve in the next year or so.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Andy, it's not accurate to say that there were no issues around Huawei, when you had lawsuits for stealing trade secrets. Huawei settled a lawsuit with Motorola Solutions for stealing trade secrets.   </p><p>      You settled a lawsuit with Cisco for stealing router trade secrets. So are you saying that, yes, these issues and lawsuits went on in the past, and we settled them, and now we're not going to steal anymore? Is that what you're saying?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PURDY</emphasis>:  I'm saying two things.   </p><p>      I'm saying that, but I'm also saying there have been no major cybersecurity incidents in the world in the 170 countries in which we do business. Our customers trust us around the world. And we believe there are additional mechanisms that can be done, so we can provide assurance and transparency, so that we can help make the -- America benefit from us being allowed to compete.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Look, I understand that you are on this P.R. trip today, and you have this whole-page ad in The Journal. And I agree that Huawei needs to convince the world that we can actually trust the products of the company.  </p><p>      But to say there have been no issues with Huawei is just 100 percent inaccurate. I just listed the number of companies that have sued you for stealing trade secrets and the settlements that you have done.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PURDY</emphasis>:  Maria, I didn't disagree with the facts of those cases.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  OK.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And there you go.  </p><p>      What do people need to understand about Huawei and China?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Like all major companies in China, they're owned by the Chinese Communist Party. They're owned by the leadership.   </p><p>Huawei especially is one of the largest. They are developing connections across the entire globe, the entire communications network around the globe, so that they can have -- they can suck up anyone's e-mails, phone calls, text messages.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Wow.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  That's what they're working on.  </p><p>      And any of the countries that allow Huawei to come in and put in the backbone of their architecture, they're absolutely crazy, because everything from their government is going to be headed straight to Chinese intelligence.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I have a report here by IPVM. And they call themselves the leading researcher on all video -- all things video cameras.   </p><p>      They report that Huawei Telecom components are currently in 60 percent of all video cameras across the world. That's -- I don't want to be an alarmist, but that tells me that China is not just listening to us. They're watching us.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Well, and don't forget, the big tech companies are able to do that too.  </p><p>      And so -- but, as it relates to Huawei, the challenge is, this is not a private company, as much as it is a government-owned company from the Chinese communists.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p>      I want to ask you about the so-called Confucius centers, because you and I have spoken about this in the past. But there was a new Senate investigation. And they're warning that these Chinese state-run centers are at -- in more than 100 U.S. colleges.   </p><p>      You have got Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley, like near Stanford. They're sharing research. What do you make of Confucius centers?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Well, I would say first that Senate report that you referred to, great report done by Senator Portman and his team.   </p><p>      It's not just the 100 universities that they're involved in. It's what they do there, right? So they're bringing in what are likely either intelligence officers or people that are working with Chinese intelligence.   </p><p>      They're doing -- they're seeding people into companies. They're recruiting people. These are all things that are in this Senate Intelligence -- or the Senate report by Rob Portman that I would encourage all of your viewers to go and take a Sunday and read it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Not only that, but China has an enormous amount of money. So they're buying up companies, like energy companies and banks, and getting American data that way too, another way to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  And that's a whole 'nother -- yes. And they're doing that all over the globe, which that could be a whole show just on that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Congressman, it's great to have you on the program.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NUNES</emphasis>:  Thank you. Great to be here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Thank you so much, Congressman Devin Nunes joining us.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJM-CF31-F15W-H1SR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

DEVIN NUNS, R-CA, INTERVIEWED ON FNC \"SUNDAY MORNING     FUTURES\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARCH 3, 2019</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS:     REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CA</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FNC</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]     MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  And we begin this morningwith former Trump attorney Michael Cohen scheduled for another roundof now closed-door testimony before the House Intelligence Committeethis Wednesday, this as Democrats ramp up their own investigationinto the proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is the rankingmember of that committee. He is Republican Congressman fromCalifornia Devin Nunes. He also sits on the House Ways and MeansCommittee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>First, reaction to Michael Cohen this past week, and give us asense of why it's important to go from the public hearing last week.Now he's going to be in front of your committee behind closed doorsthis upcoming week.</p><p>NUNES:  So, remember, he was in public with the OversightCommittee. Then he came behind closed doors with us for no reason atall. This is not a man who has any classified informationwhatsoever.</p><p>We interviewed him for some eight, nine hours. In fact,Republicans were pretty much done with interviewing after a coupleof sessions. We didn't have any more questions to ask him. We're notsure why he's coming back, but he will be back this week once againin a classified setting, for someone who has no classifiedinformation.</p><p>So, from my perspective, it's all about building out anarrative. They want to keep it behind closed doors, so that theycan conveniently say, well, we can't talk about what happened behindclosed doors, when the reality is, we can talk about whatever wewant to talk about, because the guy has no classified information.It's ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said a couple things this past week that somepeople are wondering if he perjured himself again by saying he neverwanted a job in the White House.</p><p>And then I thought there was something really interesting interms of the work you have done so well for the last year-and-a-halfon the dossier. He said he was never in Prague.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And isn't it true that, in the dossier, the dossiersaid that he went to Prague to go meet with Russian officials tomeddle into the U.S. election?</p><p>NUNES:  Yes. This is why they don't want him outside. They don't-- they want him behind closed doors, so that we can't talk aboutthe testimony.</p><p>The bottom line is, is that Cohen was great for Republicans. Itwas great for Donald Trump, because we now know that the dossier wastotal bunk. There was no truth to it. And we know that because of --that Cohen has testified now publicly that he wasn't in Prague, andthere was no truth to anything in the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said there was no collusion, by the way.</p><p>NUNES:  No collusion -- no collusion conspiracy, no obstruction.</p><p>You know, these are all issues that were essentially made inthat dossier that was the Democrat -- remember, for the viewers outthere -- and I think a lot of people forget -- this was theDemocratic campaign committee working with the Clinton campaign thatproduced this dirt, fed it into the FBI to start this investigationin the first place.</p><p>It was totally debunked this week, and it will be debunkedagain next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you have been investigating this now for upwardsof two years.</p><p>You have told us a lot. You have informed the public a lot interms of what took place in the 2016 election. I don't think,without you and your colleagues, we would even know what really tookplace by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI and the DOJ.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes. There's still more to come. We're going to keepinterviewing people. We're going to get this information out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about that, because you're wrapping upyour investigation. You have got a couple of things to do.</p><p>One of them is, you have provided a list of the people that youwould like to come down to speak to you and get testimony of them.So we have got this list. Go through some of these names and whythey're important, Tashina Gauhar, Gregory Brower, John Carlin,Kevin Clinesmith.</p><p>Tashina Gauhar is important why?</p><p>NUNES:  So, these are all names that we had sent to ourRepublican task force at the end of the last Congress.</p><p>These names are all important, because we need to know if thesepeople were involved in the chain of custody of the dossier that wejust referred to, because the dossier makes claims that thisinformation came from Russians.</p><p>So all the names that are on this list that we didn't get tolast year that still need to be interviewed, if we're really lookingfor Russian collusion, we need to know if any of those people wereactually talking to Russians on behalf of the Clinton campaign orany operative, whether it's Fusion GPS, what Russians were theyactually talking to, because, look, they could be the problem.</p><p>They could be -- these Clinton people could be the ones thatwere in bed with Russians, for all we know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, these are all...</p><p>NUNES:  Or it could be total nonsense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Many of these names are associated with HillaryClinton.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, obviously, names like Jake Sullivan, who was aP.R. guy, I believe, for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NUNES:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robby Mook, another P.R. guy for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Sidney Blumenthal, tell me why he's on your list.</p><p>NUNES:  Well, he was also involved in one of the dossiers. Sothere's several versions of the dossiers, OK?</p><p>So this was dirt he was feeding into through friends andacquaintances that got into the State Department, right? So,remember, the dossier came at very different angles all over theplace into the FBI and DOJ.</p><p>Some of those people in the Clinton campaign -- I think a lotof people forget this -- why would people in the Clinton campaign betweeting out messages about Trump's involvement with Russia? It'sbecause they had the dossier. They were promoting this message, thisdirt out there in 2016.</p><p>And we need to ask these Clinton campaign people where they gotit from. Did they get it from Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS, thedossier that they were paying for, or did they get it from someRussian friends of theirs that they know of?</p><p>The bottom line is, is that everything that was in thatdossier, all the accusations that were made, whether it was tweetsfrom the Hillary campaign, press releases from the Hillary campaign,it was all nonsense. It was stuff they were feeding into the press.The press was writing about it, they were tweeting it out andpromoting it out. And they were all in on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a part of -- it was part of their strategy toget this narrative out that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians.Give it to the media, let the media drive the bus on all of it.</p><p>And it actually worked, because...</p><p>NUNES:  At the end of the day -- at the end of the day, itworked.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... a year-and-a-half later, we're still talkingabout the potential of this.</p><p>NUNES:  That's right. That's right.</p><p>And that's why we're trying to get to the bottom of who wasinvolved. That's why we have all these lists of people we need tointerview. We need to know what their involvement was in all this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, so this is a list of 32 people.</p><p>Do you think you're ever going to get these people to come downand give you testimony? You don't have subpoena power anymore. Yourcolleagues are trying to lift every rock and look for a crime aroundDonald Trump.</p><p>NUNES:  So, the Democrats claim that they're going to be so muchnicer than we were to them.</p><p>So, remember, we gave them every single witness they wantedover the last two years when we were in the majority. They claimthey're going to give us witnesses. So far, they have given us zerowitnesses.</p><p>So, if they continue not to give us any witnesses, we will askall of these people to voluntarily come into Congress to talk to us.If they won't come in, we will either do it through the courts, orwe will send it over to the Senate, and hope that Lindsey Graham andhis team can get to the bottom of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Senator Graham has been with us many times overthe last several weeks.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said he's doing a deep dive. He's going tobring the necessary people to testify. In fact, he's going tointerview definitely the people who signed the FISA warrant.</p><p>So as you wrap up your investigation, you have got these 32names you want to interview. You have got, number two,declassification. Are we ever going to see declassification for someof the documents that you think are most important to educate theAmerican people about this?</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, I kind of sum it up this way.</p><p>There's really five areas, the interviews we just talked about.There's the criminal referrals that have to be made. There's thedeclassification, radical declassification. We need to havedeclassification across from everyone we interview to everyone thatMueller interviewed.</p><p>Then we're going to have to have a fundamental FISA reform. Wecan never again let the FISA process be used to target politicalcampaigns, right? We can't let our intelligence capabilities betargeted and pointed at political campaigns.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they went to the FISA court. And they said,look, we have this dirty dossier, and that's the reason that we'regoing to spy on the Trump campaign, essentially.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, and not only that. Not only did they get a warrantto get into somebody's e-mails on the campaign and get -- to be ableto suck all that up, e-mails and listen to phone calls and all ofthat.</p><p>They also opened a counterintelligence investigation into apolitical campaign. Now, these are tools that are supposed to beused to go after terrorists, you know, the people that destroyed thebuildings here in New York.</p><p>And then the final thing that we have to deal with is, themedia was involved in all of this, this disinformation campaign.They were given the dossier, and they spread it out. They spreadnumerous fake news stories about myself, the work that we were doingon the committee, many members on our committee, staff on ourcommittee.</p><p>That's going to have to be dealt with too, this disinformationcampaign. The slander and the libel will all have to be dealt with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're saying you're going to deal with themisinformation out there. How do you deal with that? You havereferred to them in the past as tech oligarchs to me.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes.</p><p>So, there's two ways that they're doing it. So, the fake newsmedia, they're putting out fake news stories. Sometimes, it comesfrom the Democrats, right, and the dossier. They feed it to themedia. The media runs a story</p><p>And then the numerous tech companies out there that are reallycontrolling what all Americans see, right? So, what these techcompanies have become is, they try to pretend they're not, butthey're content developers. They're developing content, OK, throughtwo ways, one, algorithms. So they're controlling what you and I seewhen we get on our device.</p><p>So for them to say that they're not developing content isnonsense. The other thing that they're doing is, they're monetizingthis. So there are some people that will not get rewarded. Like, ifyou're a conservative out there putting conservative videostogether, you're not going to get money for that, right? People arenot going to advertise on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NUNES:  So, all this has -- has got to be dealt with, I think,in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me get back to that, because I wantto find out how are you going to do that.</p><p>But speaking of interviews and your team looking at who youwant to speak to, I want to talk about this letter that yourcolleagues Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan sent to the attorney general,William Barr.</p><p>And, basically, they are asking for a number of things from theA.G. And they mention in particular Andrew Weissmann and ZainabAhmad. These are two individuals that worked at the Department ofJustice and now work at the special counsel 's office.</p><p>Can you tell me about Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad?</p><p>NUNES:  So, Weissmann is the number two. It's Mueller's deputy.He was involved in the custody of the dossier. So, in early 2016, hewas given the dossier.</p><p>This is somebody, him and the other individual that's mentionedthere, both DOJ people, both on the Mueller team. They shouldn't beinvolved in this investigation. I don't know -- well, and thequestions that my colleagues are asking is...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  ... is, you know, there's clear regulations that DOJ hasthat you can't be conflicted. And so they're asking questions.</p><p>Look, did they disclose to Mueller before Mueller picked themthat they were involved in the chain of custody of this dossier?Because I will tell you, if I was -- I don't know that they're goingto have any criminal indictments or not, but, if I was any attorney,I would be saying, look, these people that are bringing thisforward, they shouldn't be involved in this because they are biased.</p><p>We already know the people that were kicked off were biased.But you also have the fact that these two individuals that JimJordan and Mark Meadows are asking about were involved in the chainof custody of important evidence, the dossier, the dirt from theClinton campaign, that is the basis for this entire hoax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is important, because, for a long time, I havebeen asking the question, can the Robert Mueller special counselreport have credibility if it doesn't look at what we know to havebeen wrongdoing by this cabal of people at the top of the FBI?</p><p>So, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows write to Bill Barr. And theysay this. Number one, we'd like you to identify all actions taken byWeissmann and Ahmad, including disclosures to apprise the departmentor the special counsel's office of their role in the events BruceOhr testified to about supplying the FBI with information relatingto the Trump campaign.</p><p>So, they also want to explain all the actions taken byWeissmann and Ahmad after learning that Steele, Simpson and NellieOhr were providing Bruce Ohr information for the purpose of relayingit to the FBI, provide all documents and communications referring orrelating to disclosures made by Weissmann and Ahmad, and providedocuments and communications related to the process the departmentused to evaluate prosecutors and investigators' independence.</p><p>So they're right now still working on the special counsel'sinvestigation, Robert Mueller.</p><p>NUNES:  Right. And they're not -- they're not independentinvestigators. These are people that were in on this from thebeginning. They knew about the dossier. They were -- they broughtthis dossier forward.</p><p>I don't know if they told -- maybe they told Mueller, andMueller decided to waive these requirements that are there. Also,let's not forget, we also have evidence that, at one time, thatWeissmann was meeting with reporters.</p><p>And so you have this. And this is part of this wholedisinformation campaign. I should have said this earlier. It's notjust the media. It's not just that they were getting it from theClinton campaign. You also had people within the Department ofJustice and the FBI that were briefing reporters.</p><p>Now, what on earth are you doing briefing reporters? What wasWeissmann doing talking to AP reporters, right? We have asked thosequestions and never got the answers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>Well, it's a good point that you make. Jordan and Meadows wantthis information from the A.G. by March 15 at 5:00 p.m.</p><p>I want to take a short break, but we have got more to coverhere.</p><p>Number one, do you think they are going to get this informationby March 15? And, also, Mueller's report going to drop soon. Got toget your expectations.</p><p>Congressman Devin Nunes is with us this morning. He's stayingwith us.</p><p>Quick break, and then we will talk about the concerns aboutChina technology giant Huawei as well and the red flags being raisedby U.S. lawmakers on how Beijing may be infiltrating Americanuniversities to spread its propaganda.</p><p>Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures. Let meknow what you would like to know from Devin Nunes on Instagram@SundayFutures.</p><p>Stay with us, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\"right now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>And I am back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking memberon the House Intel Committee.</p><p>And, Congressman, you just said that you want to get thesepeople a list of 32 people down, so that you can interview them.</p><p>What happens next? I mean, our audience wants to seeaccountability. What are you expecting in terms of accountability?How will Bill Barr response to this letter that Meadows and Jordanjust sent him?</p><p>And do you think -- I mean, when you say criminal charges, whatdoes that mean, criminal referrals?</p><p>NUNES:  Let me start with this.</p><p>All of us want to see justice equal under the law, right? So wewant to see everyone held accountable.</p><p>I believe that, if the new attorney general and the Departmentof Justice, if they don't take all of this on, and do a full scruband have full accountability and transparency for the Americanpeople, you're going to see generations of conservatives who willnot trust the Department of Justice, they will not trust the FBI,and they for sure will not trust the FISA process.</p><p>So I mentioned this in things that we have left to do earlier.And I don't want to gloss over it, because it's very important. TheFISA laws were first written in the '70s. They need to be completelyrewritten because of what the Clinton campaign and the former peopleat DOJ and FBI were able to do.</p><p>That's going to be a whole undertaking that Congress has toundertake. If that's not done -- so we need accountability by --from the attorney general and the Department of Justice for all thepeople that were involved in this mess. And, at the same time,Congress is going to have to rewrite the laws that allow theintelligence agencies to go after American citizens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have brought all of this information forward.You have put it right there in front of Bill Barr.</p><p>Is he going to act on it, do you think? What are yourindications...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NUNES:  Well, we're going to -- yes, we will continue -- we willcontinue to work with the Justice Department. Barr just got inthere, so let's give him some time here.</p><p>I think, once the new deputy attorney general gets in, and thenwe will slowly get to work, and start to work with them to try tobring accountability to everyone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Last week, a federal judge in Florida ordered therelease of the depositions given by former British spy ChristopherSteele and an associate.</p><p>What are you expecting in terms of getting these depositionsunsealed?</p><p>NUNES:  So, this is great, because this is going to -- I thinkit's going to be on March 14 is going to be the day.</p><p>So, remember, Christopher Steele is the guy who was hired bythe Democrats to go get information from the Russians. He wouldn'tcome and talk to us, right? He's already been criminally referred tothe Justice Department. He was supposedly an asset for the FBI. Wenever got to interview him.</p><p>Luckily, someone sued him and a guy named, I think, DavidKramer, who was also involved in the creation and -- creation anddissemination of the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NUNES:  So, he pled the Fifth to us.</p><p>So between Christopher Steele and Kramer, we really want toknow, what did they tell the court? So this is going to befascinating information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the Mueller report? Are you expecting itto drop soon? What's going on there?</p><p>NUNES:  You know, you're going to interview Ken Starr a littlelater.</p><p>I don't understand. If Mueller doesn't have any crimes thathe's -- that he's going to prosecute on, then I don't know whatreport we'd be looking for, because, as far as I can tell, theMueller investigation was stood up for one reason, and one reasononly, and that was based on the dossier.</p><p>And, remember, we have never seen the scope memo that started-- we have talked about it many times on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  I hope people understand this.</p><p>There's a classified scope memo of what Mueller is supposed tobe doing. It's been hidden from Congress. It's been hidden from theAmerican people. My guess is, all it is, is the information from thedossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, real quick, Adam Schiff is looking fora crime. And he's doubling down on investigations.</p><p>Let's take a short break, and then I have got to ask you aboutyour colleague Adam Schiff.</p><p>Then, Senator Rick Scott and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney arehere.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the rankingmember on the House Intel Committee.</p><p>Your colleague who is the chairman of the Intel Committee isAdam Schiff. He said a long time ago he had more than circumstantialevidence that there's collusion between the president. He's stillout there looking for a crime, as you're trying to finish up yourinvestigation to indicate wrongdoing that he continues to push backon.</p><p>NUNES:  Yes, it's a lot like looking for, like, some mythicalcreature, right, this collusion creature?</p><p>So I often say -- I joke that it's like in search of Sasquatch,or Loch Ness Monster, or Chupacabra, which is like this mythicalanimal supposedly in the Southwest. They just don't exist.</p><p>And so he's just doing a lot of chasing the ghost around in thecloset. He's made lots of promises, and now he's basically movingthe goalposts to where they're no longer on collusion anymore.They're on to basically every single one of Donald Trump's businessventures that he was ever involved in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NUNES:  So, it's gotten way out of control, in terms, this is nolonger -- this has nothing to do with Russia anymore. This is justlike going after Trump, which is not the job of the IntelligenceCommittee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they want him out. I mean, let's face it.</p><p>I want to move on to China, because you have done aninvestigation for multi years at the Intel Committee.</p><p>And this week, I had the opportunity to speak with the chiefsecurity officer of Huawei Telecom. You have said for many yearsthat China has been stealing our intellectual property for years.</p><p>Listen to this exchange I have got to get your reaction to,Andy Purdy from Huawei.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You just said there have been no major issues aroundHuawei.</p><p>But, in fact, over the last year, years, several years, I cancite a list of companies that have sued you and you have donesettlements with, Motorola Solutions, T-Mobile, Cisco.</p><p>All of those companies sued Huawei for stealing trade secrets.</p><p>ANDY PURDY, HUAWEI CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER:  There have been nomajor cybersecurity incidents in the world involving Huawei.</p><p>That industry and the fact that we have had some lawsuits inthe past has characterized the industry for the last 20 years. Wehave resolved those issues, and we're moving forward. The remainingissues, we hope to resolve in the next year or so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Andy, it's not accurate to say that there were noissues around Huawei, when you had lawsuits for stealing tradesecrets. Huawei settled a lawsuit with Motorola Solutions forstealing trade secrets.</p><p>You settled a lawsuit with Cisco for stealing router tradesecrets. So are you saying that, yes, these issues and lawsuits wenton in the past, and we settled them, and now we're not going tosteal anymore? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>PURDY:  I'm saying two things.</p><p>I'm saying that, but I'm also saying there have been no majorcybersecurity incidents in the world in the 170 countries in whichwe do business. Our customers trust us around the world. And webelieve there are additional mechanisms that can be done, so we canprovide assurance and transparency, so that we can help make the --America benefit from us being allowed to compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you are on this P.R. triptoday, and you have this whole-page ad in The Journal. And I agreethat Huawei needs to convince the world that we can actually trustthe products of the company.</p><p>But to say there have been no issues with Huawei is just 100percent inaccurate. I just listed the number of companies that havesued you for stealing trade secrets and the settlements that youhave done.</p><p>PURDY:  Maria, I didn't disagree with the facts of those cases.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there you go.</p><p>What do people need to understand about Huawei and China?</p><p>NUNES:  Like all major companies in China, they're owned by theChinese Communist Party. They're owned by the leadership.</p><p>Huawei especially is one of the largest. They are developingconnections across the entire globe, the entire communicationsnetwork around the globe, so that they can have -- they can suck upanyone's e-mails, phone calls, text messages.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>NUNES:  That's what they're working on.</p><p>And any of the countries that allow Huawei to come in and putin the backbone of their architecture, they're absolutely crazy,because everything from their government is going to be headedstraight to Chinese intelligence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have a report here by IPVM. And they callthemselves the leading researcher on all video -- all things videocameras.</p><p>They report that Huawei Telecom components are currently in 60percent of all video cameras across the world. That's -- I don'twant to be an alarmist, but that tells me that China is not justlistening to us. They're watching us.</p><p>NUNES:  Well, and don't forget, the big tech companies are ableto do that too.</p><p>And so -- but, as it relates to Huawei, the challenge is, thisis not a private company, as much as it is a government-ownedcompany from the Chinese communists.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>I want to ask you about the so-called Confucius centers,because you and I have spoken about this in the past. But there wasa new Senate investigation. And they're warning that these Chinesestate-run centers are at -- in more than 100 U.S. colleges.</p><p>You have got Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley,like near Stanford. They're sharing research. What do you make ofConfucius centers?</p><p>NUNES:  Well, I would say first that Senate report that youreferred to, great report done by Senator Portman and his team.</p><p>It's not just the 100 universities that they're involved in.It's what they do there, right? So they're bringing in what arelikely either intelligence officers or people that are working withChinese intelligence.</p><p>They're doing -- they're seeding people into companies. They'rerecruiting people. These are all things that are in this SenateIntelligence -- or the Senate report by Rob Portman that I wouldencourage all of your viewers to go and take a Sunday and read it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not only that, but China has an enormous amount ofmoney. So they're buying up companies, like energy companies andbanks, and getting American data that way too, another way to...</p><p>NUNES:  And that's a whole 'nother -- yes. And they're doingthat all over the globe, which that could be a whole show just onthat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's great to have you on the program.</p><p>NUNES:  Thank you. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Congressman Devin Nunes joiningus.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

These companies should be left to innovate and serve consumers as creatively, quickly, and as innovatively as needed.[9] Yet, as large tech companies try to adapt to this new environment, they may hesitate about certain innovations for fear of running afoul of antitrust rules. This provides no benefit to consumers. Therefore, this is no time to hobble tech companies with esoteric regulatory concerns.[10]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The real cost of antitrust is the innovation it prevents. The risk of precluding advances, synergies, and solutions that could prove critical to a struggling economy and a stressed people is too high to justify these investigations.</p><p>It is not just a chilling effect on innovative ideas and arrangements that can impair these companies, but also the time and energy required to comply with information requests. For instance, in response to a 48-state investigation led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Google had provided more than 100,000 pages of information by mid-April 2020.[11] Forcing tech companies to use their large, but still limited resources to comply with paperwork requests of myriad antitrust investigations is counterproductive at a time when the company's customers need them most.</p><p>Price Gouging. Price gouging is not typically an antitrust issue, but it has become one during the coronavirus crisis. On March 9, Attorney General William Barr announced: \"The Department of Justice stands ready to make sure that bad actors do not take advantage of emergency response efforts, healthcare providers, or the American people during this crucial time.\"[12] In addition to federal warnings, 36 states already have price gouging legislation on their books.[13] Other states are considering similar legislation as part of their coronavirus response. There have also been calls for federal price gouging legislation, most prominently from Amazon Vice President for Public Policy Brian Huseman.[14]</p><p>Such legislation is a bad idea for several reasons. These go well beyond the typical \"price controls make shortages worse\" argument that is taught to every first-year economics undergraduateand forgotten by many policy makers.</p><p>Non-Regulatory Responses. Calls for price gouging legislation show a lack of creativity. Many companies have already developed effective ways to fight price gouging without regulation. Amazon's Huseman writes, \"We deploy dynamic automated technology to proactively seek out and pull down unreasonably priced offers, and we have a dedicated team focused on identifying and investigating unfairly priced products that are now in high demand, such as protective masks and hand sanitizer.\"[15] Company-level policies are also more adaptable than federal policies as technology and market circumstances change.</p><p>In fact, anti-price gouging technology could be a profitable business opportunity. If Amazon is not already doing so, it could license or sell its anti-price gouging technology to competitors for a profit. A startup with a killer app for use by online retailers could make a lot of money. Federal price gouging legislation would largely end this competitive behaviorprecisely the opposite of antitrust regulators' stated goal.</p><p>Moreover, regulations are made by the government we have, not the government we want. Amazon's technology and in-house policies are almost certainly more effective than what Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi, or Mitch McConnell would enact during an election year that also features a pandemic and civil unrest. The legislation would be enforced by a politicized Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, overseen by a president who frequently threatens legal action against Amazon and other high-profile businesses he dislikes.</p><p>Social Norms. Calls for legislation also ignore the power of social norms. Early in the pandemic, brothers Matt and Noah Colvin drove around Tennessee and Kentucky and bought up 17,700 bottles of sanitizer to try to sell on Amazon for as much as $70 each. Amazon barred them within a day. eBay went further, forbidding all sales of hand sanitizer and masks.[16] Tennessee state authorities got involved, but their actions were likely not necessary. The Colvins managed to avoid being charged and donated all of their stockpiled supplies to nonprofits free of charge.[17] The public shaming that ensued when their actions became public was enough to convince them to stop stockpiling emergency supplies.</p><p>Rent-Seeking. Rent-seeking is economists' term for using government for unfair advantage.[18] Price gouging legislation would allow Amazon and other large companies to raise rivals' costs without having to improve their own offerings.</p><p>One of the strongest arguments against antitrust regulation is that it creates major rent-seeking opportunities.[19] Big companies routinely game the rules to thwart competition. Price gouging legislation is another example of the same rent-seeking process. There is a reason why established companies often favor new regulationsthe rules usually keep out competitors. Price gouging regulations are no exception.</p><p>Short-Term Thinking. Amazon's call for a price gouging bill might be part of a larger effort to get itself out of antitrust crosshairs. But using price gouging legislation as a distraction tactic would only work temporarily. Those who favor expanding antitrust enforcement would gladly accept the price gouging bill, then continue their antitrust campaign the same as before. Both Amazon and the competitive process itself would be better served by avoiding short-term appeasement tactics.</p><p>Other Factors. The timing is as bad as the idea itself. Retail sales declines set new records for two months in a row in March and April, as people locked down nationwide. Despite bouncebacks in subsequent months, spending was still well below pre-COVID levels as of this writing.[20] Retailers have enough to deal with without having to spend resources complying with new rules their competitors helped to write.</p><p>There is a federalism angle, as well. A federal rule would undermine federalism by imposing standards on more than a dozen states that explicitly do not want them.</p><p>Mergers and Acquisitions Are Rarely Anti-Consumer or Anticompetitive. An idea gaining traction among Congressional Democrats is a moratorium on large-scale mergers and acquisitions. In late April, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) announced the Pandemic Anti-Monopoly Act. The bill, among other things, would put a hold on all mergers and acquisitions requiring disclosure to the FTC.[21] Rep. Ocasio-Cortez claims, \"With less competition, the whole country will see job loss and higher costs for consumers.\"[22] Other congressional Democrats have sent letters to the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department urging officials to halt mergers and acquisitions between major firms that have received government assistance under the various coronavirus-related economic relief laws.[23]</p><p>A ban on mergers and acquisitions during the coronavirus crisis is unnecessary and would only delay the economic recovery. As FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips told the New York Times:</p><p>[T]here is no evidence that the antitrust agencies are overwhelmed by filings. The Premerger Notification Office estimates a nearly 60 percent reduction in reported transactions during the past month, compared with the historical average. That is consistent with press reports indicating that M.andA. activity is down dramatically because of this crisis. Transactions reported to the F.T.C. also dropped off a cliff during the last recession. The market is funny like that.[24]</p><p>Mergers and acquisitions are simply another form of investment. In the same way that individual investors can provide needed capital and other resources to struggling businesses, saving jobs, as well as products and services for consumers, mergers and acquisitions do much of the same. A ban on investment, particularly in the middle of an economic crisis, would invite disaster. Mergers and acquisitions are not only a source of new capital, they free up other resources that can go toward serving consumers or developing new products.</p><p>Mergers and acquisitions also enable businesses to achieve economies of scale and other efficiencies. For example, companies that merge may no longer need separate offices or warehouses, so the cost savings can be redirected toward expanding production or service in other areas. In addition, companies that offer different but complementary products and services can combine to provide consumers with a wider range of options and cost savings.</p><p>A good example of the benefits of economies of scale arising from mergers and acquisitions is Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion. At the time, Instagram had just 13 employees[25] and roughly 30 million users.[26] Five years later, Instagram had grown to 450 employeesand undoubtedly many more today.[27] The platform now has over 1 billion users and is valued at over $100 billion.[28] The combined companies can now offer users different, but complementary social media experiences while offering their customers, mostly advertisers, a wider range of products.</p><p>Ultimately, Facebook's decision to purchase Instagram was not about eliminating Instagram as a would-be competitor, but rather to allow Facebook to compete more effectively with its existing rivals. As CNBC reported at the time:</p><p>Several former Facebook employees with knowledge of the Instagram acquisition tell CNBC that the company did not purchase the mobile app to squash a would-be competitor. Rather, the former employees argue, Facebook at the time was much smaller and fending off what threatened to be fierce competition from Twitter, which had already bid for Instagram, and Google's new social network.[29]</p><p>As this story demonstrates, the extent of competition in the market is not determined by the number of competitors, but by the ability of competitors to challenge one another. Competition quality is far more important than competition quantity.</p><p>Another recent merger illustrates this as well. Mobile carriers Sprint and T-Mobile completed a merger in April 2020. Of the four major carriers in the U.S., Sprint and T-Mobile were the fourth and third largest, respectively, well behind ATandT and Verizon. ATandT and Verizon have around 150 million subscribers each, compared to T-Mobile's 80 million and Sprint's 50 million.[30] Yet the combined T-Mobile/Sprint boasts a respectable 130 million subscribers, making the company a much more viable competitor to both ATandT and Verizon. What's more, Sprint was unlikely to have survived without a merger, so ATandT and Verizon would have been left with only each other and T-Mobile as viable competitors, with T-Mobile still well behind in terms of subscribers.[31]</p><p>Healthy competition is not just about bolstering existing competitors, however.</p><p>Exit Promotes Entry. Mergers and acquisitions play a critical role in fostering new market entrants. What attracts entrepreneurs and investors to a given market is the expectation that their hard work and investments will be rewarded one day. Mergers and acquisitions are a key element of that risk/reward structure. Regulations have made public stock offerings increasingly difficult for small and medium-sized firms.[32] The prospect of being bought out by major players in a given market plays an increasingly important role in encouraging investors and entrepreneurs to get into the market in the first place.</p><p>A 2004 academic study that looked at market entry in the banking sector following mergers and acquisitions concluded:</p><p>Our findings are strongly consistent with the hypothesis that MandAs are associated with subsequent increases in the probability of entry into the markets in which the MandAs occur. The results are both statistically and economically significant. [33]</p><p>Relevant to the COVID-19 crisis, there are several examples of significant market entrance during past recessions. Tech giants of today, such as Microsoft, Uber, Airbnb, Venmo, and Square, among others, were all founded during recessions.[34] The companies set to challenge today's major incumbent firms in the future are being founded today. The avenues by which these nascent firms entice prospective and transformational investors must not be closed off.</p><p>Don 't Expand Antitrust. The U.S. standard for antitrust law is consumer harm. With prices for many of big tech's services and products at zero, continued innovation in the industry, and companies competing vigorously for consumers' attention, it is hard to imagine the investigations currently underway at the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the House Judiciary Committee, and nearly every state attorney general finding evidence of customers being harmed.[35]</p><p>So, with little chance of proving illegal monopoly power or consumer harm, some advocates have argued for expanding antitrust enforcement to include data practices, privacy concerns, competitor interests, the environment, economic inequality, and political power, among other sundry causes.[36]</p><p>That expansion would represent a return to the chaos that antitrust law wreaked on the U.S. economy for much of the 20th century, yielding the opposite of progress for consumers and businesses. The U.S. already ran the experiment of antitrust trying to serve more than one master when it tried to both serve consumers and protect competitors. Antitrust law was full of contradictory court decisions and internal conflicts, and often resulted in protecting competitors over consumers.[37]</p><p>Furthermore, there is little evidence of dangerous market concentration or insufficient competition in U.S. digital markets. As a recent letter by 23 prominent economists, legal scholars, and practitioners sent to the House Judiciary Committee notes:</p><p>[T]he weight of the literature todaymuch of which is no more than a couple years old and some of which is still in working paper formdoes not support the conclusion that the economy has been trending inexorably toward increased market power and greater consumer harm, especially for the purpose of justifying dramatic legislative changes to the antitrust framework.[38]</p><p>The authors cite several economic analyses that reach similar conclusions.[39]</p><p>With little economic evidence of a problem, legislators and agency regulators should reject this expansion of antitrust laws beyond the consumer harm standard. To do otherwise invites compromising consumer welfare and encouraging corporate welfare and rent seeking.</p><p>Conclusion. Antitrust investigations at the federal and state level should be suspended during the COVID-19 crisis and, ideally, abandoned permanently. The unintended consequences of market distortion and chilled innovation are the last thing consumers and businesses need right nowor ever. This is no time for politicians and government lawyers to promote their own careers through the posturing of antitrust enforcement.

Small online businesses are struggling to survive during the COVID-19 crisis, despite offering customers a safe way to get goods and services during a deadly pandemic. Suspending or eliminating burdensome state sales tax laws would ease the compliance burden for small online businesses while also providing much-needed tax relief to consumers during difficult economic times. Allow Online Sales and Delivery of Legal but Prohibited Items. Some states have rules prohibiting delivery of alcohol, while others ban delivery of certain tobacco products. Since it is necessary to encourage people to stay at home during the pandemic, all such restrictions should be lifted to allow consumers to safely obtain these legal products. Repeal Price Controls for Debit Cards and Do Not Extend them to Credit Cards. Credit and debit cards have played a critical role in the COVID-19 crisis, allowing consumers to purchase goods and services while minimizing their interactions with merchants. The Dodd-Frank law\u2019s Durbin Amendment slapped price controls on fees banks and credit unions charge retailers to process debit card purchases. Unable to charge the full cost of processing transactions, banks and credit unions pass the additional costs onto the consumer. Repealing the price controls on debit card fees, and keeping them away from credit cards, will save consumers\u2019 hard-earned money in trying times. Allow Flexible Contracting Work Arrangements. Supporters of laws like California\u2019s AB5 claim reclassifying contractors as \u201cemployees\u201d is intended to protect struggling workers. But in reality, many Californians have found the law actually limits their ability to find work at all \u2013 and a bad situation has only been made worse during the COVID-19 crisis. California should repeal AB5, or at least suspend it during the crisis to encourage hiring. Other states and the federal government should avoid passing such counterproductive mandates. End Antitrust Investigations of Successful Tech Companies. Large, innovative tech companies have been invaluable during the COVID-19 crisis, easing the burden of millions of Americans and businesses under quarantine. Unfortunately, politicians on both sides of the aisle see political advantage in trying to \u201cbreak up big tech.\u201d The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Congress, and many state attorneys general are pursuing antitrust investigations into Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, casting a destructive shadow of uncertainty over an industry that has proven critical to life during the pandemic. The U.S standard for antitrust law is consumer harm and the current crisis has proven these companies are a huge benefit to American consumers and businesses. With little chance of proving consumer harm, regulators have argued expanding antitrust enforcement to cover data practices, privacy concerns, and the supposed interests of competing business interests rather than consumers. Policy makers should reject this expansion of antitrust laws beyond the consumer welfare standard and lift the shadow of uncertainty over important American innovators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3551093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DS-FP91-F0YC-N0ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Repealing the price controls on debit card fees, and keeping them away from credit cards, will save consumers' hard-earned money in trying times.</p><p>Allow Flexible Contracting Work Arrangements. Supporters of laws like California's AB5 claim reclassifying contractors as \"employees\" is intended to protect struggling workers. But in reality, many Californians have found the law actually limits their ability to find work at all and a bad situation has only been made worse during the COVID-19 crisis. California should repeal AB5, or at least suspend it during the crisis to encourage hiring. Other states and the federal government should avoid passing such counterproductive mandates.</p><p>End Antitrust Investigations of Successful Tech Companies. Large, innovative tech companies have been invaluable during the COVID-19 crisis, easing the burden of millions of Americans and businesses under quarantine. Unfortunately, politicians on both sides of the aisle see political advantage in trying to \"break up big tech.\" The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Congress, and many state attorneys general are pursuing antitrust investigations into Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, casting a destructive shadow of uncertainty over an industry that has proven critical to life during the pandemic. The U.S. standard for antitrust law is consumer harm and the current crisis has proven these companies are a huge benefit to American consumers and businesses. With little chance of proving consumer harm, regulators have argued expanding antitrust enforcement to cover data practices, privacy concerns, and the supposed interests of competing business interests rather than consumers. Policy makers should reject this expansion of antitrust laws beyond the consumer welfare standard and lift the shadow of uncertainty over important American innovators.</p><p>Read the whole report: Repeal of #NeverNeeded Regulations Can Help People Stay Home and Safe During the COVID-19 Crisis</p><p>For more on CEI's #NeverNeeded campaign, please visit neverneeded.cei.org.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123836224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DR-MG81-DYTH-G02V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Broadband Internet allows people to work from home with relatively little disruption. Electronic payments enable faster online ordering and contactless delivery of needed items, from groceries to prescriptions to takeout meals. Navigation apps allow delivery drivers to navigate their routes much more quickly and efficiently, while flexible hours make it possible to adjust schedules as needed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers should look to remove barriers to innovation that could yield even greater benefits. Federal and state policy makers have suspended regulations that could hinder response to the crisis. They should go further and make many of those suspensions permanent. Following are some key areas where they should focus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Suspend Internet Sales Taxes. Online small businesses are struggling to survive during the economic shutdown. These retailers provide a safe way to get customers what they need, but they are faced with burdensome state sales tax compliance.[1] Federal and state governments should remove these tax collection obligations for the sake of small online sellers and the consumers who benefit from them staying in business.</p><p>Suspension of state-level taxes for the duration of the coronavirus health crisis would lift the compliance burden on already strained companies. A remote sales tax holiday would encourage Americans to opt for the safer option of buying online, rather than visiting a retailer in person. Now is the time to focus on lightening the load for small businesses and ensuring the physical safety of citizens, not filling the coffers of revenue-hungry states.</p><p>The 2018 South Dakota v. Wayfair Supreme Court decision reversed decades of precedent by allowing states to collect sales taxes on online purchases from businesses located outside their borders. This was a blow to the federalist principle of tax competition.[2] It also has proven to be a practical nightmare for many small and medium-sized businesses that sell online.[3] Compliance costs are burdensome. Figuring out tax obligations in 10,000 distinct taxing jurisdictionseach with its own rates, definitions, and exemptionsis expensive and time-consuming. This problem will only get worse as more small businesses increase their presence online to compensate for shuttered physical locations.[4]</p><p>Federal lawmakers should consider preemption if states do not take action. Congress should pass legislation that prevents states from exporting their sales tax regime to businesses located wholly in other states.[5] An origin-based system preserves the principle of \"no taxation without representation,\" encourages healthy tax competition among the states, and is based on sound constitutional principles.[6] This approach goes from preferable to critical in the current economic environment.</p><p>Allow Online Sales and Delivery of Legal but Prohibited Items. Some states have regulations forbidding delivery of alcohol, others of tobacco products, and there are many other prohibitions of online sales. As it is necessary to encourage people to stay at home, all such restrictions should be lifted.</p><p>Across the country, state and local governments are setting aside rules that ordinarily bar direct delivery of certain products. States like Maryland have temporarily lifted rules that would ordinarily prohibit businesses that make and sell alcoholic beverages from delivering directly to homes.[7] Such allowances are pragmatic attempts to sustain non-essential businesses forced to close, as well as to encourage compliance with social distancing. In Pennsylvania, for example, where all 600 state-controlled liquor stores have been shut down and online sales remain prohibited, residents have been driving to neighboring states to purchase alcohol.[8]</p><p>States have shown less pragmatism with regards to tobacco. While combustible cigarettes remain available for purchase, as they are often sold at establishments deemed essential like supermarkets and gas stations, many consumers are finding themselves suddenly cut off from the lower-risk tobacco alternatives they previously relied on to stay smoke-free. For the most part, vapor shops, which sell non-combustible e-cigarettes, have not been deemed essential. At least six states currently prohibit e-cigarette sellers from delivering devices or liquids directly to residences.[9] Furthermore, federal lawmakers are urging the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban all e-cigarette sales nationally during the coronavirus outbreak.[10]</p><p>Such policies do not benefit public health under normal circumstances and could prove disastrous during the current pandemic. At worst, e-cigarettes may pose about 5 percent of the risk associated with smoking traditional cigarettes and, according to clinical trials, are at least twice as effective for smoking cessation than other methods.[11]</p><p>Bans on online sales and direct-to-consumer delivery of products that can help reduce the likelihood of smoking-related illness and death for smokers who switch also perpetuate existing health disparities. Smokers at lower socioeconomic levels and disadvantaged populations remain less likely to switch to these reduced-risk products.[12]</p><p>This is likely due to the higher initial cost of purchasing e-cigarettes, as well as the increasingly limited number of outlets selling vapor products. Such hurdles can be insurmountable for those with fewer resources like money, time, or transportation, as well as those who have lower mobility or live in rural areas or on reservations. As a result, many individuals in these populations continue to smoke at disproportionately high rates. The lockdowns, which have shuttered the few retail outlets allowed to sell e-cigarettes, will only exacerbate these problems, leading some existing smokers to continue with their deadly habit and some who had successfully switched to vaping to return to smoking. Worse, unable to obtain vapor products through legal means, some may turn to illicit and foreign sources of dubious quality and safety.</p><p>States that have not already done so ought to immediately lift restrictions on Internet sales and direct-to-consumer delivery of age-restricted products during the coronavirus crisis. Furthermore, they should work to ensure these policies remain in effect after social distancing policies end.</p><p>Repeal Price Controls for Debit Cards and Do Not Extend Them to Credit Cards. Credit and debit cards have played essential roles for countless families during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown by enabling payments for delivery and pickup of groceries and medical products, while minimizing contact between merchants and customers. But, unfortunately, thanks in large part to a destructive provision of Dodd-Frank financial overhaul of 2010, many Americans lack access to the banks and credit unions that issue these payment cards.</p><p>Dodd-Frank's Durbin Amendment, sponsored by then-Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), slapped price controls on the interchange fees that banks and credit unions charge retailers to process debit card purchases. Under the measure, debit card issuers must charge prices the Federal Reserve defines as \"reasonable and proportional to the cost.\" In addition, fees may only cover \"incremental costs,\" a definition that leaves out most fixed costs like computer hardware and software used to process card transactions.</p><p>The Durbin Amendment has resulted in a major windfall for the big retail firms that lobbied for it, such as Walmart, Walgreens, and Home Depot. A Home Depot executive bragged on a 2012 stock analysts' conference call that price controls could add up to $35 million per year to the chain's bottom line.[13]</p><p>The Durbin Amendment restricts banks and credit unions to recouping only \"incremental costs\" in the debit card fees they charge to retailers. That means they cannot recoup from retailers the full cost of many retail debit card transactions. So who pays these costs? Consumers, who have seen costs shifted to them in the form of reduced benefits, fewer free checking account options, and higher fees at banks and credit unions. And data show that the poorest consumers have paid the biggest price.</p><p>In 2009, the year before Dodd-Frank was enacted, 76 percent of checking accounts were free of charge. By 2011, that share had fallen to 45 percent, and by 2012 to 39 percent.[14] Service charges on non-interest-bearing checking accounts have also increased dramatically. A 2014 George Mason University study calculates that the Durbin Amendment contributed to 1 million Americans losing access to the banking systembecoming \"unbanked\"by 2011.[15]</p><p>Retailers that lobbied for the Durbin Amendment said it would result in savings that would be passed on to consumers, but those savings turned out to be miniscule or nonexistent. Even accounting for some lower prices in highly competitive markets, the public still suffered a net welfare loss of $22 to $25 billion. The amount lost in free checking and imposition of new bank fees exceeded any gains from lower retail prices, according to a 2015 study published in the Oxford Review of Law and Economics.[16]</p><p>Even in normal times, the lack of access to a payment card imposes severe hardship and inconvenience, such as always having to carry cash to make purchases. During crises such as the current one, when stores are closed or have sharply reduced hours, it can literally be an issue of survival, as those without payment cards are locked out of digital purchases. Congress should repeal or at least substantially relax the Durbin Amendment price controls for debit cards, and resist calls from retailer trade associations to extend these price controls to credit cards.[17]</p><p>Allow Permissionless Innovation in Development of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. When Bitcoin launched as the first cryptocurrency more than a decade ago, it looked like its most valued feature would be its ability to serve as an alternative to central bank currency, especially for people worried about inflation in the wake of massive quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. Today, given the Fed's actionswhich dwarf those of the 2008 financial crisis, but may be more justifiable because of the many businesses and individuals hit by something that was not their faultthere still is some desire to hedge potentially debased national currencies.</p><p>Today, when the public and policy makers are looking to move money faster, cryptocurrencies' potential to enable faster payments may be their biggest draw. The development of \"stablecoins,\" such as Tether and the Facebook-developed Libra, that can be denominated in a single national currency can lower the costs of payment processing for businesses and consumers. It can also increase financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked who are currently locked out of digital transactions (though, as noted, government interventions like the Durbin Amendment substantially contributed to the lack of banking access).</p><p>And blockchain technology, initially created as a distributed ledger to record cryptocurrency transactions, may have multiple beneficial uses in the pandemic and recovery. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, blockchain technology was already being utilized in countless new ways, from medical recordkeeping to land titling.[18] Now people are finding many ways that blockchain can be part of the solution to defeat COVID-19. For instance, scholars at Aston University in Birmingham, U.K., are researching a blockchain application to verify that medical equipment came from legitimate factories and is not defective.[19]</p><p>As it did with the development of the Internet, the government should adopt a hands-off approach that can foster an atmosphere of permissionless innovation for electronic payments. Cryptocurrency and blockchain creators should not be burdened by red tape in developing technologies that could greatly contribute to public health and economic recovery. The Securities and Exchange Commission should quit asserting jurisdiction where it has none by claiming that cryptocurrencies should be registered as securities.[20] Congress should pursue bipartisan legislation to create a less intrusive tax and regulatory regime for these technologies.[21]</p><p>Allow Flexible Contracting Work Arrangements. Supporters of California's AB-5 law contend that it is meant to protect struggling workers by ensuring that they are all classified as \"employees,\" not contractors. But many Californians have found that the law limits their ability to find workand the situation has gotten worse during the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>Since COVID-19 put the country under lockdown, people have turned to app-based companies such as DoorDash, Postmates, and UberEats to get daily essentials like food and prescription drugs. To beleaguered businesses, contractor delivery workers offer a lifeline to stay open and even a way to find new customers. For people left without work, they offer a short-term way to make ends meet. Other people have been able to earn extra cash.</p><p>Californians have not been as lucky, since AB-5 restricts this type of work in numerous ways.[22] The law's supporters have claimed that the \"gig economy\" model had nothing to do with flexibility and was just a convenient excuse to exploit workers and shirk responsibilities, like paying Social Security and payroll taxes, unemployment insurance, and other state and federal requirements.[23]</p><p>In theory, this helped people if they were working jobs full-time for one company. However, those workers represent only a fraction of the ones doing the gig economy jobs. It is little help for the majority of people who only want to work when they need to and do not plan to do it long-term. And limiting freelance work is particularly perverse if workers themselves want to be on their own, or are forced to because of the virus.</p><p>In an open letter to Governor Gavin Newsom, economists and political scientists from across the state's colleges and universities called for AB-5 to be suspended. \"Hiring laws, especially for firms with more than 50 employees, mean that companies are unwilling to make long-term commitments to traditional jobs. We aren't sure what our economic needs and capacities are going to be even two months from now. But hiring someone in a traditional job, with hours and benefit requirements, is too expensive to contemplate given that employers do not know whether they will be able to fill any permanent jobs at all and, if so, when,\" they noted.[24] Social media cites like Twitter were filled with pleas from Californians seeking relief.[25]</p><p>The Golden State's unemployment rate was an estimated 24.4 percent in March.[26] That is nearly 10 percentage points above the national rate of 14.7 percent, in April.[27] How much of that was AB-5's fault is hard to gauge, but the law certainly has not resulted in more hiringand the national unemployment rate has only continued to increase. To enable more effective responses to the crisis, policy makers should work to allow flexible work arrangements that both enable people to make ends meet while providing access to individual goods and services. State lawmakers should avoid laws like AB5and California should at least suspend it during the crisis. At the federal level, Congress should not include AB5-style labor provisions in any future COVID-19 relief legislation.</p><p>End Antitrust Investigation of Successful Tech Companies. Big tech has been invaluable in easing the burden of quarantine for millions of consumers[28] and businesses.[29] Unfortunately, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, Congress,[30] and many state attorneys general are continuing their antitrust investigations[31] into major tech firms like Google,[32] Facebook,[33] Apple[34] and Amazon.[35] Such open-ended investigations cast a destructive shadow of uncertainty over a sector that has proven critical in this crisis.</p><p>Facebook helping keep people stay in touch, Apple providing apps for curbside pickup from small businesses, Amazon's deliveries, and Google's tools for keeping informed are all enormously beneficial to consumers. These companies should be left to innovate and serve consumers as creatively, quickly, and as innovatively as needed.[36] Yet, as large tech companies try to adapt to this new environment, they may hesitate about certain innovations for fear of running afoul of antitrust rules. This is no benefit to consumers and no time to hobble tech companies with esoteric regulatory concerns.[37]</p><p>The real cost of antitrust regulation is the innovation it prevents. The risk of precluding advances, synergies, and solutions that could prove critical to a struggling economy and a stressed people is too high to justify these investigations.</p><p>It is not just a chilling effect on innovative ideas and arrangements that can impair these companies, but also the time and energy required to comply with information requests. For instance, in response to a 48-state investigation led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Google had provided more than 100,000 pages of information by mid-April 2020.[38] Forcing tech companies to use their large, but still limited, resources to comply with paperwork requests of myriad antitrust investigations is counterproductive at a time when the company's customers need them most.</p><p>The U.S. standard for antitrust law is consumer harm. With prices for many of big tech's services and products at zero, continuing strong innovation in the industry, and companies competing for consumers' attention, it is hard to imagine any of these investigations finding evidence of customers being harmed.[39] Antitrust regulators often point to barriers to entry as proof of monopoly power. But the meteoric success of Zoom clearly shows that barriers to entry are low in the tech sector. The startup's newfound dominance of video conferencing renders accusations of big tech holding widespread monopoly power unpersuasive.</p><p>So, with little chance of proving illegal monopoly power or consumer harm, regulators have argued for expanding antitrust enforcement to include data practices, privacy concerns, and the interests of competitors over consumers.[40] That would represent a return to the chaos that antitrust law wreaked on the U.S. economy for much of the 20th century, yielding the opposite of progress for consumers and businesses. Legislators and agency regulators should reject this expansion of antitrust laws beyond the consumer welfare standard.</p><p>Antitrust investigations at the federal and state level should be suspended during the crisis and, ideally, abandoned permanently. The unintended consequences of market distortion and chilled innovation are the last thing consumers and businesses need right now. This is no time for politicians and government lawyers to promote their own careers through antitrust enforcement. Consumer benefit and business resiliency must be paramount.</p><p>Ensure Commercial Access to Spectrum. The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) grant of Special Temporary Authority to ATandT and Verizon to use spectrum to help meet Americans' wireless broadband needs during the COVID-19 crisis suggests that there is a need to move more spectrum into private hands.[41] That would mean fewer spectrum bands sitting idle, designated for government agency use. Regulatory underbrush at the FCC has put American on a spectrum diet and that is suboptimal even in the best of times, but is even more harmful in a crisis. The FCC should push more spectrum into commercial use with property rights-based arrangements as quickly as possible.</p><p>A major part of the future of the economy, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been the increasing integration of the Internet into more and more devices and machines forming the \"Internet of Things.\" From new powerful handheld smart devices to large machines like driverless cars, an Internet of Things requires strong, safe, and reliable wireless connections. Wireless connections require well-allocated spectrum channels to ensure sufficient signal strength and prevent signals from interfering with one another.</p><p>This is not some far-off reality we can prepare for tomorrow. Today, millions of Americans working remotely or taking on new gig economy jobs rely more than ever on laptop computers connected through Wi-Fi spectrum and smartphones connected through cellular spectrum. Spectrum capacity is also needed to beam wireless broadband to rural and underserved communities that desperately need to stay connected in a world of social distancing.</p><p>The problem is twofold. First, unlike many resources, we simply cannot create more spectrum. This means spectrum policy must be singularly focused on improving the efficiency of its use. Second, virtually all spectrum has been allocated to either a commercial or government use.[42] This means creating new spectrum capacity for growth areas requires shifting or otherwise accommodating incumbents.</p><p>The most efficient way to allocate scarce resources with alternative uses is through markets, price signals, and property rights. The ability to do this with spectrum is limited because the federal government effectively nationalized spectrum in the 1920s and his since allocated it in ways that make potential market-based reallocation more difficult.[43] Government-issued licenses are now the closest thing to property rights in spectrum. In addition, the government has allowed various unlicensed uses of spectrum by certain technologies, constrained by various regulations in order to prevent interference.</p><p>Assuming there will not be a radical shift in this paradigm, there are a few things the government can do to ensure more spectrum is put to use into private hands and used in more economically efficient ways.</p><p>Congress must help clear regulatory uncertainty that exists with regards to spectrum allocation. Under current law, the FCC administers non-federal spectrum while the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) administers federal spectrum.[44] However, the FCC has final say on all spectrum allocation, private or public.[45] Federal agencies are supposed to coordinate their spectrum issues through NTIA, which subsequently coordinates with the FCC. Yet, there have been several recent cases of agencies flouting this system, openly feuding with the FCC in the media and before Congress, and ultimately delaying the reallocation of underutilized federally allocated spectrum to private uses.[46] First and foremost, Congress should work to end this increasingly untenable situation.</p><p>This confusion occurs because of the dearth of market mechanisms in spectrum allocation. Federal agencies that are incumbent spectrum holders face little to no incentive to help facilitate reallocation. Congress can change this.</p><p>First, agencies should be required, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, NTIA, and the FCC to include a value on the spectrum licenses they hold in their annual budgets. Subsequently, the fees charged to each federal agency should be made commensurate with the assessed value of the spectrum. Currently, federal agencies pay just $122 dollars for each assigned frequency they hold.[47] Finally, federal agencies, working with the FCC should be allowed to sell or sublease the licenses they hold to private sector actors.</p><p>Greater commercial access to spectrum will spur major investment in new products and services that harness wireless technology and the network infrastructure that powers them. This investment is not only critical for jumpstarting the post-COVID-19 economy, but also for hardening it against future crises.</p><p>Allow the Development of Private Tech Infrastructure. A major area of growth and investment after the crisis will likely involve products and services that allow more economic activity to move permanently online. As a result, the consequences of the digital dividethe gap between those Americans with reliable high-speed Internet access and those withoutwill only grow wider. The knee-jerk response to this will be to spend on subsidized or government-owned broadband networks.[48] Such a response will be a drain on needed private-sector investment.</p><p>The federal government already spends billions of dollars annually and automatically on broadband deployment. According to the Congressional Research Service, these programs spent a combined $9.1 billion in 2018.[49] The Federal Communications Commission, which administers roughly 90 percent of this spending through the Universal Service Fund (USF), is already in the process of restructuring broadband spending to ensure it does not lead to what is known as \"overbuilding\" and that such funds only go to truly unserved areas.[50]</p><p>Dr. Mark A. Jamison, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, explained the overbuilding problem in testimony before the Senate last year:</p><p>It is normal in competitive markets for rivals to duplicate each other's infrastructure. This duplication is important for rivals to be able to compete for customers and for companies to test alternative services for the future. This duplication of infrastructure can be wasteful at best, and perhaps even destructive, when the government is subsidizing one of the providers.[51]</p><p>Overbuilding harms investment because private networks struggle with, and often choose not to compete against, subsidized or government-owned networks, which always can afford to undercut competitionultimately leaving consumers without options if and when service suffers.</p><p>If current programs, such as the USF, already need restructuring to prevent overbuilding, haphazard stimulus funds present a substantial risk of this problem.</p><p>The correct solution is to either clear away or harmonize state and local regulations that impede the ability of private providers to deploy infrastructure to underserved areas. Whether a company is deploying fixed broadband networks, such as cable or fiber, erecting towers for wireless cellular and broadband service, or installing a dense network or small cells for Fifth Generation (5G) cellular service, there are common things they must do. This includes complying with local right-of-way access regulations, utility pole attachment rates, and historical and environmental reviews. Yet these things can vary not just from state to state but from technology to technology.[52]</p><p>These disparities in regulatory treatmentfrom state to state and even locality to locality across differing, but competing technologiesposes a major impediment to investment and efforts just to close the digital divide and to provide consumers with competitive options in the event that existing providers' service suffers.</p><p>To the extent that access regulations and reviews are necessary, they should be subject to strict cost caps and fixed time periods for review. These measures help potential market entrants approach new infrastructure investments with greater certainty. They further prevent local laws from having impacts on Internet service beyond their borders. A company forced to expend excessive resources in one market will likely divert those resources from serving another.</p><p>The Internet, also known as the World Wide Web, is fundamentally an interstate service, thus warranting federal regulatory oversight. The FCC has already made substantial efforts toward reducing and standardizing local regulatory burdens to 5G deployment.[53] In addition, the FCC recently intervened to prevent state and local governments from exploiting cable franchise rules in ways that harm broadband deployment.[54] The federal government should continue to explore areas where differing but competitive technologies are subject to unnecessary and disparate treatment and work to preempt such rules.</p><p>Finally, a major deterrent to broadband investment has been the specter of \"net neutrality\" regulation. Previously, the federal government sought to implement the amorphous concept of net neutrality through public utility-style regulation of Internet service providers (ISPs). The implementation of this regulatory change had a devastating effect on broadband infrastructure investment. Investment has since rebounded following the reversal of these rules in 2017.[55]</p><p>Despite the federal reversal, several states have begun promulgating their own net neutrality rules.[56] However, a recent ruling at the D.C. Circuit Court largely upheld the FCC's power to preempt state net neutrality laws, albeit on a case-by-case basis rather than via a blanket preemption.[57] Regardless, even if such state laws are likely to be successfully preempted by the federal government, they can still cause unneeded delays and uncertainty when it comes to broadband investment. States should cease pursuing these laws. Further, Congress should enact legislation with blanket preemption of state net neutrality laws while enshrining the existing regulatory status of ISPs as reestablished in 2017.</p><p>Conclusion. An effective response to the COVID-19 crisis requires finding ways to make it easier for people to stay at home. That means facilitating ways to work, shop, and access information and entertainment while sheltering in place. The private sector, especially technology firms, have made great strides in that regard. Government should allow them to continue to do so by removing as many regulatory barriers to innovation as possible.</p><p>Notes</p><p>[1] Eric Boehm, \"The Supreme Court's Online Sales Tax Ruling Is Already a Hug Headache for Small Businesses, Reason, March 19, 2019,</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://reason.com/2019/03/19/the-supreme-courts-online-sales-tax-ruli/\">https://reason.com/2019/03/19/the-supreme-courts-online-sales-tax-ruli/</url>.</p><p>[2] Jessica Melugin, \"Online Sales Taxes Make Government Bigger and Undermine Federalism,\" Web Memo No. 42, Competitive Enterprise Institute, March 15, 2018,</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cei.org/content/online-sales-taxes-make-government-bigger-and-undermine-federalism\">https://cei.org/content/online-sales-taxes-make-government-bigger-and-undermine-federalism</url>.</p><p>[3] Ruth Simon, \"Sales-Tax Ruling Strains Small Online Sellers,\" Wall Street Journal, December 29, 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sales-tax-ruling-strains-small-online-sellers-11577615401\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/sales-tax-ruling-strains-small-online-sellers-11577615401</url>.</p><p>[4] Tatiana Walk-Morris, \"EBay Pledges $100M to Help Small Businesses Move Online,\" RetailDive, April 6, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/ebay-pledges-100m-to-help-small-businesses-move-online/575462/\">https://www.retaildive.com/news/ebay-pledges-100m-to-help-small-businesses-move-online/575462/</url>.</p><p>[5] H.R. 6824, Online Sales Simplicity and Small Business Relief Act of 2018, Introduced September 13, 2018, 115th Congress, Second Session. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6824/text\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6824/text</url>.</p><p>[6] Michael Greve, Sell Globally, Tax Locally (Washington, D.C.: AEI Press, 2003), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/book/sell-globally-tax-locally/\">https://www.aei.org/research-products/book/sell-globally-tax-locally/</url>.</p><p>[7] Jacqueline Covey, \"Hogan signs executive order allowing alcohol delivery as Cecil County haunts stick it out,\" Cecil Daily, March 21, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cecildaily.com/emergency_notice/hogan-signs-executive-order-allowing-alcohol-delivery-as-cecil-county/article_ed101302-5660-5a03-bfd0-b238f10a031f.html\">https://www.cecildaily.com/emergency_notice/hogan-signs-executive-order-allowing-alcohol-delivery-as-cecil-county/article_ed101302-5660-5a03-bfd0-b238f10a031f.html</url>.</p><p>[8] Alisha Ebrahimji, \"Pennsylvanians are driving out of state to buy liquor, so neighboring states are cracking down,\" CNN, April 15, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/15/us/pennsylvania-liquor-sales-ohio-west-virginia-trnd/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/15/us/pennsylvania-liquor-sales-ohio-west-virginia-trnd/index.html</url>.

Jesus Chuy Garcia, D-Illinois, issued the following statement:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today Congressman Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia (IL-04) questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and introduced H.R. 4813, the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which would block Facebook from developing its controversial Libra Project. The bill prohibits Facebook and other big tech companies from developing digital currencies.</p><p>\"At today's Financial Services Committee hearing, I introduced the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act, which would prevent Facebook and other tech giants from developing digital currencies or assets like Libra. Big tech companies like Facebook are entering the financial services market at an alarming rate. Given the enormous access that tech giants like Facebook have to people's data and their ability to manipulate markets through their size and power, the prospect of them operating a bank or currency is troubling.</p><p>\"Left unregulated, Facebook is another 'too-big-to-fail institution' like those that caused the 2008 financial meltdown. Not only will Facebook use their monopoly on private data to manipulate markets, consumers will be exposed to immense financial risks without government protections for their money or investments.</p><p>\"Mr. Zuckerberg stated that Facebook should not be regulated like a bank or by the SEC, despite growing expert legal agreement about how to protect consumers. Zuckerberg basically said that he doesn't want anyone looking over his shoulder or reviewing his company's books. Given Facebook's track record of evading criminal liability, abusing private data, and manipulating markets with their monopolistic power, regulators should be considering how to break up Facebook, not greenlighting a new, dangerous project like Libra.</p><p>\"We have a responsibility to protect the American public and every day consumers. To do so, we must hold Big Tech giants like Facebook accountable and keep them from entering the currency market. My Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act does just that.\"</p><p>In the coming weeks, Rep. Garcia will be introducing additional legislation that further strengthens the separation between banking and commerce.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6902191 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6902191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBK-70D1-DYG2-R3TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"365\"/><timeReceived>8:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Good to see you. So, breaking tonight, Congressman Trey Gowdy joins us with his reaction tonight to the firing of the veteran FBI agent who ran both the Clinton and Trump campaign investigations and who wrote this, just to remind you, among other similar things during the 2016 election. \"Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could smell the Trump support.</p><p>The question now was this one firing enough to change the culture? And what about the other three unnamed FBI agents so far who according to the Inspector General report should be investigated for their politically charged text messages.</p><p>Good evening everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. My next guest is no stranger to this story and Peter Strzok.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Stays into your Russian collusion with the Trump campaign investigation. And you got another text from your colleague, Lisa Page. \"Trump's not ever going to become president, right?\" Right? And you replied, \"No, no he's not. We'll stop it. I want to know what it meant agent Strzok.</p><p>PETER STRZOK, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, FBI: It would be his candidacy.</p><p>GOWDY: March of 2016, you wrote, \"God, Hillary should win a hundred million to zero. And March of 2016, weren't you investigating her for potential mishandling of classified information?</p><p>STRZOK: We were.</p><p>GOWDY: Had you interviewed her yet?</p><p>STRZOK: No, but I don't appreciate what was originally said being changed.</p><p>GOWDY: I don't give a damn what you appreciate agent Strzok. I don't appreciate having an FBI agent with an unprecedented level of animus working on two major investigations during 2016.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Just a sampling of some of the water that's gone under the bridge. Here now, exclusively with his reaction to all of this tonight is Congressman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina.</p><p>Congressman, welcome. Good to have you here on THE STORY tonight.</p><p>GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. Thank you.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Were you surprised by this outcome that he was fired at this point and why do you think it happened now?</p><p>GOWDY: I think the process had just reached the point where it was a Deputy Director at Bowditch's desk. I mean, keep in mind, Peter Strzok receives a much fairer process than what he was given to Donald Trump.</p><p>This was a referral by the inspector general who if memory serves was an Obama appointee. Michael Horowitz referred it. It was investigated by OPR. Strzok has a chance to defend himself from participate in the process and submit extra material. And then, a recommendation is made with respect to punishment.</p><p>And Deputy Director Bowditch is not a political appointee. He is a 23-year long bureau agent who served with great distinction including running the Los Angeles field office. That's who made the decision to terminate Peter Strzok. It was not a political appointee, it was a career G-Man.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, his attorney doesn't agree with you. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AITAN GOELMAN, ATTORNEY FOR PETER STRZOK: I don't think that you can rationally reach any conclusion other than it was political. It's difficult to believe given the steady drumbeat of texts demonizing Pete from the President and all the calls on Capitol Hill by Republicans for Pete to be fired that, that didn't play a role in the Bureau's ultimate decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, he essentially says that you demonized Peter Strzok and that you played a role in his firing.</p><p>GOWDY: No, Peter Strzok didn't need any help at all demonizing himself. He had that fully covered. This is exactly what they said about Andy McCabe, remember?</p><p>And some of my Democrat colleagues were going to hire Andy McCabe, so he could finish out his time at the bureau. I don't know if you remember that. I can't forget it.</p><p>Peter Strzok -- of course, his lawyer says that it was a railroad job. There's the only other option is to say, \"You know what, my client prejudged two major investigations.</p><p>He made up his mind that Hillary Clinton was innocent before he interviewed her. He made up his mind that Donald Trump should be impeached before he bothered to interview him. And no other way he did a lot of this on the government phone, and he violated other FBI policy.</p><p>That's his other option. Either say that or say it was political and predictably, if you pay someone enough, Martha, they'll say damn near anything. Particularly, lawyers and he got a lawyer who's willing to say it's political.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. So, the Inspector General as I mentioned at the beginning of the program also said that there were a few other FBI agents who had sent similarly bias and politically motivated apparently text messages.</p><p>What's going on with them? Or are we going to hear more about this investigation and do you think that this Peter Strzok firing is enough in terms of the culture?</p><p>GOWDY: Well, Chairman Goodlatte and I have written asking for the names of those Bureau and DOJ employees, apparently, according to DOJ and Bureau policy, they don't rise to the level of their names being shared with Congress. But there I'm sure under investigation.</p><p>Just like those were a referral from Horowitz on Strzok. There was a referral on these, some of what they said is just unbelievable. Particularly, about their fellow citizens, particularly people who live in Ohio. You mentioned the smelling people in Virginia, they also had something really derogatory to say about folks in Ohio.</p><p>So, I am sure they will be afforded all of the process that they're due. But again, Martha, it is more than Strzok was willing to afford the President of the United States. They have a chance to defend themselves and there will be a recommendation made. And then, ultimately, Deputy Director Bowditch will decide whether or not to follow it.</p><p>You asked if it's enough. There have been 10 folks that were involved in the Hillary Clinton investigation and Donald Trump investigation that are no longer with the bureau. Lots of them were really high up.</p><p>Instead of focusing on the firings, I have focused on the hirings. Chris Wray and David Bowditch, I am convinced, are going to be able to repair the institutional reputation of the Bureau.</p><p>99.9 percent of the agents don't need their reputation to improve because it's already really good, but they're going to take the FBI back to what we remember it being. So it's the two hiring's that I'm most excited about.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, yes. And you make a good point. I mean, the DOJ and the FBI have done housecleaning clearly. So, they clearly think that there was a problem with 10 individuals who were involved in this investigation, and they are no longer there.</p><p>I want to ask you about these Bruce Ohr text messages because I'm curious what you think about him. Because he's kind of being at the back of this story for a while. But now that we're reading, and I know you read quite a while ago the message that he sent to Christopher Steele who, of course, was the person behind the dossier. Here's one from July 1.</p><p>\"I am seeing a redacted person in London next week to discuss ongoing business, but there is something separate I wanted to discuss with you informally and separately. It concerns our favorite business tycoon.\" Your thoughts on that one.</p><p>GOWDY: Bruce Ohr, who work for the Department of Justice. He had absolutely nothing to do with the Russia investigation other than he inserted himself by having contact with Chris Steele. Martha, he even had contact with Chris Steele after the FBI terminated its relationship with Chris Steele.</p><p>So, this is one branch of the Department of Justice that says you're not even fit to be an informant and here's a DOJ. I think he may have been third in command. We're going to interview him on August 28th.</p><p>I am going to come back to Washington. I'm going to leave my beloved South Carolina, and I'm going to go back. And I'm sure others will too. Jimmy and Mark and Ratcliffe. We're going to be back, and we're going to interview Bruce Ohr, not in a public circus setting, but any deposition with no time limits.</p><p>And we're going to get to the bottom of what he did, why he did it, who he did it in concert with, whether he had the permission of the supervisors at the Department of Justice?</p><p>It is. I used to work doing what Bruce Ohr does now. It is unbelievable that a prosecutor would insert himself into an ongoing investigation for which he had nothing to do.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, well one thing you had to do was that his wife worked for Fusion GPS who was working on --</p><p>GOWDY: There is that.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Who was working on the dossier and we will -- is that going to be open or closed testimony with Bruce Ohr?</p><p>GOWDY: Yes, we don't behave that well when the cameras are in there, Martha. So, we're going to do it in a closed confidential private setting where everybody behaves and it's much more constructive.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. I want to ask you about Rudy Giuliani, and what he said this weekend with regard to perjury traps, and whether or not the president should sit down with Robert Mueller. Let's play that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There was no conversation about Michael Flynn. I think it was February when it supposedly took place. Memo came out in May, and in between Comey testified under oath that in no way had he been obstructed at any time.</p><p>And then, all of a sudden in May, he says he felt obstructed. He felt pressured by that comment, you should go easy on Flynn. So, we maintained the president didn't say that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: It was indicated prior to that statement that the president talked about it but that he meant nothing by it that it didn't constitute obstruction. So, what do you make of all of this, congressman?</p><p>GOWDY: Well, there are only two people that know whether or not it came up. One is President Trump and the other is Jim Comey. I think, the better line of analysis, and again, I'm not the president's lawyer, and he can do better than me. But, there are four elements to perjury. It has to be under oath, it has to be material, it has to be intentional.</p><p>The falsehood has to be intentional. I think, the president, if he doesn't remember that coming up, that's a perfectly acceptable answer. I don't remember Ohr, that's not what I recall, or I don't think I phrased it that way.</p><p>Martha, I will tell you this. If it is obstruction of justice to ask someone to show leniency, then we're going to have to build a lot more prisons in this country, and they're going to be preachers in most of them.</p><p>For 20 years I had preachers called me and asked me to please give this person a second chance, please show some leniency. That is not obstruction of justice. That is what happens all across this country every day. And Jim Comey must not have felt obstructed because he kept working for the guy.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. And he claimed an open testimony that no one had interfered with his investigation. I have to go but I want to ask you one more quick question. In the Manafort trial, the judge appears to have been quite hard on Mueller's team.</p><p>You have been very supportive, and a proponent of the integrity of Mueller's team. Did what you hear in there affect your opinion about that at all?</p><p>GOWDY: It affects my opinion on the judge. The fact that you and I are talking about a judge. They're supposed to be neutral detached arbiters, referees, umpires. The fact that he inserts himself -- whether I supported the prosecution or the defense is immaterial, judges are not active participants in the trial.</p><p>And I've been in front of some tough ones. I've never been in front of one who enjoyed hearing his name and enjoyed being the star of the show as much as this one. And I frankly feel sorry for the -- for the lawyers on both sides that they're having to put up with a judge up who was confusing himself with the deity.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Congressman Trey Gowdy, always good to see you, sir. Thank you very much for coming in tonight.</p><p>GOWDY: Yes, ma'am. You too.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You bet. So, coming up next. Omarosa, claims now that she has Jared and Ivanka on tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OMAROSA MANIGAULT NEWMAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS, OFFICE OF PUBLIC LIAISON: There's a lot of very corrupt things that are happening in the White House and I am going to blow the whistle on a lot of that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Oh boy, what a drama this is. Governor Mike Huckabee knows all the players and he is here, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWMAN: I'm in the room and I can only speak for myself because civil rights is a priority for this President. What's happening in the inner cities is a priority for this President. The coalition's that I work with, they're priorities for this President. This is our second day here and I think that this President has accomplished more in two days than most presidents have in a very long time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So that interview was here during the first hundred days but after Omarosa was fired by John Kelly, she started singing a very different tune. She had been secretly taping private conversations in the White House and tonight there is some indication that those might include more tapes that perhaps have Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump we won't we -- won't know unless those actually are released but obviously a lot of this is to trump up her book so to speak. Trace Gallagher is live in our West Coast Newsroom with the backstory tonight. Hi Trace!</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hi Martha! The first part of Omarosa Manigault Newman's book tour has certainly been riddled with credibility problems. She's been done in by her own words. For example, she now says she heard Donald Trump on tape using a racial slur but in her book, she claims somebody else told her about the slur. Then there was the \"why she or wasn't she fired?\" The recording she released today appears to show the President being surprised that Omarosa was leaving the White House. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Omarosa, what's going on. I just saw in the news that you're thinking about leaving. What happened?</p><p>NEWMAN: General Kelly -- General Kelly came to me and said that you guys wanted me to leave.</p><p>TRUMP: No, nobody even told me about it.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Omarosa now claims and the White House appears to support that it was President Trump who \"delegated her firing.\" Listen to the tape Manigault Newman released of White House Chief of Staff John Kelly letting her go followed by what she told Good Morning America after she left the White House in December of last year. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KELLY, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I think it's important to understand and if we make this a friendly departure, we can all be you know, you can -- you can look at look at your time here in the White House as a year of service to the nation and then you can go on without any type of difficulty in the future relative to your reputation.</p><p>NEWMAN: I resigned and I didn't do that in the residence as being reported. John Kelly and I sat down in the Situation Room which is a very secure, very quiet room in the White House and we had a very candid conversation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Now, experts are torn on whether recording conversations in the Situation Room is illegal but they agree it is a clear violation of national security regulations. But on the Today Show, Manigault Newman says she's not worried about the fallout. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWMAN: I have protections. The moment that I've decided to blow the whistle on a lot of the corruption going on in the White House, there are protections that (INAUDIBLE) to me so let's be clear. The things that general Kelly is joining in this White House should concern all Americans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: President Trump responded \"while I know it's not presidential to take on a low-life like Omarosa and while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern-day form of communication and I know the fake news media will be working overtime to make even whacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible. Sorry.\" And Martha, you mentioned at the top Omarosa claims to have tapes of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Politico is now reporting those tapes say that they wished her the best and had no idea that she had been fired at the time.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Very interesting. Trace, thank you. Governor Mike Huckabee former Presidential Candidate and Fox News Contributor joins me now. Governor, obviously you know a lot of the people that are involved in all of this. Does any of this really surprise you and when you listen to the tape with John Kelly, is there anything surprising about that conversation?</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You know, there is, Martha. When I listened to John Kelly kind of letting her down easy I'm thinking that is the most gentle general I've ever seen when he's firing somebody.</p><p>MACCALLUM: She says he was threatening her.</p><p>HUCKABEE: No he wasn't threatening her. He was just making it very clear that she had some integrity issues, that she wasn't going to be able to say, that it was non-negotiable. He was calm, he was rational, but he was very firm and clear that she was going to have to go. I just can't believe that she has betrayed the President like this. You know, this is a person who a year ago was saying what a wonderful guy he was and now you know, she's thinking he's just awful and everybody in the White House is awful. So either she was lying then or she's lying now, the one thing we know is that she's a liar and she may be lying both times. The point is she has zero credibility.</p><p>And here's what I find interesting, Martha. All these various news outlets that are just begging her to come on and spill stuff about the president, I mean they're going to drop her faster than a plastic straw in California as soon as they use her all up. And she still doesn't realize that she's not going to be some celebrity because of what she's done because nobody will ever be able to trust her.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean, anybody who watched five minutes of The Apprentice could have figured out that this was going to happen, that this was going to end badly so you know, the one I think fair criticism here, Governor Huckabee, is why they would ever have hired this person who is you know, a reality T.V. show actress in the first place?</p><p>HUCKABEE: That's a fair criticism of the President. Why did he -- why did he ever hire her? Now, maybe it was sympathy, maybe it was that she had been a loyal campaigner and he thought you know, well hey, I'll give her a job but it's pretty apparent she was way over her head, didn't really have a function or a role, and ultimately was a troublemaker but not necessarily a problem solver. And that kind of person shouldn't be on the federal payroll.</p><p>So yes, I agree with you. I think it's fair to say that she should have been vetted more. They should have had a clear direction for what she was going to do. But when they realized she was not going to get better they let her go and she was fine until she was able to start hawking her book and suddenly you know, the guy who had been the greatest thing since the invention of the wheel now became worse than the wicked witch of the west at a water park. I just think it's disingenuous on her part but it's ludicrous on the part of the media who held her in such contempt before to now think she's some kind of Joan of Arc and so wonderful and how great it is that she has this courage to speak. She's just trying to make a buck and she sold her soul to do it and it's sad.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Governor Mike Huckabee, the saga continues on this one I think for a while. We'll see where it goes. Thank you, sir. Good to see you tonight.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Thank you, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You bet. Always good to have you here. All right, so how does a plane get stolen and flown from a major U.S. Airport in the post 9/11 era. Our own Lea Gabrielle, a former Navy pilot is here with the shocking truth about that.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD RUSSELL, SEATTLE PLANE THIEF: I've got a lot of people that care about me and it's going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I'm just a broken guy, got a few screws loose I guess. Never really knew it until now.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He came flying out of the cargo area.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Call and scramble now.</p><p>RUSSELL: -- going to try to do a barrel roll. And if that goes good, then I'm going to go nose down and call it a night.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Unbelievable. Those are the final words from the airport employee who hijacked an empty plane and flew it for an hour before crashing on Friday night. The incident, of course, raises security concerns all across the country. Investigators say that 29-year-old Richard Russell who you can see tragically flying that plane. He did loop- the-loops, a barrel roll. He was a ground service worker at Seattle-Tacoma Airport known as SeaTac and he simply pushed the 76 cedar turboprop back from a maintenance area and then took off without authorization.</p><p>The big question tonight is how could he do that? Lea Gabrielle, Fox News Correspondent, and former Navy pilot, Lea, thank you for coming in tonight. It's good to have you here. The family spoke out today and I just want to play this. This is the family and friends of Richard Russell. Watch.</p><p>MIKE MATTHEWS, FAMILY FRIEND OF RICHARD RUSSELL: He was a faithful husband, a loving son, and a good friend. A childhood friend remarked that Bebo was loved by everyone because he was kind and gentle to each person who he met. This is a complete shock to us. We are devastated by these events and Jesus is truly the only one holding this family together right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know he said himself there are people who care about me who are going to be so disappointed in what I'm doing. And you know obviously this is a tragedy for this family but it also raises so many questions about having a terrorist who's trained and gets himself a job working at an airport could do the same thing with disastrous results for other people.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That is absolutely true, Martha. One of the questions I keep getting about this story is how could somebody steal an airplane? It is actually very easy to steal an airplane because they're not set up to have large amounts of security. This Airport has security but this person had been screened. In fact, this airport had added additional screening the past year and a half where you had to have biometrics and you had to be badged if you were allowed to operate in that area. So he was within the circle of trust. That's where that security falls for that air -- that airfield.</p><p>But when you think about flying an airplane, they're designed to fly. They're not that hard to fly. There are many airports around the country that don't have that level of security where somebody can literally walk out on to the airfield get in an airplane if they can get inside the cockpit, they can fly it. So it's not that surprising. Now, I will say you know, one word of caution when people are nervous about this is that this is a person who didn't have any red flags. This is a person who didn't have something in his background that would have indicated that he was trouble or that he might do something wrong or to harm other people and certainly it doesn't seem as though he intended to hurt anyone.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, but the biggest concern here is that so -- and this has been a concern in since after 9/11 that's somebody, anybody who wanted to become a terrorist, get his hands on a plane could work in an airport. You could be there for five years. You could have a perfectly clean record. You could be a sleeper agent. And then you have this access. Why isn't there a key? Why aren't the planes locked? Why shouldn't you have some sort of finger- maker or anything to allow you to get on the plane?</p><p>GABRIELLE: It's a really good question. And the reason is because of the logistics. You know, when you go to, you know, to get on a flight to so somewhere you want efficiency and you want your ticket prices to be lower. Well, all those things decrease deficiency.</p><p>If you have to lock the aircraft then somebody has to have a key to get in the maintainers who are in charge of moving it around. If an airplane lands and goes to one gate and then it needs to be move to another, they have maintainers on the ground who are trusted their credentials to be able to do that.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Wow.</p><p>GABRIELLE: So it changes things. Airplanes are easy to fly but not easy to land though and then not easy to maneuver. There's a lot of simulators that you can find online that teach you how to flip the right switches and get it airborne.</p><p>MACCALLUM: They are more and more automatic and more and more able to able to plan their own than ever.</p><p>GABRIELLE: The rules are written in blood and I think that we will see more rules because of this incident.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Lea Gabrielle, thank you very much. Good to have you here tonight.</p><p>So, coming up next, a word of warning. Before you Google, how the tech company has violated its own promises to protect your privacy. Wait until you hear what your simple search is getting you. Steve Hilton with the story, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have the best spirit, the best soldiers ever to set foot on any battlefield anywhere at any time. We are the most powerful. We are the best funded. We are the biggest. We are the strongest. We are the smartest. And we are still not holding a damn thing because America is on the move once again and we are not backing down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: That holding reference was from a Patton, quote, \"that the president was talking about today about moving forward and not holding your position.\"</p><p>That was President Trump at Fort Drum earlier today signaling -- signing, rather, a $716 billion defense policy bill giving the largest pay raise to the military in nine years.</p><p>The president's support among the military is just one of many topics that I discussed with outspoken Republican Rick Wilson earlier today. He is the author of the new book \"Everything Trump Touches Dies.\" Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACCALLUM: When you watch that and you watch him speaks at the military, he got a very positive response there today. What goes through your mind?</p><p>RICK WILSON, Republican STRATEGIST: Look, Donald Trump has speechwriters like every other president's speechwriters. What I worry about is not what's prepared for him to say in an event like this. What I worry about is the impulsive nature of this president.</p><p>Because look, I'm not -- I'm not some liberal rhino squash who wants the president to, you know, become, you know, pro-abortion or anything with that. I'm a conservative and I believe that the power of the presidency is a sacred power. And I believe that the government needs to have a perspective from someone who is a mindful leader and follows in the traditions of our greatest presidents, and I find that Donald Trump doesn't meet those standards.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So let me say this. When I, you know, reading your book--</p><p>WILSON: Sure.</p><p>MACCALLUM: -- that's the thing that really I think speaks the loudest. What I get from it in many ways, is you don't like him, you don't like his style, you are offended by him.</p><p>And a lot of people that I talked to across the country, I always ask people what they think about the president as I'm sure you do.</p><p>WILSON: Sure.</p><p>MACCALLUM: As somebody who cares about politics and cares about the country. And what I hear from many people is, I don't like him, but I like his policy. I like what he's doing. And I get it. I hear that over and over. People pull me aside and say, here's what I think. I'm not crazy about him, but I like what he is doing. So--</p><p>WILSON: I think you're right, Martha. A lot of people likes some of the things that are happening because of policy matters. But a lot of those policy things are unfortunately very temporary. A lot of the things--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. Just tell me about the things that you talk that die.</p><p>WILSON: Sure.</p><p>MACCALLUM: What has died in--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILSON: Well, look, everyone who works for Donald Trump at some point is going to hit the wall and their life is going to turn into one moment they are on the top of the mountain. One moment Omarosa is the best friend in the world and she's wonderful and she's in the inner circle. And the next minute she is wacky--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: But do you think Omarosa matters to most Americans. I mean, I talk to Americans running businesses in this country, right? You look at the numbers. You look at corporate support for the president, CEO support, small business support up 14 percent, up 19 percent. Consumer confidence is very high under this president.</p><p>So they look at what's going on and they are separating out the man from the policies, and they are saying, you know what, I have a lot less regulation on my business, I'm opening up a new plant. I'm expanding the people that I'm employing here. And I feel like that matters to people that I speak to in the country way more than these other stuff.</p><p>WILSON: Well, look, it may matter to some people about that. But I will say this. We are still sitting on a gigantic ocean of quantitative easing cheap money from the Fed that started during Obama and continued on the--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right, that's the given when he walks in the door.</p><p>WILSON: It is. I am not blaming or praising him.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Right.</p><p>WILSON: That has had a large economic impact. The fact that we passed the massive tax bill have a simulative effect, no question about it. But it also is going to come with a price.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So then how do you explain consumer confidence numbers. Up 14 percent under Trump. That's not hedge fund guys. That's guys who run businesses.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILSON: Look--</p><p>MACCALLUM: The majority of the economy in this country as you well know is small business.</p><p>WILSON: Well, Martha--</p><p>MACCALLUM: So I'm just asking this what died? What died?</p><p>WILSON: Every person that works for Donald Trump.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: You said that. What else died?</p><p>WILSON: In fact, the Republican Party used to stand for the rule of law.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So what rule of law is--</p><p>WILSON: This is a president who is at war with the FBI, at war with the Justice Department who believes he operates in an extra judicial fashion in a lot of different ways.</p><p>And you see him frequently acting as if he is not a person who works for the people but he acts more in that sort of status and more authoritarian flavor and he's got a deal of affection for that kind of style and that kind of leadership overseas.</p><p>And I will say this. Donald Trump he is a character that people bought into. And they love that character. They love the big broad acting of, you know, acting on his emotions and all of that other stuff. And I will say this. The people that have worked for him have come to grief almost all of them.</p><p>All these people that were inside and once they move out, they become un- person.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. But so, Rick, wait, wait, wait. Indulge me here for a second.</p><p>WILSON: Sure.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Because you work in Washington, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILSON: I work in Florida, I say in Washington.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know a lot of these -- OK. You work in Florida. OK, you work in politics.</p><p>WILSON: Yes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You work in politics for a long time. Most people in America don't work in politics.</p><p>WILSON: Sure.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So you have sympathy, perhaps for people in the meat grinder of this process and who don't like or who have left, right. I'm not sure again that that is something that has died for most Americans across this country.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILSON: Well, look, the other thing that died that is the Republican agenda beyond the executive order.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So then why do 87 percent of Republicans support the president?</p><p>WILSON: We have a great tribal system now in this country whether the tribal media side on the right, the tribal media are on the left. And there are few people left in the center. And a lot of it becomes self-reinforcing and self-referential. And then there are basically TV networks on the right and TV networks on the left, media on the right, media on the left.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I know, but I don't give a whole lot of credit to TV networks even though I work for one. A few million people watch television every day.</p><p>WILSON: Sure.</p><p>MACCALLUM: A 120 million people voted in the last presidential election. Most of them are not swayed one way or the other. As much as you and I like to think that we have an impact on what people think or what they read or what they listen to--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILSON: I will tell you--</p><p>MACCALLUM: -- most of us don't have a big impact on their daily lives.</p><p>WILSON: I will tell you this. One thing that had a big impact and we saw this and a lot of folks, (Inaudible) voters voted in 2016 where you'd sit there behind the glass and listen to these interviews and they'd say well, Donald Trump is a decisive leader and he's a good manager and he's great at international developing.</p><p>They were listening to the character they knew from television. They watched him on the apprentice for 14 years. And the character in the White House is different person. All this impulsive tweeting, all this, you know, back and forth the things that he believes he's accomplished with like--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: But I'm just saying to you that when I -- you know, the people who -- a lot of people go, I don't really care about the tweets. So what do you say to them? I mean, I know it bothers you personally and I get that.</p><p>WILSON: No.</p><p>MACCALLUM: But what I'm looking at when I look across the spectrum, you know, you look at more money going to NATO, you look at shaking the chess board up with North Korea and Iran, putting them in a different position. And who knows? I mean, the outcome may be disastrous.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILSON: I think--</p><p>MACCALLUM: Or it may be very good. We don't know the answer to that question yet. So I'm still curious when you say that everything he touched dies, so far what I've got is you know, staffers who are unhappy and left and norms?</p><p>WILSON: Well, and also the long held Republican belief, we were going to be the party that its gets deficit under control, we were going to be the party that--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, that's been a problem for plenty of Republican presidents. And you're absolutely right.</p><p>WILSON: -- certainly announced--</p><p>MACCALLUM: President Trump has done nothing to make that better.</p><p>WILSON: -- certainly announced. And we were also the party that was going to shrink the size of government. And Donald Trump while there's been some regulatory tweaking is proposing wild expansions of the size and scope of power of the federal government and a whole bund of areas.</p><p>MACCALLUM: But you haven't name anything that he's done that died essentially when it comes to the kind of thing that you're talking about.</p><p>WILSON: Well.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And as I said before I think that--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILSON: We're still -- we're still stuck with Obamacare.</p><p>MACCALLUM: -- while people may care about the people who work in Washington and work in the White House and think that some of them are nice people and they might be--</p><p>WILSON: Sure.</p><p>MACCALLUM: -- I'm sorry they left their job. I'm not sure something that they care about when sit down to dinner. Rick, before I let you go, do you think he would win again if the election were held today?</p><p>WILSON: Well, the Democrats have an infinite capacity to screw up campaigns. So he's got three in five chance right now if the Democrats put up, you know, one of the -- one of the usual suspects.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. Interesting. Rick Wilson, thank you very much. Good talking to you.</p><p>WILSON: Thank you, Martha.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So here now, Steve Hilton, host of The Next Revolution and a Fox News contributor. So, Steve, you listen to that conversation I think it's very interesting, you know, politically to talk to people who support President Trump, people who are never Trumpers to try to analyze, you know, where things are going to be for that side of the equation when the next election rolls around, and try to sort of poke some holes in some of these theories that don't really match up with what we are seeing in terms of a lot of the numbers and a lot of people's reactions out there. What did you think, what did you take away from him?</p><p>STEVE HILTON, HOST, FOX NEWS: Well, my main take away, Martha, was what an amazing interview. I was watching that and every moment when he said something, I wanted to jump in. I was literally sitting here and wanted to jump in and you said the exact same thing that I would have said.</p><p>And I just thought you really exposed how thin his argument is. When the first line of your argument is Omarosa and you can't really get beyond staffing issues, it really shows that there is nothing much to it.</p><p>Because frankly, this -- by the way, he is a guy that I know and I think that he is a good guy, you know, and he's true. He is right when he said he is a conservative and so on.</p><p>But in the end, all of those people in that never Trump camp, what they really object to and you really expose that is the style and not the substance. And what really matters to people's lives is the substance where he is making really big progress not just in the economic area that you highlighted that because the most important.</p><p>I mean, he said, for example, the changes that maybe good they're not permanent. They're kind of fleeting. How can you say that about Gorsuch and hopefully now Kavanaugh? Those are really lasting changes.</p><p>And the other thing I'd point to which is a really lasting change and they are really big deal but you can't even that some of the never Trumpers do kind of give the credit to the Republican Party or Congress and not really give any credit to Trump which is often what they do with the tax bill.</p><p>Look at China, what President Trump has done and this is really coming directly from him and not anyone else, is finally recognize that our number one strategic enemy in this century is China. And he completely recalibrated our relationship with China.</p><p>That is a really historic shift in policy. And I think that these are all examples of where the underlying substance of this administration is really solid and delivering results.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. We will see. And I always think back to the people I met on the campaign trails who said they wanted someone who would change things up on the Republican side.</p><p>HILTON: Right.</p><p>MACCALLUM: And clearly he is a disrupter. There is no doubt about that. You are a disrupter when it comes to technology. You are a person who is not an adapter. And when I read this piece today about Google if you turn off the location devices, it means basically nothing.</p><p>HILTON: Yes.</p><p>MACCALLUM: They are still tracking you and looking at what you being looking at all the time, right?</p><p>HILTON: Exactly. And it's similar throughout the tech sector. You get it also with Facebook, for example, where they are following what you do online even if you are not actually on Facebook.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Crazy. So crazy.</p><p>HILTON: And so the thing that we have to understand about these big tech companies which I know very well, is that really if you think about their business, what they actually are, a data gathering company. That is their business. That is how they make money.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Making money off of everything that anyone of us look for?</p><p>HILTON: Yes. Now sometimes that can -- what they say is when we gather all this information and then we can use that to give you useful services. For example, if you want to find, I don't know, shops near you that are selling something that are still open. That's useful for you.</p><p>But in the process the idea of privacy has basically disappeared. There isn't really no way to opt out of it. I as you hinted out opted out in a very drastic way. I don't have a Smartphone at all, I haven't had one for six years because I don't think that's a solution for most people.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I really admire that about you. I got to tell you, because I would love to leave my Smartphone behind. But I get like a little bit of like, you know, I get a panic attack if I'm far from it for too long.</p><p>HILTON: Of course.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Like most Americans do I think. Thank you so much. Good to see you tonight, Steve. Great to have on the show as always.</p><p>HILTON: Thanks, Martha. See you soon. Bye.</p><p>MACCALLUM: OK. You bet. I look forward to it.</p><p>So days after a second guilty plea in the tragic hazing death of Tim Piazza, his family is working to carry on his legacy and try to turn things around on campuses as students head back to school this fall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM PIAZZA, TIM PIAZZA'S FATHER: He didn't let us down. The people that killed him let us down. I think he would be looking down at us and he would be proud of the fact that we are carrying this torch and hopefully saving other people in the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So less than a week after a 2nd so-called brother pleaded guilty to charges relating to Tim Piazza's hazing death, Tim's parents push to carry on his legacy tonight.</p><p>So today is the second annual Timothy Piazza Memorial Foundation golf tournament. The money raised is used in part to help fund prosthetic devices for children in need and scholarships for students. And we have shared some of those stories with you over the course of the last year.</p><p>Tim's father, Jim Piazza joins me live from the event where the auction is underway. And we hope they are raising a lot of money tonight in Tim's name.</p><p>But Jim, I do want to ask you about the recent sentencing that happened for two of the individuals who were involved in what happened to Tim. And one of them was Ryan Burke, and you made a very emotional statement of the personal loss that you suffered.</p><p>Do you feel that what he got as the rush (Ph) chairman 27 months of probation and 100 hours of community service is the right punishment?</p><p>PIAZZA: Well, you know, we are not judges. We don't really know what the right amount of punishment should be. We are looking for justice for Tim. He was the first one to step up. So we are hopeful that it sets a precedent and you know, from there moving forward, we have appropriate justice with the rest of the individuals that really had a more meaningful role in the whole incident.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. Do you think that that will prompt others to step forward? Do you think it will?</p><p>PIAZZA: We are hoping so. We're hoping that others, you know, see that, you know, that he and the other individuals stepped up and they will follow suit. Obviously, the evidence is there. There is a video. There is no denying, you know, what happened that night. The video speaks for itself.</p><p>MACCALLUM: yes, indeed, it does. And you know, you and your wife Evelyn won an award for the work that you have done against hazing. And as I think so many students are heading back to college campuses, some of them for the first time, some of them will be rushing this fall.</p><p>What is -- what's your message to those families? What should they say to their children as they head off and would you discourage them from participating at all?</p><p>PIAZZA: No, we're not trying to discourage participation in Greek life. I mean, our message is, you know, make sure that your children are well informed, they're smart. And when they decide to rush, if they are asked to do something that they are uncomfortable with, just don't do it. And buddy up with other people so that you can walk away.</p><p>Hopefully by this point the Greek organizations are smarter and they are not getting involved in these chaotic rituals that we saw in our situation.</p><p>MACCALLUM: It's so awful what happened to your son and the amount of alcohol that he was forced to drink. And I just think it's so important that you continue to speak out as these other students head off. Do you think that Penn State has made meaningful change in terms the monitoring of these students and these frat houses?</p><p>PIAZZA: I think they've come a long way. I still think they have work to do. We are meeting with the president of Penn State in a couple of weeks to really get an understanding of what they've done so far and what they have ahead of them. We are actually going to be presenting at Penn State in a couple of weeks to a number of the Greek life folks.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACCALLUM: That's wonderful.</p><p>PIAZZA: And we're hopeful that they'll see it all through.</p><p>MACCALLUM: That's good to hear. Before I let you go I know today is a big day of hope and a positive way forward for your family and you hope you will raise a lot of money for more scholarships, right?</p><p>PIAZZA: Yes, for scholarships and for those in need of prosthetics and mobility devices. And we had a great day. It rained a lot of course but we still had over 250 people come out and golf and 400 for dinner. And it's still going on right now and you can hear them at the background.</p><p>MACCALLUM: That's great. Well, we want you to get back to it but we know that Tim wanted to be an engineer and was very interested in prosthetics for children who can't afford them. And we've spoken to a family who benefitted from the great work you're doing earlier on the story. And we hope that you guys had a great night. Give our best to everyone. Thank you very much, Jim.</p><p>PIAZZA: Yes, they are here with us tonight. Thank you very much.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Good. I'm so glad. Take care. Jim piazza. Always good to see him.</p><p>So, coming up, more of The Story after this. Stay with us.</p><p>MACCALLUM: This August evening the president is about to get back to the White House. He just landed at Joint Base Andrews. And there he is. He was in Utica today signing the Defense Authorization bill. And we watch the president as he has been in Bedminster working for the past week and a half and so.</p><p>So that is our STORY on this Monday night. See you back here tomorrow night. \"TUCKER\" is up next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018081301cb263</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T1K-DRC1-JB20-G2Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 13, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Peter Strzok</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hillary Clinton</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FBI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>David Bowditch</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Aitan Goelman</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Andrew McCabe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Christopher Wray</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bruce Ohr</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Christopher Steele</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fusion GPS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robert Mueller</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rudy Giuliani</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jim Comey</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Paul Manafort</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Judge Ellis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Omarosa Manigault-Newman</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SeaTac</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Aviation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Budget</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Justice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Charities</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X5W</classCode><className>SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

I should say the 2019 celebration going and welcome in the new year with a rally. The Dow up 149, the Nasdaq up 56.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's take a look at markets around the globe, rallying as well after China injects more liquidity into its banking system. The Shanghai composite higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This after a decade to remember. The Dow up over 173 percent. The S&amp;P up nearly 190 percent. And the Nasdaq just shy of a 300 percent gain the past 10 years.</p><p>We're going to take a look at where opportunity lies in the new year.</p><p>The Europe, the year kicking off with a rally. The Euro Zone PMI for December showing manufacturing contracting for the 11th month in a row, but coming in better than expected. That helping to boost the markets. A 1.1 percent gain in France.</p><p>In Asia, solid gains on the Hang Seng despite violent new year's day protests in Hong Kong. China freeing up about $115 billion by cutting the amount of money banks must hold in reserves. The market loves it. The Shanghai composite gaining 1.1 percent. The Nikkei closed for a holiday.</p><p>A done deal. President Trump says phase one of the China trade deal will be signed on January 15th and he will be heading to Beijing to meet with President Xi as they work together on phase two.</p><p>Tensions with Iran. Protesters retreating after Iran-backed militias attacked the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. President Trump says he wants peace but warning that a war with Iran would not last long.</p><p>Plus, pizza anyone? Papa John's founder John Schnatter with a big new year's resolution, looking to beat his own record of 40 pizzas in 30 days. Why would you do that? Find out just how many pies he plans to consume this year.</p><p>And here with me to break it all down, pizza and all, Fox News contributor and columnist for \"The Hill,\" Liz Peek, The Brewer Group's CEO, former investment banker and former NFL player, Jack Brewer, and Divine Asset Management's CEO Danielle Hughes.</p><p>Thanks' for joining us, guys.</p><p>DANIELLE HUGHES, CEO, DIVINE ASSET MANAGEMENT: Thanks for being here.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP: Thank you (ph).</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Forty -- 40 pizzas in 30 days?</p><p>HUGHES: It just sounds gross (ph).</p><p>SIMONETTI: I know.</p><p>PEEK: Whoa.</p><p>BREWER: Sounds disgusting.</p><p>PEEK: Why not go for 60? I mean, really, you know.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I actually think that it sounds delicious.</p><p>BREWER: Oh.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Come on. Pizza is everything you need. It's healthy.</p><p>HUGHES: One piece.</p><p>SIMONETTI: A little bit.</p><p>BREWER: Until you digest it.</p><p>SIMONETTI: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>Anyway, our top story this hour is not pizza, it is clashes at the U.S. embassy in Iraq and they are coming to an end.</p><p>Iran-backed military members, they retreated following two days of violent conflict at the American compound in Baghdad. The attack ended the aftermath prompting the Pentagon to send hundreds of additional troops to the Middle East.</p><p>Here's President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have some of our greatest warriors there. They got in there very quickly. As soon as we saw there was a potential for problems, they got in and there was no problem whatsoever.</p><p>I also want to thank the Iraqi government. They really stepped up. I spoke to the prime minister today. I thanked him. But they stepped up very nicely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Joining me now, House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committee member and Iraq War veteran, Congressman Guy Reschenthaler.</p><p>Thank you so much, Congressman, for joining us. Happy New Year to you.</p><p>REP. GUY RESCHENTHALER (R-PA): Thanks for having me on. Happy New Year to you, too.</p><p>SIMONETTI: What are the president's red lines in the Middle East with Iran specifically?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, I think the big take-away is that if the president sets a red line, such as, do not attack U.S. bases or joint U.S. Iraqi bases, there will be consequences. When Obama made red lines, they were ignored. And part of the reason we're in this situation now is because under the Obama administration, Iran was able to grow its influence around the region.</p><p>You've got to remember, Iran is not only interfering in Iraq, they're also responsible for the unrest in Yemen. They fund Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip. So all over -- in Syria, we've got to remember Syria. So they've created a lot of unrest in the region.</p><p>And, finally, we have a president, an administration, that's holding Iran accountable and putting on applied maximum pressure on that regime.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Do you think, Congressman, that Iran sees the president as being weak with respect to some of this decisions, such as pulling troops out of Syria, such as cancelling the attack when their drone hit a certain part of the -- the Middle East? Do you think they see weakness or a reluctance to escalate a conflict in an election year particularly?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: No, I see just the opposite. Iran is acting out in part because this administration has been so tough on the -- on sanctions. Right now in Iran they do not have as much money as they did under the Obama administration, so they can't fund a lot of their operations around the region. That's why you see them acting out, blocking the Strait of Hormuz, shooting down drones, taking British oil tankers, for example. They're trying to artificially increase the cost of petroleum, which is going to bring in more revenue.</p><p>What's unfortunate for them is that we in the United States are not -- we're not reliant upon their oil reserves because we have natural gas here in the United States. We're now an energy producer.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Got it.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Also, they have a president that's going to stand by his word. And when one of our embassies is under siege, the cavalry is coming. This is not the Obama administration anymore.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Right. The troops are headed in.</p><p>All right, let's move on and let's talk about what's going on, on Capitol Hill. Looking ahead to 2020, what are the Republicans' priorities, specifically in the House where you sit?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, my number one priority is always going to be job growth and economic growth. The best thing that we can do in government is that -- having a strong economy because it fixes so many other problems that we have.</p><p>But the way to do that is to make the tax cuts permanent. The tax cuts now expire in 2025. That might sound like a long way off. But if you're a business looking to invest and you're projecting out five, 10 years, you need to make sure that you can have tax rates that are going to bring back a return on that investment. So making the tax cuts permanent will be my number one goal heading into 2020.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Is the president speaking about the economy enough as he campaigns for 2020?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: He is, but the Democrats are trying to distract from this red hot economy. You just went through the numbers. We have the S&amp;P hitting all-time highs. We have an economy that's just roaring right now. Unemployment is at a five-year low. So whether -- what are the Democrats trying to do? They're trying to talk about impeachment, bring that in the news so we're distracted from just how strong this economy is and how much job growth we've had under the Trump administration.</p><p>HUGHES: Congressman, good morning. This is Dani Hughes.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Good morning.</p><p>HUGHES: And Happy New Year.</p><p>I'm wondering, how do you increase job growth specifically in the areas that you represent with the economy doing so well? Is it a matter of bringing in additional companies to employ these people? Is it to increase wage growth? What do you see as the impetus?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Right. There's really just two ways to do it. I believe it's that simple. One, we reduce regulation, which the Trump administration has done. That's had helped in particular in the oil and gas industry, which is huge in my -- in my region, western Pennsylvania.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: We also grow the economy by reducing tax rates. And we've -- we've done that with the tax cuts. That's why we have to make it permanent. But when have you that stability, when you have low taxation, when you have low regulations, businesses can grow and flourish.</p><p>I think that the best thing the government can do for business is just get out of the way and let business be business and grow the economy.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Do you think the president wins Pennsylvania again? And I'm asking because you just mentioned, have you a lot of oil and gas in your state and Democrats running all about climate change, they want to ban gas and oil in Pennsylvania. You also had Joe Biden, just a few days ago, telling a room of people, hey, you know what, coal miners, learn how to code.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: How does that resonate where you are?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: When you have -- when you have this field, and Joe Biden, the supposed moderate, wants to ban fracking, that just shows you how far left this party has gone. But if they want to talk about banning fracking, reducing our oil and gas exploration, good luck winning Pennsylvania, because we know that it's just not about energy. It's about reducing the cost of energy so you can make manufacturing possible because you have reduced energy costs.</p><p>Also it's about petrochemicals. Oil and gas is about energy, but it's also about those petrochemicals that are used to produce everything from the jacket that you buy to the smartphone in your pocket. So if we have cheap and abundant petrochemicals, reduced cost of energy, then manufacturing can grow as well.</p><p>And, don't forget, that because we are -- because we have natural gas production in places like Texas, Pennsylvania, the Dakotas, we're now able to export energy and we're able to keep Russia at bay, we're able to put maximum pressure on Iran, like we're seeing, and we're exposing a lot of flaws in petrochemical states like Russia and Venezuela.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, it's a weapon.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: So it's about jobs, it's about the economy and it's about having a strong American presence abroad.</p><p>SIMONETTI: We haven't spoken about impeachment yet. And as this Senate impeachment trial looms, the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, telling reporters at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday that he would be willing to testify.</p><p>Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION: Would you testify in the trial?</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: I would testify. I would do demonstrations. I'd give lectures. I'd give summations. Or I'd do what I do best, I'd try the case. I'd love to try the case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right, that's in contrast to former Vice President Joe Biden, who said he is, quote, not going to pretend that there is any legal basis to comply with GOP subpoenas.</p><p>Congressman, your thoughts?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Well, you know, good luck to Joe Biden if he thinks he's going to get away from not answering a congressional subpoena. Really, good luck with that.</p><p>But the Senate has control of impeachment. It's not up to people like Nancy Pelosi in the House or potential witnesses like Joe and Hunter Biden. It's up to Mitch McConnell what's going to transpire in the Senate. And I think that if we were really going to explore this, we would call witnesses, like Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and see why he was getting paid $50,000 a month, not a year, $50,000 a month when he had zero experience in Ukraine, zero experience in oil and gas.</p><p>And let's also call Adam Schiff and his staff and see what they were talking to with the whistleblower and let's also call the whistleblower. I tried to subpoena the whistleblower. I was denied. But let's bring all those folks out and get to the bottom of this.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Ten seconds, Congressman, do you see any Republican defections in the Senate?</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: No, not at all. In fact, I see Democrats voting with Republicans to acquit this president and I see that -- I see our party growing stronger and I see President Trump moving up in the polls in swing states.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right, Congressman Guy Reschenthaler, thanks for the time.</p><p>RESCHENTHALER: Happy New Year.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Happy New Year.</p><p>And we're just getting this morning started. Coming up, shiny Apple. We're going to take a look at Apple's banner 2019, what's in store for them for 2020.</p><p>Boost your finances. We'll tell you the best ways to get financially fit for the new year.</p><p>Plus, chatting off in 2020. We list the best travel destinations for your next vacation.</p><p>And coming up, a papal mea culpa. Pope Francis apologizing after slapping a woman's hand. We'll have the fallout in just a bit.</p><p>Plus, \"A Quite Place\" is making a buzz again. We're going to show you more of the new trailer for the sequel of John Krasinski's hit movie.</p><p>Keep it here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Devastating wildfires still burning out in Australia.</p><p>Cheryl Casone here now with the details and if any relief is in sight.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: The images have been really disturbing coming out of Australia. And now the death toll there is at 17. Three bodies were found on the coast of New South Wales.</p><p>Now, this as the military is being deployed. They're trying to help with rescue and relief efforts. Excessive and persistent heat and drought in that country is being blamed for the unrelenting fires.</p><p>Well, diamonds may be a girl's best friend, but Warren Buffet reportedly passed on a chance to buy Tiffany &amp; Company. London's \"Financial Times\" says that Buffett rejected Tiffany's offer to make a counter offer. It marks the fourth year that Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway has not made a major acquisition. LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, among other luxury brands, bought Tiffany for $16 billion. That deal announced in November.</p><p>And, finally, a New Year's Day scare for fans of \"A Quiet Place.\" A trailer dropped for the sequel yesterday. \"Quiet Place\" part two is going to give a back story to the alien invasion from the 2018 film. The trailer also shedding light on what happened following the death of John Krasinski's character. Did -- I probably just ruined that for everybody. Sorry. And I've never even seen it, so I just ruined it for myself.</p><p>Anyway, Krasinski is the writer and director behind both film, which also stars Emily Blunt, his wife, by the way. \"A Quiet Place\" part two coming to theaters March 2020.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I don't think you're going to -- I don't think you're going to like it. I watched (ph).</p><p>CASONE: I -- I -- you know what, we've talked about this on our show, I don't like being scared. I don't -- I do not watch scary films.</p><p>HUGHES: You should not watch this film.</p><p>CASONE: Life scares me enough, you know, reality, so I don't need to be frightened in front of a television screen. So --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Dani disagrees?</p><p>HUGHES: I -- well, it's a fantastic, fantastic -- I used to love zombie movies, but now I can't watch those anymore. But \"A Quiet Place\" was really great. It was exciting. It kept you on the edge of your seat. And you'd think, like, they're not even talking, but it's a fantastic movie. So I'm really excited to see this next one.</p><p>CASONE: Well, you enjoy that.</p><p>SIMONETTI: There's -- there's just not enough hours in a day to watch all the content that's coming at us.</p><p>PEEK: That's the truth.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I know.</p><p>PEEK: Or even know what you should be watching. I don't know how anyone keeps track of all these different --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Word of mouth.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, I guess.</p><p>HUGHES: It is word of mouth, for sure.</p><p>PEEK: It's amazing, though, really.</p><p>HUGHES: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: When someone says, watch this, I -- I usually agree. That is -- it's good.</p><p>PEEK: And --</p><p>HUGHES: Depending on the person.</p><p>SIMONETTI: That's true.</p><p>Coming up, Mariah Carey gets hacked. The pop princess' Twitter feed full of Eminem posts. What exactly happened? Keep it here.</p><p>Plus, the housing market rebound. We're going to tell you about America's top cities leading the way when it comes to new home sales.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right, a \"Fox Business Alert.\" Fund raising in focus as the 2020 race heats up. There is an election this year. President Trump's campaign just announced that it brought in $46 million in the fourth quarter of last year. It was the best fundraising quarter for the campaign in the cycle. It ended the year with $102.7 million in cash on hand.</p><p>Some Democratic contenders also releasing their latest numbers. Senator Bernie Sanders, $34.5 million. Pete Buttigieg, look, he's young, he's new, who saw this, $24.7 million, and Andrew Yang, 60.5. Tulsi Gabbard brought in $3.4 million.</p><p>So, this is a lot of money. And it's interesting to me, when you hear Elizabeth Warren say, you know what, I don't want those big money donors, you have to compete with the Trump war chest, which is $102 million.</p><p>HUGHES: Well, and also Bloomberg's war chest too. I mean he's got unlimited funds as well.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>HUGHES: And, you know, you kind of have to look at it like the Democrats, you just add up all those numbers, because as we heat up and after we get to a point where we have a leading Democratic candidate, we're going to see significant fundraising on both sides.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And that affects the market, which brings us to our next segment, recession fears, are they hitting the c-suite? An economic decline topping the list of concerns for CEOs, that according to the Conference Board, which is a business research group.</p><p>Let's bring in EY's Americas vice chair of accounts, Sam Johnson.</p><p>Sam, good morning.</p><p>SAM JOHNSON, AMERICAS VICE CHAIR OF ACCOUNTS, EY: Good morning. Thanks for -- thank you for having me.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Happy New Year.</p><p>Is it going to be a happy new year for investors?</p><p>JOHNSON: You know, I think so. If you look at how we are starting the year, I think we're starting the year in a very solid place. That's thanks to, you know, good news that we got in the fourth quarter, easing of tensions on trade. So I think that's very positive.</p><p>But I think the thing that really is interesting is that's countered by what we're hearing from our clients. So our clients are still dealing with uncertainty. And some of them are almost paralyzed by what we're calling the complexity crisis. It's really driven by three factors. First, geopolitical risk, which is really causing a lot of problems with supply chain, strategies around trade access. The second, believe it or not, is societal expectations. You know, customers, stakeholders are expecting different things for companies than they did in the past.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Social responsibility?</p><p>JOHNSON: Social responsibility, those types of things. And, finally, the one I think is the most important is digital disruption.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Ah.</p><p>JOHNSON: That is really creating a lot of havoc for our clients.</p><p>PEEK: So -- so can I just jump in here and say --</p><p>JOHNSON: Sure. Sure.</p><p>PEEK: Companies have brought some of this concern about society's view of them totally on themselves. When the business roundtable goes out and says, yes, making money is no longer our prime objective, we are now really beholden to all the stakeholders. We've got to be careful -- that's raising expectations that are completely unrealistic. And, in my view, it was totally setting them up for just exactly the kind of problem that you're talking about.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, but the -- now management teams have to actually be prepared to deal with that.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, it's a huge mistake, in my view.</p><p>JOHNSON: And it's -- and it's real. And it's real. And it's real.</p><p>So when you take all those factors together, you know, that really creates a really unique environment.</p><p>But I do think, when you look in 2020, one of the positive things is I think for innovative companies and for entrepreneurs, there's going to be significant upside because of this disruption.</p><p>SIMONETTI: OK.</p><p>JOHNSON: And that's where they typically find the opportunity.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And President Trump is still president, so there's not a lot of regulation or red tape. And that is always good --</p><p>JOHNSON: For business.</p><p>SIMONETTI: For business.</p><p>What growth opportunities do you see in 2020? Because I asked you in the break, I said, is 2020 a year to play it safe or double down, and you said both.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, both. And I'm not trying to give a safe answer, but we really do believe that. So, play it safe to us really means getting back to the basics. So companies need to do things like look at their cash flows, they need to take expenses out, they need to move to automation. So they need to do the basic things, get rid of non-strategic assets.</p><p>But on the double down side, it's really about investing in the future. What technologies can change your product set? You know, what new markets are you going to get into? And I think that's the difference.</p><p>In the past, all you really had to do was to weather the storm. But, today, if you don't think about investing in the future, I think you're going to see a lot of your competitors leap frog you as we come out of the next cycle. So I think it's actually both, play it safe and double down to really be successful.</p><p>HUGHES: I think that's interesting, Sam. And it is a safe answer, actually. But -- just kidding.</p><p>But cloud computing grew 37 percent year over year. Things like e-commerce, which over just in the last segment of the market went up 18 percent. You know, you've got huge digital disruption. And we've got a long way to go. You know, there's going to be a lot more people in the world that have access to these things that are going to be able to change their life in a digital way. And is that where you're saying that the real growth is?</p><p>JOHNSON: I'm so glad you mentioned that because, you know, I really encourage our clients to move faster to digital. I'll give you a real quick example. I was talking to some executives at a construction company and we were talking about building a digital road map. And one of the execs looked at me and said, you know, Sam, we dig holes and we put in poles in the ground. So we don't need digital.</p><p>Six months later, they called us back and said, one of our competitors has introduced an application that gives utility companies access to our work orders, they can see the status of our work, they can see change orders and they can pay their bills electronically. How do we respond?</p><p>And so this digital disruption, I think, is going to impact every industry.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: No one will be immune to it.</p><p>The good news is, is there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in that. So you're going to see companies continue to change and continue to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Transformation.</p><p>JOHNSON: Transformation.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I feel like, though, as you're speaking, the bar for a company is just so high. You have to be socially responsible --</p><p>JOHNSON: Right.</p><p>PEEK: Exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And moral --</p><p>JOHNSON: Exactly right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And somehow make money for your -- for you shareholders.</p><p>JOHNSON: Exactly right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: You have to be top of the line with technology.</p><p>Yep.</p><p>SIMONETTI: At what point is a company actually able to do what the point of their company is?</p><p>PEEK: Make money.</p><p>JOHNSON: Make money, yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Or -- yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, I think that's what's making it so complicated now, right? And I think companies have to actually do both. You can't just focus on the short term issues.</p><p>What we're -- I'll give you an example. Companies are having to change their business model. So we're seeing traditional manufacturing companies actually think about outsourcing the manufacturing, taking that capital and investing it in technology to differentiate their products.</p><p>SIMONETTI: So everybody's a tech company.</p><p>JOHNSON: Everybody is going to have to move towards disruption.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>Jack.</p><p>BREWER: I just think everyone's supposed to do this. Listen, I don't want to be the guy on the panel not about just making money, but it -- when you're living in the greatest country on earth, when there's people all around us and everywhere that we look that are suffering, I'm -- I'm so happy to hear, San, that there's so many companies looking to make money while making an impact. We've got to help each other. That's --</p><p>PEEK: But, Jack, creating jobs is making an impact, right? That's the best thing you can do.</p><p>BREWER: I agree, but -- but -- it is, but you can do both.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>BREWER: You can always do both.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, for example, one of the things that we're doing is around investing in innovation, but, more importantly, upscaling our people, right?</p><p>BREWER: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: Sure.</p><p>JOHNSON: And so the fact that our people need new -- they need new skills.</p><p>HUGHES: Up training.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Skilling -- yes.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, yes, yes. So giving the new skills that are going to be really relevant in the new environment.</p><p>SIMONETTI: So, yes, if you're anything like me, where I just outsourced something with like my phone or TV that I can't do to my husband, that's bad. You have to know how to do everything.</p><p>PEEK: You're up skilling his skills. That's very good.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Sam Johnson, you can fix my TV any time. One day I'll learn.</p><p>JOHNSON: Always going to do that. Thank you so much.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right, coming up, a papal mea culpa. Pope Francis says he's sorry after slapping a woman's hand. We'll have that fallout in just a bit.</p><p>Plus, a 2020 pizza party. Domino's jacks up prices for Times Square partyers, as the Papa John's founder vows to eat a ton of pies this month. We'll tell you just how many in just a bit.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good morning. I'm Lauren Simonetti in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, January 2nd, 2020. Let's get to your top stories at 7:30 Eastern Time.</p><p>2020 kicking off with markets around the globe rallying after China announces monetary easing. Futures pointing to a big gains at the open, Dow up 167.</p><p>The green arrows after a record-breaking year, the NASDAQ leading the pack, last year gaining more than 35 percent.</p><p>In Europe, the year is also kicking off with a rally. Eurozone PMI for December, look, it showed manufacturing contracting for the 11th month in a row but it came in better than expected. Green arrows across the board. The CAC Quarante in France up 78 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, solid gains on the Hang Seng, despite violent New Year's Day protests in Hong Kong. DAX Index up 1-1/4 percent.</p><p>The world however is reacting to news out of China that they are freeing up about $115 billion by cutting the amount of money banks must hold in reserve. The Shanghai Composite up 1.1 percent. The Nikkei in Japan closed for a holiday.</p><p>Well, the New Year means some higher prices on prescription drugs. We'll say good morning to Cheryl Casone here now with those details. Hi, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, hi. Drug makers of Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Biogen are going to be increasing the cost more than 50 medications in 2020 and they include lifesaving cancer and HIV medications. More than 250 drugs have seen a hike already according to a healthcare research firm.</p><p>Well, there's more good news if you're looking to sell your home. Prices rose 3.3 percent in October from a year ago, that suggests that the housing market is really starting to strengthen.</p><p>Phoenix, Tampa and Charlotte among the market showing the most significant increases. San Francisco, the only U.S. City where prices actually fell.</p><p>And finally, Pope Francis is now apologizing for this unholy act. It's tough to watch. The pope is seen in this video, he smacks the hand, there it was, of a clinging pilgrim as he -- he was trying to break free obviously. This happened on New Year's Eve as he was greeting the faithful at St. Peter Square.</p><p>Now, the pontiff said during remarks yesterday he had lost his patience. Pope Francis then used his New Year's Day address to denounce violence against women.</p><p>I'm going to withhold comment but everybody deserves forgiveness. That is the Christian thing to do, forgive. So, he had a tough moment.</p><p>SIMONETTI: That was well said, Cheryl.</p><p>JACK BREWER, CEO, THE BREWER GROUP: Very well said, Cheryl.</p><p>You know, it's sad because our country, our nation, our world spiritually when you see things like this, it's just not good. Everyone like Cheryl said deserves forgiveness but, you know, if you watch video of Pope Francis over time, he's always pulling his hand back away from people. I don't particularly agree with that, you know, given the fact that Jesus walked the earth and actually washed the feet of his disciples.</p><p>And you know, when folks came to kiss the hem of his garment, he came with love and respect. And we can't -- we can't forget that. And I think we need to have these discussions more and more in America and across the world.</p><p>SIMONETTI: He did give a New Year's sermon and he did condemn violence against women, particularly.</p><p>BREWER: Live your words through the works of your hands. Live your words through the works of your hands.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, and everyone deserves forgiveness, including the Pope.</p><p>BREWER: Amen.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right, top New Year's resolutions often include getting in shape. But your finances may need to, well, get in shape as well.</p><p>The New Year's a great time to wipe the slate clean, make some big money moves. Let's bring in Ramsey Solutions Financial expert and author of Everyday Millionaires, Chris Hogan. Chris, good to see you.</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTION: Good to see you as well.</p><p>SIMONETTI: How do we get our finances in shape?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, I think we have to realize at the beginning of the year, it's the perfect time for us to set some new goals and over half the people always set goals that are related to either money or getting healthier. So I want to give people some tips on how do you get financially fit moving forward in this year.</p><p>We live in the greatest country on the planet where we can make decisions and back it up each and every day. So we've got a great opportunity.</p><p>So tip number one is to set a plan and stick to it. Like you have to begin to establish habits. And whether that's sitting down and beginning to budget, telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it went, it's a great first step but we have to stick to it.</p><p>Next, I want people to be very specific in your goals. Whether you're looking at your amount of debt and you're getting resolved to get yourself out of debt, you've got to sit down and write down what do you owe, how much do you have and we teach a process of the debt snow ball which you want to attack debt smallest to biggest. It's not about interest rate.</p><p>But then I want you to begin to look and understand, reminders are the way to keep yourself focused. So put some visual sticky notes up, put something up that's reminding you that you're going to eat out less that you're going to be more intentional with your money and watch what happens. That goal will start to stay on the front of your mind.</p><p>And then also I want you to get an accountability partner. If you're married, you've got a built in accountability partner to someone that can help you stay focused.</p><p>But if you're single or newly single, get a good friend or someone that will check in with you and ask you where you are and you're making progress with your goals.</p><p>Then I want you to set some reminders on your calendar. Mechanical devices, or phones, or iPads and tablets, all of these things serve to help us.</p><p>Well, let's help it help us with our goals. Set up a monthly reminder that will pop up that allows you to check in. Where are you on getting out of debt, where are you with your budgeting. These things will help it stay on the forefront of our mind.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Has anyone on this set including you Chris, ever kept a New Year's resolution through the year?</p><p>HOGAN: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Oh?</p><p>HOGAN: Yes, I think it's -- yes. Well, I think if we look at it a little bit different, that it's not just a resolution, it's a commitment. It helps us to have a different focus about it.</p><p>SIMONETTI: OK.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Chris, your comments, your advice really seems very commonsensical. But I would push back a little bit on this idea. The statistics suggest people are borrowing because interest rates are so extremely low. I mean, doesn't it make some sense to actually be borrowing at this kind of interest rate and invest in the money because most people are going to do better, certainly last year in the stock market and probably in most years if they have a little bit extra invested. And even if they're paying a little bit more for interest?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, not at all because here's my fact. You know, interest that you pay is a penalty. Interest that I earn is a reward. So, I'm debt averse. I'm allergic to it. I don't like it. I don't want it in my life.</p><p>So the only debt I'm OK with people borrowing on is for a 15 year fixed rate mortgage. So philosophically, we just disagree.</p><p>I want people to get out of debt and avoid debt like the plague. But I do want them to invest so they can grow their investments.</p><p>So get yourself out of debt, be intentional and then invest. But don't ever borrow to invest. It brings risk into your life.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Chris, you say people should think about what they are willing to sacrifice for financial success. So what exactly do we need to give up?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, Lauren, I think people are so good about writing down what they want to accomplish but we're not necessarily good at identifying what we're willing to give up.</p><p>For example, if we want to get better with our money, that's going to involve us sitting down, spending time looking at our budget. How much money is coming in and how much is going out. That means we're not going to go out to eat five or six times a week, we're going to actually use the stove that's in our home and cook some meals, but we have to sacrifice.</p><p>And if you want to get serious about money, we're going to have to give up some things. But I think those sacrifices are easier for us to accept once we understand what we have to gain. And I think when we keep that in focus, it helps us stick to the plan.</p><p>DANIELLE HUGHES, CEO, DIVINE ASSET MANAGEMENT: Chris, I love what you're saying. And I agree with you 10,000 percent. I think really it's a money mindset, right? It's not just a chore to do your budget or look at your finances or really write down exactly where everything is. It's really a mindset of I can do this, I will do this. Rather than a I have to do this.</p><p>HOGAN: No, I agree. And I think it's also a mindset, if we get to do this. We live in the greatest country on the planet where we can make a decision and start working immediately. We don't need anyone's permission.</p><p>I just want to encourage more people to do it. We've got almost 80 percent of people that are living paycheck to paycheck. That means if one check doesn't show up, we've got families that are struggling.</p><p>So I want 2020 to be the year that we get into perfect money focus. We start to work a plan that will actually work. People can go to my website, ChrisHogan360.com. I've got blogs on there about goal setting but also steps to take to help you win with your money.</p><p>BREWER: Chris, can you call me every day, hang out with me and just kind of shoot me a text, every 50 minute or so, because that's the only way I'm going to pull that all off, brother. Because I love what you're saying men, but that's some hard stuff to do.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It is intimidating. So I guess -- to follow up with that Chris, what are -- what are things we don't even realize that we do on a daily basis that we waste money on?</p><p>HOGAN: Great point. I think when we take a look at some of the subscription things that we have going on. Maybe you signed up for it in January but you don't really realize, you're not even utilizing it now.</p><p>So take a look at your bank statement. What are some of those $9.00, $10.00 fees that are happening each and every month that you're not really using. Cancel those things. Let's redirect that money to somewhere else.</p><p>Another one is these fancy coffee shops out there. Now you guys know, we need a little coffee, we love coffee.</p><p>PEEK: Starbucks.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Chris.</p><p>HOGAN: But a $5.00 or $6.00 a pop every day, that can add up. So that's just a few tips.</p><p>SIMONETTI: OK. I'm going to get a phone call right now, but we get free coffee here at Fox and this morning, Jack, it is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, so we might have to you know, buy that $6.00 coffee across the street.</p><p>Chris Hogan, next time you're here, coffee on me, sir. Good to see you.</p><p>HOGAN: Thank you so much.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Happy New Year.</p><p>All right, coming up, shiny new Apple, we're looking at Apple's banner 2019 and what's in store for 2020.</p><p>Plus, Box Office domination. Disney absolutely ruled 2019, making the biggest splash at the Box Office, that and other stories making buzz this morning.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Big tech in the 2010s, Apple coming out as the number one performer on the Dow for the entire decade, its stock price gaining more than 860 percent in the past 10 years. Microsoft also among the top 10 Dow performers seeing its stock rise more than 400 percent during the past decade. Wow.</p><p>Joining me now, Digital Trends vice president and editor-in-chief, Jeremy Kaplan. I mean, come on. Can Apple and Microsoft and some of the others just keep going?</p><p>JEREMY KAPLAN, VICE PRESIDENT AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DIGITAL TRENDS: There's a lot of upside still in those companies. If you look at what they do and what they've been doing over the last five, 10 years, there's a lot of future that I think is going to see some continued growth over there.</p><p>Who's going to replace these companies? I don't know if there is a big replacement but there is a lot of upside for those companies still.</p><p>SIMONETTI: 10 years ago was the iPhone 3Gs, it had a 3-1/2 inch screen and it cost about $200. What is the new phone, what is it going to look like? What's the phone of 2030?</p><p>KAPLAN: Here's what's crazy about Apple, right. They continue to make a phone that more or less looks like the iPhone did 10 years ago, right? And what's the problem there? There isn't a problem because people still love them.</p><p>If you ask us, go to DigitalTrends.com, look up the best smartphone, we still recommend an iPhone. It is still the best phone out there.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, it's interesting because last year and the year before even when they're bringing out the newest model we were like eh, there's nothing -- it's just increment list, right. There's no big change.</p><p>And yet, I was with someone over the weekend who were saying, I love this phone because of the new camera. That didn't even get that much buzz but apparently the 11, the camera is awesome.</p><p>KAPLAN: It is fantastic. I've got with myself, it's free.</p><p>PEEK: And people buy it for that. It's amazing.</p><p>KAPLAN: Apple has been pivoting to become a services company over the last five years. Apple News, Apple Music, Apple T.V., right. I think that's going to be very transformative for this business over the next 10 years.</p><p>People are buying fewer phones, right? Because the phone we have is probably good enough. But I think the service division is really going to be big for them over the next couple years.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I've also heard that we're going to bring virtual reality into our daily lives in ways that we might say yet no way, it's going to make me dizzy, I'm not interested but that's going to happen. And companies that are going to make it happen. KAPLAN: I've been hearing that for half a decade. And I keep waiting for it to happen. I haven't seen anything that's meaningful.</p><p>SIMONETTI: We've got 10 years left.</p><p>KAPLAN: There's a lot of room for that to happen. Where is the big killer app when it comments to V.R., right? What are you doing today that's meaningful? I haven't seen it.</p><p>HUGHES: Right. I think -- I think the interesting thing to your point about services and how we're so now attached to Apple and Microsoft and Amazon Prime because we put all our stuff in the cloud.</p><p>And we -- you know, if you lose it somewhere else, you can go where it's just in the cloud and I can get it from any device but they've -- they own you. They own you going forward.</p><p>KAPLAN: We've got a whole series you've been looking at the last decade in technology, cloud is a word you'd think aren't we sick of this at this point, we've been hearing cloud for five, 10 years, right? Cloud is just getting started.</p><p>Microsoft has rebuilt their entire business over the last five years on cloud services. And this is really just the tip of the iceberg. There's a tremendous transformation that has yet to take over for business.</p><p>SIMONETTI: What about privacy? We say we're concerned about it. A new law went into effect in California so you can have more control of your data, your privacy online. Where do we go with our personal data?</p><p>KAPLAN: Look, I think a certain group of people have a lot of concerns when it comes to privacy. I think the younger you look -- the younger the audience is, the less people are actually worried about these things.</p><p>Modern kids today, 18 to 24-year-olds grew up posting things online, no fretting at all about what they were posting. Those people are less worried about privacy. Older adults, older Americans are still very concerned and worried about these things.</p><p>Think back for a second, remember when Google Maps first came out and everyone said, oh my gosh, you can see my house online. Big privacy concern, right? Do we care about that today? Not so much.</p><p>PEEK: So Jeremy, the question of the decade, what is 5G, what does it mean to us? When is it going to be on our phones? Who is going to dominate? We talk about it all the time. Who knows -- what does it mean?</p><p>KAPLAN: That's exactly what we're going to see over the next 10 years and I think 2020 is going to be a huge year when it comes for 5G.</p><p>So yes, you can get it today. If you live on 28th street and Seventh Avenue, like a certain specific spots in certain cities. I think over the next year, we're going to see that broaden out dramatically across the U.S. and it is going to be very transformative.</p><p>PEEK: Do we need a new phone?</p><p>KAPLAN: You absolutely need a new phone.</p><p>HUGHES: Of course you do.</p><p>PEEK: So that's huge, right?</p><p>KAPLAN: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: And is Apple going to have that new phone available this year?</p><p>KAPLAN: At the -- we think at the tail end of 2020 we are going to see a 5G iPhone and I think if you're looking at that phone, there's a lot of reasons to buy that. Maybe not today, but 2020 is going to be a great year for buying that because I think 5G will become far more widespread.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Are you -- are you scared by a certain technology that really is going to disrupt society, more than artificial intelligence has, more than our phone has? Is there something that really worries you?</p><p>KAPLAN: No, I see a lot of upside for technology. I think there's going to be some very transformative things that happen but it's going to change our lives in a lot of ways.</p><p>One real quick example, artificial intelligence, voice assistance today are very much responsive. You say Alexa play me some music, you say Alexa do this or that for me. Going forward in the very near future, they're going to be proactive, they're going to come at you and say let me do this for you which is good. You're talking about privacy, that feels really weird, doesn't it?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>KAPLAN: But it's going to be really useful I think. So it's going to feel a little scary.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I think it's by the end of next year or there's going to -- or this year, there's going to be more smart speakers than human beings.</p><p>HUGHES: Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I read that. That's a prediction.</p><p>KAPLAN: Not surprising.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Wow. I kind of want to leave it all out, just get away, right? It's a lit -- I find it disruptive.</p><p>All right, Jeremy, good to see you.</p><p>KAPLAN: A pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Good stuff. We appreciate it.</p><p>Coming up, Box Office domination, Disney ruling 2019 made a big splash at the Box Office. We're going to tell you just how much.</p><p>Plus, 2020 pizza party, Domino's jacks up prices for Times Square revelers. Wait until you hear how much.</p><p>And the Papa John's founder vows to you a ton of pies this month. Those stories making a buzz this morning, next.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Pop star Mariah Carey making a buzz this morning, but not on her own, although I did like that video. The singer's Twitter account was hacked on Tuesday with inappropriate tweets about the rapper Eminem and his daughter and references to the same hacker group that compromised Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's account that was over the summer.</p><p>And of the salacious tweets, they've been deleted from Mariah's account. But Jack, we were just talking about this and getting hacked with Jeremy. This -- that's a real concern for a lot of people.</p><p>BREWER: Yes, it's a real concern. I mean, think about it, if you can hit up Mariah Carey's account, right, with Eminem and who -- everyone is vulnerable right now. And I think you're going to see more and more of this. You talk about folks hacking in. And we were just had a segment when we were mentioning cameras and folks being able to tap into that, maybe see your family, Alexa. So it's some scary stuff. I mean, with all the different A.I. and technology going on, we've got to stay concerned about this.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And there might be pushback because you -- Liz and you, Jack, both said you got rid of your Amazon smart speakers.</p><p>BREWER: Gone.</p><p>PEEK: Here's the thing, you unplug them, they don't exist anymore.</p><p>BREWER: Right.</p><p>PEEK: It's amazing.</p><p>BREWER: Alexa lives no more in the Brewer house.</p><p>PEEK: I do control my life.</p><p>SIMONETTI: You can't fight back. You won that argument.</p><p>PEEK: Exactly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Disney is dominating the 2019 Box Office, the numbers are in. Seven out of the 10 highest grossing movies of the past year came from Disney. Topping the list, the \"Avengers: End Game\", \"The Lion King\" remake, \"Toy Story 4\", \"Frozen 2\" and \"Captain Marvel\", all Disney movies, and all rounding out the top five biggest Box Office totals. Danielle, this is pretty unbelievable.</p><p>HUGHES: I mean, Disney's an absolute monster. And you see it in the stock price too. I mean, the stock's up 50 percent since last year for kind of a sleeper that Disney's stock was for many, many years.</p><p>\"Star Wars\" was a huge hit too even though a lot of people were like what, we don't understand, but I mean, they just have the legacy names that will continue to drive their content going forward. And now with Disney Plus.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And the latest \"Star Wars\" still in theaters.</p><p>HUGHES: That's right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: But Disney Plus, they're doing this on streaming too. Their numbers are tremendous for the early rollout.</p><p>HUGHES: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: But it's not just the franchise things. \"Avatar\" was not a franchise movie, it was a brilliant movie, right, that won all kinds of awards, huge, biggest ever, I think. I mean, you just got to say, they have a magic -- it's not magic, they have a formula for success.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Bob Iger as the CEO.</p><p>HUGHES: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right, all eyes on the pies for the New Year. Domino's Pizza franchise in Times Square cashed in on the massive New Year's crowds, charging $30.00 for a pie. All right. I mean, I thought that was --</p><p>PEEK: I just can't -- I can't understand how it happened. I don't see how they do it. These people are cordoned off from about like 6:00 p.m. on, no one can get in or out. How in the world -- they deserve to charge $30.00 to deliver a pizza.</p><p>SIMONETTI: They should charge more, Domino's. Got that, all right, people online are starving.</p><p>All right, meanwhile, former Papa John's owner John Schnatter pledging to eat 50 pizzas in 30 days, that's his New Year's resolution, aiming to beat his previous records which was 40 pizzas in a month. 50 pizzas in a month.</p><p>PEEK: So, that's just a remarkable thing. And I of course because I'm an analyst, I always want to know, what kind of pizza are you talking about? Is it just plain cheese because then frankly it's not that impressive, but whatever.</p><p>SIMONETTI: (INAUDIBLE) vegan version.</p><p>BREWER: He should do the Rolaids commercial after that.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, no question.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Followed by a Rolaids commercial, perfect.</p><p>Still ahead, if you're unhappy with your holiday gift, return them. Today is the peak day to send those gifts back to those store. We'll have more on that in the next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020010202cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWJ-FWH1-JB20-G4CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8010\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Guy Reschenthaler</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iran</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Baghdad</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>2020</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mariah Carrey</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eminem</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Box Office</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disney</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New Year</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pope Francis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Domino's Pizza</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Papa John's</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>iPhone</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>5G</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Privacy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alexa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Energy &amp;
