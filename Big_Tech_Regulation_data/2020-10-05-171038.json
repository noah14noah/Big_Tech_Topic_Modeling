The regulator's ongoing probe will look to understand whether Amazon's policies for third-party sellers impact the pricing of products, and the sellers' dependence on Amazon, given that sellers have to use Amazon's Fulfilment tag and advertise on Amazon. The bureau will look at whether Amazon's practices influences consumers to purchase its products over those offered by competing sellers.</p><p>Amazon said it was cooperating with the bureau's investigation and would continue to support small and medium businesses, per Reuters. Big Tech companies, including Amazon, have been facing increased regulatory scrutiny in the US and in other countries.</p><p>Germany's anti-trust regulator is also looking into Amazon's relationship with third-party sellers, Andreas Mundt, the head of the Federal Cartel Office, has reportedly said. Mundt said that during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been complaints that Amazon had blocked some traders because of allegedly high prices, reported Reuters. According to CNBC, there were allegations of Amazon sellers inflating prices of hand sanitisers and masks.</p><p>Until 2013, Amazon had prevented sellers from providing their products at cheaper rates on website. A spokesperson for the German regulator told CNBC that it is \"not up to a private platform to be a price regulator or the price police\". The German anti-trust regulator had forced it to stop this practice.</p><p>Bezos admits to using seller data to help private label products in US Congressional hearing</p><p>In a US Congressional hearing on anti-trust, Congressman David Cicilline, chair of the house subcommittee on antitrust, said that Amazon controls 75% of all online marketplace sales and its market share is seven times the market share of its closest competitor.</p><p>In a major concession, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos told the subcommittee that although Amazon has a policy against using [not accessing] seller-specific data to aid its private label business, he \"cannot guarantee that that policy has never been violated\".</p><p>Further questioning indicated the possibility that Amazon has used aggregate data from third-party sellers to build their own competing private label products, something that Amazon's Nathan Sutton had declined was happening in July 2019. Bezos revealed that Amazon employees have access to \"highly detailed data\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0054187037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MS-3XK1-DXMP-K41J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

A day earlier, representatives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google were sharply criticized by lawmakers in Washington over the companies\u2019 market dominance.</p><p>The announcement, by the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive branch, is an incremental step in an inquiry into Amazon\u2019s business practices that was described as \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/technology/amazon-europe-margrethe-vestager.html\">preliminary</url>\u201d in September. There is no hard deadline for the investigation to be completed, and it could last for years.</p><p>Regulators said they were examining whether Amazon was hurting competition by abusing its dual role as a retailer that sells its own goods and a marketplace where other merchants sell products.</p><p>\u201cE-commerce has boosted retail competition and brought more choice and better prices,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition commissioner. \u201cWe need to ensure that large online platforms don\u2019t eliminate these benefits through anticompetitive behavior.\u201d</p><p>In a statement, Amazon said, \u201cWe will cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\u201d</p><p>The investigation highlights the growing importance of data in measuring the power of tech platforms. Regulators in Washington and Europe are looking more closely at whether the methods that companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google use to collect and hoard data give them an unfair advantage over rivals without comparable access to the same kind of data.</p><p>Europe has been at the forefront of regulating the tech industry on issues like antitrust, tax evasion, privacy protection, and the spread of hate speech and other harmful content. Google has been fined three times in the past two years for anticompetitive business practices, resulting in penalties totaling more than $9 billion. In 2016, <url normalizedValue=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2923_en.htm\">Apple was ordered to repay</url> about $14.6 billion for unfair tax benefits it has received in Ireland.</p><p>The investigation announced on Wednesday could lead to fines for Amazon or demands that it change its business practices. A settlement could also be reached, or the case could be dropped.</p><p>European investigators are also in the early stages of an antitrust investigation involving Facebook, according to a person familiar with the inquiry.</p><p>The inquiry into Amazon\u2019s practices shows how European authorities have sharpened their focus on companies that provide platforms that other businesses depend on to reach customers. Amazon\u2019s website is the main storefront for many third-party merchants, with a substantial number paying a fee to store goods in the company\u2019s warehouses and using its delivery network to ship products.</p><p>Yet third-party sellers have long suspected that if Amazon notices that a particular product is selling well, it comes up with its own version \u2014 and offers it at a lower price.</p><p>\u201cIf powerful platforms such as Amazon are found to use data they amass to get an edge over their competitors, both consumers and the market bear the cost,\u201d said Johannes Kleis, a spokesman for the European Consumer Organization, a consumer-rights group in Brussels.</p><p>Apple is facing complaints in Europe from Spotify and other companies over the terms that it demands from those that sell through its App Store.</p><p>Although Europe has been the world\u2019s most aggressive regulator of the tech industry, critics say its investigations take too long to complete and have not resulted in meaningful changes to the companies\u2019 practices. An antitrust inquiry into complaints that <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=1_39740\">Google was favoring</url> its own services in search engine results took nearly seven years to complete. The company\u2019s market share grew exponentially in that time.</p><p>European investigators said on Wednesday that their investigation of Amazon would include examining the company\u2019s agreements with merchants and how it was then able to analyze and use third-party sellers\u2019 data. Another focus of the inquiry will be how Amazon selects the goods placed in its \u201cBuy Box\u201d section, a prized space on the company\u2019s website where customers click to add items to their purchase cart.</p><p>Amazon has been the subject of European Union investigations in the past. In 2017, it was ordered to repay 250 million euros over illegal tax advantages it received from Luxembourg, where the company has its European headquarters. The same year, Amazon agreed to change terms of its e-book contracts with publishers to settle another antitrust investigation.</p><p>Regulators elsewhere have also been investigating Amazon. On Wednesday, Germany<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Meldungen%20News%20Karussell/2019/17_07_2019_Amazon.html\">announced a settlement</url> with the company over its treatment of third-party sellers. As a result, Amazon will face new rules over how it terminates or blocks outside sellers from its site, and it will have to cover more of the costs related to returns and reimbursements. The settlement also forces Amazon to accept more legal liability in its contracts with sellers. The changes will apply globally, according to German officials.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/big-tech-antitrust-hearing.html\">At the congressional hearings on Tuesday</url>, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/big-tech-antitrust-hearing.html\">faced sharp criticism</url> that underscored lawmakers\u2019 widening range of concerns with Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies. Representatives of the tech giants were repeatedly asked how their companies had altered innovation and entrepreneurial activity.</p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission recently decided to divide responsibility for potential antitrust investigations of the tech giants. The Justice Department is scrutinizing Google and Apple, and the trade commission is focused on Facebook and Amazon. Last week, the trade commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/technology/facebook-ftc-fine.html\">voted to fine Facebook about $5 billion</url> for mishandling users\u2019 personal information, by far the agency\u2019s largest fine ever against a tech company.</p><p>Kevin Granville contributed reporting. </p><p>PHOTO: Regulators will look into how Amazon collects data from independent sellers on its website.

Regulators are struggling to define how to act against large online companies that can operate in a deceptive manner when they set the rules for a platform that also hosts their rivals.<br/>EU officials have questioned online merchants over the past year and a half to see clearly how Amazon competes for website purchases that tells users if they can purchase a product from Amazon or from a retailer using Amazon Marketplace.<br/>As a platform operator, Amazon collects data about successful products and user demand that can help you get ahead of smaller sellers. It is also increasingly driving its own branded products that are similar to the best sellers offered by others.<br/>The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the European Union would send a statement of charges next week or the following week. Amazon declined to comment on the issue. The commission's press office declined to comment beyond confirming that the investigation is ongoing.<br/>The European Union's antitrust investigations have not always opened the way for greater competition.

I think that many users have no idea that this data is out there and they don't know how it's going to be used in the future, either.</p><p>\"As an industry, I think we have to do a better job of giving people better, more granular consent about this.\"</p><p>Davidson said it's possible for governments to draft laws that would better regulate big tech companies.</p><p>Amazon also faced tough questions about the way it can use searches on its Alexa or Echo smart speakers to target users with ads associated with their searches.</p><p>Targeted advertising</p><p>\"If you have asked about the weather in Bermuda and then you go on Amazon, you might be pitched with a holiday book about Bermuda?\" asked Irish MP James Lawless.</p><p>\"It's theoretically possible,\" Ryland replied.</p><p>Ryland said information gathered by Alexa or Echo devices is added to the user's profile along with other information, such as lists of items they've bought on Amazon. He said users are aware that their information is being used by the company and they can check the information gathered about themselves on Amazon's website.</p><p>While some of the companies that have appeared before the committee have said they're willing to accept new laws governing their behaviour \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and would like to see the European Union's tough new privacy law, the GDPR, extended to other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Ryland said existing competition laws are sufficient and the GDPR is good in principle but cumbersome.</p><p>Ryland said Amazon respects domestic laws in the countries where it operates.</p><p>Amazon also faced tough questions from NDP MP Charlie Angus about some of its employment practices, citing reports of anti-union practices and the company using an artificial intelligence system to fire workers for failing to meet productivity standards.</p><p>Ryland said Amazon treats its workers well and humans review performance data before an employee is dismissed.</p><p>The committee also heard Wednesday from Apple and Microsoft, which outlined steps they have been taking to protect the data of their users.</p><p>British MP Damian Collins \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who hosted the first meeting of the committee in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d said the hearings in Ottawa underline the need for governments to regulate big tech companies.</p><p>\"For me, the lesson of the last two days is that we have to continue to work together to make sure we have these systems in place, and to have regulators with the powers to go into big companies and investigate concerns that they may be in breach of data protection law, or not doing what they can to act against harmful content,\" he said.</p><p>'A profound shift'</p><p>Angus said the committee has moved the yardstick over the past six months but its work is not yet done.</p><p>\"What about the democratic rights of citizens? What are we going to do with artificial machine intelligence making decisions for our lives without our input?\" he asked. \"What are we going to do with facial recognition technology and holding massively powerful digital corporations to account?</p><p>\"That's a profound shift in the political discussion and it's happening around the world.\"</p><p>Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca\">elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBC-cbcstory1.5154548</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W76-12W1-F07J-T54H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305992</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><timeReceived>5:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Antitrust regulators \"are paranoid about it at the moment because they are concerned they have not looked at these mergers enough in the past, like Facebook-WhatsApp.\"</p><p>Authorities were put off over Facebook's change of position on how it handled data from WhatsApp, prompting EU officials to accuse the company of misleading them to win approval for the takeover in 2014.</p><p>Big Tech is a flash point now for antitrust across the globe. In the U.S., there are probes into Google, Facebook and Amazon over allegations they unfairly hinder competition. The CMA is investigating how Google plans to use Looker Data Sciences Inc. data before approving that $2.6 billion takeover.</p><p>While the CMA's mission is in part to ensure big deals won't hamper competition, it doesn't usually investigate bids for minority stakes. It may have been moved to act this time because of Amazon's access to an unending reservoir of data from its many businesses. And CMA's Chief Executive Officer Andrea Coscelli has said that it was a mistake to allow deals like Facebook's purchase of Instagram.</p><p>\"U.K. regulators may have some antitrust concerns with the proposed investment,\" said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Aitor Ortiz and Diana Gomes. \"One of them could be whether Amazon could get access to Deliveroo's user data, leveraging the delivery giant's position in other markets besides on-demand restaurant delivery, such as online groceries.\"</p><p>Amazon, Deliveroo and the CMA declined to comment on the matter.</p><p>The food-delivery business is no stranger to the regulator's attention. Two years ago the agency began investigating Just Eat's merger with a smaller rival Hungryhouse, eventually allowing it to go through because of the competition in the sector.</p><p>Since then the delivery business has seen a wave of acquisitions and international expansion. Just Eat agreed to a 5 billion-pound merger ($6.6 billion) with Dutch firm Takeaway.com NV in July, while Uber Technologies Inc. was reported to be showing interest in Spanish startup Glovo. However, according to food-service consultant Peter Backman, competition in the sector remains strong.</p><p>\"It's getting more intense because the pressure to get scale is becoming more intense,\" said Backman, a former director of Horizons FS. \"Although the market has gotten bigger, they are under huge pressure to become profitable.\"</p><p>Deliveroo has never turned a profit, losing 232 million pounds last year despite a 72% increase in global sales. A ruling against Amazon would be a setback for the U.K. company, which has already raised $1.53 billion in investor funding.</p><p>In August, it was forced to make an abrupt retreat from Germany after struggling to get a grip on the market.</p><p>For Amazon, the stakes aren't as high, but if the CMA decision goes the wrong way, it faces yet another embarrassing exit from a market it has found difficult to crack. It closed its own U.K. food delivery unit Amazon Restaurants U.K. in December 2018, with its American counterpart following suite last summer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-672174</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPK-J391-JBM5-P2YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"587\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Mergers &amp;

Antitrust regulators \u201care paranoid about it at the moment because they are concerned they have not looked at these mergers enough in the past, like Facebook-WhatsApp.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Authorities were put off over Facebook Inc.\u2019s change of position on how it handled data from WhatsApp, prompting EU officials to accuse the company of misleading them to win approval for the takeover in 2014.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Big tech firms are a flash point now for antitrust across the globe. In the United States, there are probes into Google, Facebook and Amazon over allegations they unfairly hinder competition. The CMA is investigating how Google plans to use Looker Data Sciences Inc. data before approving that US$2.6 billion takeover.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    While the CMA\u2019s mission is in part to ensure big deals won\u2019t hamper competition, it doesn\u2019t usually investigate bids for minority stakes. It may have been moved to act this time because of Amazon\u2019s access to an unending reservoir of data from its many businesses. CMA\u2019s CEO Andrea Coscelli has said that it was a mistake to allow deals like Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    \u201cU.K. regulators may have some antitrust concerns with the proposed investment,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Aitor Ortiz and Diana Gomes. \u201cOne of them could be whether Amazon could get access to Deliveroo\u2019s user data, leveraging the delivery giant\u2019s position in other markets besides on-demand restaurant delivery, such as online groceries.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The food delivery business is no stranger to the regulator\u2019s attention. Two years ago, the agency began investigating Just Eat Plc\u2019s merger with a smaller rival Hungryhouse, eventually allowing it to go through because of the competition in the sector.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Since then, the delivery business has seen a wave of acquisitions and international expansion. Just Eat agreed to a 5 billion-pound (US$6.6 billion) merger with Dutch firm Takeaway.com NV in July, while Uber Technologies Inc. was reported to be showing interest in Spanish startup Glovo. <br/><br/><br/><br/>    However, according to food service consultant Peter Backman, competition in the sector remains strong.

Critics of the companies have accused each of favoring their own products over those of rivals, potentially stifling competition.<br/>The change to the search algorithm could steer customers toward Amazon private-label products that deliver higher profit margins than competing listings, the Journal reported.<br/>Amazon shares fell 1.8% to $1,806 at 3:35 p.m.Angie Newman, an Amazon spokeswoman, said the Journal's characterization of events inside Amazon was incorrect. \"The fact is that we have not changed the criteria we use to rank search results to include profitability,\" she said. \"We feature the products customers want, regardless of whether they are our own brands or products offered by selling partners.\"<br/>She added that while Amazon does consider long-term profitability in evaluating search features, the company was not making decisions based solely on that metric.<br/>Sam Weinstein, a professor at Cardozo Law School at Yeshiva University, said the practices the article describes could draw the interest of regulators but that it's unclear whether they ran afoul of antitrust law.<br/>\"The optics are bad, because it lines up with these theories about how we think the platforms are abusing their power, favoring their own business,\" said Weinstein, who was previously an attorney in the Justice Department's antitrust division. But the article stopped short of showing the changes harmed other sellers for Amazon's benefit or limited competition in potential violation of U.S. antitrust law, he said.<br/>Bloomberg reported last week that a team of Federal Trade Commission investigators has begun interviewing small businesses that sell products on Amazon to determine whether the e-commerce giant is using its market power to hurt competition. A House panel investigating big tech companies for potential antitrust violations is seeking information from customers of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook about the state of competition in digital markets and the adequacy of existing enforcement, Bloomberg reported on Sunday.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTRNS-M-117204</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTRNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2P-GC81-DYDW-719Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428688</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"434\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Transportation &amp;

Analysts said Brexit reality was \"really kicking in now\" adding that investors can expect many more announcements like this in the weeks ahead. Yesterday Diploma, the engineering firm which supplies components for Formula 1 cars, said it had started building inventory levels of parts ahead of Brexit. Shares in Electrocomponents tumbled 31.6p to 580p, despite the firm separately revealing first-half profits increased by more than a fifth. Diploma dropped 4p to 1345p.</p><p>In a subdued session the FTSE 100 lost 38.19 points to 6962.70 with Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust among the fallers after a big tech sell-off overnight on Wall Street.</p><p>Apple's stock fell sharply as the tech giant said its newest line of phones may not be selling as well as it or its investors had hoped.</p><p>Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust is most exposed to the US tech scene, holding big positions in companies such as Netflix, Amazon and Tesla. Its shares were off 12.2p to 462.7p.</p><p>Overall tech sentiment was crumbling as investors also sold off bitcoin, which fell to $4430, its weakest since October last year. Increased regulation, particularly in the US, has spooked investors.

And it has progressively widened ever since. It now stands at more than $US500 billion ($694 billion).</p><p>Amazon this week became the second trillion dollar company (in US dollars) on the planet, following Apple which reached the milestone in August.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook fell into bear market territory - its shares are down more than 20 per cent since late July - with myriad scandals still swirling around the social platform, and fresh signs that users are moving away from it.</p><p>Now, these two companies operate in completely different corners of tech - one is an e-commerce 'everything store', with a juggernaut cloud computing side business that has morphed into its main profit centre. The other sells ads.</p><p>As such, perhaps we shouldn't read too much into their divergent paths over the past year.</p><p>On the other hand, the relentless rise of Amazon, and Facebook's fall from grace are an illustration of how quickly and dramatically things can change in the world of big tech - a sector that now dominates the US stockmarket, and a sector many Australian investors are only just becoming accustomed to.</p><p>It's been a torrid year for Facebook, almost entirely of its own making, and reflecting its rampant growth in its early years of existence.</p><p>There was the Cambridge Analytica scandal - which saw the data of millions of users potentially harvested by a political consultancy with links to the Trump administration (resulting in regulatory investigations, including in Australia).</p><p>And there were ongoing revelations about how the platform was manipulated by Russian troll groups during the 2016 elections - a topic that was discussed at Senate hearings again this week attended by its chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey (and no one from Google).</p><p>Overnight, a survey of nearly 3,000 Americans conducted in May and June this year by the Pew Research Center made for grim reading for Facebook and its investors.</p><p>Among other things, the survey found that 26 per cent of users had deleted the Facebook app from their phones, and 42 per cent had taken a break from the platform for several weeks.</p><p>\"It is a little concerning from the perspective of a shareholder in Facebook,\" acknowledged Andrew Macken, portfolio manager at Montgomery Global Investment Management, which holds shares in the giant social network.</p><p>\"That said, the resilience of this business lies in the portfolio of properties that Facebook owns - which is not just Facebook itself. The company also owns Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp - with others on the way. Of these additional properties, only Instagram has started to be monetised.\"</p><p>As for Amazon, its rise has been powered by strength in its cloud computing business (in which it rents out servers and web infrastructure to big companies) and its ongoing expansion into new markets, such as Australia.</p><p>The hype of Amazon's Australian invasion may have outweighed the reality, but it is still very early days for that experiment.</p><p>However, the bigger Amazon gets, the more scrutiny it is likely to receive from regulators. In recent months key figures from opposite ends of the US political spectrum have attacked the company.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has persistently admonished Amazon (whose CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post). Last week left-wing Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill (the BEZOS act) designed to shame companies like Amazon into paying higher wages.</p><p>For a quite a while, the so-called FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) grouping of big tech stocks were a one-way bet.

And it has progressively widened ever since. It now stands at more than $US500 billion ($694 billion).</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/amazon-joins-apple-in-becoming-a-1-trillion-company-20180905-p501rn.html\">Amazon this week</url> became the second trillion dollar company (in US dollars) on the planet, following Apple which reached the milestone in August.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook fell into bear market territory - its shares are down more than 20 per cent since late July - with myriad scandals still swirling around the social platform, and fresh signs that users are moving away from it.</p><p>Now, these two companies operate in completely different corners of tech - one is an e-commerce 'everything store', with a juggernaut cloud computing side business that has morphed into its main profit centre. The other sells ads.</p><p>As such, perhaps we shouldn't read too much into their divergent paths over the past year.</p><p>On the other hand, the relentless rise of Amazon, and Facebook's fall from grace are an illustration of how quickly and dramatically things can change in the world of big tech - a sector that now dominates the US stockmarket, and a sector many Australian investors are only just becoming accustomed to.</p><p>It's been a torrid year for Facebook, almost entirely of its own making, and reflecting its rampant growth in its early years of existence.</p><p>There was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/cambridge-analytica-firm-at-centre-of-facebook-scandal-shuts-down-20180503-p4zd0c.html\">Cambridge Analytica scandal</url> - which saw the data of millions of users potentially harvested by a political consultancy with links to the Trump administration (resulting in regulatory investigations, including in Australia).</p><p>And there were ongoing revelations about how the platform was manipulated by Russian troll groups during the 2016 elections - a topic that was discussed at Senate hearings again this week attended by its chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey (and no one from Google).</p><p>Overnight, a survey of nearly 3,000 Americans conducted in May and June this year by the Pew Research Center made for grim reading for Facebook and its investors.</p><p>Among other things, the survey found that 26 per cent of users had deleted the Facebook app from their phones, and 42 per cent had taken a break from the platform for several weeks.</p><p>\"It is a little concerning from the perspective of a shareholder in Facebook,\" acknolwedged Andrew Macken, portfolio manager at Montgomery Global Investment Management, which holds shares in the giant social network.</p><p>\"That said, the resilience of this business lies in the portfolio of properties that Facebook owns - which is not just Facebook itself. The company also owns Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp - with others on the way. Of these additional properties, only Instagram has started to be monetised.\"</p><p>As for Amazon, its rise has been powered by strength in its cloud computing business (in which it rents out servers and web infrastructure to big companies) and its ongoing expansion into new markets, such as Australia.</p><p>The hype of Amazon's Australian invasion may have outweighed the reality, but it is still very early days for that experiment.</p><p>However, the bigger Amazon gets, the more scrutiny it is likely to recieve from regulators. In recent months key figures from opposite ends of the US political spectrum have attacked the company.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has persistently admonished Amazon (whose CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post). Last week left-wing Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill (the BEZOS act) designed to shame companies like Amazon into paying higher wages.</p><p>For a quite a while, the so-called FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) grouping of big tech stocks were a one-way bet. That is certainly not the case anymore.</p><p>But as Facebook's experience over the past year shows, and to paraphrase Hemingway, in tech things change gradually, then suddenly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520055210</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6H-GM41-JBJ7-N1T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"672\"/><timeReceived>12:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Microsoft's stock rose 260% in the first two years of its investigation. It then fell 60% as the antitrust case dragged on.Last week's Big Tech antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) came almost exactly two years[1] after I started warning about this hidden threat. </p><p>The breadcrumbs were all there: Amazon's ill-fated purchase of Whole Foods. Google's multibillion-dollar fines from the European Union. Apple's efforts to milk its App Store for all it's worth. Big Tech was bound to draw too much attention from regulators and from both sides of the congressional aisle. So if you're a shareholder of a 'market-leading online platform' (as the DOJ put it in its press release announcement last week), what do you do? For now, nothing. [embedded content]The Calm Before the StormTech antitrust investigations take several years, at least. Historically, the share price of the companies at the center of them do well as the cases wind their way through the federal court system: Microsoft is a good example. The DOJ filed its antitrust case against the software giant in 1998. But the investigation didn't deter the stock from rising another 260% in the following two years. Xerox is another one. The Federal Trade Commission opened its investigation of the company in January 1972, alleging it unfairly dominated the market for copy machines. The company's stock rose another 40% over the following year. IBM was hit with federal antitrust charges in 1969[2] that claimed it attempted to monopolize the market for mainframe computers. The shares rose another 40% through 1973. But as the cases drag on, the threat of a breakup or restructuring tends to weigh on the shares, alongside the inevitable worries over bear markets and recessions: Microsoft's stock fell 60% between 2000 and 2001, when its antitrust case officially drew to a close. Xerox's stock dropped more than 60% between 1973 and 1975 before the company entered into a consent decree with the DOJ. IBM's shares fell 50% in roughly the same time frame.(Source: Capital IQ) But there's a second action you can take as Google, Apple, Amazon and others go under the antitrust microscopeWinning the War Against AmazonYou can look for the proverbial 'next big thing' and start redeploying your capital in that direction. Which companies are winning the war against Amazon, for instance? I have several in my Total Wealth Insider portfolio. Think about Microsoft in 2000. The company's real threat wasn't tech antitrust regulators. It was Google, smartphones and cloud computing. The real threat for IBM in the 1970s was Intel \u2014 then a nearly unknown Silicon Valley company \u2014 and the rise of faster, cheaper and smaller computing systems than the room-sized mainframes IBM sold back then.

Some even say they should be broken up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most recently, U.S. lawmakers launched a sweeping review to determine if these companies have become so big and powerful that they are stifling competition and harming consumers, while federal regulators are also gearing up to take action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But, when it comes to whether Silicon Valley giants are abusing their market power, size is only part of the problem.</p><p>The price of 'free'</p><p>Traditionally a company's size has attracted the most antitrust scrutiny because being big often translates into market power that it uses to prevent competitors from developing. A company's ability to raise prices is the main test regulators have used to determine whether it possesses such market power.</p><p>A growing body of analysis, that takes into account some of the different features of these companies, shows that relying so heavily on price obscures other potential harms.</p><p>Today, the biggest tech companies allow \"free\" consumer access to most if not all of their products. Consumers don't have to pay a dime to chat with friends on Facebook, search for the best route using Google Maps, exchange emails, comb the internet for facts and figures or engage in countless other activities.</p><p>So an antitrust policy that focuses on consumer price doesn't see a problem.</p><p>But the data about what consumers do, where they go, who they know and what they buy has great value to companies like Google and Facebook. And we're required to give up that data in exchange for \"free\" use of their products.</p><p>What's more, this data gives these companies an extraordinary market advantage. It allows them to identify untapped and underserved markets, spot potential competitors and prevent them from developing   the kind of edge that antitrust law is meant to thwart.</p><p>Could network effects create natural monopolies?</p><p>Large companies are also a primary antitrust concern because they can lead to monopolies that limit competition, discourage innovation and harm consumers.</p><p>But in some industries, such as utilities and communications, competition can at times be impractical, leading to so-called natural monopolies. In the past, a few companies were allowed to exist as natural monopolies because of the high fixed costs and inefficiencies of competition   such as in the utilities sector.</p><p>Antitrust regulators have allowed them to exist but only with additional scrutiny   such as price controls and oversight boards   to compensate for the lack of market monitoring.</p><p>Antitrust law is now facing the question of whether \"network effects\" might also justify regarding a company such as Facebook and its massive social media network as a natural monopoly. Network effects occur when something increases in value as more people use it.</p><p>Launching a new social media service doesn't require costly infrastructure, but it is made difficult by the hurdle of creating a network that people want to join. For example, Google+ failed to become a meaningful competitor for Facebook because people stuck with the social network where all their friends were.</p><p>Instagram may have been on its way to providing such competition, which is why many now regret that Facebook was allowed to buy it. A competing service might offer better features than Facebook but can't establish itself because it doesn't have the network of friends already in place.</p><p>Antitrust law does have ways of dealing with natural monopolies. It would be a significant adjustment to approach social networks in this way, but these are also industries with features unlike those that regulators have dealt with previously.</p><p>'Big tech' can be misleading</p><p>A common retort heard from these companies is that they shouldn't be subject to antitrust scrutiny because they are all in competition with one another. Indeed, we've been talking about \"big tech\" for so long now that it's easy to see it as one industry.</p><p>But, as I've learned in my research on the changing competitive landscape of television, these companies are actually quite different and shouldn't be seen as competing against one another in one big tech market. Nor do they present precisely the same anti-competitive behavior and concerns.</p><p>Facebook is a social media company supported by advertising. It also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, two other popular communication services, and is able to collect data across all three services. Facebook has extraordinary data power and its pervasiveness as a social network leads to an expanding role as a communication utility with incomparable reach.</p><p>Google offers a host of services but earns 85 percent of its revenue from advertising   mostly from ads placed in its search engine. The lack of competition in search leads to concern about its power in delivering search results. The amount of digital advertising controlled by Google and Facebook is also an area of competitive concern.</p><p>Amazon also has multiple endeavors but earns most of its revenue   88 percent   from its online retail business, which accounts for a little less than half of U.S. e-commerce. Antitrust concerns involve the advantage it achieves from using information it gains from the marketplace to create and sell products that compete with existing vendors at lower prices   or to exclude competing goods.</p><p>Rethinking antitrust</p><p>U.S. policymakers finally seem to be catching up with the rest of the world and are beginning to acknowledge the antitrust challenges presented by these companies.</p><p>Regulators in Europe and Australia, for example, were quicker to identify the social and economic costs of the data collected by these massive tech companies and their use of market power.</p><p>The likes of Amazon and Google have reshaped many facets of daily life. Let's see if they lead to a rethinking of U.S. antitrust policy as well.</p><p>Amanda Lotz is fellow at Peabody Media Center and professor of media studies, Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

AP Photo/Jeff Chiu[1]  Courtesy ofAmanda Lotz[2], Queensland University of Technology[3] There's a growing chorus of U.S. politicians[4], antitrust scholars[5] and consumer watchdogs[6] calling for stricter antitrust treatment of Amazon, Google, Facebook and other tech giants. Some even say they should be broken up[7]. Most recently, U.S. lawmakers launched a sweeping review[8] to determine if these companies have become so big and powerful that they are stifling competition and harming consumers, while federal regulators are also gearing up to take action[9]. But, when it comes to whether Silicon Valley giants are abusing their market power, size is only part of the problem[10]. The price of 'free' Traditionally a company's size has attracted the most antitrust scrutiny[11] because being big often translates into market power that it uses to prevent competitors from developing. A company's ability to raise prices is the main test regulators have used to determine whether it possesses such market power[12]. A growing body of analysis[13], that takes into account some of the different features of these companies, shows that relying so heavily on price obscures other potential harms. </p><p>Today the biggest tech companies allow 'free' consumer access to most if not all of their products. Consumers don't have to pay a dime to chat with friends on Facebook, search for the best route using Google Maps, exchange emails, comb the internet for facts and figures or engage in countless other activities. So an antitrust policy that focuses on consumer price doesn't see a problem[14]. But the data about what consumers do, where they go, who they know and what they buy has great value[15] to companies like Google and Facebook. And we're required to give up that data in exchange for 'free' use of their products. What's more, this data gives these companies an extraordinary market advantage. It allows them to identify untapped [16] and underserved markets, spot potential competitors[17] and prevent them from developing - the kind of edge that antitrust law is meant to thwart.   Facebook came under scrutiny after selling user data. AP Photo/Andrew Harnik[18]  Could network effects create natural monopolies? Large companies are also a primary antitrust concern because they can lead to monopolies that limit competition, discourage innovation and harm consumers. But in some industries, such as utilities and communications, competition can at times be impractical, leading to so-called natural monopolies[19]. In the past, a few companies were allowed to exist as natural monopolies because of the high fixed costs and inefficiencies of competition - such as in the utilities sector. Antitrust regulators have allowed them to exist but only with additional scrutiny[20] - such as price controls and oversight boards - to compensate for the lack of market monitoring. Antitrust law is now facing the question of whether 'network effects[21]' might also justify regarding a company such as Facebook and its massive social media network as a natural monopoly. Network effects occur when something increases in value as more people use it. Launching a new social media service doesn't require costly infrastructure, but it is made difficult by the hurdle of creating a network that people want to join. For example, Google+ failed to become a meaningful competitor for Facebook[22] because people stuck with the social network where all their friends were. Instagram may have been on its way[23] to providing such competition, which is why many now regret[24] that Facebook was allowed to buy it. A competing service might offer better features than Facebook but can't establish[25] itself because it doesn't have the network of friends already in place. Antitrust law does have ways of dealing with natural monopolies. It would be a significant adjustment to approach social networks in this way, but these are also industries with features unlike those that regulators have dealt with previously. 'Big tech' can be misleading A common retort heard from these companies is that they shouldn't be subject to antitrust scrutiny because they are all in competition[26] with one another[27]. Indeed, we've been talking about 'big tech[28]' for so long now[29] that it's easy to see it as one industry. But, as I've learned in my research on the changing competitive landscape of television[30], these companies are actually quite different[31] and shouldn't be seen as competing against[32] one another in one big tech market. Nor do they present precisely the same anticompetitive[33] behavior and concerns. Facebook is a social media company supported by advertising. It also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, two other popular communication services, and is able to collect data across all three services. Facebook has extraordinary data power[34] and its pervasiveness as a social network leads to an expanding role as a communication utility with incomparable reach[35]. Google offers a host of services but earns 85% of its revenue from advertising[36] \u2014 mostly from ads placed in its search engine. The lack of competition in search leads to concern[37] about its power in delivering search results. The amount of digital advertising controlled by Google and Facebook[38] is also an area of competitive concern. Amazon also has multiple endeavors but earns most of its revenue - 88%[39] - from its online retail business, which accounts for a little less than half of U.S. e-commerce[40]. Antitrust concerns[41] involve the advantage it achieves from using information it gains from the marketplace to create and sell products that compete with existing vendors at lower prices - or to exclude competing goods[42]. Rethinking antitrust U.S. policymakers finally seem to be catching up with the rest of the world and are beginning to acknowledge the antitrust challenges presented by these companies. Regulators in Europe[43] and Australia[44], for example, were quicker to identify the social and economic costs of the data collected by these massive tech companies and their use of market power. The likes of Amazon and Google have reshaped many facets of daily life. Let's see if they lead to a rethinking of U.S. antitrust policy as well.

Consumers don't have to pay a dime to chat with friends on Facebook, search for the best route using Google Maps, exchange emails, comb the internet for facts and figures or engage in countless other activities. </p><p>So an antitrust policy that focuses on consumer price <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-curse-of-bigness\">doesn't see a problem</url>. </p><p>But the data about what consumers do, where they go, who they know and what they buy <url normalizedValue=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/your-data-is-worth-more-than-you-think/\">has great value</url> to companies like Google and Facebook. And we're required to give up that data in exchange for \"free\" use of their products.</p><p>What's more, this data gives these companies an extraordinary market advantage. It allows them to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-is-becoming-a-competitor-to-the-outside-manufacturers-it-hosts-on-its-platform-2019-1/?r=AU&amp;IR=T\">identify untapped </url> and underserved markets,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/why-facebook-bought-whatsapp\">spot potential competitors</url> and prevent them from developing - the kind of edge that antitrust law is meant to thwart. </p><h>Could network effects create natural monopolies?</h><p>Large companies are also a primary antitrust concern because they can lead to monopolies that limit competition, discourage innovation and harm consumers. </p><p>But in some industries, such as utilities and communications, competition can at times be impractical, leading to so-called <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/natural_monopoly.asp\">natural monopolies</url>. In the past, a few companies were allowed to exist as natural monopolies because of the high fixed costs and inefficiencies of competition - such as in the utilities sector.  </p><p>Antitrust regulators have allowed them to exist but only with <url normalizedValue=\"https://opentextbc.ca/principlesofeconomics/chapter/11-3-regulating-natural-monopolies/\">additional scrutiny</url> - such as price controls and oversight boards - to compensate for the lack of market monitoring.</p><p>Antitrust law is now facing the question of whether \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/the-power-of-network-effects-why-they-make-such-valuable-companies-and-how-to-harness-them-5d3fbc3659f8\">network effects</url>\" might also justify regarding a company such as Facebook and its massive social media network as a natural monopoly. Network effects occur when something increases in value as more people use it. </p><p>Launching a new social media service doesn't require costly infrastructure, but it is made difficult by the hurdle of creating a network that people want to join. For example, Google+ failed to become a meaningful competitor for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/05/network-effects-and-global-domination-the-facebook-strategy/\">Facebook</url> because people stuck with the social network where all their friends were. </p><p>Instagram may have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://gigaom.com/2012/04/09/here-is-why-did-facebook-bought-instagram/\">on its way</url> to providing such competition, which is why many now       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/RepRoKhanna/status/1088850850766823424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2019%2F01%2F27%2Ffacebooks-plan-to-merge-messaging-services-ignites-antitrust-concerns.html\">regret</url> that Facebook was allowed to buy it.

Some even say they should be broken up.</p><p><br/> Most recently, U.S. lawmakers launched a sweeping review to determine if these companies have become so big and powerful that they are stifling competition and harming consumers, while federal regulators are also gearing up to take action.<br/> But, when it comes to whether Silicon Valley giants are abusing their market power, size is only part of the problem. The price of 'free'<br/> Traditionally a company's size has attracted the most antitrust scrutiny because being big often translates into market power that it uses to prevent competitors from developing. A company's ability to raise prices is the main test regulators have used to determine whether it possesses such market power.<br/> A growing body of analysis, that takes into account some of the different features of these companies, shows that relying so heavily on price obscures other potential harms.<br/> Today the biggest tech companies allow \"free\" consumer access to most if not all of their products. Consumers don't have to pay a dime to chat with friends on Facebook, search for the best route using Google Maps, exchange emails, comb the internet for facts and figures or engage in countless other activities.<br/> So an antitrust policy that focuses on consumer price doesn't see a problem.<br/> But the data about what consumers do, where they go, who they know and what they buy has great value to companies like Google and Facebook. And we're required to give up that data in exchange for \"free\" use of their products.<br/> What's more, this data gives these companies an extraordinary market advantage. It allows them to identify untapped and underserved markets, spot potential competitors and prevent them from developing - the kind of edge that antitrust law is meant to thwart. Facebook came under scrutiny after selling user data. AP Photo/Andrew Harnik Could network effects create natural monopolies?<br/> Large companies are also a primary antitrust concern because they can lead to monopolies that limit competition, discourage innovation and harm consumers.<br/> But in some industries, such as utilities and communications, competition can at times be impractical, leading to so-called natural monopolies. In the past, a few companies were allowed to exist as natural monopolies because of the high fixed costs and inefficiencies of competition - such as in the utilities sector.<br/> Antitrust regulators have allowed them to exist but only with additional scrutiny - such as price controls and oversight boards - to compensate for the lack of market monitoring.

Network effects occur when something increases in value as more people use it.<br/> Launching a new social media service doesn't require costly infrastructure, but it is made difficult by the hurdle of creating a network that people want to join. For example, Google+ failed to become a meaningful competitor for Facebook because people stuck with the social network where all their friends were.<br/>Instagram may have been on its way to providing such competition, which is why many now regret that Facebook was allowed to buy it. A competing service might offer better features than Facebook but can't establish itself because it doesn't have the network of friends already in place.<br/> Antitrust law does have ways of dealing with natural monopolies. It would be a significant adjustment to approach social networks in this way, but these are also industries with features unlike those that regulators have dealt with previously. 'Big tech' can be misleading<br/> A common retort heard from these companies is that they shouldn't be subject to antitrust scrutiny because they are all in competition with one another. Indeed, we've been talking about \"big tech\" for so long now that it's easy to see it as one industry.<br/> But, as I've learned in my research on the changing competitive landscape of television, these companies are actually quite different and shouldn't be seen as competing against one another in one big tech market. Nor do they present precisely the same anticompetitive behavior and concerns.<br/>Facebook is a social media company supported by advertising. It also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, two other popular communication services, and is able to collect data across all three services. Facebook has extraordinary data power and its pervasiveness as a social network leads to an expanding role as a communication utility with incomparable reach.<br/>Google offers a host of services but earns 85% of its revenue from advertising - mostly from ads placed in its search engine. The lack of competition in search leads to concern about its power in delivering search results. The amount of digital advertising controlled by Google and Facebook is also an area of competitive concern.<br/>Amazon also has multiple endeavors but earns most of its revenue - 88% - from its online retail business, which accounts for a little less than half of U.S. e-commerce. Antitrust concerns involve the advantage it achieves from using information it gains from the marketplace to create and sell products that compete with existing vendors at lower prices - or to exclude competing goods. Rethinking antitrust<br/> U.S. policymakers finally seem to be catching up with the rest of the world and are beginning to acknowledge the antitrust challenges presented by these companies.<br/> Regulators in Europe and Australia, for example, were quicker to identify the social and economic costs of the data collected by these massive tech companies and their use of market power.<br/> The likes of Amazon and Google have reshaped many facets of daily life. Let's see if they lead to a rethinking of U.S. antitrust policy as well.The Conversation<br/> Amanda Lotz, Fellow, Peabody Media Center; Professor of Media Studies, Queensland University of Technology<br/> This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Nor do they present precisely thesame anticompetitivebehavior and concerns.Facebook is a social media company supported by advertising. It also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, two other popular communication services, and is able to collect data across all three services. Facebook has extraordinarydata powerand its pervasiveness as a social network leads to an expanding role as a communication utility withincomparable reach.Google offers a host of services but earns 85% of its revenue fromadvertising\u2014 mostly from ads placed in its search engine. The lack of competition in search leads toconcernabout its power in delivering search results. The amount of digital advertisingcontrolled by Google and Facebook[3]is also an area of competitive concern.Amazon also has multiple endeavors but earns most of its revenue -88%[4]- from its online retail business, which accounts fora little less than half of U.S. e-commerce.Antitrust concernsinvolve the advantage it achieves from using information it gains from the marketplace to create and sell products that compete with existing vendors at lower prices - or toexclude competing goods.Rethinking antitrustU.S. policymakers finally seem to be catching up with the rest of the world and are beginning to acknowledge the antitrust challenges presented by these companies.Regulators inEuropeandAustralia, for example, were quicker to identify the social and economic costs of the data collected by these massive tech companies and their use of market power.The likes of Amazon and Google have reshaped many facets of daily life. Let's see if they lead to a rethinking of U.S. antitrust policy as well.Amanda Lotz[5] is a fellow, Peabody Media Center; professor of Media Studies, Queensland University of Technology.This article originally appeared inThe Conversation[6].Read thearticlehere.[7] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/03/facebook-google-other-tech-giants-face-antitrust-investigation-by-house-lawmakers/?utm_term=.cde3a9a39639\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/03/facebook-google-other-tech-giants-face-antitrust-investigation-by-house-lawmakers/?utm_term=.cde3a9a39639</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/the-power-of-network-effects-why-they-make-such-valuable-companies-and-how-to-harness-them-5d3fbc3659f8\">https://medium.com/evergreen-business-weekly/the-power-of-network-effects-why-they-make-such-valuable-companies-and-how-to-harness-them-5d3fbc3659f8</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2017/07/28/google-facebook-digital-advertising/\">http://fortune.com/2017/07/28/google-facebook-digital-advertising/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/in-2018-aws-delivered-most-of-amazons-operating-income/\">https://www.zdnet.com/article/in-2018-aws-delivered-most-of-amazons-operating-income/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/amanda-lotz-154746\">https://theconversation.com/profiles/amanda-lotz-154746</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com\">https://theconversation.com</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/amazon-google-and-facebook-warrant-antitrust-scrutiny-for-many-reasons-not-just-because-theyre-large-118370\">https://theconversation.com/amazon-google-and-facebook-warrant-antitrust-scrutiny-for-many-reasons-not-just-because-theyre-large-118370</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX1087671561445458842251763300180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDS-HKF1-JCMN-Y3KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1176\"/><timeReceived>6:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 25, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Put simply, the biggest of big tech companies have decided that to win, they must control every aspect of how we interact with technology. And that means building out Apple-like ecosystems of gadgets that capture as much of your data as possible and keep it within their very owned walled gardens. The promise to consumers is to create, like Apple, a system that offers ease and simplicity of use, and rewards users for investing more in a single brand. </p><p>By the same measure, those systems become a trap which limits choice over time as they limit compatibility with competing systems. In rocketing to becoming the world's most valuable company, Apple has demonstrated the profound appeal of this integrated approach. With some exceptions now and then, Apple's products are seductively simple to connect with each other, and manage a single account across those gadgets. At home, I have an Apple TV, iPad, 3 iPhones, and a Macbook Air. These all communicate seamlessly. I haven't taken the Apple Watch plunge, and have no plants to get one. Now, Apple is extending that ecosystem with the HomePod, its own voice-activated speaker powered by Siri. But if you want to listen to music, you'll need to have an Apple Music subscription. There is some speculation that at some point, Apple could open it up to third-party developers. For the moment, it will be a closed system when it goes on sale in December. Of course, for Apple, this integration of hardware and software has been a consistent approach. And because the company doesn't overtly make money from users' data, it's a bit less ominous I suppose. On the other hand, for rivals like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, that data is now, and will increasingly, be used in the future for ad-targeting, marketing campaigns, and efforts to get you to buy more and more. Google-Alphabet has been going down this road for sometime now, as it has tried with mix success to become a hardware company. Its acquisition of Nest, its Chromecast stick for TV, Nexus phones, Chromebook and Google Home have helped ease the pain of failures like Google Glass. Still, this isn't enough for Google, which 18 months ago hired Rick Osterloh to be its senior vice president of hardware. It was Osterloh who apparently oversaw the deal with HTC, and the decision to basically bring in-house the production of the Pixel phone, its attempt to create a flagship Android device. 'Our team's goal is to offer the best Google experience\u2014across hardware, software and services\u2014to people around the world. \\We're excited about the 2017 lineup, but even more inspired by what's in store over the next five, 10, even 20 years,'\u00a0he wrote in a blog post about the HTC deal[2]. 'Creating beautiful products that people rely on every single day is a journey, and we are investing for the long run.' It is an innocent-sounding statement that is less-than innocent. Google is already under fire in Europe for abusing its search engine monopoly to beat back competitive shopping services. The EU is also investigating whether it used its Android OS to force handset manufacturers and consumers to use various Google services on their phone. Google is planning to make more announcements about its hardware plans at an event on October 4. Even if Google products allow third-party developers access to the hardware, as with Android, there are major concerns that with the default being Google's voice assistant or search, the company is hoping to grab data that might otherwise flow to, say, Apple or any other competitor. Amazon's push to lasso the physical and the virtual also has troubling overtones. From its start with the Kindle reader, and later the Amazon TV Fire stock, the company has a growing portfolio of products such as the Echo now driven by its Alexa voice assistant. The company is also eager for other hardware developers to build Alexa capability into third-party hardware. And it's attracting a growing number of developers who are creating skills for Alexa. The company has other niche hardware products like the Dash buttons for ordering more goods, the Dash Wand for reading barcodes at home, and the Echo Look connected camera. This is creating a massive vacuum of information about user behavior and their data. How they mix and match that data is going to draw close scrutiny from regulators and privacy advocates. Particularly as they invest more in physical stores like Whole Foods. And then comes Facebook, which for the moment has made its biggest splash with its acquisition of Oculus VR. But the company increasingly realizes where the game is headed. A year ago, Facebook publicly announced it had built a 22,000 square foot hardware lab[3]. Some of that work focuses on its internal IT projects, like servers and switches. And some focuses and its various efforts to expand connectivity to remote areas. But earlier this year, the company unveiled its Surround 360 cameras[4]. But now there are reports[5] it's building a video chat device and its own smart speaker. Even possibly a modular smartphone[6]. Microsoft, in contrast, has tempered its hardware ambitions after a big push a few years ago. Though its phones have flopped, and its Nokia deal was a bust, it has gotten traction with its Surface tablet, and of course the Xbox has a long run as a top video gaming platform. Likely, Microsoft remains chastened by its various antitrust battles over the years along with some of these costly flops. And like Google's Android, its a bit restrained by its need to manage its long-standing OEM relationships. But it's also in some ways trying to zig away from these other tech giants by becoming easier to use on other platforms, particularly with some of its Office apps in an effort to extend its appeal. And it's focusing more on its cloud services competition against Google and Amazon. Still, overall, the direction is clear. Consumers are going to be facing tough choices not just about a single product, or service, but about the larger implications of what it means in terms of when and where that service or product might work. They are going to be forced to grapple with a larger number of interoperability issues as they try to figure out which service works with which hardware, and which hardware can be paired with which other hardware. The path of least resistance, over time, will be to simply buy hardware and services from one company. And once you do, the barrier to switching to other products with become higher and higher. Companies will talk about being 'open,' but they will only kinda sorta mean it. While U.S. anti-trust and consumer protection has become relatively toothless in recent years, these companies can also likely look forward to more intense scrutiny and legal battles with the European Union. The EU has been far more aggressive in ensuring that these companies don't use their might to limit consumer choices. The expanding walled garden of hardware would seem to be painting a big red target on the backs of these tech companies. In the meantime, consumers ought to remain vigilant. Each gadget unto itself can be fun, seductive, and even actually useful. But they should make sure that as they step further into the embrace of one company that they aren't entering into a relationship from which there is no exit.

Algorithms designed by Facebook, Twitter Inc. and Google have also been criticized for increasing political polarization by giving people the type of news they already agree with, creating so-called \u201cfilter bubbles.\"<br/><br/>\u201cWe are at the early stages of the commercialization of AI,\" ITI President Dean Garfield said. \u201cGiven the reach of AI, we think it\u2019s critical that society, governments, and the technology sector work together to begin to solve some of the most complex issues.\" ITI presented the principles Tuesday at a conference in Washington hosted by a unit of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.<br/><br/>ITI stressed that governments shouldn\u2019t ask companies to share or expose the code behind their AI systems. That touches on a key issue for the companies, which don\u2019t want to have to explain the workings of AI systems that produce results their creators sometimes don\u2019t fully understand themselves. In Europe, regulators have told tech companies they don\u2019t mind how algorithms work, as long as they don\u2019t break the law.<br/><br/>Facebook\u2019s head of security, Alex Stamos, took to Twitter earlier this month to warn that the issue of fake news on social networks was more complicated than it\u2019s often made out to be and trying to interfere with algorithms could have unintended consequences.<br/><br/>AI is one of the hottest fields of technological research, with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon, Facebook and Chinese internet giants like Baidu Inc. racing to develop computer programs that learn on their own. ITI estimates AI will add at least $7 trillion to the global economy by 2025.<br/><br/>Despite the promise, criticisms range from Elon Musk\u2019s fears of AI being an existential threat to humanity to the problem of mostly male scientists and developers injecting their own biases into AI.<br/><br/>Tech companies have a responsibility to make sure the data and tools they use to develop AI mitigate bias, Garfield said, describing the principles as a commitment from industry to work on this problem.<br/><br/>The principles also acknowledge concerns that AI will disrupt labor markets, pushing more people out of work as computers learn to do tasks better than humans. Education, private-public partnerships and building AI programs that help people do their jobs should be priorities, the ITI report said.<br/><br/>\"Any time you are driving innovation in a society that is transformative and as a result potentially uncomfortable, there are going to be points of tension,\" Garfield said. \"The thing that we are trying to do is to make sure we\u2019re at the center of trying to identify those points of tension and trying to resolve them. The bottom line is we hear the concerns that are being raised.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WINITP-352523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WINITP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PVV-RF71-DY2V-D1WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">337441</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Windows IT Pro Magazine</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 25, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Algorithms designed by Facebook, Twitter Inc. and Google have also been criticized for increasing political polarization by giving people the type of news they already agree with, creating so-called \u201cfilter bubbles.\"<br/><br/>\u201cWe are at the early stages of the commercialization of AI,\" ITI President Dean Garfield said. \u201cGiven the reach of AI, we think it\u2019s critical that society, governments, and the technology sector work together to begin to solve some of the most complex issues.\" ITI presented the principles Tuesday at a conference in Washington hosted by a unit of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.<br/><br/>ITI stressed that governments shouldn\u2019t ask companies to share or expose the code behind their AI systems. That touches on a key issue for the companies, which don\u2019t want to have to explain the workings of AI systems that produce results their creators sometimes don\u2019t fully understand themselves. In Europe, regulators have told tech companies they don\u2019t mind how algorithms work, as long as they don\u2019t break the law.<br/><br/>Facebook\u2019s head of security, Alex Stamos, took to Twitter earlier this month to warn that the issue of fake news on social networks was more complicated than it\u2019s often made out to be and trying to interfere with algorithms could have unintended consequences.<br/><br/>AI is one of the hottest fields of technological research, with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon, Facebook and Chinese internet giants like Baidu Inc. racing to develop computer programs that learn on their own. ITI estimates AI will add at least $7 trillion to the global economy by 2025.<br/><br/>Despite the promise, criticisms range from Elon Musk\u2019s fears of AI being an existential threat to humanity to the problem of mostly male scientists and developers injecting their own biases into AI.<br/><br/>Tech companies have a responsibility to make sure the data and tools they use to develop AI mitigate bias, Garfield said, describing the principles as a commitment from industry to work on this problem.<br/><br/>The principles also acknowledge concerns that AI will disrupt labor markets, pushing more people out of work as computers learn to do tasks better than humans. Education, private-public partnerships and building AI programs that help people do their jobs should be priorities, the ITI report said.<br/><br/>\"Any time you are driving innovation in a society that is transformative and as a result potentially uncomfortable, there are going to be points of tension,\" Garfield said. \"The thing that we are trying to do is to make sure we\u2019re at the center of trying to identify those points of tension and trying to resolve them.

Algorithms designed by Facebook, Twitter Inc. and Google have also been criticized for increasing political polarization by giving people the type of news they already agree with, creating so-called \u201cfilter bubbles.\"<br/><br/>\u201cWe are at the early stages of the commercialization of AI,\" ITI President Dean Garfield said. \u201cGiven the reach of AI, we think it\u2019s critical that society, governments, and the technology sector work together to begin to solve some of the most complex issues.\" ITI presented the principles Tuesday at a conference in Washington hosted by a unit of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.<br/><br/>ITI stressed that governments shouldn\u2019t ask companies to share or expose the code behind their AI systems. That touches on a key issue for the companies, which don\u2019t want to have to explain the workings of AI systems that produce results their creators sometimes don\u2019t fully understand themselves. In Europe, regulators have told tech companies they don\u2019t mind how algorithms work, as long as they don\u2019t break the law.<br/><br/>Facebook\u2019s head of security, Alex Stamos, took to Twitter earlier this month to warn that the issue of fake news on social networks was more complicated than it\u2019s often made out to be and trying to interfere with algorithms could have unintended consequences.<br/><br/>AI is one of the hottest fields of technological research, with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Amazon, Facebook and Chinese internet giants like Baidu Inc. racing to develop computer programs that learn on their own. ITI estimates AI will add at least $7 trillion to the global economy by 2025.<br/><br/>Despite the promise, criticisms range from Elon Musk\u2019s fears of AI being an existential threat to humanity to the problem of mostly male scientists and developers injecting their own biases into AI.<br/><br/>Tech companies have a responsibility to make sure the data and tools they use to develop AI mitigate bias, Garfield said, describing the principles as a commitment from industry to work on this problem.<br/><br/>The principles also acknowledge concerns that AI will disrupt labor markets, pushing more people out of work as computers learn to do tasks better than humans. Education, private-public partnerships and building AI programs that help people do their jobs should be priorities, the ITI report said.<br/><br/>\"Any time you are driving innovation in a society that is transformative and as a result potentially uncomfortable, there are going to be points of tension,\" Garfield said. \"The thing that we are trying to do is to make sure we\u2019re at the center of trying to identify those points of tension and trying to resolve them. The bottom line is we hear the concerns that are being raised.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SQLSER-352423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SQLSER2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PVV-RF71-DY2V-D1MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">337439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SQL Server Pro</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 25, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Here are some interesting revelations: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">               1. Amazon built a \"hybrid\" drone            </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Amazon's prototype is an octocopter - meaning it has eight propellers and can take off and land vertically, like a helicopter. But the design also includes wings and a \"pusher motor\" so that it can transition from helicopter takeoffs to the energy-efficient flight of a plane at altitude. A pure octocopter wouldn't be capable of\u00a0a range of 15 miles, like this prototype. </p><p> At altitude, only the pusher motor -  - is in motion. The eight other propellers reactivate once the drone is about to land and needs to make a vertical descent into a yard. </p><p>              2. Backyards will be key for Amazon Prime Air           </p><p> The video shows the drone switching into \"landing mode\" and descending onto a \"delivery zone\" in the customer's backyard. The drone releases the package onto what looks like a sheet of plastic with an Amazon logo. The larger the yard and the less tree cover, the easier the landing will be. </p><p>              3. Amazon sticks with a different approach than Google           </p><p> Just like its first drone video, the Amazon drone lands to drop off a package. This is a different tactic than   what rival Google has demonstrated  , in which its hovering drone releases a package that floats to the ground. </p><p> Amazon will need to be certain its drone can land in a backyard without any mishaps involving a family pet, kids, stray sports equipment, a new birdbath or whatever else might be in a yard. </p><p>              4. What about safety?           </p><p> Amazon says its drone has \"sophisticated 'sense and avoid' technology,\" which will be essential for those backyard landings. Everyone from big tech companies such as Amazon to start-ups is developing this technology, so that drones can identify obstacles and automatically avoid them. For example, with sense and avoid, a drone would realize a dog had strayed into its landing zone, and not land until the coast was clear. </p><p> Because this prototype has nine propellers it will still function even if multiple motors fail. </p><p>              5. It'll likely be a lot faster than your local delivery truck           </p><p> One section of the\u00a0video, which Amazon notes is actual flight footage, shows the drone flying between 55-58 mph. That speed will come in handy if Amazon is going to deliver on its promise of getting packages to customers in 30 minutes. </p><p>              6. It's a big drone           </p><p> Amazon isn't saying how much this\u00a0prototype weighs, only that its drones weigh less than 55 pounds. And it's not sharing the prototype's wingspan. If you look at the photo below and remember that blue box is actually a shoe box, it's obvious the drone is far larger than the consumer drones we see most frequently, such as the DJI Phantom and Parrot Bebop. </p><p> A larger drone means Amazon can carry larger packages. Larger drones are generally heavier, which increases risk in the event of the crash. At the same time, all that size creates space for the nine propellers - and a drone with nine motors has more back-up propellers that a drone with four propellers, which improves safety. </p><p>              7. Remember, it's just a prototype.           </p><p> Don't expect an exact replica of this drone to eventually land in your backyard. Amazon says it has more than a dozen prototypes in its research and development labs, and that the look of characteristics will continue to evolve.\u00a0Amazon's prototype has changed quite a bit in two years, who knows what it'll look like in 2017. </p><p>              8. Amazon chose a British broadcaster for voiceover purposes           </p><p> Former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson - who is developing a show for Amazon - does the honors. Amazon has taken its testing overseas given its frustration with the slog toward commercial drone regulation in the United States. Amazon says it will launch Prime Air once it has regulatory support. Don't be surprised if it launches first outside the United States. </p><p> Amazon says the prototype can operate safely \"beyond line of sight\" to distances of 10 miles or more. That means outside the view of the person responsible for controlling it. However the FAA's proposed commercial drone rules, released in February, require drones to fly where the drone's pilot can see it. While U.S.   drones may eventually be able to fly out of sight  , the process isn't moving as fast as Amazon would like. </p><p>              Related: Amazon's plans for how drones can fly safely over U.S. skies </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-1a5988e8975611e594f09eeaff906ef3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HGX-RD11-JB4M-V0HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><timeReceived>5:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 30, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000617</classCode><className>ENERGY EFFICIENCY &amp; CONSERVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001319</classCode><className>PETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DFCU</classCode><className>COMMERCIAL DRONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000617</classCode><className>ENERGY EFFICIENCY &amp; CONSERVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Here are 8 details worth noting.</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>Matt McFarland</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Almost exactly two years after first announcing its plans to deliver packages with a drone, Amazon revealed a new prototype of one of its delivery drones. Here are some interesting revelations: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">               1. Amazon built a \"hybrid\" drone            </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Amazon's prototype is an octocopter - meaning it has eight propellers and can take off and land vertically, like a helicopter. But the design also includes wings and a \"pusher motor\" so that it can transition from helicopter takeoffs to the energy-efficient flight of a plane at altitude. A pure octocopter wouldn't be capable of\u00a0a range of 15 miles, like this prototype. </p><p> At altitude, only the pusher motor -  - is in motion. The eight other propellers reactivate once the drone is about to land and needs to make a vertical descent into a yard. </p><p>              2. Backyards will be key for Amazon Prime Air           </p><p> The video shows the drone switching into \"landing mode\" and descending onto a \"delivery zone\" in the customer's backyard. The drone releases the package onto what looks like a sheet of plastic with an Amazon logo. The larger the yard and the less tree cover, the easier the landing will be. </p><p>              3. Amazon sticks with a different approach than Google           </p><p> Just like its first drone video, the Amazon drone lands to drop off a package. This is a different tactic than   what rival Google has demonstrated  , in which its hovering drone releases a package that floats to the ground. </p><p> Amazon will need to be certain its drone can land in a backyard without any mishaps involving a family pet, kids, stray sports equipment, a new birdbath or whatever else might be in a yard. </p><p>              4. What about safety?           </p><p> Amazon says its drone has \"sophisticated 'sense and avoid' technology,\" which will be essential for those backyard landings. Everyone from big tech companies such as Amazon to start-ups is developing this technology, so that drones can identify obstacles and automatically avoid them. For example, with sense and avoid, a drone would realize a dog had strayed into its landing zone, and not land until the coast was clear. </p><p> Because this prototype has nine propellers it will still function even if multiple motors fail. </p><p>              5. It'll likely be a lot faster than your local delivery truck           </p><p> One section of the\u00a0video, which Amazon notes is actual flight footage, shows the drone flying between 55-58 mph. That speed will come in handy if Amazon is going to deliver on its promise of getting packages to customers in 30 minutes. </p><p>              6. It's a big drone           </p><p> Amazon isn't saying how much this\u00a0prototype weighs, only that its drones weigh less than 55 pounds. And it's not sharing the prototype's wingspan. If you look at the photo below and remember that blue box is actually a shoe box, it's obvious the drone is far larger than the consumer drones we see most frequently, such as the DJI Phantom and Parrot Bebop. </p><p> A larger drone means Amazon can carry larger packages. Larger drones are generally heavier, which increases risk in the event of the crash. At the same time, all that size creates space for the nine propellers - and a drone with nine motors has more back-up propellers that a drone with four propellers, which improves safety. </p><p>              7. Remember, it's just a prototype.           </p><p> Don't expect an exact replica of this drone to eventually land in your backyard. Amazon says it has more than a dozen prototypes in its research and development labs, and that the look of characteristics will continue to evolve.\u00a0Amazon's prototype has changed quite a bit in two years, who knows what it'll look like in 2017. </p><p>              8. Amazon chose a British broadcaster for voiceover purposes           </p><p> Former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson - who is developing a show for Amazon - does the honors. Amazon has taken its testing overseas given its frustration with the slog toward commercial drone regulation in the United States. Amazon says it will launch Prime Air once it has regulatory support. Don't be surprised if it launches first outside the United States. </p><p> Amazon says the prototype can operate safely \"beyond line of sight\" to distances of 10 miles or more. That means outside the view of the person responsible for controlling it. However the FAA's proposed commercial drone rules, released in February, require drones to fly where the drone's pilot can see it. While U.S.   drones may eventually be able to fly out of sight  , the process isn't moving as fast as Amazon would like. </p><p>              Related: Amazon's plans for how drones can fly safely over U.S. skies </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-6dbb27df09044f66b48c697b7c9bb09a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HGX-RD11-JB4M-V0N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><timeReceived>5:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 30, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000617</classCode><className>ENERGY EFFICIENCY &amp; CONSERVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001319</classCode><className>PETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DFCU</classCode><className>COMMERCIAL DRONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000617</classCode><className>ENERGY EFFICIENCY &amp; CONSERVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Six months ago, a labor leader and an Amazon vice president would have been on opposite sides in discussing the future of work at Big Tech in general and Amazon in particular. Then on May 1, one of us, Tim, walked away from a senior role at Amazon Web Services, and potentially millions in compensation, in protest over the firing of workers who spoke out about conditions in the companys warehouses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During the pandemic, weve seen Big Tech share prices and revenue rocket, while some of Amazons warehouse workers say they fear coming to work and catching the coronavirus. The companys decision to fire the activists who demanded safer jobs is unacceptable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both of us now agree: Amazon and the rest of Big Tech must change. And that includes allowing its workers to unionize.</p><p>Were not alone in wanting accountability from these companies: Jeff Bezos and the heads of Facebook, Google and Apple will appear before the House judiciarys antitrust subcommittee today.</p><p>The coronavirus has killed over half a million people worldwide and pushed global unemployment to rates not seen since the Great Depression. Shared sacrifice is called for, yet the burden has been far from even. Since mid-March, when quarantined shoppers turned to Amazons vast retail platform, its shareholder value increased by nearly $500 billion, to more than $1.4 trillion. Stock market shares are owned disproportionately by the richest people in society, and by Mr. Bezos in particular ; his lead over the other richest people on earth has increased markedly.</p><p>This wealth is not shared with the workers who help create it. The temporary Covid-19-related hourly raise was rolled back in June , but the order flow remains high , making the already stressful work of those who sort, package and deliver Amazon goods even worse.</p><p>We Work in an Amazon Warehouse. We Didnt Sign Up to Be Heroes.</p><p>Thanks for the flattering commercials, but were about to lose our hazard pay.</p><p>My typical morning, my cat usually jumps on my face. Then my alarm goes off about 4 oclock. I cry for about a good three minutes. Usually during the day, I am numb. I am on autopilot. So I give myself that three minutes to let everything out. So that way I dont you know, have a breakdown. I grocery shop for thousands, maybe millions of people a day. I dont know. Were the back, legs, arms. We are the body of Amazon. We dont need your thank you commercials. We need better protections and to be paid what we deserve. Amazon has reportedly confirmed its going to stop paying its warehouse workers that extra $2 an hour in coronavirus hazard pay. Amazons unlimited unpaid-leave policy ended on May 1. That means if you have coronavirus, you are expected to still show up to work even after two weeks have passed. I have lupus nephritis, which means my immune system is weak. So if I even get the mild condition of just getting corona, I would end up in critical condition because thats how weak my body is. Theyre still getting cases every other day or every other week, and not just our warehouse on Staten Island but across the United States. Im home now scared to go to work. They ended the UPT policy. My leave of absence ended May 9. I requested a new leave, and Amazon denied it. This is my source of income for the past two years. I dont want to give up the job, but in this pandemic, theyre making me choose between my life or a customers order. Amazon is acting like the pandemic is over and everything is back to normal. They call us essential. They call us heroes. But Im just going to say it. We are expendable. You have 30 million-plus people on unemployment in the country. Hazard pay would actually help because a lot of people are the sole breadwinners now in their household especially too because were risking our lives. Bring the unlimited UPT back. That keeps us safe versus coming in, walking around, not knowing whether they have the virus or not. Business is phenomenal for them right now. Even as unrest builds, it has done nothing to knock Amazons share price off the perch, even hitting new record highs. A decent amount of people that I work with have quit. I thought about it. I want to, but I cant. Me and my sister work hard for everything. We were homeless. You know, my biggest fear is going back to that. Amazon is facing questions about its initial response to employees who complained about safety. Two former Amazon employees say they were fired for their activism. Definitely not scared of them. My mother was a Marine, and I was in the Navy. But am I scared of losing what keeps a roof over my head and food in my stomach? Yeah, that Im scared of. We didnt sign up to come in and risk our lives. We didnt sign up to be someones hero. Its a shitty choice. In these uncertain times, I just want to remind you that its still an uncertain time. Dont let these policies expire before the pandemic is over.</p><p>Thanks for the flattering commercials, but were about to lose our hazard pay.</p><p>As this was unfolding, most of Big Tech, including Amazon, sent white-collar workers home to flatten the curve and fight the pandemic. Tim saw company leadership go to great lengths to make sure this new system was working and actively seek feedback from the remote workers. Christy heard from a warehouse employee who said productivity targets made it difficult for workers to take a break even for hand washing without a mark on their record. Pay for warehouse workers starts at $15 an hour with minimal access to time off ; in May Amazon ended the unpaid leave policy that for a few weeks allowed them to stay home if they had Covid-19 symptoms. The contrast in the treatment of knowledge and warehouse workers couldnt be starker. Equally clear is the cause: One group has power, the other doesnt.</p><p>Amazons decision to fire the activists was easy to make in the United States, where Amazon workers have no union and are left to fend for themselves. With no right to paid sick leave or protection from unfair dismissal, American workers are among the most vulnerable in the world to pressure from any employer, not just Amazon.</p><p>Union-represented Amazon workers in Spain, Italy, France and Germany initially failed to resolve their concerns through negotiation, but with court action, regulatory intervention and strikes, they got their needs addressed.</p><p>Lets look at France: Unions there brought a civil case arguing that Amazon had taken inadequate steps to protect workers from infection risk and that it had sidestepped the unions statutory role. The court ordered Amazon to limit its sales to only essential items, or face harsh penalties until it could reach a safety agreement with the unions. Rather than negotiate, Amazon closed its French operations and appealed. But the appellate court also sided with the workers, who ultimately negotiated a settlement including mandatory union consultation over safety measures, union hiring of external experts to assess the measures effectiveness and a continued increase in workers hourly pay. The news from Europe shows that Amazon can work with unions and get good results.</p><p>Both of us want Amazon to share the wealth with workers and stop putting the relentless pursuit of revenue growth ahead of all other concerns. One way or another, this requires putting more power in the hands of workers. Regulation and legislation are part of the solution. But theres no need to wait; power can be taken, not just given. Thats what unions are for.</p><p>Amazon is a data-driven company. It should recognize the evidence showing that countries with more collective bargaining have a stronger social fabric and better growth, and are more able to weather economic ups and downs. Businesses with collective bargaining relationships, including Auchan Retail and Carrefour, navigated the Covid-19 crisis with less disruption to their businesses and emerged with their reputations intact and even enhanced.</p><p>For its own future and the future of the global economy, Amazon should become more responsive to the women and men whove enriched shareholders and be willing to recognize and bargain with their representatives. When it comes to the rights of its workers, it should be a leader, not a laggard.</p><p>Its not just Amazon: The need for more unionization is urgent across Big Tech. Amazon stands out because it combines the extraordinary profit margins of these companies with employing hundreds of thousands of front-line workers. There are fewer of these workers at the other iconic tech companies, but nevertheless their employees also deserve a voice over the issues that matter to them.</p><p>The question for Mr. Bezos and the billionaires of the world is: Are they ready to rise to the occasion?

Die ist neben Elektronikprodukten und Spielsachen seit Jahren einer der Bestseller am \"Prime Day\" in Deutschland. Als wir angefangen haben, kamen die Kunden noch zu uns, weil etwas woanders schwer zu finden war - zum Beispiel eine besondere Nudelsorte, die man im Italien-Urlaub entdeckt hat. Station\u00e4re L\u00e4den sind toll, aber die k\u00f6nnen unm\u00f6glich Tausende Nudelsorten bereithalten. Online ist das m\u00f6glich. Aber wenn ich mir heute unsere meistverkauften Produkte anschaue, dann sind das Dinge, die Menschen jeden Tag benutzen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Deutschland ist nach den Vereinigten Staaten der zweitwichtigste Absatzmarkt f\u00fcr Amazon. Gibt es daf\u00fcr einen bestimmten Grund?</p><p>Deutsche Kunden nehmen unser Angebot sehr gut an, was uns sehr freut. Die Prime-Mitglieder in Deutschland geh\u00f6ren weltweit zu den aktivsten Nutzern. Ich bin seit mehr als 20 Jahren bei Amazon, und in vielerlei Hinsicht haben sich Bed\u00fcrfnisse von Kunden nicht ge\u00e4ndert: Wir sehen, dass Kunden gute Preise, eine gro\u00dfe Auswahl und eine schnelle Lieferung sch\u00e4tzen - und wir arbeiten hart daran, alle drei Dinge zu jeder Zeit zu gew\u00e4hrleisten. Das m\u00f6gen Kunden \u00fcberall - auch in Deutschland.</p><p>Sie verkaufen ja nicht nur online, sondern haben auch L\u00e4den namens Amazon Go. Und dann liefern Sie auch per Drohne. Gibt es Pl\u00e4ne, das auch in Deutschland einzuf\u00fchren?</p><p>Dazu haben wir bisher keine Ank\u00fcndigung gemacht. Was ich sagen kann: Deutsche stehen sicher nicht lieber in Schlangen an der Kasse als Amerikaner. Schauen Sie sich den kassenlosen Supermarkt Amazon Go in Seattle, New York, San Francisco oder Chicago an - reingehen, ausw\u00e4hlen, rauslaufen. Das war's! Bei der Lieferung per Drohne sind viele regulatorische Fragen zu kl\u00e4ren. Das verlangt gute Zusammenarbeit mit Regierungen.</p><p>Politiker und Marktw\u00e4chter sind besorgt, Amazon sei zu m\u00e4chtig geworden. K\u00fcrzlich sagte Amerikas Finanzminister, Amazon habe den Einzelhandel zerst\u00f6rt. Stimmen Sie ihm zu?</p><p>Nein. Die Fakten sind ziemlich einfach. Der Einzelhandel ist ein sehr gro\u00dfes Gesch\u00e4ft. Amazon macht, global gesehen, weniger als ein Prozent am Handel aus, und in den Vereinigten Staaten stehen wir f\u00fcr weniger als 4 Prozent des Umsatzes. Wir sind nicht einmal der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Verk\u00e4ufer in Amerika. Walmart ist etwa doppelt so gro\u00df wie wir. Das Gleiche gilt f\u00fcr Deutschland und Gro\u00dfbritannien und anderswo. Das alles widerspricht dieser Aussage. Au\u00dferdem erwirtschaften selbst\u00e4ndige Verkaufspartner 58 Prozent des gesamten Bruttoumsatzes auf Amazon. Wir helfen ihnen dabei, ihr Gesch\u00e4ft auszubauen.</p><p>Warum untersucht die EU-Kommission denn dann, wie Amazon auf Marketplace mit diesen H\u00e4ndlern umgeht?</p><p>Ich kann Ihnen versichern, dass wir vollumf\u00e4nglich mit der Kommission kooperieren und auf die Nachfragen antworten. Ich sage auch: Wir sind sehr stolz darauf, wie wir unseren Verkaufspartnern helfen, mit ihrem Gesch\u00e4ft voranzukommen. Es gibt genug Belege, die zeigen, welchen positiven Einfluss wir auf diese Partner haben: Viele erreichen \u00fcber uns pl\u00f6tzlich Millionen Kunden weltweit, wachsen, stellen Mitarbeiter ein - allein in Deutschland sind so 120.000 Arbeitspl\u00e4tze entstanden.</p><p>Auch die amerikanischen Wettbewerbsh\u00fcter untersuchen jetzt die Marktmacht der gro\u00dfen Digitalunternehmen.</p><p>Wir sagen seit langem: Gerade bei gro\u00dfen Unternehmen sollte es normal sein, dass man sie unter die Lupe nimmt. So wie wir unser Gesch\u00e4ft betreiben, brauchen uns aber diese Untersuchungen nicht zu beunruhigen, egal wer nachfragt, ob Regierungen oder jemand anderes. Wenn Beh\u00f6rden auf uns zukommen und Fragen stellen, erl\u00e4utern wir gerne, wie unser Gesch\u00e4ft funktioniert. Ich bin \u00fcberzeugt: Mit unseren Antworten werden sie zufrieden sein. Wir freuen uns auf diese Gespr\u00e4che.</p><p>Amazon ist also nicht zu gro\u00df?</p><p>Die Breite sollte nicht mit der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe verwechselt werden. Wir betreiben ein sehr breites Gesch\u00e4ft: Wir verkaufen nicht nur Produkte, wir bieten auch Cloud-Dienste an, wir sind im Filmgesch\u00e4ft, es gibt Alexa. Wir sind auch in geographischer Hinsicht breit aufgestellt: in Amerika, Europa, Japan, Indien und in vielen anderen L\u00e4ndern. Es ist diese Breite, die uns gro\u00df erscheinen l\u00e4sst. In jedem unserer Gesch\u00e4ftsbereiche stehen wir aber in einem intensiven Wettbewerb mit etablierten Mitbewerbern.</p><p>Nicht wenige sind ja der Meinung, dass die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Tech-Unternehmen nicht gut ist f\u00fcr Innovationen und das Produktivit\u00e4tswachstum. Sind die Digitalkonzerne \u00fcberhaupt noch innovativ oder verlangsamen sie neue Entwicklungen inzwischen?</p><p>Ich bin viel unterwegs, \u00fcberall auf der Welt. Auf diesen Reisen kann ich heute so viel einfacher in Kontakt bleiben mit den Menschen, die ich liebe, etwa indem ich ihnen Bilder schicke, wo immer ich gerade bin. Und ich finde es unglaublich bequem, dass ich durch Tokio mit einer digitalen Karte laufen kann, die ich auch verstehe. Das war fr\u00fcher alles nicht so einfach m\u00f6glich.</p><p>Ist also alles gut mit Big-Tech?</p><p>Das hei\u00dft nicht, dass es keine Herausforderungen gibt in einer viel vernetzteren Welt. Aber das sollte uns doch nicht generell davon abhalten, Dinge weiter zu verbessern, Neues zu entwickeln und zu automatisieren. Nat\u00fcrlich kann ich verstehen, dass Menschen zuerst an den Arbeitsplatz der Kassierer denken, wenn wir L\u00e4den ohne Kasse entwickeln. Das ist eine nachvollziehbare Reaktion. Aber es ist ja nicht so, dass wir in den L\u00e4den keine Menschen besch\u00e4ftigen. Die Mitarbeiter f\u00fcllen die Regale auf, sie kochen, verpacken. Wir schaffen da viele Arbeitspl\u00e4tze. Wir machen es dem Kunden nur leichter, den Laden schneller zu verlassen.</p><p>Wie hat sich das Unternehmen in dieser Zeit gewandelt?</p><p>Viele der Kernelemente sind gleich geblieben, wie wir neue Projekte angehen zum Beispiel: Wir stellen uns vor, wie wir unseren Kunden ein fertiges Produkt erkl\u00e4ren werden, wenn wir es rausbringen. Wir gehen also am Anfang des Innovationsprozesses erst mal an sein Ende. Von da arbeiten wir r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts. Warum? So stellen wir sicher, dass wir den Kundennutzen nicht aus dem Auge verlieren. Das ist die DNA des Unternehmens. Wir wollen immer unseren Kunden dienen.</p><p>Wie hat sich der Gr\u00fcnder Jeff Bezos in dieser Zeit ver\u00e4ndert?</p><p>Jeffs Neugier war von Anfang an gro\u00df und ist geblieben. K\u00fcrzlich erst haben wir \"Neugierig bleiben und stetig Neues lernen\" in unsere F\u00fchrungsprinzipien aufgenommen. Und Jeff ist oft der wichtigste Anwalt unserer Kunden. Er unterst\u00fctzt uns, risikofreudig zu sein und neue Dinge zu versuchen und zu entwickeln. Er sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass Amazon ein guter Ort ist, um Fehler zu machen. Das ist seine Rolle. Das Unternehmen ist in der Zeit gr\u00f6\u00dfer und erwachsen geworden, das Team um ihn herum auch. Dadurch hat er mehr Zeit, sich genau um das zu k\u00fcmmern: ein guter Leader sein.</p><p>(======================= Linkliste =======================)</p><p>Sie sind in New York als Sohn italienischer Einwanderer aufgewachsen und vielleicht der europ\u00e4ischste in der Amazon-F\u00fchrung. M\u00fcssen Sie den anderen manchmal erkl\u00e4ren, wie Europa tickt?</p><p>Ja, manchmal. Aber das gilt nicht nur f\u00fcr Europa. F\u00fcr mich ist es eine der gr\u00f6\u00dften Herausforderungen, immer wieder neu zu verstehen, was unsere Kunden wollen, vor allem, da viele ja eine andere Sprache sprechen als ich. Auch innerhalb Europas gibt es Unterschiede. Manche erlauben Sonntagslieferungen, andere nicht. Und klar beeinflusst es dich, wenn du \u00fcberwiegend amerikanische Medien konsumierst. Vergangenes Jahr fragte jemand: Warum schw\u00e4chelt der Umsatz diese Woche? Und du antwortest: Es ist Fu\u00dfballweltmeisterschaft.</p><p>F.A.Z.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FAZNET-6322642</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FAZNET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS9-TM51-JB61-100D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">466502</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1246\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Alle Rechte Vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>FAZ.Net</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13436\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>Mittwoch 7.

Thank  you so much, and we'll see you in a few minutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday, November 13th, your top stories  right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets looking to rebound this morning after a serious selloff yesterday.   Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 95 points.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The market up about a third of a percent on the Dow, half a percent higher  on the S&amp;P, and about three quarters and percent higher on the NASDAQ with  a 49-point move this morning higher for NASDAQ.  </p><p>This after broad-based selloff yesterday for stock prices, Apple and  Goldman Sachs dragging down the Dow Industrials by better than 600 points  at the close.  </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly two percent on the session.  As you can see,  the NASDAQ the worst performer, down nearly three percent.  Apple leading  the charge in technology stocks lower yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning, also seeing a bit of a bounce.  The FT-100 is  up a fraction, 13 points higher there, 11 points higher on the CAC Quarante  in Paris, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 75, that's two-thirds of one  percent this morning.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances, as you see there.  Best performer in  China, up about one percent on the Shanghai Composite.</p><p>But the Nikkei Average in Japan down better than two percent overnight.</p><p>The picks are in, Amazon will soon call Long Island City, New York, and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the company's HQ2 selection  with the announcement coming as early as today.  </p><p>Amazon shares are up this morning, three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Raging wildfires in California.  This infernos -- the infernos are burning  a path of devastation.  The death toll now rising to nearly 50 people  between these massive fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KORY HONEA, SHERIFF, BUTTE COUNTY:  I understand that makes this the  deadliest fire in the history of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest and we will take you live to California  this morning.</p><p>There are new questions facing Boeing this morning.  A new report says the  jet-maker withheld information on the 737, the same model involved in the  deadly Indonesia crash last month.  </p><p>Boeing Chairman and CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, will join me in a Fox Business  exclusive this morning.  Stay with us for that exclusive coming up at 8:30  a.m. Eastern this morning.</p><p>Plus Tide detergent unveils new packaging, and it is going viral.  The  controversy coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner Mitch  Roschelle, and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, with us this  morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Cannot wait for that Boeing  interview.  That'll be fantastic.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that'll be good, because this is -- there are new  questions this morning, but at the same time, Boeing has been operating on  fire. </p><p>I mean, this company is seeing commercial airline business up strongly, the  defense business up strongly, and the stock has held up well.  </p><p>Of course, they are trading down in the month of October.  Like the other  defense contractors, they had a tough month. </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  It'll also be interesting because there are  some trade considerations with a company like Boeing.  Their rival Airbus  in Europe, so it'll be interesting to see what he has to say about that as  well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  And China is the number one market  for the business in terms of new planes and aerospace business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  We are at tend of earning season, which Lindsey will get  into.  Ninety percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, but we've got  retailers this week.  </p><p>Home Depot just came out with numbers beating on revenue and earnings per  share.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The numbers are on the screen right now.  The estimates call  for $2.26 a share.  The company is reporting earnings of $2.51 on revenue  of -- better than the estimate, which was 26.26 billion and here is the  renew estimate coming in better than expected at 23.6 billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Overall S&amp;P 500 earnings are up almost 29 percent from a  year ago.  The expectation going into the quarter was 22 percent, so it was  a terrific quarter on earnings.  </p><p>A lot misses on revenue, 40 percent of companies missing on revenue  expectations.  This was a beat.  We get Walmart later this week and some  other big retailers like a Macy's, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting to see this market performance, Lindsey, in  the face of 29 percent profit growth year over year.  </p><p>BELL:  I know.  And I think it's still like we always talk about, it's all  about the outlook.  The outlook was a little bit weaker than expected for  many companies as we looked forward to the fourth quarter and into 2019.  </p><p>There are rising raw material costs, the strong dollar certainly impacting,  but you and I was -- we're talking about that in the green room.  </p><p>And so expectations for growth in 2019 have been coming down.  All through  this year, we're looking for 10 percent earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p>Now we're at about eight and a half percent, which is still a very, very  good number, but there are still a lot of uncertainties out there with what  the fed's going to do, what's going to happen with trade, and then where is  the dollar going.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  What I -- what I like about the home improvement industry is  these are discretionary spends.  </p><p>BELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And it tells you something about the consumer, when they're  discretionarily spending on things.  You don't have to fix up your home,  you don't have to do home improvement, and when you do it, that's when the  customer feels strong.  </p><p>So, that may give us an indication of what the rest of the retail season  looks like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's also a really important focus on the consumer.  </p><p>This week, we will hear -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- as you said, from Walmart and Macy's tomorrow, but Home  Depot numbers' better than expected.  </p><p>As we worry about a growth slowdown, where is the consumer in that growth  slowdown?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, I mean you know what, I think the consumer remains  confident and higher interest rates aren't scaring them away from doing  home improvements.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is good because the home sales this year have been in kind  of a slow slide for much of -- much of the year in terms of declines in  home sales in consecutive months.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  Which is why Home Depot's stock hasn't done so well this year.   It's down about five percent year to date.  </p><p>These numbers look to be pretty strong, and we'll have to get into the  details.  But, you know, the concern is home sales have been weak, interest  rates are rising, are investors going -- are peep -- are consumers going to  invest in their homes and fixing them up?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you look at a market, like we saw yesterday, where Apple  was really the problem.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Down sharply.  And you wonder if that's indicator of slowdown.   People are worried about unit sales, worried about a slowdown in Apple.</p><p>This is the most important product that identifies really what we're  talking about in terms of consumer spending.  </p><p>What did you think about the market selloff yesterday?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that a lot of this is still a hangover from Apple  suddenly announcing that it's not going break out its unit sales because it  does look like they're trying to hide something, quite frankly.</p><p>And, you know, this was -- they act like that breaking out the unit sales  of these products isn't important today.  Well -- but -- you know, why was  it important then years ago when you -- when you launched the iPhone?</p><p>That's number one.  I'll just point out that stock is still up almost 15  percent year to date.</p><p>So it was roughly immune to what happened to, say, in Amazon in the month  of October when Amazon went into a full-blown bear market in that stock.  </p><p>Apple is still up, it's, you know, pretty -- seeing a pretty sharp decline  in the -- so far in November.  </p><p>But, again, still double-digit gain year to date.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's really indicative of the story overall, of the worry,  the story of this market.  We are worried about growth, worried that things  will turn down and you see a company like Apple and Home Depot really  indicative of the consumer.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And I think yesterday's action in Apple really did spook  especially tech investors because exactly to your point, Amazon's in bear- market territory.  Apple has been the value in the tech sector.  And it's  been able to hold up and support the group.  </p><p>And so if growth is slowing there, we -- do we have a bigger problem  overall?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was on a report about suppliers.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Two -- </p><p>BELL:  Two suppliers.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's another thing, the suppliers made guidance  warnings and, you know, you think thank back to what Dan Niles said a  couple of weeks ago with the inventory build-up.  </p><p>I mean he mentioned that Apple had inventories up 89 percent, quarter of a  quarter -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in the second quarter and that was an issue because if  you've got an economic slowdown and you've got people pulling back in terms  of spending, well, what are they going to do?</p><p>First, they're going to buy the inventory that they have.  Can they  actually get rid of all of that inventory?  </p><p>And if you see China slowing down, is China -- are the Chinese going to buy  a phone for a thousand dollars?  So, that's why Apple is such an important  indicator in terms of what's going on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will argue also that yesterday was kind of a delayed reaction  to that move-up in long-term interest rates last week where you saw the 10- year.  Every time -- and we've had this happen several times in the last  month or so.</p><p>Every time that 10-year treasury yield gets closer to 3.25 percent, because  it hit a new -- it was like a seven and a half year-high last week, that  rattles investors and the bond market was closed yesterday.  </p><p>But I think that that is definitely playing into, you know what, if longer- term interest rates are at three and a quarter, three and a half, you know,  those earnings, I need to pay a little bit less for those earnings way,  way, way out in the future on these big-growth companies.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, and that's a huge impact on the tech sector.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BELL:  Which is supposed to have the best earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let -- </p><p>BELL:  It has had the best growth in the past two years. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's zero in on this stock market and really what's going on  this morning.  Joining the conversation, we got the Chairman, President,  and CEO of Boeing here in studio this morning, Dennis Muilenburg.  </p><p>My special guest in the fact of this new report from the Journal on its  737.  </p><p>Louisiana Congressman and current House Majority Whip, Steve Scalise, joins  us with his reaction to the midterm elections and what can get done.</p><p>Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane  is with us this morning, along with the CEO of the Mayo Clinic, Dr. John  Noseworthy back with us as well.  </p><p>And Florida Congressman-elect, former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel  Michael Waltz, joining us as well.  A lot to talk about.  Big guest lineup  today, don't miss a moment of it.  </p><p>And of course we are watching markets this morning after that major selloff  yesterday driven by weakness in technology and Apple in familiar.  </p><p>Joining us now is Fort Pitt Capital Group Partner, Vice President, as well  as Senior Portfolio Manager, Kim Forrest.  Kim, good to see you.  Thanks  very much for joining us.  </p><p>Your reaction to the -- </p><p>KIM FORREST, VICE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FORT PITT CAPITAL  GROUP:  Thanks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the market selloff yesterday and what to do  now?</p><p>FORREST:  Sure.  Well, I think you guys covered it ably, you know.  All the  factors that you cited are just exactly in line with what I saw.  </p><p>The raise in interest rates, you know, made these higher price stocks a  little less desirable.  </p><p>I do think that Apple may not be something that the -- that is a great  thing about -- a great -- I don't know, point of data about how consumers  are spending because you did get those great Home Depot numbers.  </p><p>And I think Apple's its own little issue.  But that being beside that, I  think today is a tremendous opportunity if you have long-enough time  horizon -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FORREST:  -- to really look and see stocks that you may want to buy right  now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting you say Apple could have its own  issue.  I mentioned Dan Niles has been covering this company for years.  </p><p>FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  AlphaOne Capital Partners, he almost predicted this trouble for  Apple and the technology sector a month ago.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  I think you  absolutely are, and this is exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of  inventory out there.  </p><p>So, if you pick the biggest company in the world, Apple, for example, they  have 89 percent inventory growth year over year in the June quarter that  they reported.  Their revenues were up 17 percent.  </p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>Look at last year, they had one phone priced above a thousand dollars.   This holiday season, they have three phones priced above them.</p><p>The average selling price, they're trying to boost it by another hundred  dollars.  </p><p>The problem is, if you look at smartphone units overall, this will be the  first year in history that smartphone units are down year over year.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kim, you might say that Apple is its own specific story, but -- </p><p>FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- doesn't it feed on itself?  I mean if you've got a lot of  inventory out there in technology and you can't sell it because things are  slowing down, that's going to trickle into other retail and other tech.</p><p>FORREST:  Maybe.  We're going to put a big maybe there because here --  here's the issue, I look at tech very differently than a lot of analysts.   We're talking about Apple, which is almost solely consumer-oriented tech.  </p><p>I am really excited about more enterprise or business-related tech because  I think as wages are starting to go up, businesses have to once again think  about how do I make my employees more productive?  </p><p>And it's not by watching Netflix, it's not by, you know, participating on  Facebook and maybe it's not by buying Apple products.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>FORREST:  But still, semiconductors underlie this whole trend of making  people more productive through software and hardware -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>FORREST:  And it's delivered on semiconductors, so that's what I'm kind of  throwing out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>FORREST:  And I do think Apple is, you know, an issue in and of itself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  It is very high-priced products and maybe not everybody, you  know, needs to buy a new Apple phone every 18 months -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  -- like they have in the past.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about Amazon?  The Journal is reporting this morning  that the company is ready to choose New York City and Northern Virginia as  the new homes for Amazon's new headquarters.  </p><p>Kim, good or bad move on Amazon's part to split the second headquarters?   What do you think?  </p><p>FORREST:  Well, I really thought Pittsburgh was the winner here, but, you  know, we're going to leave that behind.</p><p>But, no, I think it's really smart, especially because it looks like  Amazon's going to have to develop its own in-house brands for clothing and  what better place than New York City to do that.</p><p>The Virginia aspect is kind of interesting, it's close to the government  and, you know, I think they need to address a whole lot of maybe regulatory  issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  So, you know, that makes a whole lot of sense there, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, just really quickly, I'm sure we'll get to this in the show,  but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has just been elected to Congress,  representing part of Queens, is calling in to question Amazon moving into  Queens.  </p><p>The idea of we receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a  time when our subway is crumbling out and our communities need more  investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here that -- </p><p>Well, we will just talk about that, because that shows a fundamental  misunderstanding of the way an economy works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a misunderstanding of what the whole point in giving  tax breaks to companies are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the whole point, is to lead to jobs.  </p><p>FORREST:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Twenty-five thousand jobs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you -- do you have a leave -- do you have a leave?  Because  that gives me a headache.  That economic analysis -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have an Advil for you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is just -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I might have an Advil for you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kim, thank you so much.  We will see you soon.  </p><p>FORREST:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're watching all of the above.  Kim Forrest joining us.   We'll take a break.  </p><p>When we come back, wild fires are out of control in California.  The  multiple blaze is burning across the state, becoming the deadliest in the  state history.  The very latest coming next.  </p><p>And then withholding data, new reports suggest Boeing did not share  potential problems with flight control systems.  It could have played a  role in the Lion Air jet crash next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  In Northern California, wild fire becoming the  deadliest in state history.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details right  now.  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  The  monster campfire has now killed at least 42 people in Northern California,  hundreds are still unaccounted for.  President Trump has approved a major  disaster declaration for the Golden State. </p><p>In Southern California, that's where you have the Woosley Fire that's  destroyed more than 400 homes and businesses.  That fire has killed at  least two people.  </p><p>Thousands of structures remain at risk, red-flag warning in effect for L.A.  and Ventura counties, and obviously the weather is not helping the  situation.</p><p>Well, Boeing reportedly withheld information on the Lion Air jet that  crashed in Indonesia last month, killing all 189 people on board.  </p><p>The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Boeing didn't tell airlines about  potential hazards in a new flight control feature on their 737 Max.  </p><p>The problem is that the system can push the plane's nose down so strongly  that pilots can't pull it back up.  The automated stall prevention system  is being investigated as playing a role in the crash.  </p><p>Shares of Boeing are up a quarter of one percent.  And premarket trading,  Maria, you will talk to Boeing Chairman, and CEO, President Dennis  Muilenburg.  That's at 8:30 this morning.  </p><p>Everybody stay tuned for that that.  </p><p>Well, fans worldwide are paying tribute to a real superhero.  Stan Lee, the  father of Spider-Man, The Hulk, Iron Man, and many other memorable comic  characters, died yesterday in Los Angeles.  </p><p>Lee was a legendary Writer and Publisher of Marvel Comics whose creations  revolutionized comic books.  </p><p>His comics were often turned into blockbuster movies, generating billions  of dollars worldwide. </p><p>Stanley dead at the age of 95.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Coming up next, midterm  madness.  More inconsistencies in the Florida recount process.  They are  popping up as the judge tells both sides to ramp down the rhetoric, that  and other races still not decided right after this break.  </p><p>And then a tidy box, this new design for Tide's detergent driving the  internet nuts this morning.  We will tell you why.  Stay with us on that.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching markets this morning after a big  selloff yesterday.  Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading this  morning.  </p><p>We are looking at a gain of about 145 points on the Dow Industrials, that's  two-thirds of one percent after a 600-point selloff yesterday.  </p><p>The S&amp;P is up 16, and the NASDAQ is up 60 points right now.</p><p>I want to turn to the midterm fallout.  New oversight, the hours on the  senate race has been called.  Kyrsten Sinema, becoming the first democrat  elected in 30 years.  </p><p>In Georgia, a judge extending the deadline to certify votes in the  governor's race there.  </p><p>Republican Brian Kemp is ahead by nearly 60,000 that votes right now, but  Democrat Stacey Abrams is filing a lawsuit to count rejected ballots.</p><p>And then in Florida, ballot drama, the recount is in full swing right now,  but large counties are scrambling to meet the deadline of Thursday.  </p><p>Fox News' Griff Jenkins is in Lauderhill, Florida.  He's at the Broward  County Office of Elections.</p><p>Griff, good morning to you.  </p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  </p><p>You may be watching the markets, but I'm watching ballots being separated  in Broward County.  Take a look at this.  The tabulation room, they still  have not begun the recount here.  </p><p>Now in 65 of Florida's 67 counties, they are either halfway done or even  more from the recount being done, but here in Palm Beach County, they're  far from it.  What they have to do is finish separating page one.  </p><p>Then they'll likely do a calibration of the machines and begin the actual  official tabulation recount.  That isn't expected any time before about  9:00 a.m. here so it's quite an issue as they race towards the Thursday  deadline to get those numbers in.  </p><p>But we were surprised, Maria, yesterday when the Election Supervisor here,  Dr. Brenda Snipes, came out, talked to the media, and addressed allegations  that she has made major mistakes this election, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRENDA SNIPES, SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS, BROWARD COUNTY:  The lawsuits, as  they are written, certainly cast dispersions on my character.  </p><p>I've have worked here for about 15 years and I have to say this is the  first time that this office or I have been under such attacks, so if we  make mistakes, we own mistakes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  Then the stunning development, FormerFlorida Governor, Jeb Bush,  tweeting that he believes Snipes failed to comply with the law in multiple  counts and called for her removal.  </p><p>Jeb was the one that appointed her in 2003 to replace the previous  supervisor who had to be removed for similar problems.  </p><p>Meanwhile, on the national level, Senator Nelson and Governor Scott trading  nasty barbs, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D), CALIFORNIA:  Scott cannot oversee this process in a  fair and impartial way, and thus he should remove himself from any role in  the recount process.</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  Our goal is that we follow the law.  We know  Brenda Snipes mixed illegal ballots with legal ballots.  We know they've  not let party officials in, the courts have said follow the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  If they do indeed get this recount started and meet that Thursday  deadline here in Broward County, Maria, lawyers tell me that they expect  the margin of error to be under that .25 percent and will be headed for a  hand recount after Thursday.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Griff, thank you much.  Griff Jenkins this morning on  that.  </p><p>This is an incredible story, that now we see that Sinema has actually won  in Arizona and these other two are so close.  </p><p>I mean, Georgia, 60,000 votes sounds like a lot, but she's still fighting  in Georgia, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She is still fighting in Georgia, so -- but the Republicans know  definitively that they will still have a 51-seat majority in the Senate,  that's the take away from that.</p><p>But in terms of what's going on down in Florida, there's a history in  Broward County of problems there.  </p><p>I just want to point that out because Brenda Snipes seems to suggest that  people are attacking her and her character, well, there have been glitches,  mistakes, and even illegal ballot destruction in her county under her  supervision.</p><p>The -- a court ruling found in May, Broward Election Supervisor Brenda  Snipes illegally destroyed ballots from a 2016 congressional race with  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was trying to push off this primary challenger,  Tim Canova.  </p><p>So again, there's a history of problems there and raises the issue of if  you were the steward of the county when these problems happened, why was  she still there going into the midterms?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why is she saying that she's been on this job 15 years and this  is the first time she's getting attacked when we know darn well that there  have been issues in the past?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think that Miami Herald and all the newspapers in the State  of Florida write about these problems often and so now that she's in the  national spotlight, maybe it feels a little bit different.  </p><p>But there are issues there and they're front and center during the  midterms.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Count and recount.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll keep following that.  </p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, searching for deal, Vice President  Pence is looking to set a trade agreement with japan that would serve as a  model for other countries.  </p><p>General Jack Keane is here, he will weigh on that.  </p><p>And then on precedence and security, as drug lord, El Chapo, sees his day  in a New York Court.  He will be here today in New York to face that.</p><p>The very latest straight ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures, indicating a bit of a bounce, this morning, after a sharp selloff  yesterday, Dow Industrials set to open up about 130 points that is one-half  of one percent, S&amp;P is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ with a gain of 57  points, good for gain of almost one percent out of the gate, this morning.  </p><p>This after the major indices took a big hit yesterday, a five percent  decline in Apple stock, took a chunk out of this market, that's a Dow  component and a NASDAQ component, the Dow was down 602 points at the close,  down better than two percent, S&amp;P was down about two percent, and the  NASDAQ with a 206-point selloff, was down almost 3 percent, yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the bouncing is continuing, the FT-100 is also  recovering along with stocks on Wall Street, that is up a quarter of a  percent, in London.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up almost half a percent  and the DAX Index in Germany, up three quarters of one percent, 87 points  higher.</p><p>Mixed performances in Asia, overnight, worst performer, Japan; Nikkei  Average down two percent, the Shanghai composite in China, up almost one  percent.</p><p>Crude oil slipping this morning, this after the price of oil closed lower,  yesterday, for 11 days in a row, the very latest on oil's bear market,  coming up.  It is down 20 percent from the highs, just 5 weeks ago.</p><p>Home Depot, reporting earnings this morning, they were better-than- expected, the improvement store out with double beat.  We will break it  down for you as the stock is up 2-1/4 percent, that's helping the Dow  Industrials for sure.</p><p>Zuckerberg won't go, the Facebook founder could be held in contempt after  declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.  And  another Tide controversy to report, the detergent's new packaging being  compared to a box of wine, we will get into all of that, coming up.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, mounting pressure on China,  Vice President Mike Pence headed to Singapore, to talk trade, with the  Association of the Southeast Asian Nations.  Speaking with Japanese Prime  Minister Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo, yesterday, the Vice President took a strong  stance on China, ahead of the President's meeting with President Xi, at the  end of the month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States seeks a  relationship with China that's based on fairness, reciprocity and respect  for sovereignty.  The difficulties that the United States and other nations  face with China have been well documented by our administration.  And China  knows where we stand.</p><p>Nevertheless, President Trump is looking forward to his meeting with  President Xi, in Argentina.  He believes that progress could be made, but  either way, we're confident that the United States remains in a strong  position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that is FOX News  Strategic Senior Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to see  this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to  see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you were just in Singapore, a few months ago, meeting with  leadership there, your take on the Vice President's comments and how  Singapore and the U.S. can team up here?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, yes, they're very concerned.  I just came back from Vietnam  this weekend also, they are very concerned about what China has been doing  in the region for years, and largely getting away with it.  You know,  because, the United States had never truly engaged competitively against  China.</p><p>And they think that we have a long way to make up for it, but they truly  appreciate the fact that the United States is back in the game, so to  speak, and they're pushing back on China's economic and political warfare  and also their militarization, particularly, the South China Sea.</p><p>And I think Vice President Pence's Seminole speech, a few weeks ago, on  China, caught everybody's attention in the Indo-Pacific.  And that was a  huge step forward for the United States, but most importantly for our  relationship with our allies.</p><p>So, I think Vice President Pence will be very welcome by the ASEAN leaders,  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and I think he will get positive  feedbacks for the fact that President Trump is, once again, exercising  American leadership in the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General, the President really has to walk a balance here,  because while pushing back on China, trying to get them to change their  behavior, it also could impact business.  We've got the CEO of Boeing  coming in here, this morning, to talk about his business.  In the coming  year and years, one in four or five planes made at Boeing, will go to  China.</p><p>This is the second largest market for Boeing, and that's just in the  aerospace maker, I mean, there are tons of other companies, as well,  looking to China for opportunities, so how does the President walk that  balance?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I think, there has to be a balance.  Listen, clearly, China  is a major market and American businesses will continue to do work there,  to be sure, but I think what the President has done and illuminated the  issue in trying to find the balance and stop stealing our intellectual  property, stop -- </p><p>If you have to do business in China, as you well know, Maria, you've got to  enter into a joint venture with them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  That's not the way we do business in Europe or in the Middle East,  and as a result to that joint venture, they get access to our intellectual  property.  That's got to stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.</p><p>KEANE:  So, I think -- I think if we continue to do business, that's fine,  but let's get it on a balance table where it's much more equitable and it's  kind of the way we do business in other parts of the world.  I will tell  you this, a lot of the supply chain that exists in China, and from American  businesses and other businesses are looking to go elsewhere.</p><p>And in Vietnam, that I just came back from, they are reaping some of the  benefits of that, as will other nations in the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean -- I guess business has been dealing with, you  know, succumbing to China and handing over their technology and going by  their rules for so long that they forgot how unfair it was.  Look, the  other major point in the Vice President's statement yesterday, was on North  Korea.  Watch this, got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE:  The President has made it clear that the time for implementing the  agreement is not a driving factor.  And as I assured you, Mr. Prime  Minister, the pressure campaign will continue, the sanctions will remain in  full force, until we achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of  North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New satellite images reportedly show that North Korea is moving  ahead with its nuclear program after Kim Jong-un's agreement with President  Trump, so your take on these developments, General?  What now?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, the Vice President's visit to Japan and talking  to Prime Minister Abe, I will tell you what, he got an earful from him  because that's the person that President Trump do talks in any other world  leader and he truly gives him very good perspective on what's going on in  North Korea and China.</p><p>Listen, the North Koreans, in principle, have agreed to denuclearized, in  fact, they have not taken a single step to do that.  What we wanted out of  the box was; one, give us an inventory of all of your sites and your  weapons themselves, two, give us a plan to destroy and disarm ballistic  missiles and nuclear weapons that has not happened.</p><p>And what we have to stay focused on, is the third thing, there's not been a  single ballistic missile or nuclear weapon that has been disarmed or  destroyed.  So while this progress on the fringes and there are a lot of  positive statements, the reality is, in terms of what needs to be done,  there hasn't been any substantive progress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And for the U.S., what does that mean?  Should the U.S. be  doing something different in terms of our strategy to get the  denuclearization back on track?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, that's a great question, and certainly that's something that  the National Security team of this administration is working on.  I would  suggest, one, we've got to -- we've got to get tough on China because  they've opened the aperture on the sanctions, and some of that backdoors  are happening.</p><p>The Russians have always backdoored North Korea.  We're not going to make  any progress with them.  The State Department has to make certain that the  other nations are not giving up, there's no missiles flying, there's no  tests being taken, there's a -- there's no sense of a crisis, so we have to  make sure the other countries are enforcing the sanctions.</p><p>And we've got to up our game ourselves and we can do that militarily, start  moving some things into the region, make sure that they know that we're  dead serious, it's either you give us the weapons, Mr. Chairman of North  Korea, or we're going to come take the weapons, that's the deal that's on  the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask you about oil, in that vein, President  Trump took aim at Saudi Arabia yesterday, after reports that the country  plans to cut oil production.  The President tweeted this yesterday,  hopefully Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production.  Oil  prices should be much lower based on supply.</p><p>Look, we know, General, that the U.S. has become one of the leading  producers at this point, and now, with the Saudis and OPEC, wanting to cut  production, they're trying to boost prices because it's in a bear market  right now, 20 percent lower from the highs.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  Well, this consensus in the last OPEC meeting, even the so- called Russian cartel, you know, they felt it was going to be a cutback  obviously, in Iranian crude, on the market and as a result of that, the  Russian cartel increased prices, but then this consensus developing now,  that there's going to be an oversupply in 2019.</p><p>I suspect -- the Saudis have made a decision to cut -- I think OPEC will  cut next month, in Vienna, and the Russians will likely follow suit.   That's the path that we are on.  I don't think there's anything that's  going to change it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have been expecting a change in Homeland Security.  I know  that the Washington Post is reporting that Kirstjen Nielsen, Homeland  Security Secretary, is out, and I was hearing the same thing actually, that  they've already had the discussion.</p><p>My sources told me that they've already had the conversation that the  Secretary is going to be out of that job in -- as the President changes its  administration after the midterms, your thoughts on Kirstjen Nielsen being  out?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I don't know anything about that, on the inside, honestly.   But I do know what I'm looking at and clearly, the administration has got  to be very frustrated with the open border that we have because there are  hundreds of people coming through every week, who are coming, seeking  asylum, and we have to release them.</p><p>And that's what's happening, because our system is so backed up with people  who are waiting to be processed.  The so-called catch and release, it's  hundreds, happening every week.  We are focused on the caravan to be sure,  but the equivalent to a caravan, is happening every month.</p><p>And that's got the administration's focus because they get daily reports on  all of this, and I think they are just genuinely dissatisfied with where  things are.  Certainly, the Congress is part of this problem, but it's not  the only part of the problem.  And I think that's likely what's driving the  replacements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the President -- the President cancelled the trip this  week, with Kirstjen Nielsen, to the southern border, in Texas.  Now,  that's, I guess, the Washington Post is saying this is the impetus.  But,  you know, as you say, he's been very frustrated with her, because of the  open borders, but she says it's a Congress problem.  She can't do anything  different because this is the law, General.</p><p>So, the President's frustrated with the person who is in the job, but  doesn't -- aren't her hands tied?</p><p>KEANE:  Her hands are somewhat tied.  But I suspect, now, this is just  speculation on my part, I suspect that the President has received some  advice from other advisers who are saying there are some other options that  we could be putting into play here, and certainly, having resources to cope  with the problem.</p><p>So we're not catching and release, would likely be a start.  And  increasingly, how we process these people in getting their hearings, would  be another part of the puzzle.  I just suspect that over time, there's been  a loss of confidence here if what you're reporting is accurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  There is going to be a replacement.  I think it's largely  immigration issue.  I don't even think it has to do with -- it's one of the  largest -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you're right.</p><p>KEANE:  departments in government.  I don't think that has to do with  anything else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  It's totally the immigration issue, 100  percent, that's what I'm hearing.  But real quick, General, before you go,  any thoughts on who might replace her?</p><p>KEANE:  No, I have no idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so  much.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As always, General Jack Keane, joining us there.  Coming up,  Zuckerberg skips out, why the Facebook founder could be held in contempt,  after declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.   And then, first Tide pods, now this, the internet goes crazy over Tide's  new detergent design, it looks like a case of boxed wine, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The trial of El Chapo set to begin today in New  York.  Lauren Simonetti with the details now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  The notorious Mexican drug lord will be in a Brooklyn federal  court this morning with unprecedented security for the jurors and for  Joaquin El Chapo Guzman himself.  Security will include snipers perched on  rooftops and an armored vehicle to transport Guzman.  He's accused of  spending quarter century smuggling more than 150 tons of cocaine into the  U.S.  He was extradited from Mexico last year after escaping prison two  times.  The trial expected to last more than four months.  Prosecutors say,  the evidence will include the testimony of over a dozen witnesses.  </p><p>Well, a Canadian politician says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be held  in contempt after he refused to appear before an international panel of  five governments that are investigating the company.  That politicians says  he might issue subpoena forcing Zuckerberg to appear before Canada's  parliament.  Zuckerberg had rejected an earlier request to appear before an  international grand committee looking into disinformation and election  meddling.  Facebook not commenting, shares of the company up $1.23 this  morning.</p><p>Well, Procter &amp; Gamble may have another packaging problem.  The company  debut its eco-box, which happens to look a lot like a wine box but that new  Tide box is generating some buzz on Twitter.  This is what one user wrote:  \"You all don't want kids eating Tide pods but when you make a wine box  tide, what do you want from me?  Well, he was referring to the Tide pod  challenge last year when teenagers were daring each other to eat the  detergent pods but would you drink the Tide wine?  I don't know, I hope  that's not an adult challenge coming up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a crazy story.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were eating the pods.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But looks like a wine box, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It does.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I have freshman in college, and I'm frightened right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Where do you think that stuff happens, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a keg, not a wine box.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, owing the best for your friends; how Petco plans to  provide your pet with only health foods.  That's next, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, President Trump just tweeting this, we want to  get this out: \"Emmanuel Macron suggesting building its own army to protect  Europe against the United States, China and Russia, but it was Germany in  World Wars I and 2.  How did that work for France?  They're starting to  learn German in Paris before U.S. came along.  Pay for NATO or not!\"  The  president taking about his meetings and NATO pay your fair share, once  again, this morning.  </p><p>Meanwhile there's this, putting your pet first which we all do here on this  program.  Petco becomes the only major retailer of pet supplies to ensure  healthy food for your furry family members.  In a first on Fox Business  announcement, the company is revealing it will not sell foods or treats  containing artificial colors, flavors and preservatives for dogs and cats  by May of 2019.  Joining us right is the CEO of Petco, Ron Couglin, and  it's good to see you, Ron.  </p><p>RON COUGHLIN, CEO, PETCO:  It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  I was telling you during  commercial break, I only used to serve Ellabela steamed string beans as  treats and she died at almost 18 years old.  She lived a long and strong  life as a result.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  You what's amazing, over 50 percent of pet owners, cook for  their pets.  We were talking about it earlier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Only 50 percent.</p><p>COUGHLIN:  Over 50 percent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  And we're bringing human grade food actually into Petco shortly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about what you're doing?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Yes.  So, the big announcement today is that we're going to be  eliminating all cat and dog foods and treats with artificial flavors,  artificial colors, artificial preservatives.  You know, if you think about  the bet we love, do we want ethanol to be served to them, do we want sulfur  dioxide, do we want (INAUDIBLE), so the answer is no.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And those are in most pet foods?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Those are in certain pet foods.  Now, the reality is, Petco has  been weening off those products, other companies have much higher percent  of those foods.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, Charlie and Ramon don't eat those, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, they eat a food that you can't buy at Petco.  They eat blue  buffalo basic, limited ingredient, grain-free canned food and also -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And also, I.D. which is prescription and you're going to begin  to sell prescription dog food. </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  This week, we started doing prescription dog food  on Petco.com.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, big response from customers?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Yes, we've seen response thus far, but today is our announcement  day, so we're very proud of it.  It's big deal for the industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's higher premium that people will pay.  It's amazing  to me how much money people spend on their dogs and their cats.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anything -- most of my dogs have gastro, severe gastro  intestinal problems, so anything to keep them healthy but you were talking  about -- you're going to actually start selling cooked food, literally  human food for animals?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, humanization is one of the biggest trends,  folks like you but you don't always have time.  So, what we're going to do  is we're partnered with company called Just Food for Dogs, and we actually  are going to have kitchens.  Union Scare, right here, is going to have a  kitchen where we cook for your dog; you can come in and get fresh food  every day for your dog.  My dog right now is having salmon and sweet  potatoes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Lucky dog.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  So, if you're having salmon and sweet potatoes, your pet should  have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And does this make a difference in the dog's life?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Absolutely, it's all vet-driven mixtures.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can't feed them too much, though, because they'll get fat  and that's a huge problem, obesity in animals.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Ron, real quick, we've been talking about the Petco Foundation,  maybe a little bit on that.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, we're very proud of the Petco Foundation,  especially in times and of hurricanes, fires, et cetera.  We go in and take  care of the pets, we give free food, we give funding to the shelters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Ron.  That's fantastic.  Great, check out  Petco.  Ron Coughlin, thank you for joining us.  Still ahead, a diamond fit  for a ring, we will show you more of this ring designed by Apple's chief  designer; it's made entirely out of diamond, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Great to see  everybody this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for being here after a huge day yesterday in  markets.  Look, we're in a good earnings period, Lindsey, and yet the  market trades down 600 points on these growth concerns.  What's going on?  </p><p>BELL:  Yes. Growth is the big question mark for 2019.  Look, we're cycling  the tax reform package, fiscal stimulus is coming to a peak right now as we  look out to 2019, interest rates are rising.  It seems like global growth  could be slowing especially with China.</p><p>So the question is where do earnings go from here?  We're looking right now  at 8.5 percent growth for 2019, that's down from 10 percent that we saw all  through earlier this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Revenue?  </p><p>BELL:  Revenue, it actually ticked up a slight bit to 6.3 percent which is  pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about earnings of 10 percent.  </p><p>BELL:  Earnings of 8.5 percent for 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  </p><p>BELL:  Came down -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's way down.  No wonder markets are upset about things  slowing down.  For 2018 -- talking about earnings being up 25 percent;  going down to 8 percent in 2019.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  But so much of that was a one-timer from tax  reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think what the market isn't really fully digesting is the  forward guidance is in a new tax regime year over year mode.  And a lot of  people looking at the difference between the 20 plus percent earnings  growth in '18 and then less than 10 percent in '19 and they're having a  hard time digesting it.</p><p>We should put like -- maybe they should just watch this show and hear us  say this enough.  Because there's really no reason to freak out.  These are  still strong earnings numbers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  But a lot of this, I would  argue, is higher interest rates and the Federal Reserve still in the  process of winding down that multitrillion dollar balance sheet where  you've seen a deflation in assets, not just in the stock market, in the  last six weeks or so.</p><p>But look at what oil has done, down 11 days in a row.  That is a record  streak for declines in the cost of crude oil.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are a lot of things at play, maybe actual supply and  demand fundamentals, but also money just coming out of this was clearly an  over-inflated asset.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Apple, we'll talk about that.  What do the  price of oil and Apple tell you about the broader economy.</p><p>Coming up, my exclusive interview this morning with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk to him about what he's  seeing in the global economy, of course, commercial aerospace has been on  fire.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, House majority whip and Louisiana  Congressman Steve Scalise is here.  He's out with a new book.  Congressman- Elect Michael Waltz will join us, Green Beret.  And the CEO of the Mayo  Clinic is back, Dr. John Noseworthy, with some news today.  The host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney here as well.</p><p>We've got a big two hours coming up.  Don't miss a moment of it because we  are reporting this morning the news of the day.</p><p>Our top story right now is that sharp selloff in stocks.  Futures are  higher this morning as the technology sector tries to recover from a sharp  decline yesterday.  It pulled the markets lower, knocking off more than 600  points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>Yesterday it was a sharp selloff and Apple really drove things, drove a  technology slump.</p><p>Now today, this morning it is unchanged after taking a hit amid fresh  concerns over the demand for the iPhone.</p><p>Joining us right now is Scott Martin.  He is Kingsview Asset Management  CIO.  Scott -- good to see you this morning.  I know you've had your share  of worries out there for markets.  Is yesterday's performance telling us  anything about what's ahead?  </p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Probably.  You know, you're  right, Maria -- without the markets I've got enough to worry about.  So  thank you markets for making that even more compounded.  </p><p>Listen, I love what you guys talked about there in the intro to the hour.   Lindsey is absolutely right.  You know, the revenue numbers estimates have  come down, the earnings estimates have come down.</p><p>Mitch is right, too.  You know, guys -- I started some meditation over the  last couple of weeks so you should definitely try that at home, kids.  I  think that has helped me with some of the worries -- Maria.</p><p>And the market needs stop freaking out.  You know, that's the thing like --  kind of like they say in the meditation, be calm because even though  earnings like you said, Maria, and you pointed out astutely are not growing  at 20 plus percent, guess what, kids -- that was unsustainable.  I mean  those weren't numbers that we're going to keep repeating.</p><p>But the market maybe got fooled into thinking that or let's just say we got  valuation metrics that seemed to be aligned with the thinking that that was  going to continue.</p><p>So as we alight or let's say descend back to reasonable numbers and  reasonable economic growth expectation, Lindsey mentioned interest rates  going up and so forth, the market needs to settle into some price here and  then I think it can rebuild some of these losses.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Scott, is there -- if you want to be defensive or if you want  to stay in the market but not have to meditate and do yoga to stay calm --  where's the place to be right now?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, and I haven't found any good yoga or meditation stocks yet,  Mitch, but I'm still looking for them.  You know, there are places to be  and that's a great thing to point out, you know.  This is not a total  freak-out selloff, even kind of like we saw in February just yet or even  like we saw over Brexit or even like we saw, you know, back in the late  2000s, you know, 2008 and so on, because there are things that are working,  specifically -- and we haven't bought enough of this stuff yet but we're  accruing it.</p><p>Look at consumer staples, look at real estate.  Look at utilities.  You  know, if interest rates come down because people like say with the freak- out, you know, they freak-out and they buy bonds, they buy fixed income  instruments and that drives down interest rates.  Some of these interest  rate sensitive names tend to hang in there when equity markets go like they  did yesterday.  </p><p>So Mitch -- I would say those are three good sectors for the individual  investors at home to look at that we start to pick up as well that have  started to mitigate some of the volatility.  </p><p>BELL:  Hey -- Scotty.  So you mentioned a lot of defensive sectors there  which as you rightly point out they've been doing well more recently.  But  what hasn't been doing well is tech.  and that is what led the market over  the past two years.  </p><p>Right now you have two -- three quarters of the S&amp;P 500 tech sector in bear  market territory.  Do we need the tech sector though to continue to move  this bull market higher?  </p><p>MARTIN:  We need something to, Lindsey and I'll tell you that's the  interesting point is you had these great leadership names -- you know, your  favorite ones and ones we still own.  You know, Google, Apple, Microsoft,  Amazon, Netflix, Whatever, Broadcom, Adobe -- great companies that were  crushing earnings and getting high valuations, again like we talked about  that were probably undeserved. </p><p>And now Lindsey -- the market has no leadership, you know.  Everybody has  been calling in the so-called experts, have said, oh my gods, this is the  time for financials because the Fed is hiking interest rates.  When the  reality for the most part, they were just flattening the interest rate  curve.</p><p>And so to me, it needs leadership.  I don't know if it's tech necessarily.   I was hoping for a while there it was going to be industrials because we  were hopefully going to get some of these trade deals reworked and more in  our favor and that was going to work out for some of the companies like  Deere, Caterpillar and some of the other ones we own.</p><p>But maybe it's health care.  That gets worked out with you know, maybe a  bipartisan congress.  Who knows?  But I think you're right, Lindsey.  It  doesn't necessarily have to be tech but it has to be some leadership in  some other sector to take the reins of this market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about financials?  I mean that's probably tough  because you've got higher rates going on.  Tech is where the growth has  been.  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  Higher rates are interesting, Maria -- because even though  the fed's been hiking interest rates, rates did get a nice boost as we saw,  you know, into October and then they've kind of fallen off a bit.  I mean  look at, you know, last week we were at 3.25 again on the 10 year and now I  think I checked this morning we're at 3.15.</p><p>So, you know,, financials kind of remind me of all the girls that turned me  down in high school.  I had to bring that up.  Because they're never there,  you know.  Like financials every year we hear somebody make this bold call  on financials being there and being the one, and they're never doing it.</p><p>So to me I'm not ready to give up on financials but as far as overweighting  financials, I won't do that either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what about Amazon, the split decision expected to divide  its second headquarters between evenly between New York City and northern  Virginia.  According to the Journal this morning, the announcement is  probably -- could come as early as today.</p><p>Is this a smart decision?  What are your thoughts here?  Would you put new  money to work in this market right here?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, we would.  I would slowly start weighting it again.  I don't  think that, you know, you have to jump in on a day like today where, you  know, we had a little bit of mixed trading overseas, especially in the  Nikkei, for example as you pointed out all morning.  And we've got a little  bit of a bounce today.</p><p>But I mean guys, even Eli Manning had a decent football game last night.   So the market can bounce just like that as well.</p><p>But I think Maria -- there's some levels that are coming into play here  that are decent as far as some of these tech names that have sold off 20,  25 percent.  So I think you can start weighting in here with some money but  just have a quick kind of hook on it if things start to get worse again  because you may get some lower prices.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Scott always a pleasure.   Thanks so much for weighing in here.</p><p>MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scott Martin joining us there.</p><p>Turning to the devastation in California right now, the wildfires are  becoming the deadliest in state history.  Fox News' Ray Bogan is in Ventura  County this morning with the very latest.  Good morning to you -- ray.  </p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Maria -- good morning.  </p><p>We're at the incident command center for the Woolsey and Hill Fires where  in just a couple of hours, hundreds of firefighters will arrive to get  their morning briefing.  They're working 24 hour shifts.</p><p>In the meantime, some of them are sleeping in tents.  One man is even over  to my left in a sleeping bag.</p><p>Now, in northern California, investigators are looking into whether a  sparking PG&amp;E power line may have started the Camp Fire which has become  the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state's history.  42 people  have died.  They've been found in their homes and cars as they were trying  to escape. </p><p>At last update, the fire was 30 percent contained and Cal Fire doesn't  expect to have full containment for another week.  Nearly 6,500 homes have  been destroyed, including some belonging to firefighters and their  families.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID HAWKE, PARADISE FIRE CHIEF:  It's just absolutely heart-breaking to  drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.  My family lost  their home in the fire.  My parents did.  My grandmother did.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOGAN:  Now, here in southern California, the Woolsey Fire at last update  was 93,000 acres and 30 percent contained.  Firefighters estimate more than  400 buildings have been destroyed.</p><p>In both fires crews are working against dry, windy conditions and steep  terrain but California is getting help.  President Trump has approved a  major disaster declaration and in addition, Cal Fire is thanking 17 state  partners that have come from as far as Alaska and Georgia.  Maria, back to  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Ray.  Thank you so much.  We will follow this.  And  this is an incredibly devastating story.  Ray -- thank you.  Ray Bogan  there.  </p><p>Coming up, concerns in the sky.  The new report that Boeing withheld  information on its 737.  The same model involved in the deadly Indonesia  crash last month.  I'll speaking exclusively with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing this morning.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk about that  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern and also get his take on the on the commercial  aerospace boom he's been seeing.  Over the last few years.</p><p>Then an injury on the court, the details after a player's gruesome leg  injury leaves some in tears, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New information coming to light this morning following last month's crash  of a Boeing jet in Indonesia.  Lauren Simonetti with the Details now --  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hi -- Maria, Boeing reportedly withheld  information on the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max which killed all 189 people  on-board that day.  Safety experts and others telling the \"Wall Street  Journal\" that Boeing didn't tell airlines about potential hazards in their  new flight control feature on that plane.  The problem is that the system  can push the plane's nose down so strongly that pilots can't pull it back  up.</p><p>The automated stall prevention system is being investigated as playing a  role in that Lion Air crash.  Shares of Boeing trading up a quarter of a  percent, $358.  And programming note -- Maria will sit down with Boeing's  chairman, CEO and president Dennis Muilenburg in the next hour on Morning's  with Maria, 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Well, the Labor Department is trying to help people save money and curb  401-k cash-outs.  The department could soon allow companies to  automatically transfer (INAUDIBLE) accounts of $5,000 or less belonging to  employees who change jobs to the 401-k plan of their new employers.  It's  the effort to cut down on the premature flow of money out of retirement  plans.  Research shows that as many as 80 percent of people leaving jobs  with less than $5,000 in those accounts eventually cash out of them.</p><p>Well, check this out.  Apple's head designer, Johnnie Ives, has taken on a  project more elegant than your iPhone.  He designed a ring carved from a  single chunk of diamond.  It could sell for a quarter million dollars at an  auction at Sotheby's.  Sotheby's says the ring has up to 3,000 facets,  never seen before on a single piece.  It will be made to fit the buyer, up  to a size 5, which is actually pretty small.  All of those proceeds going  to charity.  But most designers start with the metal.  Johnnie Ives took  the metal out of the equation and started with the diamonds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow -- so it's all diamond all around.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All diamonds -- Baby.  And diamonds are my birth stone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they are a girl's best friend.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can hear the woman.  How are they supposed to know it's  diamonds?  You know, you can't tell.  Sorry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  All right.  Thank you -- Lauren.</p><p>Coming up, the state of health care in America.  The CEO of the Mayo Clinic  Dr. John Noseworthy is here.  He's weighing in on the industry innovations,  plus an exclusive announcement that will change health care, certainly at  the Mayo Clinic -- that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A major investment in the future of health care in America.   The Mayo Clinic School of Medicine receiving a $200 million gift from  philanthropist Jay Alix, the largest ever made to the clinic.</p><p>Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive are Alix Partners founder  Jay Alix and Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. John Noseworthy.  Great to see you both.   Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JAY ALIX, FOUNDER, ALIX PARTNERS:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p>DR. JOHN NOSEWORTHY, CEO, MAYO CLINIC:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Jay -- what a gift.  Congratulations to you that you're  able to do such a thing for the Mayo Clinic.  </p><p>ALIX:  Absolutely.</p><p>You know, Mayo is such a he deserving institution.  The medical school is  one of the top ranked medical schools in the country.  And to be able to be  involved with them, to help them with their mission is just a really great  opportunity for us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is going to help the medical school a lot, Dr.  Noseworthy.  And you're also going to be able to attract new talent with  this.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  Thanks -- Maria.  Yes, this is really going to help us a great  deal, attract the best students from all over the world, from all  backgrounds regardless of their ability to pay for medical education. </p><p>And it will help us with new curriculum and dual degrees and innovative  ways of teaching and technology and all those good things.  It's a  wonderful gift.  We're really grateful to Jay.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are now going to be on the board.</p><p>ALIX:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you want to see from the Mayo Clinic and how this  money could be best used.  </p><p>ALIX:  Well, what this gift is about is really helping attract the best  students for the medical school, to train the doctors of the future.  The  country is facing a crisis that we're going to need probably 110,000  doctors in the next 10 years that we don't have today and we don't know  where they're going to come from.</p><p>So we need to train more doctors and we have to provide the money and the  support and the scholarship to help those students get into medical school  and have the country have the right doctors in the future.  Mayo can do  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  It was major issue in this past election,  everybody said that health care was the number one matter that was very  important to voters.  The Democrats taking the House in the midterm  elections.  And they say one of the priorities is health care in America.</p><p>So John -- tell us where the needs are right now.  Tell us what your view  is in terms of what needs to be done to take health care up to the next  level.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  So the majority of Americans are concerned about access,  coverage, and the cost of health care and the need for transparency to  drive down the cost but also improve the outcomes.  And we support all of  that.</p><p>From Mayo Clinic's perspective, it's more than cost.  It's certainly cost  but it's also outcomes and the performance and how well health care  performs.  And at Mayo Clinic we're all about serious and complex illness  and how to finance as quickly and effectively and provide patients with the  best possible care.</p><p>So the doctors of the future are going to have to deal with transparency,  coverage cost, access, technology, how to drive the safest and highest  technology, most affordable health care system which we don't have at the  moment, as you know.  We're tied to these election cycles every two years.   So it's this and that and this and that and until the country decides that  it's really a priority for the citizens, we're not going to get that long- lasting answer that we need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you talk about outcomes.  You know, we've been all about  prevention these last several years, talking about getting ahead of  disease.  How might that money be used toward getting ahead of disease and  when you look at the needs in this country today.  I mean I know we haven't  done enough work or we need more money for Alzheimer's, for example.  And  you know, issues related to the brain.  Where are the needs in that regard?  </p><p>ALIX:  Well, I think we have really leading edge technologies now.  We have  artificial intelligence coming online.  What A.I. is going to do for  medicine and the digitization of medical, you know, personal health data is  going to revolutionize how we can do diagnosis.  And of course with it, you  know, early intervention, diagnosis and prevention we can really change  outcomes for all people who have serious complex medical problems.  And  Mayo is leading the way on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you made because A.I. is  able to work with doctors to improve the outcomes.  Isn't that right?  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  That's absolutely right.  And I think it's also prediction.   It's early diagnosis but it's also predictive genomics, if you will.   Knowing what we know about people, who is likely to be at risk for this or  that so you can diagnose it early.  It's all of that together.  </p><p>And the young kids who want to do medicine, want to have a life of service,  they need to have that kind of an education to prepare them for that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What have you done differently in terms of A.I. at the clinic?  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  We have well over 100 projects trying to predict how to read  x-rays better, how to predict from genomics, how things will play out.   We're working into everyday life at Mayo Clinic, monitoring patients'  hearts, who is at risk for heart disease, that sort of thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this money will go toward getting new students who will be  looking at A.I. as part of their curriculum, very different than the  doctors in the past.  </p><p>ALIX:  Exactly.  Medical education is going to have to evolve quickly now  and keep up the new technologies, new breakthroughs in science and apply it  right into the clinic for people.  Mayo Clinic can lead the way on that  with this gift and with the research and development it has.</p><p>Mayo has three shields with clinical care, education and research and the  combination of all those three working together is what this gift will  allow Mayo to do.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  We'll be offering a masters of artificial intelligence.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Masters of A.I. </p><p>NOSEWORTHTY:  Masters of A.I. and masters of regenerative science, and  masters of advanced biotechnology and bioengineering.  All of these, the  new wave will be right in the curriculum plus the (INAUDIBLE) start willing  to spend say an extra year to get that additional training.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we go, where have you seen the most progress in terms of  outcomes in terms of disease?  Is it cancer?  Is it somewhere else?  Heart  disease?  Where have you seen the biggest -- </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  I think it's in all the serious illnesses -- Maria.  We're  actually measuring outcomes much better, the quantitation of outcomes,  quality of life, life expectancy, readmission to hospital, all of those  things that are now being put on score cards to see what is the investment  to health care doing to reduce the costs and prove the outcome so that  quantitative outcomes research, it's still in its infancy, but it's  absolutely critical if we're going to have the best health care system in  the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And particularly as you see spending from the NIH  dropping, you need private investors and private practitioners to come in  and help the situation. </p><p>And here comes you-- Jay Alix.  Thank you so much.  Great to see you both.   Thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>ALIX:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. John Noseworthy and Jay Alix joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Congress returns to Washington.

And it is Tuesday, November 13th,  your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures are indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning after a  sharp selloff yesterday.  The Dow Industrials set to be up 150 points right  out of the gate, that's two thirds of one percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up 17  right now and the NASDAQ is up 57 points, that's almost one percent higher.  </p><p>This after the major indices took a sharp hit yesterday, five percent  decline in the Dow and the NASDAQ component Apple, that took a chunk out of  markets with Apple down five percent, the Dow was down 2-1/3 percent and  the NASDAQ was down almost three percent at the close yesterday.  S&amp;P 500  with a decline of 55 points, down almost two percent.  </p><p>Well, that was then this morning we're seeing a bounce in the U.S. and  Europe.  FT-100 is up a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante is up a half a  percent and the DAX Index in Germany is up almost one percent.  </p><p>Mixed performances in Asia overnight to report.  Nikkei Average worst  performer in Japan, down about two percent.  The Shanghai Composite was the  winner up about one percent.  </p><p>Crude oil continues to slide this morning, take a look at the price, down  another two percent after oil closed lower yesterday for 11 days in a row,  we are looking at a bear market here.  It is down 20 percent from the highs  in just the last five weeks.  What does that tell us?  </p><p>Earnings out today, Home Depot with a double beat earlier this morning, the  stock is up 2-1/2 percent on better than expected earnings and revenue at  Home Depot. </p><p>Meanwhile, back in session, Congress returns to Washington today for the  first time since Democrats won the House in the midterm elections.  What  the divided House will mean for your wallet coming up. </p><p>And tragedy on the court, a star Nets player suffered a gruesome ankle  injury in last night's game.  We'll have the details coming up this  morning.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, Congress returning to  Washington today to a new political landscape.  I spoke with House Majority  leader Kevin McCarthy this weekend along with Congressman David Cicilline  on Democrats the \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" program about the agenda going  forward.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Well, we'll want to  find common ground.  We will look to make sure we continue to make our  military strong, make sure that we can combat China and others of their  aggressive actions and also when it comes to trade expanding, we want to  find places that we can find common ground.  But those place that's we  principally disagree with, we will stand up strongly to show America the  difference to make assuring that we can continue to grow this country.  </p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (R), RHODE ISLAND:  Democrats ran on a very specific  agenda.  I helped craft it with my co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and  Communications Committee.  It's an -- it's an agenda for the people on this  country.  It's focusing on driving down the cost of health care, driving  down the cost of prescription drugs, protecting coverage for pre-existing  condition, raising family incomes by rebuilding our country with a serious  infrastructure plan for our roads, bridges, ports, transit systems, we'll  create 16 million good paying jobs.  And taking on the corruption in  Washington by getting money out of our political system.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Congressman-elect, or Florida's 6th  Congressional district and former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel Michael  Waltz.  Lieutenant Colonel, good to see you this morning.  Congratulations  to you and thank you for joining us.  </p><p>LT. COL. MICHAEL WALTZ (R), CONGRESSMAN-ELECT, FLORIDA:  Thank you.  Yes,  thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, let's talk first about the new Congress and what  you expect to get done now working with the Democrats.  </p><p>WALTZ:  Well, you know, one of the things that I'm very excited about in  this Congress is the amount of veterans that are running on both sides of  the aisle.  I think that's something that's really resonated with voters.   They understand that veterans know how to get things done.  They're not as  ideological.  You know, I can tell you Maria, in the fox hole, nobody cares  about party, race, religion, social economic background, the enemy's  bullets certainly don't care.  </p><p>And you know, I think you're going to see an approach or at least at an  ethos where compromise isn't a dirty word.  Where we can move the country  forward because you're going to have folks.  Right now, we're at a record  low in our nation's history at around 17 percent of veterans in Congress.   I think that's going to increase.  You're going to see people focused on  mission, on country and on getting things done.  That's what I heard from  hundreds of thousands of doors that people want results.  They don't want  resistance.  And they expect their elected representatives to accomplish  what they set out to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I guess, should we expect defense spending to stay elevated  then?  </p><p>WALTZ:  I think so.  You know, I can tell you from firsthand experience  after 17 years of war our military, our equipment is exhausted.  You have  pilots that are younger than the planes that they're flying.  And we face  unprecedented threats between Russia, China and still a metastasizing  growing Islamic extremism problem.  So, I think we're going to have to.   There's really not a choice there.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  One of the huge issues  though, Congressman-elect, it's Dagen McDowell.  Good to see you again.  </p><p>WALTZ:  Thanks Dagen, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is that the U.S. is on course to spend more on the interest on  our debt than even on defense spending.  That's going to happen about four  to five years from now.  So in order to make sure that our military is  sound in terms of it's our financial support, we need to figure out how  we're going to rein in spending elsewhere.  What's your plan on that?  </p><p>WALTZ:  Well so, there's two ways, right, to -- you know, I'm a business  owner as well as a veteran and there's two ways to deal with debt.  You  deal with it with growth and with cutting spending.  I think President  Trump's absolutely spot-on on what he's doing to grow the economy as a  business owner himself.  And then I think you need members that have the  fortitude to stand up and take on -- to take on spending.  Not only do I  support the military but I also hold the Pentagon accountable for when  there is -- when there's waste involved in their spending in all government  agencies.  </p><p>But Dagen, we both know that on the one hand you have the discretionary  spending and then you have the nondiscretionary spending and what gets at  the heart of that is the cost of health care.  We have to take -- I'm very  -- I'm fascinated to see if the Democrats will take on what it takes to  lower the cost of care.  Tort reform, selling across state lines, going  into a free market system, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, really getting  serious about driving down the cost of care which would then make it more  accessible and affordable and help businesses like mine and help our debt.   .</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Congressman, Mitch Roschelle.  One of the  things that concern business owners, my friend recently did a study of what  are on the mind of business leaders, and the number one thing that they're  looking for in a bipartisan way is cyber security.  And you talk about  defense spending.  I think they're interrelated.  Do you think that's an  area -- because I haven't heard much from Washington about policy around  protecting intellectual property.  You know, from -- not just from theft  but from a cyber security risk.  Is that something that you think could be  an agenda, especially, you know, more military people obviously they have a  pretty good sense of cyber warfare.  </p><p>WALTZ:  You know, I can -- I can tell you, watching China roll out its  sixth generation stealth fighter which looks exactly like ours, armed  drones which looks exactly like ours, underwater submersibles which look  like ours, doesn't sit well with veterans.  And they've essentially stolen  that intellectual property.  So, you know, this is -- this is about how the  private sector and the government come together in a way that's in line  with American values, not dictated from Washington.  </p><p>But look, I think we're getting to the point where we really have no choice  and the more business owners, the more veterans you have on the Hill that  understand those dynamics, I think the better.  So yes, that's something I  certainly want to take on.  </p><p>Look, we have to as a country.  We are having our technological edge be  stolen in front of our very eyes and at the -- you know, at the same time  this is something that President Trump I think has taken on, Republican  Congress needs to take it on.  And I hope the Democrats join us in that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what has taken place since the midterm  elections, Tuesday night.  There's still no winner for the state Senate.</p><p>WALTZ:  Less than a week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's talk about Florida.  There's still no winner for the  gubernatorial and the state Senate race.</p><p>WALTZ:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The controversy over a recount is continuing this morning.   Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum has relinquished the race -- had  relinquished the race against Republican Ron DeSantis.  But he took that  back.  What do you think is going on here?  And what's your reaction to the  fact that in Arizona we see now a change in leadership post the midterms,  now Sinema is winning or won?  </p><p>WALTZ:  You know, in Florida this is so concerning.  Frankly, it's  embarrassing for our state.  It's two counties that year -- you know, cycle  after cycle we're having these problems.  It's incompetence at best.  It's  fraud, you know, frankly at worst, as many have alleged.  This is happening  year after year.  I think we need to see accountability when it comes to  these election officials.  I can tell you, I had four counties in my  district and the T's were crossed and the I's were dotted.  This is the --  this is the heart of our democracy.  As a veteran, this is what we fight to  defend and sacrifice to defend all over the world.  And they have -- they  have a solemn duty to get it right.  I'm glad to see so much attention but  -- on it.  But you know, once this is all said and done, I think you will  see Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott emerge as they currently are ahead.  There  needs to be some accountability afterwards so that we're not dealing with  this again in 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to quickly point out something that Byron York  tweeted out that was mentioned on \"SPECIAL REPORT\" last night.  Like, Rick  Scott went into this, he was leading by 56,000 votes on election night,  tens of thousands of votes for the DeSantis lead going into this.  If a  recount reverses the initial margin of a few -- of more than a few hundred  votes it would be unprecedented, in the history of recent American  elections.  </p><p>WALTZ:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  According to FairVote, almost 4,700 state-wide elections between  2000 and 2016, only 26 of them went to a recount.  Of those 26, just three  recounts wound up changing the initial results of the race, it was one in  Washington, --</p><p>WALTZ:  Washington State.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- one in Vermont and one in Minnesota.  The average swing in  those three elections after the recounts, 311 votes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, watch these results.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this largely because of Broward County?  </p><p>WALTZ:  Broward County and Palm Beach County.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALTZ:  And this is -- but what has us so in sensed is this has been a  habitual problem.  This goes back to Bush versus Gore.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p>WALTZ:  And it happens cycle after cycle.  And what so many of us are  asking is, where is the accountability for these election officials?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're also asking that this morning.  Lieutenant colonel,  it's good to see you this morning, thanks very much.</p><p>WALTZ:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching as you take your post in the New Year.   Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz, Congressman-elect.  </p><p>Coming up, a nightmare on the court, the details after a player's gruesome  leg injury leaves some in tears, that's next.  </p><p>Then, Congress headed back to the Hill today, we break down how the  Democratic control of the House may impact your wallet.  Congressman Steve  Scalise is here.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, more of the NFL salute to service at Monday Night  Football.  Jared Max with the story now, Jared.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX SPORTS NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We have  been seeing NFL coaches wearing the Salute to Service gear, all available  for purchase at NFLShop.com.  Last night in Santa Clara, California, U.S.  Navy performed a flyover above Levi's Stadium.  Before the 49ers took on  the New York Giants, 49er's tightened George Kittle made sure to thank  every service member on the field last night.  Kittle amongst several  minors who donated game worn jerseys to raise money for the victims of the  wildfires.  Players, coaches and cheerleaders from Paradise High School  most now homeless from the fires, guests of the 49ers last night on the  field for the anthem.  </p><p>Before the Niners gave away 20-10 lead.  Giants' Q.B. Eli Manning tells his  critics I still got it.  Fourth quarter comeback, his first such win in two  years.  Odell Beckham Jr. dances the Carlton and Sterling Shepard with  catch the game winning score 27-23, Giants beat the Niners.  </p><p>Brooklyn Nets player Caris LeVert suffered a serious leg injury last night.   LeVert collided with Minnesota's Jeff Teague and came down hard on his leg.   He had to be carted off the court on a stretcher, hospitalized, no word on  the severity of this gruesome looking basketball injury.  </p><p>Golden State Warriors have a new plan, to allow around 200 more fans at its  home games.  The Warriors are selling monthly passes for fans to attend  games at Oracle Arena but -- but it's a really big but, the fans cannot  even see the court.  They can watch the game on T.V.  They can hear the  crowd roar.  And pay arena prices for booze and food and it only costs $100  a month.  Imagine that, Maria, you're paying $100 a month to get into the  arena to do what you can do at home, watch on T.V., minus the traffic.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.  I think they just want to be there for the  excitement of it but you can't see a darn thing.  Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX:  Exactly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Catch Jared sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on  radio Sirius XM 115.</p><p>Quick break and then Washington and your wallet, how Democrats' control of  the House may impact your pocketbook.  That's next right here.  Congressman  Steve Scalise is with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're back for business, the House and the  Senate returning to Washington today for what will be an intense start to  the lame duck session.  Joining us right now is National Taxpayers Union  senior fellow and Center for a Free Economy board member Mattie Duppler.   Mattie, good to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>MATTTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION:  Yes, good  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we want to get a sense of what you believe can happen  between now and January, this next seven weeks, can the current Congress  get anything done knowing that they're going to have new pressures come  January with the House leadership?  </p><p>Bbb Maria, that is the perfect question to be asking.  Right now there's  been a lot of attention on what Democrats will do when they finally control  the House Chamber coming in in January.  But you're right, there are  several weeks of work still to be done.  </p><p>I'm watching a couple of different things here.  One is what happens on the  next betting decision, on December 7th parts of the government funding will  expire.  And that means Democrats have a choice to make.  Do they want to  be party that shows they can govern or will they take their heels in and  start to make demands on spending bills?  It really depends on who you're  listening to.  If you're trying to anticipate what Democrats will do, you  heard Chuck Schumer earlier this week talk about how he may want to load up  that spending bill with language that includes something to do with  investigations of the president.  That of course would set a signal that  Democrats are not willing to govern, do not have any interest in getting  things done.  And I think will make things very difficult in the New Year.  </p><p>So, we're have to see -- we'll have to see what happens with House  leadership.  If Nancy Pelosi decides that that is not the path she wants to  take, there could be an opportunity for bipartisan agreement on a spending  bill.  Typically in a lame duck session taxpayers do not benifit from  decisions that are made on spending bills there.  And Nancy Pelosi,  remember, when she was speaker, she was the one who governed probably some  of the biggest omnibus spending bills in the past.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And we had the majority leader Kevin McCarthy on  this weekend.  And he said that there are two appropriations bills that  they're going to get to.  Of course, one of the big issues at stake is the  Republican tax cut plan, 2.0.  McCarthy joined me on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" along with Democratic representative David Cicilline who want to  have the number four spot in Democratic leadership in the new Congress.   They have both different views on what they're expecting to happen.  Watch  this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been working on Tax Cuts 2.0.  Does that go away at this  point given the fact that not one Democrat voted for you -- first tax cut  plan?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't believe so.  Because it's already passed the House.  We  still have a number of weeks and session that's over in the Senate.  We  will continue to fight for it.  Because Maria, it is the right principle.   It is the right policy.  And that should overcome politics.  We should put  people before politics and I'll be excited to see the day that the  Democrats want to join us with that.  </p><p>CICILLINE:  The fact is that tax cut gave 83 percent of that tax cut to the  top one percent, to the richest people in this country and now the  Republicans are proposing we pay for that by cutting Medicare and Social  Security.  We can't do that.  We've got to protect Social Security and  Medicare.  We need a tax cut for middle class families not 83 percent of it  going to the top one percent, richest people in this country and the most  powerful corporations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I've got a prospect on that because 80 percent of the tax  cut plan did not go to the top one percent as you know, Congressman.  The  tax cut plan lowered all income levels and they doubled the standard  deduction.  So, that talking point -- </p><p>CICILLINE:  Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it is true.</p><p>CICILLINE:  And Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe you get there because the corporate rate was cut.  Are  you saying you want to have corporate -- </p><p>CICILLINE:  Thad's right -- that's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you want the corporate rate at 35 percent?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  Well, so, you acknowledge it's right.  83 percent does go to  the top one percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, do you want to raise the corporate tax rate?  Is  that what you're saying?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  Well, I don't -- what I say, we have to do is we have to be  responsible about that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you want to keep with this talking  point that is inaccurate.  That's fine.  You can do as you will.  </p><p>CICILLINE:  No, it's the fact, it's not inaccurate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do you -- the question is what do you going to do on taxes?   Are you looking to raise taxes, are you looking to reverse the economic  policies of this president?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  No, what I think we need to do is give a real tax cut to  working families, to middle class families, that's permanent and long- standing.  Not giving 82 percent (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That sounds like -- that sounds like what's being worked on  right now, Tax Cuts 2.0.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we know the facts on taxes, Mattie.  Mitch  Roschelle, you're here.  You responded and reacted to that interview.  You  and I were e-mailing each other.  Give us the facts on who pays the taxes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I also screamed at the television set on Sunday, just to be  clear.  But the top 10 percent of taxpayers in this country, and that's  those Households earning over $133,000 pay 70 percent of the tax.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Bottom line.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.  So, and that was based upon the last time the tax  foundation did this.  So the fact of the matter is, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just lies.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- it's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mattie, is  that -- are we going to just have bluster for the  next two years, lots of lies and inaccuracies and get nothing done, what do  you think?  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, we will see.  Look, (INAUDIBLE) just called in the Arizona  for the Kyrsten Sinema.  She is one of the only Democrats who voted to  extend those tax cuts.  Those Democrats who wants to see those tax cuts  made permanent.  We'll see if Democrats continue to push back on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and not one of them voted for the tax cut plan in general.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mattie, thank you so much.  Mattie Duppler there.  Still ahead,  divided in half, the details on Amazon's plans to split its second  headquarters, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   It is a busy morning.  It is Tuesday, November 13th.  Your top stories  right now 8:00 a.m. on button on the East Coast.  Markets are set to  rebound this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a modest gain at  the start of trading.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial average up 130 points right now, one-half of one  percent.  The S&amp;P is up two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ with a 53- point rally this morning up three quarters of a percent.  A much different  day than yesterday, where we saw serious broad-based sell-off on Wall  Street.  Apple and Goldman dragged the markets lower.  The Dow was down 600  plus points.  That was 2-1/3 percent.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 sliding nearly two percent on the session.  And at the close,  the NASDAQ was the worst performer.  It was down nearly three percent on  the session as Apple and other technology stocks really took the NASDAQ  down sharply at the close.  Take a look at global markets this morning on  the heels of the strength you're seeing on Wall Street this morning.   European markets following suit.</p><p>The FT-100 is up a fraction, the CAC Quarante in Paris us a half of a  percent, 21 points higher and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  90  points higher in Germany.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances there,  take a look.  Worst performer was Japan, the Nikkei average down better  than two percent.</p><p>Well, the picks are in.  Amazon will soon call Long Island City York and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the decision to split its  headquarters, the second headquarters.  The announcement is expected as  early as today.  That would be the official announcement but we know this  is coming up one percent on Amazon this morning in terms of the stock.</p><p>Meanwhile, let's go to California where raging wildfires are continuing  this morning.  The infernos burning a path of devastation.  The death toll  up to nearly 50 people right now between these massive fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand that makes this the deadliest fire in the  history of United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are going to take you live to Southern California to get the  very latest there.  Massive devastation.  New questions this morning for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  important 737 jet.  That's the same model that was involved in the deadly  crash in Indonesia last month.  I'm going to be speaking with the Chairman  and CEPO Dennis Muilenburg this morning and he is here in studio in a Fox  Business Exclusive.</p><p>He will join me at 8:30 a.m. Eastern to answer these questions as well as  to tell us about the backdrop for his business today.  Also joining the  conversation this morning, House Majority Whip and Louisiana Congressman  Steve Scalise as Congress gets back to work this morning.  Also this  morning joining me is CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Lindsey,  good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Lindsey, we were talking earlier about the markets and about  that sell-off yesterday.  We just came off of the quarter where we saw  profit growth up 29 percent year-over-year.  So why are markets so nervous?</p><p>BELL:  We haven't seen growth that great since before 2000.  So that is a  very impressive number.  It's the third quarter of over 20 percent earnings  growth.  And that is largely due to the tax reform package that we got  earlier this year and fiscal stimulus.  But the problem now is that fiscal  stimulus is peaking, monetary policy is tightening.  The Fed is running off  its balance sheet here.</p><p>And the question is where do we go with growth from here?  There is a lot  of uncertainty still out there on trade and to me, between trade and the  Fed, those are the two biggest things as I look to 2019 to determine where  growth -- the growth trajectory will be going.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, we saw some of the big tech names come down a lot  yesterday, Apple down five percent which is a serious number for Apple.  Is  the worry about growth largely in some of these high flyers like in Apple,  or are we just talking about economic growth going from 4.2 percent in the  second quarter, 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter to something very  different in 2019.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I think it's more about economic growth.  The tech sector is  being weighed on by the trade disputes obviously and then also I think that  with interest rates rising the evaluations that we've seen in some of that  really had investors turn a little more skittish.  It's been dragging the  market down but as we look to 2019, look, if we get 2-1/2 to -- to 2.9  percent GDP, that's really solid.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And really much better than what we saw the prior 10 years.  </p><p>BELL:  Exactly.  In a slowdown in growth from the four percent that we saw  in the last quarter could help you elongate this bull market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sounds like you think things went overdone yesterday on the  downside.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And I just think volatility is here to stay for a while but we  are optimistic, we have 3100 price targets for the next 12 months in the  S&amp;P 500.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  3100 and it is now at 2726 on the standard &amp; poor's.  Lindsey,  thank you.  Great insights always from you.  I'm going to turn now back to  the Capitol Hill.  Congress is back in session today for its final two  month stretch, spending immigration and the fate of the Mueller probe  expected to dominate the debate.  Joining me right now is the House  Majority Whip, author of the new book, Back in the Game, Steve Scalise.</p><p>And we are really happy you are back in the game, Congressman.  It's good  to see you.  </p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  Maria, great to be back  with you.  Great to be back in the game.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations on the book.  You know, I  was so happy when I saw the book because I thought I'm really happy he is  writing about this incident.  The whole country was just so worried about  you after that shooting at the baseball -- at the baseball course.  So  we'll get to that in a moment.  But you just heard Lindsey Graham talking  about the economy.</p><p>Are you expecting growth to slow?  You just had this landmark tax cut  reform that you put in place earlier this year and now people are worried  that the economy is going to slow down. </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, you know, we were seeing so much economic growth and it was  working the way that we intended.  When you -- when you see tax cuts for  every single income group and of course lower to middle income people are  the ones who benefited the most.  And now with Nancy Pelosi being expected  to be sworn in as Speaker in January, it does concern people that they want  to go backward.</p><p>They want to raise taxes again, go to like kind of big government,  government-controlled healthcare.  All the things that Pelosi did when she  was speaker before.  So, you know, it is definitely concerned people and  slowed down the growth.  Let's see what happens but we're going to be  battling that too.  We're not going to -- we're not going to let this  country go back to those days, the 10 years of slow economic growth less  than two percent growth for eight straight years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know we're waiting on couple of situations in Florida this  morning but it looks like Republicans will keep the majority in the Senate  based on what we're seeing.  </p><p>SCALISE:  And actually grew their number in the Senate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And grew their numbers but I'm talking about these, you know,  questions in Florida and -- but yes, growing the numbers in the Senate.  So  should that make us feel that the Democrats being in the House majority now  will not be subject to stopping the President's economic agenda?  I mean,  what does this mean in terms of the House leadership taking the majority?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, I think the most important thing that you don't see us go  backwards.  And, you know, even if Nancy PelosI's agenda which will be to  try to grow government, to try to raise taxes, higher, they're not going to  be successful ultimately because the bill would have to be signed by the  President.  But what it does mean is the things that we were going to do  tax cuts 2.0, the work that Chairman Brady and his committee were already  engaged in to try to make those tax cuts permanent.</p><p>To build on the growth we're seeing in our economy.  It's going to be very  difficult to get those things accomplished once Nancy Pelosi is speaker for  at least two-year period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, do you think -- I was with David Cicilline, Democratic  Congressman who0 wants to get into leadership, the leadership race is  obviously happening this week, and he said he doesn't like the corporate  rate where it is.  Do you think there's any chance that he would be  successful in raising the corporate rate?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, I saw that interview and you pressed him I think  appropriately because ultimately he didn't want to say it but you can tell  what he was trying to imply was he wants to raise the corporate rate and  it's OK if he tries to do that which he will not be successful by the way.   But if he tried to, what does he going to do with those millions of jobs  that we're bringing back to America because we lowered the corporate rate  to be competitive.</p><p>America lost its competitive edge and everybody acknowledged that.  It  wasn't a partisan issue.  And so when we made our country competitive  again, we're seeing the benefits of it by millions of new jobs being  created for families who want to get in the work force.  Why would he want  to take that away, we're not going to let it happen but it shows you they  do want to raise those rates even higher.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They want to raise rates and they want to have investigations  around President Trump.  You've got six weeks or seven weeks before the end  of the year.  What can you get done in this next seven weeks?  I know you  have spending bills, appropriation bills that need to be tended to.  Tell  us what you're expecting in terms of success this year.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Maria, there are a few important bills that are right up front  and center that we have to deal with the funding of the Department of  Homeland Security which is critically important to keeping America safe.   And of course the big fight, there is going to be overfunding the wall.  In  the House we've been moving forward to try to give the President the $5  billion that he's requested to start fully building out the wall.</p><p>There is some money he has to start building about 100 miles of wall.  We  want to go a lot further, you know, that's going to be a battle we have.   The other big battle is going to be over the farm bill.  And Maria, Farm  Bill Policy expired a few weeks ago and the big fight has been over work  requirements.  You know, here you've got this great robust economy where  there are more job openings and people looking for work.</p><p>And yet we put a provision in the House that says, if there is a job out  there in your able body, you ought to be able to go and look for work  instead of getting taxpayer funded welfare benefits and the Democrats  oppose that, so we have a big impasse over that.  And imagine, at a time  when people are looking for work, the Federal government is paying people  not to work and we said, look, if there is a job out there for you, you  have to go take it or else stop getting taxpayer money.</p><p>And we'll even pay you to train you to work if there's not -- if you don't  have the proper training and that's what they're opposing right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  All right.  Are there any plans to cut  spending?  The idea of debt and deficits in our face and getting more  expensive just to hold the debt.  This conversation is getting louder.   What are the plans in terms of spending cuts and is it possible that the  Congress and the President make a mistake of looking for something to come  together with the Democrats choosing infrastructure and then creating even  more debt by spending $2 trillion on an infrastructure package.</p><p>SCALISE:  All right.  That is continuing to be a concern.  One of the  reason we didn't get an infrastructure package is because we couldn't get  an agreement over how to pay for it.  We weren't in this Republican-led  House, we weren't going to pass a bill that was just going to add to the  deficit.  One of the things we had in our healthcare bill that passed the  House had protections for people with preexisting conditions.</p><p>But a reforming Medicaid, one of the most broken forms of healthcare by  block granting it to the states, letting the states actually be innovative  and coming up with better ways to run healthcare for lower income people.   It's saved over $800 billion just through the innovation.  You didn't have  a reduction in money, it just actually allowed states to be more flexible  with the money.</p><p>That saved $800 billion.  It failed by one voted in the Senate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SCALISE:  Huge disappointments there in a lot of fronts but it would have  made healthcare more affordable, protected people of preexisting conditions  and transformed Medicaid into a much better program at those kind of  savings.  That was what's at stake in this election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  We all remember the infamous thumbs down on the Senate.   Let me -- let me ask you about the preexisting conditions because that's  another talking point on the left that the Republicans do not want to  protect preexisting conditions.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Yes.  It was a false claim.  In fact they spent millions of  dollars promoting that false claim.  And I talked to members and so many of  these swing districts and they said, look, they're lying about this,  they're spending two, $3 million in T.V. ads lying about it.  And so they  had to go on T.V. and spend -- they didn't have two million, they might had  a million and half to say that it wasn't true.</p><p>And so people got confused, they weren't sure what was the case.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCALISE:  But our bill -- our bill actually protected people with  preexisting conditions.  It's in the bill, they knew it, they didn't care,  they just said it anyway.  Look, you know, they're going to get the  majority.  I think it's going to be a short-lived majority but at the same  time a lot of those candidates who won said they're going to be pro-life  and pro-gun and they're going to vote against Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Well, their very first vote as a member of Congress in January is going to  be for Nancy Pelosi as speaker.  You know, which side are they going to  choose, the -- you know, the people back home that they promised one thing  to or what's going to happen up in D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've got your leadership races this week, tomorrow night,  the vote tell us what you're feeling in terms of how things stack up.  Are  you expecting that Kevin McCarthy will be the Minority Leader and you will  tell us about the role that you're expecting.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Yes.  I think Kevin will get the votes and he will be the  minority leader.  I'm running for the minority whip position and feel real  confident and the votes that we have and, you know, we'll go forward but at  the same time it's going to be interesting to see which route they go, the  Democrats do when they're in power.  They're going to just be about  harassing the President, subpoenas and even impeachment.</p><p>That's not what the American people wanted.  You know, ultimately they're  going to have to -- they're going to have to decide which route they go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Just to change the conversation, so that's the  conversation for the next two years as opposed to what you've been able to  do in terms of legislation. </p><p>SCALISE:  And we've got to be I think a lot better at articulating the  things we stand for as conservatives.  That's one thing that I think we  didn't do well.  We've got to do a lot better at and we're going to get  there but I think there's going to be a sharp contrast now because you're  going to see the approach that Nancy Pelosi would take as speaker.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm glad you mentioned -- a lot of people mentioned the  messaging on the Republican side.  Let's talk about your book Back in the  Game, what role did your recovery have in writing this book?  Tell us why  you wrote the book.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, you know, as you talked about earlier, there were so many  people that came together to help me, you know, not only to save my life in  those first few hours after the shooting, but to help me get back in the  game and essence to be able to learn how to walk again.  Just to learn how  to do basic things that I couldn't do in those first few weeks after the  shooting.</p><p>And, you know, I had a lot of -- a lot of support and prayers by the people  like you were praying, people all over the country were praying and there  were so many miracles that we chronicle in this book and the book we talked  about.  What my wife Jennifer and I talk about these little miracles that  happened along the way.  And we also talked about the people who did so  many heroic things every step of the way to save not only myself but all  the other people that were out there that day.</p><p>And then ultimately to help me through the recovery process.  And it really  is an inspirational book because it could have been a lot different in how  it ended.  You know, so many cases like this don't end the way it did.   This actually has a happy ending and thanks to god, to miracles, and to the  support and prayers of so many people.  We chronicled it all in the book.   Back in the Game and I'm really happy with how it came out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were so worried.  Everybody was worried about you, we -- I  mean, it was so serious.  Did it change the way you look at things?  Did it  change the way you approach your job?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Maria, if anything, it sharpened my focus on the things that  matter in life and I think I removed a lot of clutter in life.  You know,  all of us do things every day that some that we want to do, some that you  just kind of do because it's a routine and you focus on what's really  important, my family, my faith, you know, the work that I do, I love my  job.  You know, and it illuminated the things that aren't as important and  much happier today. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.  Thank you for your leadership.   So happy you're here.</p><p>SCALISE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Steve Scalise.  Check out the book back in the  game.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeting this on trade.   France makes excellent wine but so does the U.S.  The problem is that  France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France and  charges big tariffs while doing so.  Whereas the U.S. makes it easy for  French wines and charges very small tariffs.  It's not fair.  Must change.   The President obviously touting European leaders on trade this morning.</p><p>Switching gears.  We want to bring you to California and show you this  devastation which is just unreal.  We have two wildfires whipping across  the state. The campfire is the northern part, now it is the deadliest fire  in the state's history.  And the Woolsey fire taking a major toll on  Southern California.  Fox News' Jonathan Hunt is in Malibu this morning.   Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.  Thousands of  families remain evacuated from this area of Southern California where the  Woolsey fire has hit so hard.  That likely to be out of Malibu and other  areas for I would say at least another 24 hours.  And take a look at what  hundreds of families are going to come back to find when they are  eventually let in.</p><p>Everything they have built over their lives, everything they've worked for  completely and utterly destroyed.  It is a similar story up north -- the  camp fire near Chico, California.  Now as you mentioned becoming officially  the deadliest in state history.  42 people have been killed in that fire.   More than 100 still remain unaccounted for and the entire town of Paradise  is basically wiped out.  Listen here to the fire chief.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID HAWKS, DIVISION CHIEF, CAL FIRE-BUTTE COUNTY:  It's just absolutely  heartbreaking to drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.   My family lost their home in the fire, my parents did, my grandmother did.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HUNT:  President Trump tweeted last night that he has now approved and  expedited major disaster declaration for California.  That tweet coming in  the wake of tweets over the weekend, in which he was critical of  California's forest management.  That sparked a firestorm of criticism.   He's now changing his tune paying tribute to the heroic firefighters who  are still on the frontlines, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jonathan.  Thanks very much.  We will be watching.   Jonathan Hunt in Malibu this morning.  Coming up.  Concerns in the sky.  A  new report says Boeing withheld information on its 737 plane.  The same  model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash last month.  I'll be speaking  exclusively with the chairman and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg about  that in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>As we take a break, we are watching the price of oil this morning.  And as  you can see, it is down 1-1/4 percent below 60 right now.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump continuing to tweet this morning.  Here's what  he just posted.  The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low  approval rating in France, that's 26 percent.  And an unemployment rate of  almost 10 percent.  He was just trying to get on to another subject, by the  way, there is no country more nationalist than France.  Very proud people  and rightfully so.  Make France Great Again.  The President writes this  morning.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Vive la, France.  Sorry.  I  just want to quickly say we have our pickup trucks, everyone.  We have our  tariffs on pickup truck imports.  They have their protections for one.   Let's move along and get along. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  All right.  Well, stocks getting yesterday on  weakness from technology meanwhile especially Apple.  The NASDAQ was down  almost three percent.  This morning we are looking at a rebound a bit, the  Dow industrials are up 77, the S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up 39  points after that sharp sell-off yesterday.  Joining us right now Wells  Fargo Investment Institute Head, global market strategists, Paul  Christopher. </p><p>Paul, good to see you.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when you come in today after since a rough day at the office  yesterday where the markets were down 600 points on the Dow.  What do you  do?  Are you a buyer or a seller here?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We're a buyer.  Look, it's -- the markets, it's still  worried about growth, it's trying to put in a bottom.  You don't have to  put in all the chips at once here but people have a lot of cash.  Our  clients held a lot of cash and we would like for them to put in a little  bit here at a time.  We think this is the best buying opportunity in U.S.  large caps since the November 2016 election.</p><p>So don't have to put it all in at once.  We're still looking for a bottom  but do start to take some positions especially in those growth-oriented  sectors.  </p><p>BELL:  So Paul, does that mean you take some positions in the tech, maybe  some of the FAANG names that have been beaten up or maybe are in bear  market territory right now off of their highs?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  It's a good question.  We've been market weight on  information technology.  We still think you should be market weight but  listen if you haven't had a chance to get into some of these stocks and now  you find yourself below market weight.  Again this is an opportunity to  take yourself back up to that waiting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Paul, it's Dagen McDowell.  It seems like the market gets really  shaken every time that 10-year yield gets to about only 3-1/4 percent.   Realistically how high a yield, a longer term interest rate can stocks  handle given a lot of names that are still -- that still look really  overvalued?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We think that bond yields, the 10-year for instance  will go a little bit higher over the next 12 months and that we think that  stocks will still be OK with that.  The problem is we're just getting this  transition period where we've gone from clearly low growth and low interest  rates to a little bit faster growth and somewhat higher interest rates and  that sort of a move always wrong foots markets until investors can  determine that yes earnings can continue to hit higher levels.</p><p>And it's -- those earnings ultimately over the long run that will be --  that will match the S&amp;P on the way up we think, you know, percentage for  percentage.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Paul, great to see you.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paul Christopher joining us.  Well Fargo.  New questions for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  737 model.  This is the same model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash  last week.  We will speak with Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg next,  exclusive coming up right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast.  Futures are indicating  a gain at the start of trading this morning.  Dow Industrials expected to  be up 69 points, that is about a quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 is up  almost half a percent, and the NASDAQ with a 39-point gain, up two-thirds  of one percent.  This, after a sharp sell-off yesterday where the Dow lost  two percent and the NASDAQ lost almost three percent.</p><p>European markets were mixed, the FT-100 is down a fraction, as you can see,  but the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are both positive.  Although off of  the highest levels of the morning, for sure.  Overnight in Asia, mixed  performances, take a look, the worst performer was Japan overnight in Asia.   The Nikkei Average was down on the session about two percent, as you can  see there.  </p><p>Oil is extending its losing streak this morning.  Crude oil under pressure  again now 11 days in a row lower, down 1-1/3 percent, below $60.00 a  barrel.  What is the price of oil selling off tell us about the global  economy?  We want to look at that, coming up.  </p><p>All of those stories coming up this morning, but first, our top story this  half an hour, new questions this morning for Boeing, The Wall Street  journal is reporting that Boeing withheld information on its 737 model,  according to safety experts and others.  That is the same model involved in  the deadly Lion aircrash in Indonesia last month.  And joining me right now  to discuss that and a lot more in this Fox Business exclusive is the  Chairman, President, and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg.  Dennis, it's  good to see you this morning.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BOEING:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the story in The Journal obviously is very concerning.   What can you tell us in terms of what was told to the pilots and the  airlines about any new equipment in that 737?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, Maria, first of all, I think it's important that we all  express our sympathies for the loss of Lion Air Flight 610 and certainly,  our thoughts go with the families that have been affected.  We've been very  engaged with the investigative authorities throughout and providing all of  the information necessary to make sure we do a full assessment of the  situation.  And the bottom line here is the 737 max is safe, and safety is  a core value for us at Boeing, it always has been, and we ensure that our  airplanes are safe.  In fact, this airplane went through thousands of hours  of tests and evaluation, certification, working with the pilots, and we've  been very transparent on providing information and being fully cooperative  on the investigative activity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what happened?  Apparently, there were 10 computer -- the  computers about the angle of the nose were not accurate and then the plane  went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you have a sense of what went wrong?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, as the Indonesian authorities have pointed out initially,  there were some indications of inaccurate angle attack signal that was  being sent to the airplane, and of course, our airplane has the ability to  handle that, and we have procedures in place.  And we've already issued a  couple of additional bulletins to our operators and pilots around the world  that point them back to existing flight procedures to handle that kind of  condition.  So again, we're going to continue to support the investigation  as it proceeds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And was there -- I mean, one of the Boeing officials quoted in  The Journal today, one high-ranking Boeing official said that the company  had decided against disclosing more details to cockpit cruise due to  concerns about inundating average pilots with too much information.  Was  that a decision now that you regret?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Now, again, we ensure that we provide all of information  that's needed to safely fly our airplanes.  Again, this comes as out of  thousands of hours of testing and evaluating and simulating, and providing  the information that our pilots need to operate our airplanes safely, and  we'll continue to do that.  As I said, as part of the process here, we've  already issued a couple of bulletins to pilots and operators that point  them back to existing flight procedures to handle this kind of situation.   So, we're going to continue to fully cooperate in the investigation.  I  think it's really important -- again, the bottomline here, the 737 Max is a  very safe airplane and we're very confident in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But was there a new -- well, there are new system that wasn't  disclosed to the pilots.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  No, there are new systems on the airplanes that are designed  to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane and to provide  control capability in high-angle of attack conditions, and those systems  operate properly.  And again, in certain failure modes, if there's an  inaccurate angle attack sensors feeding information to the -- to the  airplane, there's a procedure to handle that.  And so, again, as part of  the investigation process, we're going to make sure we fully understand  that.  We're going to make sure that we're providing all of the information  necessary and appropriate training, and go back to the core value here, is  that the airplane safe, we know how to fly it safely, and we're very  confident in that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was that information in terms of what to do should something  change -- was that information available to the pilots?  Did they know how  to operate it should the nose be in a different position?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.  In fact, that's part of the training manual, it's an  existing procedure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  So, the bulletin that we put out again last week and over the  weekend, pointed to that existing flight procedure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, obviously, I know that you're answering lots of  questions this morning and this week after this horrific crash, and you're  going to get more information.  What would be the timing on that?  When do  you expect to hear from the FAA on this?  </p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, this is an ongoing investigation, so it will take  whatever time is necessary to make sure it's done thoroughly.  Again, we  participate fully in these investigations, we've provided technical  assistance, we'll continue to do that until the work is complete.  It's  very important that we do this in a diligent and thorough manner.   Bottomline is we want to ensure safety in the system, and continue to have  confidence in the 737 Max.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the 737 has been a cash cow for your business, this is a  very important business.  There were some headwinds in the supply chain in  terms of the 737, which I want to ask you about.  And I know over the  recent past, you've expanded the business, you've got commercial aerospace,  you've got defense, and then you've got services.  Tell us how business is  right now, because commercial aerospace has been driving the stock  obviously for several years right now?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, aerospace is a tremendous growth business.  We look out  over the next 10 years as an $8.1 trillion marketplace.  Passenger traffic  is growing at about six to seven percent per year sustained.  The world  needs about 43,000 new commercial airplanes over the next 20 years.  A part  of that is the 737 as we've ramped up to 52 a month, this year, we're  producing at 57 a month next year.  And we have had some supply chain  challenges as you -- as you pointed out, as we've been growing.  But we are  briskly moving to a recovery.  We just announced delivery numbers for  October earlier this morning, so we delivered 43 737s in October which is  an all-time record for October, and we're continuing to March smartly to  our recovery plan, and expect to meet our year-end targets for deliveries.   This year, for the first time, we'll deliver more than 800 commercial  airplanes.  By the end of the decade here, we'll be delivering more than  900 airplanes a year.  So, you can see the tremendous growth here in  commercial airplanes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible and I know you got an incredible backlog as  well --</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which will continue that delivery calendar.  One out of four  or five planes go to China in terms of your deliveries.  Tell us about the  importance of the business in China.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, China is very important to us.  Today, about a third of  our 737s go to China, about one-quarter of our overall deliveries.  So, if  you look at that marketplace around the world, 43,000 new airplanes over  the next 20 years, about 7,000 of those are in China.  It's the fastest  growing market segment right now.  China needs that lift capability to  serve their economic growth needs, so China is very interested in the  healthy aerospace economy.  </p><p>As you know here in the U.S. as well, there's a big advantage to a healthy  aerospace ecosystem.  We have about 90 percent of our manufacturing jobs  here in the U.S. even though we export about 80 percent of what we build.   So when you look at trade deficit versus trade surplus, aerospace is the  biggest trade surplus for the U.S., about $80 billion a year.  And our  business is the biggest piece of that.  So, that a mutually-beneficial  relationship between the U.S. and China as it applies to trade and the  aerospace is very important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what happens now with this trade spat that we're having  with China then?  I mean, have you seen any backlash from the Chinese in  terms of your business, given the fact that the President is sitting there  waiting to put another 250 billion on exports from China on tariffs and  this fight between China and the U.S. intensifies?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We've been very engaged in that dialogue, as you know, this is  a very important topic to us.  We've been talking with the President and  the U.S. administration, extensively.  They're very aware of the situation  and the importance of aerospace.  We've also had a very good dialogue with  Chinese leadership and our customers in China.  And we're encouraged by the  dialogue that's going on.  </p><p>I think you've seen some recent reports that President Trump and President  Xi plan to meet around the G20 summit that's coming up.  Some productive  dialogue going on on the trade front, we think both countries are  interested in a mutually successful aerospace ecosystem.  It's good for the  economies of both countries.  And here in the U.S., it's really important  to U.S. manufacturing jobs.  We have about 13,000 companies in our supply  chain here in the U.S. that are supporting that kind of manufacturing  growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has the air supply chain changed in any way because of your  services business?  I mean, you're pursuing this more aggressive strategy,  does that mean that in time -- in terms of selling a plane to somebody or a  business, then you want to maintain that plane as well by using the  services there, but are you taking away business from the suppliers?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We're actually see this as a grow the pie business.  So,  something we can do jointly with our suppliers.  Services is our biggest  single-growth opportunity.  When you look at that $8-trillion marketplace,  it's the place where we have the biggest opportunity to further grow.  And  we're bringing capabilities like parts distribution, maintenance, and  modifications.  New software, digital solutions, training solutions for our  customers, doing that jointly with our suppliers.  </p><p>To date -- year-to-date, our services business has grown 12 percent in a  market that's growing about three percent a year.  So, it is growing,  growing strongly, and by doing this jointly with our supply chain, we can  provide better light cycle value for our customers.  And that's really the  lens we're looking through here, not only how we design and build  airplanes, but how do we provide value for our customers for post- production support.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This sounds like a natural fit.  I mean, the commercial  aerospace business has been so strong, and walk us through that for a  moment because most people don't understand the number of people who've  never been on an airplane.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The number of people who are perhaps in Asia who are wanting to  travel, this is a big opportunity for you.  So, this is also an economic  growth story.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  It is.  And, Maria, you bring up a really great point.  As I  said earlier, traffic is growing -- passenger traffic at about six to seven  percent a year completely outstripping GDP.  And some of the things that  are driving that is the upcoming middle class that for the first time ever,  is able to travel.  So, we have this unique combination of backlogs, seven  years of backlog.  And every year in Asia alone, 150 million people fly for  the first time.  Less than -- less than 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's amazing.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Less than 20 percent of the world's population has ever taken  a single flight.  So, think about the growth opportunity that's still ahead  of us, and we're feeding right into that with our design and productions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But here we have worries in the market, down 600 points  yesterday, worries from economic worries that things are going to slow  down.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where are we on that in your view?  You've got interest  rates rising obviously when a company or country buys a plane, or several  planes, they are in many parts doing it by borrowing, their borrowing costs  are going up with interest rates.  How much of a headwind will that be for  you?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We're not seeing it affect our business.  Again, we have a  much longer term view.  Today, we have a backlog of almost 5800 commercial  airplanes if you think of that in terms of production volume, it's about  seven years of backlog.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  So, this gives us the opportunity to think long term in terms  of capital investment, innovation investment.  And while we pay attention  to things like interest rates and the financial markets, it's not something  that's really affecting near-term buying behavior.  You know, today, we're  selling 737 Maxes, filling our production skyline out in 2023 and beyond.   So, we have a much longer term perspective.  Aerospace is a strong long- term growing business.  It's not -- it's no longer a cyclical business.   This is a long term sustained growth business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the competition is fierce.  I mean, airbus -- can airbus  sell to European countries and companies with no tariffs?  So, are you  disadvantaged by the tariff situation given the fact that a European  jetmaker Airbus can do it a lot cheaper?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, something we're paying close attention to.  To date, we  haven't been affected materially by the tariffs.  Things that have affected  steel and aluminum pricing.  We source 90 percent of our aluminum here in  the U.S. so it hasn't been a dramatic effect on us, but it's something  we're paying a close attention to.  The bottom line is it's a very  competitive marketplace because it's a very attractive marketplace.  Now,  we have to continue to invest, to compete.  We have to continue to invest  to innovate.  Tax reform, for example, in the U.S. has been something that  has really helped us gain a level-playing field globally so that we can  compete and win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can you grow the defense business at this point?  A lot of  worries that defense spending needs to either be capped or cut, given the  trillion-dollar deficits we're talking about every day and the debt of 21  trillion.  </p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, we see the defense budget here in the U.S. sustained, and  if you look back a couple of years when we were in the middle of  sequestration.  We feel like we're in a stronger budget position now on  both sides of the aisle.  So, we look to the U.S. defense budget to remain  strong.  But we also see growth around the world.  Today, about a third of  our defense backlog is outside the U.S.  So, again, this is a very global  business, and there's a lot of defense growth opportunities outside of the  U.S., and I think the thing that's unique about Boeing is when we think  about growth, we look across commercial defense and services.  We're really  the only aerospace company that can bring great big critical mass to all  three of those sectors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Dennis, it's great to have  you on the program.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Likewise.  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Dennis Muilenburg, ceo at Boeing.  We will  be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump just tweeting again.  He says this, \"By the  way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France  because of almost zero visibility.  I suggested driving, Secret Service  said no, too far from airport and big Paris shutdown.  Speech next day at  the American cemetery in pouring rain!  Little reported -- Fake News.\"  The  President referring to some criticism that he received from the media on  failing to go the cemetery that dual.</p><p>We want to turn to Amazon, congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  slamming Amazon's plans to partially bring (INAUDIBLE) headquarters to New  York City.  Joining me right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart  Varney.  And Stuart, there was a reason that so many cities across this  country were vying for Amazon to come to their city and set up their new  headlines.  Does she not understand business and economics?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, she does not.  I don't  think she wants to.  There's no pleasing some people, and that's the truth.   There's no pleasing a socialist.  I'll quote you exactly what she said.   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, Amazon is a-billion-dollar company.  The  idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks is  extremely concerning to residents here.  Has the company promised to hire  in the existing community?  What's the quality of jobs?  How many are  promised?  Are these jobs low wage or high wage?  Are there benefits?  Can  people collectively bargain?  There's just no satisfying a socialist.  They  see no benefit to investment, capital infusion and growth.  They don't see  it.  They simply see a big corporation.  Give me the money.  I just want  the money.  That's what it's all about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm astonished, actually.  I would have thought that when you  bring 25,000 new jobs, a couple of billion dollars to your city, it would  be universally approved, but apparently not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the first thing she does, Dagen, is she complains that  Amazon is getting tax breaks (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And she says Queens City councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer and state  Senator Gianaris have also come out against the Amazon deal while Mayor  Bill de Blasio says that this could be the single biggest economic  development deal in the history of New York City.  So, here's a word,  Amazon, find another city, I dare you.</p><p>VARNEY:  For once, I'm on Bill de Blasio's side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stuart, I know you'll have more in 10 minutes.  We'll see you  at the top of the hour, thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right  after MORNINGS WITH MARIA 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Stay with us.</p><p>But first, driving innovation, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the  journal's technology conference, featuring the CEO of Uber.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The future of technology, the Wall Street  Journal's Tech D.Live conference is underway this morning where big names  and descending on Laguna Beach, California.  Susan Li is there.  Susan,  good morning.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you, Maria.   Yes, we'll be talking all things tech here in Laguna beach.  That includes  government regulation, innovation, and future partnerships.  Now, later on,  to the program, will feature a lot of heavyweights, that includes Uber CEO,  Dara Khosrowshahi, one of the headliners.  And then, we have celebrity  attendance as well.  Gwyneth Paltrow will be holding the evening session  along with Kevin Hart, the comedian.  Last night, we heard from AT&amp;T's  Randall Stephenson who has some interesting things to say about President  Trump, about Jim Acosta, Time Warner and CNN, and we also heard from  (INAUDIBLE) of Google.  </p><p>Now, we also caught up with Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's former CEO,  billionaire, owner of the L.A. Clips.  And I think that the overarching  theme her are like going to be so far has been this -- talk about the  relationship between the White House and big tech.  And whether or not  they'll be more regulation in the future of big Silicon Valley names.  I  asked Steve Ballmer this.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT:  I don't think Microsoft has much  risk at all right now.  We certainly had ours in the past.  Amazon will  have their own set of issues.  The most important thing for anybody running  a successful tech company where there's not a clear issue.  It's just to  continue to do their job well, be responsible.  I think Amazon has done a  very good job so far.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LI:  Yes.  It was an -- a great job, Jeff Bezos has done a great job as  Steve Ballmer says.  We'll talk more later on today and we have more  interviews coming to you and coming on Fox Business from Laguna Beach.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff.  Susan, thank you.  Susan Lee joining us  there in Laguna.  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Back  In a Minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey  Bell.</p><p>BELL:  Look, the markets might be going well, but the bedrock of the  country, the consumer is strong and we saw that in Home Depot's numbers and  we'll here about that from retailers later this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bullish (INAUDIBLE) Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think the markets just need to calm down.  You know,  sometimes good news is bad news, and bad news is good news.  Right now, the  market just needs to calm down, calm down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, it's the stability.  Look long term, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And New York City, I'm going to tweet this.  I think the  Governor of the New York -- of New York state and the major of New York  City, maybe need to do a conference call with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to  explain what 25,000 jobs mean in terms of the tax revenue, and how that  actually helps fix the New York City subways.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's a reason that every city in the country wanted the  Amazon headquarters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  They all wanted it.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thank  you so much, and we'll see you in a few minutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good morning, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday, November 13th, your top stories  right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Markets looking to rebound this morning after a serious selloff yesterday.   Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 95 points.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The market up about a third of a percent on the Dow, half a percent higher  on the S&amp;P, and about three quarters and percent higher on the NASDAQ with  a 49-point move this morning higher for NASDAQ.  </p><p> This after broad-based selloff yesterday for stock prices, Apple and  Goldman Sachs dragging down the Dow Industrials by better than 600 points  at the close.  </p><p> The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly two percent on the session.  As you can see,  the NASDAQ the worst performer, down nearly three percent.  Apple leading  the charge in technology stocks lower yesterday.</p><p> Global markets this morning, also seeing a bit of a bounce.  The FT-100 is  up a fraction, 13 points higher there, 11 points higher on the CAC Quarante  in Paris, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 75, that's two-thirds of one  percent this morning.</p><p> In Asia overnight, mixed performances, as you see there.  Best performer in  China, up about one percent on the Shanghai Composite.</p><p> But the Nikkei Average in Japan down better than two percent overnight.</p><p> The picks are in, Amazon will soon call Long Island City, New York, and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the company's HQ2 selection  with the announcement coming as early as today.  </p><p>Amazon shares are up this morning, three quarters of one percent.  </p><p> Raging wildfires in California.  This infernos -- the infernos are burning  a path of devastation.  The death toll now rising to nearly 50 people  between these massive fires.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KORY HONEA, SHERIFF, BUTTE COUNTY:  I understand that makes this the  deadliest fire in the history of the United States.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest and we will take you live to California  this morning.</p><p> There are new questions facing Boeing this morning.  A new report says the  jet-maker withheld information on the 737, the same model involved in the  deadly Indonesia crash last month.  </p><p>Boeing Chairman and CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, will join me in a Fox Business  exclusive this morning.  Stay with us for that exclusive coming up at 8:30  a.m. Eastern this morning.</p><p> Plus Tide detergent unveils new packaging, and it is going viral.  The  controversy coming up.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner Mitch  Roschelle, and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, with us this  morning.  Good to see you.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Cannot wait for that Boeing  interview.  That'll be fantastic.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that'll be good, because this is -- there are new  questions this morning, but at the same time, Boeing has been operating on  fire. </p><p> I mean, this company is seeing commercial airline business up strongly, the  defense business up strongly, and the stock has held up well.  </p><p> Of course, they are trading down in the month of October.  Like the other  defense contractors, they had a tough month. </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  It'll also be interesting because there are  some trade considerations with a company like Boeing.  Their rival Airbus  in Europe, so it'll be interesting to see what he has to say about that as  well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  And China is the number one market  for the business in terms of new planes and aerospace business.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  We are at tend of earning season, which Lindsey will get  into.  Ninety percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, but we've got  retailers this week.  </p><p> Home Depot just came out with numbers beating on revenue and earnings per  share.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The numbers are on the screen right now.  The estimates call  for $2.26 a share.  The company is reporting earnings of $2.51 on revenue  of -- better than the estimate, which was 26.26 billion and here is the  renew estimate coming in better than expected at 23.6 billion.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Overall S&amp;P 500 earnings are up almost 29 percent from a  year ago.  The expectation going into the quarter was 22 percent, so it was  a terrific quarter on earnings.  </p><p> A lot misses on revenue, 40 percent of companies missing on revenue  expectations.  This was a beat.  We get Walmart later this week and some  other big retailers like a Macy's, so.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's interesting to see this market performance, Lindsey, in  the face of 29 percent profit growth year over year.  </p><p> BELL:  I know.  And I think it's still like we always talk about, it's all  about the outlook.  The outlook was a little bit weaker than expected for  many companies as we looked forward to the fourth quarter and into 2019.  </p><p> There are rising raw material costs, the strong dollar certainly impacting,  but you and I was -- we're talking about that in the green room.  </p><p> And so expectations for growth in 2019 have been coming down.  All through  this year, we're looking for 10 percent earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p> Now we're at about eight and a half percent, which is still a very, very  good number, but there are still a lot of uncertainties out there with what  the fed's going to do, what's going to happen with trade, and then where is  the dollar going.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  What I -- what I like about the home improvement industry is  these are discretionary spends.  </p><p> BELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And it tells you something about the consumer, when they're  discretionarily spending on things.  You don't have to fix up your home,  you don't have to do home improvement, and when you do it, that's when the  customer feels strong.  </p><p> So, that may give us an indication of what the rest of the retail season  looks like.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's also a really important focus on the consumer.  </p><p> This week, we will hear -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- as you said, from Walmart and Macy's tomorrow, but Home  Depot numbers' better than expected.  </p><p> As we worry about a growth slowdown, where is the consumer in that growth  slowdown?</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Well, I mean you know what, I think the consumer remains  confident and higher interest rates aren't scaring them away from doing  home improvements.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which is good because the home sales this year have been in kind  of a slow slide for much of -- much of the year in terms of declines in  home sales in consecutive months.</p><p> BELL:  Yes.  Which is why Home Depot's stock hasn't done so well this year.   It's down about five percent year to date.  </p><p> These numbers look to be pretty strong, and we'll have to get into the  details.  But, you know, the concern is home sales have been weak, interest  rates are rising, are investors going -- are peep -- are consumers going to  invest in their homes and fixing them up?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you look at a market, like we saw yesterday, where Apple  was really the problem.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Down sharply.  And you wonder if that's indicator of slowdown.   People are worried about unit sales, worried about a slowdown in Apple.</p><p> This is the most important product that identifies really what we're  talking about in terms of consumer spending.  </p><p> What did you think about the market selloff yesterday?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that a lot of this is still a hangover from Apple  suddenly announcing that it's not going break out its unit sales because it  does look like they're trying to hide something, quite frankly.</p><p> And, you know, this was -- they act like that breaking out the unit sales  of these products isn't important today.  Well -- but -- you know, why was  it important then years ago when you -- when you launched the iPhone?</p><p> That's number one.  I'll just point out that stock is still up almost 15  percent year to date.</p><p> So it was roughly immune to what happened to, say, in Amazon in the month  of October when Amazon went into a full-blown bear market in that stock.  </p><p>Apple is still up, it's, you know, pretty -- seeing a pretty sharp decline  in the -- so far in November.  </p><p> But, again, still double-digit gain year to date.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's really indicative of the story overall, of the worry,  the story of this market.  We are worried about growth, worried that things  will turn down and you see a company like Apple and Home Depot really  indicative of the consumer.</p><p> BELL:  Yes.  And I think yesterday's action in Apple really did spook  especially tech investors because exactly to your point, Amazon's in bear- market territory.  Apple has been the value in the tech sector.  And it's  been able to hold up and support the group.  </p><p> And so if growth is slowing there, we -- do we have a bigger problem  overall?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was on a report about suppliers.</p><p> BELL:  Right.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Two -- </p><p> BELL:  Two suppliers.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's another thing, the suppliers made guidance  warnings and, you know, you think thank back to what Dan Niles said a  couple of weeks ago with the inventory build-up.  </p><p> I mean he mentioned that Apple had inventories up 89 percent, quarter of a  quarter -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- in the second quarter and that was an issue because if  you've got an economic slowdown and you've got people pulling back in terms  of spending, well, what are they going to do?</p><p> First, they're going to buy the inventory that they have.  Can they  actually get rid of all of that inventory?  </p><p> And if you see China slowing down, is China -- are the Chinese going to buy  a phone for a thousand dollars?  So, that's why Apple is such an important  indicator in terms of what's going on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I will argue also that yesterday was kind of a delayed reaction  to that move-up in long-term interest rates last week where you saw the 10- year.  Every time -- and we've had this happen several times in the last  month or so.</p><p> Every time that 10-year treasury yield gets closer to 3.25 percent, because  it hit a new -- it was like a seven and a half year-high last week, that  rattles investors and the bond market was closed yesterday.  </p><p> But I think that that is definitely playing into, you know what, if longer- term interest rates are at three and a quarter, three and a half, you know,  those earnings, I need to pay a little bit less for those earnings way,  way, way out in the future on these big-growth companies.</p><p> BELL:  Yes, and that's a huge impact on the tech sector.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BELL:  Which is supposed to have the best earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let -- </p><p> BELL:  It has had the best growth in the past two years. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's zero in on this stock market and really what's going on  this morning.  Joining the conversation, we got the Chairman, President,  and CEO of Boeing here in studio this morning, Dennis Muilenburg.  </p><p> My special guest in the fact of this new report from the Journal on its  737.  </p><p>Louisiana Congressman and current House Majority Whip, Steve Scalise, joins  us with his reaction to the midterm elections and what can get done.</p><p>Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane  is with us this morning, along with the CEO of the Mayo Clinic, Dr. John  Noseworthy back with us as well.  </p><p> And Florida Congressman-elect, former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel  Michael Waltz, joining us as well.  A lot to talk about.  Big guest lineup  today, don't miss a moment of it.  </p><p> And of course we are watching markets this morning after that major selloff  yesterday driven by weakness in technology and Apple in familiar.  </p><p> Joining us now is Fort Pitt Capital Group Partner, Vice President, as well  as Senior Portfolio Manager, Kim Forrest.  Kim, good to see you.  Thanks  very much for joining us.  </p><p> Your reaction to the -- </p><p> KIM FORREST, VICE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FORT PITT CAPITAL  GROUP:  Thanks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the market selloff yesterday and what to do  now?</p><p> FORREST:  Sure.  Well, I think you guys covered it ably, you know.  All the  factors that you cited are just exactly in line with what I saw.  </p><p> The raise in interest rates, you know, made these higher price stocks a  little less desirable.  </p><p> I do think that Apple may not be something that the -- that is a great  thing about -- a great -- I don't know, point of data about how consumers  are spending because you did get those great Home Depot numbers.  </p><p> And I think Apple's its own little issue.  But that being beside that, I  think today is a tremendous opportunity if you have long-enough time  horizon -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> FORREST:  -- to really look and see stocks that you may want to buy right  now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting you say Apple could have its own  issue.  I mentioned Dan Niles has been covering this company for years.  </p><p> FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  AlphaOne Capital Partners, he almost predicted this trouble for  Apple and the technology sector a month ago.  Watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?</p><p> DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  I think you  absolutely are, and this is exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of  inventory out there.  </p><p> So, if you pick the biggest company in the world, Apple, for example, they  have 89 percent inventory growth year over year in the June quarter that  they reported.  Their revenues were up 17 percent.  </p><p> Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p> Look at last year, they had one phone priced above a thousand dollars.   This holiday season, they have three phones priced above them.</p><p> The average selling price, they're trying to boost it by another hundred  dollars.  </p><p> The problem is, if you look at smartphone units overall, this will be the  first year in history that smartphone units are down year over year.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kim, you might say that Apple is its own specific story, but -- </p><p> FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- doesn't it feed on itself?  I mean if you've got a lot of  inventory out there in technology and you can't sell it because things are  slowing down, that's going to trickle into other retail and other tech.</p><p> FORREST:  Maybe.  We're going to put a big maybe there because here --  here's the issue, I look at tech very differently than a lot of analysts.   We're talking about Apple, which is almost solely consumer-oriented tech.  </p><p> I am really excited about more enterprise or business-related tech because  I think as wages are starting to go up, businesses have to once again think  about how do I make my employees more productive?  </p><p> And it's not by watching Netflix, it's not by, you know, participating on  Facebook and maybe it's not by buying Apple products.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> FORREST:  But still, semiconductors underlie this whole trend of making  people more productive through software and hardware -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> FORREST:  And it's delivered on semiconductors, so that's what I'm kind of  throwing out there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p> FORREST:  And I do think Apple is, you know, an issue in and of itself.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> FORREST:  It is very high-priced products and maybe not everybody, you  know, needs to buy a new Apple phone every 18 months -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> FORREST:  -- like they have in the past.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, what about Amazon?  The Journal is reporting this morning  that the company is ready to choose New York City and Northern Virginia as  the new homes for Amazon's new headquarters.  </p><p> Kim, good or bad move on Amazon's part to split the second headquarters?   What do you think?  </p><p> FORREST:  Well, I really thought Pittsburgh was the winner here, but, you  know, we're going to leave that behind.</p><p> But, no, I think it's really smart, especially because it looks like  Amazon's going to have to develop its own in-house brands for clothing and  what better place than New York City to do that.</p><p> The Virginia aspect is kind of interesting, it's close to the government  and, you know, I think they need to address a whole lot of maybe regulatory  issues.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> FORREST:  So, you know, that makes a whole lot of sense there, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, just really quickly, I'm sure we'll get to this in the show,  but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has just been elected to Congress,  representing part of Queens, is calling in to question Amazon moving into  Queens.  </p><p> The idea of we receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a  time when our subway is crumbling out and our communities need more  investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here that -- </p><p> Well, we will just talk about that, because that shows a fundamental  misunderstanding of the way an economy works.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a misunderstanding of what the whole point in giving  tax breaks to companies are.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's the whole point, is to lead to jobs.  </p><p> FORREST:  Right.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Twenty-five thousand jobs.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you -- do you have a leave -- do you have a leave?  Because  that gives me a headache.  That economic analysis -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I have an Advil for you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- is just -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I might have an Advil for you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kim, thank you so much.  We will see you soon.  </p><p> FORREST:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're watching all of the above.  Kim Forrest joining us.   We'll take a break.  </p><p> When we come back, wild fires are out of control in California.  The  multiple blaze is burning across the state, becoming the deadliest in the  state history.  The very latest coming next.  </p><p> And then withholding data, new reports suggest Boeing did not share  potential problems with flight control systems.  It could have played a  role in the Lion Air jet crash next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  In Northern California, wild fire becoming the  deadliest in state history.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details right  now.  Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  The  monster campfire has now killed at least 42 people in Northern California,  hundreds are still unaccounted for.  President Trump has approved a major  disaster declaration for the Golden State. </p><p> In Southern California, that's where you have the Woosley Fire that's  destroyed more than 400 homes and businesses.  That fire has killed at  least two people.  </p><p> Thousands of structures remain at risk, red-flag warning in effect for L.A.  and Ventura counties, and obviously the weather is not helping the  situation.</p><p> Well, Boeing reportedly withheld information on the Lion Air jet that  crashed in Indonesia last month, killing all 189 people on board.  </p><p> The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Boeing didn't tell airlines about  potential hazards in a new flight control feature on their 737 Max.  </p><p> The problem is that the system can push the plane's nose down so strongly  that pilots can't pull it back up.  The automated stall prevention system  is being investigated as playing a role in the crash.  </p><p> Shares of Boeing are up a quarter of one percent.  And premarket trading,  Maria, you will talk to Boeing Chairman, and CEO, President Dennis  Muilenburg.  That's at 8:30 this morning.  </p><p> Everybody stay tuned for that that.  </p><p> Well, fans worldwide are paying tribute to a real superhero.  Stan Lee, the  father of Spider-Man, The Hulk, Iron Man, and many other memorable comic  characters, died yesterday in Los Angeles.  </p><p> Lee was a legendary Writer and Publisher of Marvel Comics whose creations  revolutionized comic books.  </p><p> His comics were often turned into blockbuster movies, generating billions  of dollars worldwide. </p><p> Stanley dead at the age of 95.  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Coming up next, midterm  madness.  More inconsistencies in the Florida recount process.  They are  popping up as the judge tells both sides to ramp down the rhetoric, that  and other races still not decided right after this break.  </p><p> And then a tidy box, this new design for Tide's detergent driving the  internet nuts this morning.  We will tell you why.  Stay with us on that.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching markets this morning after a big  selloff yesterday.  Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading this  morning.  </p><p> We are looking at a gain of about 145 points on the Dow Industrials, that's  two-thirds of one percent after a 600-point selloff yesterday.  </p><p> The S&amp;P is up 16, and the NASDAQ is up 60 points right now.</p><p> I want to turn to the midterm fallout.  New oversight, the hours on the  senate race has been called.  Kyrsten Sinema, becoming the first democrat  elected in 30 years.  </p><p> In Georgia, a judge extending the deadline to certify votes in the  governor's race there.  </p><p> Republican Brian Kemp is ahead by nearly 60,000 that votes right now, but  Democrat Stacey Abrams is filing a lawsuit to count rejected ballots.</p><p> And then in Florida, ballot drama, the recount is in full swing right now,  but large counties are scrambling to meet the deadline of Thursday.  </p><p>Fox News' Griff Jenkins is in Lauderhill, Florida.  He's at the Broward  County Office of Elections.</p><p> Griff, good morning to you.  </p><p> GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  </p><p> You may be watching the markets, but I'm watching ballots being separated  in Broward County.  Take a look at this.  The tabulation room, they still  have not begun the recount here.  </p><p> Now in 65 of Florida's 67 counties, they are either halfway done or even  more from the recount being done, but here in Palm Beach County, they're  far from it.  What they have to do is finish separating page one.  </p><p> Then they'll likely do a calibration of the machines and begin the actual  official tabulation recount.  That isn't expected any time before about  9:00 a.m. here so it's quite an issue as they race towards the Thursday  deadline to get those numbers in.  </p><p> But we were surprised, Maria, yesterday when the Election Supervisor here,  Dr. Brenda Snipes, came out, talked to the media, and addressed allegations  that she has made major mistakes this election, take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BRENDA SNIPES, SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS, BROWARD COUNTY:  The lawsuits, as  they are written, certainly cast dispersions on my character.  </p><p> I've have worked here for about 15 years and I have to say this is the  first time that this office or I have been under such attacks, so if we  make mistakes, we own mistakes.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JENKINS:  Then the stunning development, FormerFlorida Governor, Jeb Bush,  tweeting that he believes Snipes failed to comply with the law in multiple  counts and called for her removal.  </p><p> Jeb was the one that appointed her in 2003 to replace the previous  supervisor who had to be removed for similar problems.  </p><p> Meanwhile, on the national level, Senator Nelson and Governor Scott trading  nasty barbs, listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. BILL NELSON (D), CALIFORNIA:  Scott cannot oversee this process in a  fair and impartial way, and thus he should remove himself from any role in  the recount process.</p><p> GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  Our goal is that we follow the law.  We know  Brenda Snipes mixed illegal ballots with legal ballots.  We know they've  not let party officials in, the courts have said follow the law.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JENKINS:  If they do indeed get this recount started and meet that Thursday  deadline here in Broward County, Maria, lawyers tell me that they expect  the margin of error to be under that .25 percent and will be headed for a  hand recount after Thursday.  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Griff, thank you much.  Griff Jenkins this morning on  that.  </p><p> This is an incredible story, that now we see that Sinema has actually won  in Arizona and these other two are so close.  </p><p> I mean, Georgia, 60,000 votes sounds like a lot, but she's still fighting  in Georgia, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She is still fighting in Georgia, so -- but the Republicans know  definitively that they will still have a 51-seat majority in the Senate,  that's the take away from that.</p><p> But in terms of what's going on down in Florida, there's a history in  Broward County of problems there.  </p><p> I just want to point that out because Brenda Snipes seems to suggest that  people are attacking her and her character, well, there have been glitches,  mistakes, and even illegal ballot destruction in her county under her  supervision.</p><p> The -- a court ruling found in May, Broward Election Supervisor Brenda  Snipes illegally destroyed ballots from a 2016 congressional race with  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was trying to push off this primary challenger,  Tim Canova.  </p><p> So again, there's a history of problems there and raises the issue of if  you were the steward of the county when these problems happened, why was  she still there going into the midterms?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why is she saying that she's been on this job 15 years and this  is the first time she's getting attacked when we know darn well that there  have been issues in the past?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think that Miami Herald and all the newspapers in the State  of Florida write about these problems often and so now that she's in the  national spotlight, maybe it feels a little bit different.  </p><p> But there are issues there and they're front and center during the  midterms.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Count and recount.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll keep following that.  </p><p> We'll take a break.  When we come back, searching for deal, Vice President  Pence is looking to set a trade agreement with japan that would serve as a  model for other countries.  </p><p> General Jack Keane is here, he will weigh on that.  </p><p> And then on precedence and security, as drug lord, El Chapo, sees his day  in a New York Court.  He will be here today in New York to face that.</p><p> The very latest straight ahead.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Futures, indicating a bit of a bounce, this morning, after a sharp selloff  yesterday, Dow Industrials set to open up about 130 points that is one-half  of one percent, S&amp;P is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ with a gain of 57  points, good for gain of almost one percent out of the gate, this morning.  </p><p> This after the major indices took a big hit yesterday, a five percent  decline in Apple stock, took a chunk out of this market, that's a Dow  component and a NASDAQ component, the Dow was down 602 points at the close,  down better than two percent, S&amp;P was down about two percent, and the  NASDAQ with a 206-point selloff, was down almost 3 percent, yesterday.</p><p> In Europe this morning, the bouncing is continuing, the FT-100 is also  recovering along with stocks on Wall Street, that is up a quarter of a  percent, in London.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up almost half a percent  and the DAX Index in Germany, up three quarters of one percent, 87 points  higher.</p><p> Mixed performances in Asia, overnight, worst performer, Japan; Nikkei  Average down two percent, the Shanghai composite in China, up almost one  percent.</p><p> Crude oil slipping this morning, this after the price of oil closed lower,  yesterday, for 11 days in a row, the very latest on oil's bear market,  coming up.  It is down 20 percent from the highs, just 5 weeks ago.</p><p>Home Depot, reporting earnings this morning, they were better-than- expected, the improvement store out with double beat.  We will break it  down for you as the stock is up 2-1/4 percent, that's helping the Dow  Industrials for sure.</p><p> Zuckerberg won't go, the Facebook founder could be held in contempt after  declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.  And  another Tide controversy to report, the detergent's new packaging being  compared to a box of wine, we will get into all of that, coming up.</p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour, mounting pressure on China,  Vice President Mike Pence headed to Singapore, to talk trade, with the  Association of the Southeast Asian Nations.  Speaking with Japanese Prime  Minister Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo, yesterday, the Vice President took a strong  stance on China, ahead of the President's meeting with President Xi, at the  end of the month.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States seeks a  relationship with China that's based on fairness, reciprocity and respect  for sovereignty.  The difficulties that the United States and other nations  face with China have been well documented by our administration.  And China  knows where we stand.</p><p> Nevertheless, President Trump is looking forward to his meeting with  President Xi, in Argentina.  He believes that progress could be made, but  either way, we're confident that the United States remains in a strong  position.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that is FOX News  Strategic Senior Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to see  this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p> GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to  see you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you were just in Singapore, a few months ago, meeting with  leadership there, your take on the Vice President's comments and how  Singapore and the U.S. can team up here?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, yes, they're very concerned.  I just came back from Vietnam  this weekend also, they are very concerned about what China has been doing  in the region for years, and largely getting away with it.  You know,  because, the United States had never truly engaged competitively against  China.</p><p> And they think that we have a long way to make up for it, but they truly  appreciate the fact that the United States is back in the game, so to  speak, and they're pushing back on China's economic and political warfare  and also their militarization, particularly, the South China Sea.</p><p> And I think Vice President Pence's Seminole speech, a few weeks ago, on  China, caught everybody's attention in the Indo-Pacific.  And that was a  huge step forward for the United States, but most importantly for our  relationship with our allies.</p><p> So, I think Vice President Pence will be very welcome by the ASEAN leaders,  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and I think he will get positive  feedbacks for the fact that President Trump is, once again, exercising  American leadership in the region.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General, the President really has to walk a balance here,  because while pushing back on China, trying to get them to change their  behavior, it also could impact business.  We've got the CEO of Boeing  coming in here, this morning, to talk about his business.  In the coming  year and years, one in four or five planes made at Boeing, will go to  China.</p><p> This is the second largest market for Boeing, and that's just in the  aerospace maker, I mean, there are tons of other companies, as well,  looking to China for opportunities, so how does the President walk that  balance?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, I think, there has to be a balance.  Listen, clearly, China  is a major market and American businesses will continue to do work there,  to be sure, but I think what the President has done and illuminated the  issue in trying to find the balance and stop stealing our intellectual  property, stop -- </p><p> If you have to do business in China, as you well know, Maria, you've got to  enter into a joint venture with them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  That's not the way we do business in Europe or in the Middle East,  and as a result to that joint venture, they get access to our intellectual  property.  That's got to stop.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.</p><p> KEANE:  So, I think -- I think if we continue to do business, that's fine,  but let's get it on a balance table where it's much more equitable and it's  kind of the way we do business in other parts of the world.  I will tell  you this, a lot of the supply chain that exists in China, and from American  businesses and other businesses are looking to go elsewhere.</p><p> And in Vietnam, that I just came back from, they are reaping some of the  benefits of that, as will other nations in the region.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean -- I guess business has been dealing with, you  know, succumbing to China and handing over their technology and going by  their rules for so long that they forgot how unfair it was.  Look, the  other major point in the Vice President's statement yesterday, was on North  Korea.  Watch this, got to get your reaction.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PENCE:  The President has made it clear that the time for implementing the  agreement is not a driving factor.  And as I assured you, Mr. Prime  Minister, the pressure campaign will continue, the sanctions will remain in  full force, until we achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of  North Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  New satellite images reportedly show that North Korea is moving  ahead with its nuclear program after Kim Jong-un's agreement with President  Trump, so your take on these developments, General?  What now?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, first of all, the Vice President's visit to Japan and talking  to Prime Minister Abe, I will tell you what, he got an earful from him  because that's the person that President Trump do talks in any other world  leader and he truly gives him very good perspective on what's going on in  North Korea and China.</p><p> Listen, the North Koreans, in principle, have agreed to denuclearized, in  fact, they have not taken a single step to do that.  What we wanted out of  the box was; one, give us an inventory of all of your sites and your  weapons themselves, two, give us a plan to destroy and disarm ballistic  missiles and nuclear weapons that has not happened.</p><p> And what we have to stay focused on, is the third thing, there's not been a  single ballistic missile or nuclear weapon that has been disarmed or  destroyed.  So while this progress on the fringes and there are a lot of  positive statements, the reality is, in terms of what needs to be done,  there hasn't been any substantive progress.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And for the U.S., what does that mean?  Should the U.S. be  doing something different in terms of our strategy to get the  denuclearization back on track?</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, that's a great question, and certainly that's something that  the National Security team of this administration is working on.  I would  suggest, one, we've got to -- we've got to get tough on China because  they've opened the aperture on the sanctions, and some of that backdoors  are happening.</p><p> The Russians have always backdoored North Korea.  We're not going to make  any progress with them.  The State Department has to make certain that the  other nations are not giving up, there's no missiles flying, there's no  tests being taken, there's a -- there's no sense of a crisis, so we have to  make sure the other countries are enforcing the sanctions.</p><p> And we've got to up our game ourselves and we can do that militarily, start  moving some things into the region, make sure that they know that we're  dead serious, it's either you give us the weapons, Mr. Chairman of North  Korea, or we're going to come take the weapons, that's the deal that's on  the table.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask you about oil, in that vein, President  Trump took aim at Saudi Arabia yesterday, after reports that the country  plans to cut oil production.  The President tweeted this yesterday,  hopefully Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production.  Oil  prices should be much lower based on supply.</p><p> Look, we know, General, that the U.S. has become one of the leading  producers at this point, and now, with the Saudis and OPEC, wanting to cut  production, they're trying to boost prices because it's in a bear market  right now, 20 percent lower from the highs.</p><p> KEANE:  Yes.  Well, this consensus in the last OPEC meeting, even the so- called Russian cartel, you know, they felt it was going to be a cutback  obviously, in Iranian crude, on the market and as a result of that, the  Russian cartel increased prices, but then this consensus developing now,  that there's going to be an oversupply in 2019.</p><p> I suspect -- the Saudis have made a decision to cut -- I think OPEC will  cut next month, in Vienna, and the Russians will likely follow suit.   That's the path that we are on.  I don't think there's anything that's  going to change it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I have been expecting a change in Homeland Security.  I know  that the Washington Post is reporting that Kirstjen Nielsen, Homeland  Security Secretary, is out, and I was hearing the same thing actually, that  they've already had the discussion.</p><p> My sources told me that they've already had the conversation that the  Secretary is going to be out of that job in -- as the President changes its  administration after the midterms, your thoughts on Kirstjen Nielsen being  out?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, I don't know anything about that, on the inside, honestly.   But I do know what I'm looking at and clearly, the administration has got  to be very frustrated with the open border that we have because there are  hundreds of people coming through every week, who are coming, seeking  asylum, and we have to release them.</p><p> And that's what's happening, because our system is so backed up with people  who are waiting to be processed.  The so-called catch and release, it's  hundreds, happening every week.  We are focused on the caravan to be sure,  but the equivalent to a caravan, is happening every month.</p><p> And that's got the administration's focus because they get daily reports on  all of this, and I think they are just genuinely dissatisfied with where  things are.  Certainly, the Congress is part of this problem, but it's not  the only part of the problem.  And I think that's likely what's driving the  replacements.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the President -- the President cancelled the trip this  week, with Kirstjen Nielsen, to the southern border, in Texas.  Now,  that's, I guess, the Washington Post is saying this is the impetus.  But,  you know, as you say, he's been very frustrated with her, because of the  open borders, but she says it's a Congress problem.  She can't do anything  different because this is the law, General.</p><p> So, the President's frustrated with the person who is in the job, but  doesn't -- aren't her hands tied?</p><p> KEANE:  Her hands are somewhat tied.  But I suspect, now, this is just  speculation on my part, I suspect that the President has received some  advice from other advisers who are saying there are some other options that  we could be putting into play here, and certainly, having resources to cope  with the problem.</p><p> So we're not catching and release, would likely be a start.  And  increasingly, how we process these people in getting their hearings, would  be another part of the puzzle.  I just suspect that over time, there's been  a loss of confidence here if what you're reporting is accurate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  There is going to be a replacement.  I think it's largely  immigration issue.  I don't even think it has to do with -- it's one of the  largest -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, you're right.</p><p> KEANE:  departments in government.  I don't think that has to do with  anything else.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  It's totally the immigration issue, 100  percent, that's what I'm hearing.  But real quick, General, before you go,  any thoughts on who might replace her?</p><p> KEANE:  No, I have no idea.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  General, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so  much.</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  As always, General Jack Keane, joining us there.  Coming up,  Zuckerberg skips out, why the Facebook founder could be held in contempt,  after declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.   And then, first Tide pods, now this, the internet goes crazy over Tide's  new detergent design, it looks like a case of boxed wine, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The trial of El Chapo set to begin today in New  York.  Lauren Simonetti with the details now, Lauren.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  The notorious Mexican drug lord will be in a Brooklyn federal  court this morning with unprecedented security for the jurors and for  Joaquin El Chapo Guzman himself.  Security will include snipers perched on  rooftops and an armored vehicle to transport Guzman.  He's accused of  spending quarter century smuggling more than 150 tons of cocaine into the  U.S.  He was extradited from Mexico last year after escaping prison two  times.  The trial expected to last more than four months.  Prosecutors say,  the evidence will include the testimony of over a dozen witnesses.  </p><p> Well, a Canadian politician says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be held  in contempt after he refused to appear before an international panel of  five governments that are investigating the company.  That politicians says  he might issue subpoena forcing Zuckerberg to appear before Canada's  parliament.  Zuckerberg had rejected an earlier request to appear before an  international grand committee looking into disinformation and election  meddling.  Facebook not commenting, shares of the company up $1.23 this  morning.</p><p> Well, Procter &amp; Gamble may have another packaging problem.  The company  debut its eco-box, which happens to look a lot like a wine box but that new  Tide box is generating some buzz on Twitter.  This is what one user wrote:  \"You all don't want kids eating Tide pods but when you make a wine box  tide, what do you want from me?  Well, he was referring to the Tide pod  challenge last year when teenagers were daring each other to eat the  detergent pods but would you drink the Tide wine?  I don't know, I hope  that's not an adult challenge coming up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was a crazy story.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They were eating the pods.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  But looks like a wine box, right?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It does.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  I have freshman in college, and I'm frightened right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Where do you think that stuff happens, right?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a keg, not a wine box.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, owing the best for your friends; how Petco plans to  provide your pet with only health foods.  That's next, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, President Trump just tweeting this, we want to  get this out: \"Emmanuel Macron suggesting building its own army to protect  Europe against the United States, China and Russia, but it was Germany in  World Wars I and 2.  How did that work for France?  They're starting to  learn German in Paris before U.S. came along.  Pay for NATO or not!\"  The  president taking about his meetings and NATO pay your fair share, once  again, this morning.  </p><p> Meanwhile there's this, putting your pet first which we all do here on this  program.  Petco becomes the only major retailer of pet supplies to ensure  healthy food for your furry family members.  In a first on Fox Business  announcement, the company is revealing it will not sell foods or treats  containing artificial colors, flavors and preservatives for dogs and cats  by May of 2019.  Joining us right is the CEO of Petco, Ron Couglin, and  it's good to see you, Ron.  </p><p> RON COUGHLIN, CEO, PETCO:  It's great to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  I was telling you during  commercial break, I only used to serve Ellabela steamed string beans as  treats and she died at almost 18 years old.  She lived a long and strong  life as a result.  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  You what's amazing, over 50 percent of pet owners, cook for  their pets.  We were talking about it earlier.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Only 50 percent.</p><p> COUGHLIN:  Over 50 percent.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  And we're bringing human grade food actually into Petco shortly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about what you're doing?  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  Yes.  So, the big announcement today is that we're going to be  eliminating all cat and dog foods and treats with artificial flavors,  artificial colors, artificial preservatives.  You know, if you think about  the bet we love, do we want ethanol to be served to them, do we want sulfur  dioxide, do we want (INAUDIBLE), so the answer is no.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And those are in most pet foods?  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  Those are in certain pet foods.  Now, the reality is, Petco has  been weening off those products, other companies have much higher percent  of those foods.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen, Charlie and Ramon don't eat those, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, they eat a food that you can't buy at Petco.  They eat blue  buffalo basic, limited ingredient, grain-free canned food and also -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And also, I.D. which is prescription and you're going to begin  to sell prescription dog food. </p><p> COUGHLIN:  That's right.  This week, we started doing prescription dog food  on Petco.com.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, big response from customers?  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  Yes, we've seen response thus far, but today is our announcement  day, so we're very proud of it.  It's big deal for the industry.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's higher premium that people will pay.  It's amazing  to me how much money people spend on their dogs and their cats.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anything -- most of my dogs have gastro, severe gastro  intestinal problems, so anything to keep them healthy but you were talking  about -- you're going to actually start selling cooked food, literally  human food for animals?  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, humanization is one of the biggest trends,  folks like you but you don't always have time.  So, what we're going to do  is we're partnered with company called Just Food for Dogs, and we actually  are going to have kitchens.  Union Scare, right here, is going to have a  kitchen where we cook for your dog; you can come in and get fresh food  every day for your dog.  My dog right now is having salmon and sweet  potatoes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Lucky dog.  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  So, if you're having salmon and sweet potatoes, your pet should  have it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And does this make a difference in the dog's life?  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  Absolutely, it's all vet-driven mixtures.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can't feed them too much, though, because they'll get fat  and that's a huge problem, obesity in animals.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Ron, real quick, we've been talking about the Petco Foundation,  maybe a little bit on that.  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, we're very proud of the Petco Foundation,  especially in times and of hurricanes, fires, et cetera.  We go in and take  care of the pets, we give free food, we give funding to the shelters.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Ron.  That's fantastic.  Great, check out  Petco.  Ron Coughlin, thank you for joining us.  Still ahead, a diamond fit  for a ring, we will show you more of this ring designed by Apple's chief  designer; it's made entirely out of diamond, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It -- I mean it loks like a nuclear blast went off here.  It's crazy.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will take you live to southern California with the very  latest coming up.</p><p> New questions for Boeing this morning.  A new report says that the jet  maker withheld information on its 737, the same model involved in the  deadly Indonesia crash last month.  Boeing's chairman and CEO Dennis  Muilenburg will join me in a Fox Business exclusive this morning.  That's  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that interview coming up.</p><p> And a scare on the court, a Nets player suffers a gruesome injury leaving  people in the crowd in tears.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PWC partner Mitch  Roschelle and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see  everybody this morning.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for being here after a huge day yesterday in  markets.  Look, we're in a good earnings period, Lindsey, and yet the  market trades down 600 points on these growth concerns.  What's going on?  </p><p> BELL:  Yes. Growth is the big question mark for 2019.  Look, we're cycling  the tax reform package, fiscal stimulus is coming to a peak right now as we  look out to 2019, interest rates are rising.  It seems like global growth  could be slowing especially with China.</p><p> So the question is where do earnings go from here?  We're looking right now  at 8.5 percent growth for 2019, that's down from 10 percent that we saw all  through earlier this year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Revenue?  </p><p> BELL:  Revenue, it actually ticked up a slight bit to 6.3 percent which is  pretty good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're talking about earnings of 10 percent.  </p><p> BELL:  Earnings of 8.5 percent for 2019.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  </p><p> BELL:  Came down -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's way down.  No wonder markets are upset about things  slowing down.  For 2018 -- talking about earnings being up 25 percent;  going down to 8 percent in 2019.  </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  But so much of that was a one-timer from tax  reform.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And I think what the market isn't really fully digesting is the  forward guidance is in a new tax regime year over year mode.  And a lot of  people looking at the difference between the 20 plus percent earnings  growth in '18 and then less than 10 percent in '19 and they're having a  hard time digesting it.</p><p> We should put like -- maybe they should just watch this show and hear us  say this enough.  Because there's really no reason to freak out.  These are  still strong earnings numbers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BELL:  Yes.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  But a lot of this, I would  argue, is higher interest rates and the Federal Reserve still in the  process of winding down that multitrillion dollar balance sheet where  you've seen a deflation in assets, not just in the stock market, in the  last six weeks or so.</p><p> But look at what oil has done, down 11 days in a row.  That is a record  streak for declines in the cost of crude oil.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There are a lot of things at play, maybe actual supply and  demand fundamentals, but also money just coming out of this was clearly an  over-inflated asset.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then there's Apple, we'll talk about that.  What do the  price of oil and Apple tell you about the broader economy.</p><p> Coming up, my exclusive interview this morning with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk to him about what he's  seeing in the global economy, of course, commercial aerospace has been on  fire.</p><p> Joining the conversation this morning, House majority whip and Louisiana  Congressman Steve Scalise is here.  He's out with a new book.  Congressman- Elect Michael Waltz will join us, Green Beret.  And the CEO of the Mayo  Clinic is back, Dr. John Noseworthy, with some news today.  The host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney here as well.</p><p> We've got a big two hours coming up.  Don't miss a moment of it because we  are reporting this morning the news of the day.</p><p> Our top story right now is that sharp selloff in stocks.  Futures are  higher this morning as the technology sector tries to recover from a sharp  decline yesterday.  It pulled the markets lower, knocking off more than 600  points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p> Yesterday it was a sharp selloff and Apple really drove things, drove a  technology slump.</p><p> Now today, this morning it is unchanged after taking a hit amid fresh  concerns over the demand for the iPhone.</p><p> Joining us right now is Scott Martin.  He is Kingsview Asset Management  CIO.  Scott -- good to see you this morning.  I know you've had your share  of worries out there for markets.  Is yesterday's performance telling us  anything about what's ahead?  </p><p> SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Probably.  You know, you're  right, Maria -- without the markets I've got enough to worry about.  So  thank you markets for making that even more compounded.  </p><p> Listen, I love what you guys talked about there in the intro to the hour.   Lindsey is absolutely right.  You know, the revenue numbers estimates have  come down, the earnings estimates have come down.</p><p> Mitch is right, too.  You know, guys -- I started some meditation over the  last couple of weeks so you should definitely try that at home, kids.  I  think that has helped me with some of the worries -- Maria.</p><p> And the market needs stop freaking out.  You know, that's the thing like --  kind of like they say in the meditation, be calm because even though  earnings like you said, Maria, and you pointed out astutely are not growing  at 20 plus percent, guess what, kids -- that was unsustainable.  I mean  those weren't numbers that we're going to keep repeating.</p><p> But the market maybe got fooled into thinking that or let's just say we got  valuation metrics that seemed to be aligned with the thinking that that was  going to continue.</p><p> So as we alight or let's say descend back to reasonable numbers and  reasonable economic growth expectation, Lindsey mentioned interest rates  going up and so forth, the market needs to settle into some price here and  then I think it can rebuild some of these losses.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Scott, is there -- if you want to be defensive or if you want  to stay in the market but not have to meditate and do yoga to stay calm --  where's the place to be right now?</p><p> MARTIN:  Yes, and I haven't found any good yoga or meditation stocks yet,  Mitch, but I'm still looking for them.  You know, there are places to be  and that's a great thing to point out, you know.  This is not a total  freak-out selloff, even kind of like we saw in February just yet or even  like we saw over Brexit or even like we saw, you know, back in the late  2000s, you know, 2008 and so on, because there are things that are working,  specifically -- and we haven't bought enough of this stuff yet but we're  accruing it.</p><p> Look at consumer staples, look at real estate.  Look at utilities.  You  know, if interest rates come down because people like say with the freak- out, you know, they freak-out and they buy bonds, they buy fixed income  instruments and that drives down interest rates.  Some of these interest  rate sensitive names tend to hang in there when equity markets go like they  did yesterday.  </p><p> So Mitch -- I would say those are three good sectors for the individual  investors at home to look at that we start to pick up as well that have  started to mitigate some of the volatility.  </p><p> BELL:  Hey -- Scotty.  So you mentioned a lot of defensive sectors there  which as you rightly point out they've been doing well more recently.  But  what hasn't been doing well is tech.  and that is what led the market over  the past two years.  </p><p> Right now you have two -- three quarters of the S&amp;P 500 tech sector in bear  market territory.  Do we need the tech sector though to continue to move  this bull market higher?  </p><p> MARTIN:  We need something to, Lindsey and I'll tell you that's the  interesting point is you had these great leadership names -- you know, your  favorite ones and ones we still own.  You know, Google, Apple, Microsoft,  Amazon, Netflix, Whatever, Broadcom, Adobe -- great companies that were  crushing earnings and getting high valuations, again like we talked about  that were probably undeserved. </p><p> And now Lindsey -- the market has no leadership, you know.  Everybody has  been calling in the so-called experts, have said, oh my gods, this is the  time for financials because the Fed is hiking interest rates.  When the  reality for the most part, they were just flattening the interest rate  curve.</p><p> And so to me, it needs leadership.  I don't know if it's tech necessarily.   I was hoping for a while there it was going to be industrials because we  were hopefully going to get some of these trade deals reworked and more in  our favor and that was going to work out for some of the companies like  Deere, Caterpillar and some of the other ones we own.</p><p> But maybe it's health care.  That gets worked out with you know, maybe a  bipartisan congress.  Who knows?  But I think you're right, Lindsey.  It  doesn't necessarily have to be tech but it has to be some leadership in  some other sector to take the reins of this market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, what about financials?  I mean that's probably tough  because you've got higher rates going on.  Tech is where the growth has  been.  </p><p> MARTIN:  Yes.  Higher rates are interesting, Maria -- because even though  the fed's been hiking interest rates, rates did get a nice boost as we saw,  you know, into October and then they've kind of fallen off a bit.  I mean  look at, you know, last week we were at 3.25 again on the 10 year and now I  think I checked this morning we're at 3.15.</p><p> So, you know,, financials kind of remind me of all the girls that turned me  down in high school.  I had to bring that up.  Because they're never there,  you know.  Like financials every year we hear somebody make this bold call  on financials being there and being the one, and they're never doing it.</p><p> So to me I'm not ready to give up on financials but as far as overweighting  financials, I won't do that either.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, what about Amazon, the split decision expected to divide  its second headquarters between evenly between New York City and northern  Virginia.  According to the Journal this morning, the announcement is  probably -- could come as early as today.</p><p> Is this a smart decision?  What are your thoughts here?  Would you put new  money to work in this market right here?  </p><p> MARTIN:  Yes, we would.  I would slowly start weighting it again.  I don't  think that, you know, you have to jump in on a day like today where, you  know, we had a little bit of mixed trading overseas, especially in the  Nikkei, for example as you pointed out all morning.  And we've got a little  bit of a bounce today.</p><p> But I mean guys, even Eli Manning had a decent football game last night.   So the market can bounce just like that as well.</p><p> But I think Maria -- there's some levels that are coming into play here  that are decent as far as some of these tech names that have sold off 20,  25 percent.  So I think you can start weighting in here with some money but  just have a quick kind of hook on it if things start to get worse again  because you may get some lower prices.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Scott always a pleasure.   Thanks so much for weighing in here.</p><p> MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Scott Martin joining us there.</p><p> Turning to the devastation in California right now, the wildfires are  becoming the deadliest in state history.  Fox News' Ray Bogan is in Ventura  County this morning with the very latest.  Good morning to you -- ray.  </p><p> RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Maria -- good morning.  </p><p> We're at the incident command center for the Woolsey and Hill Fires where  in just a couple of hours, hundreds of firefighters will arrive to get  their morning briefing.  They're working 24 hour shifts.</p><p> In the meantime, some of them are sleeping in tents.  One man is even over  to my left in a sleeping bag.</p><p> Now, in northern California, investigators are looking into whether a  sparking PG&amp;E power line may have started the Camp Fire which has become  the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state's history.  42 people  have died.  They've been found in their homes and cars as they were trying  to escape. </p><p> At last update, the fire was 30 percent contained and Cal Fire doesn't  expect to have full containment for another week.  Nearly 6,500 homes have  been destroyed, including some belonging to firefighters and their  families.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID HAWKE, PARADISE FIRE CHIEF:  It's just absolutely heart-breaking to  drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.  My family lost  their home in the fire.  My parents did.  My grandmother did.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOGAN:  Now, here in southern California, the Woolsey Fire at last update  was 93,000 acres and 30 percent contained.  Firefighters estimate more than  400 buildings have been destroyed.</p><p> In both fires crews are working against dry, windy conditions and steep  terrain but California is getting help.  President Trump has approved a  major disaster declaration and in addition, Cal Fire is thanking 17 state  partners that have come from as far as Alaska and Georgia.  Maria, back to  you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right Ray.  Thank you so much.  We will follow this.  And  this is an incredibly devastating story.  Ray -- thank you.  Ray Bogan  there.  </p><p> Coming up, concerns in the sky.  The new report that Boeing withheld  information on its 737.  The same model involved in the deadly Indonesia  crash last month.  I'll speaking exclusively with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing this morning.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk about that  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern and also get his take on the on the commercial  aerospace boom he's been seeing.  Over the last few years.</p><p> Then an injury on the court, the details after a player's gruesome leg  injury leaves some in tears, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> New information coming to light this morning following last month's crash  of a Boeing jet in Indonesia.  Lauren Simonetti with the Details now --  Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hi -- Maria, Boeing reportedly withheld  information on the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max which killed all 189 people  on-board that day.  Safety experts and others telling the \"Wall Street  Journal\" that Boeing didn't tell airlines about potential hazards in their  new flight control feature on that plane.  The problem is that the system  can push the plane's nose down so strongly that pilots can't pull it back  up.</p><p> The automated stall prevention system is being investigated as playing a  role in that Lion Air crash.  Shares of Boeing trading up a quarter of a  percent, $358.  And programming note -- Maria will sit down with Boeing's  chairman, CEO and president Dennis Muilenburg in the next hour on Morning's  with Maria, 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p> Well, the Labor Department is trying to help people save money and curb  401-k cash-outs.  The department could soon allow companies to  automatically transfer (INAUDIBLE) accounts of $5,000 or less belonging to  employees who change jobs to the 401-k plan of their new employers.  It's  the effort to cut down on the premature flow of money out of retirement  plans.  Research shows that as many as 80 percent of people leaving jobs  with less than $5,000 in those accounts eventually cash out of them.</p><p> Well, check this out.  Apple's head designer, Johnnie Ives, has taken on a  project more elegant than your iPhone.  He designed a ring carved from a  single chunk of diamond.  It could sell for a quarter million dollars at an  auction at Sotheby's.  Sotheby's says the ring has up to 3,000 facets,  never seen before on a single piece.  It will be made to fit the buyer, up  to a size 5, which is actually pretty small.  All of those proceeds going  to charity.  But most designers start with the metal.  Johnnie Ives took  the metal out of the equation and started with the diamonds.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow -- so it's all diamond all around.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  All diamonds -- Baby.  And diamonds are my birth stone.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they are a girl's best friend.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can hear the woman.  How are they supposed to know it's  diamonds?  You know, you can't tell.  Sorry.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  All right.  Thank you -- Lauren.</p><p> Coming up, the state of health care in America.  The CEO of the Mayo Clinic  Dr. John Noseworthy is here.  He's weighing in on the industry innovations,  plus an exclusive announcement that will change health care, certainly at  the Mayo Clinic -- that's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A major investment in the future of health care in America.   The Mayo Clinic School of Medicine receiving a $200 million gift from  philanthropist Jay Alix, the largest ever made to the clinic.</p><p> Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive are Alix Partners founder  Jay Alix and Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. John Noseworthy.  Great to see you both.   Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> JAY ALIX, FOUNDER, ALIX PARTNERS:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p> DR. JOHN NOSEWORTHY, CEO, MAYO CLINIC:  Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Jay -- what a gift.  Congratulations to you that you're  able to do such a thing for the Mayo Clinic.  </p><p>ALIX:  Absolutely.</p><p> You know, Mayo is such a he deserving institution.  The medical school is  one of the top ranked medical schools in the country.  And to be able to be  involved with them, to help them with their mission is just a really great  opportunity for us.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this is going to help the medical school a lot, Dr.  Noseworthy.  And you're also going to be able to attract new talent with  this.  </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  Thanks -- Maria.  Yes, this is really going to help us a great  deal, attract the best students from all over the world, from all  backgrounds regardless of their ability to pay for medical education. </p><p> And it will help us with new curriculum and dual degrees and innovative  ways of teaching and technology and all those good things.  It's a  wonderful gift.  We're really grateful to Jay.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you are now going to be on the board.</p><p>ALIX:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you want to see from the Mayo Clinic and how this  money could be best used.  </p><p>ALIX:  Well, what this gift is about is really helping attract the best  students for the medical school, to train the doctors of the future.  The  country is facing a crisis that we're going to need probably 110,000  doctors in the next 10 years that we don't have today and we don't know  where they're going to come from.</p><p> So we need to train more doctors and we have to provide the money and the  support and the scholarship to help those students get into medical school  and have the country have the right doctors in the future.  Mayo can do  that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  It was major issue in this past election,  everybody said that health care was the number one matter that was very  important to voters.  The Democrats taking the House in the midterm  elections.  And they say one of the priorities is health care in America.</p><p> So John -- tell us where the needs are right now.  Tell us what your view  is in terms of what needs to be done to take health care up to the next  level.  </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  So the majority of Americans are concerned about access,  coverage, and the cost of health care and the need for transparency to  drive down the cost but also improve the outcomes.  And we support all of  that.</p><p> From Mayo Clinic's perspective, it's more than cost.  It's certainly cost  but it's also outcomes and the performance and how well health care  performs.  And at Mayo Clinic we're all about serious and complex illness  and how to finance as quickly and effectively and provide patients with the  best possible care.</p><p> So the doctors of the future are going to have to deal with transparency,  coverage cost, access, technology, how to drive the safest and highest  technology, most affordable health care system which we don't have at the  moment, as you know.  We're tied to these election cycles every two years.   So it's this and that and this and that and until the country decides that  it's really a priority for the citizens, we're not going to get that long- lasting answer that we need.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you talk about outcomes.  You know, we've been all about  prevention these last several years, talking about getting ahead of  disease.  How might that money be used toward getting ahead of disease and  when you look at the needs in this country today.  I mean I know we haven't  done enough work or we need more money for Alzheimer's, for example.  And  you know, issues related to the brain.  Where are the needs in that regard?  </p><p>ALIX:  Well, I think we have really leading edge technologies now.  We have  artificial intelligence coming online.  What A.I. is going to do for  medicine and the digitization of medical, you know, personal health data is  going to revolutionize how we can do diagnosis.  And of course with it, you  know, early intervention, diagnosis and prevention we can really change  outcomes for all people who have serious complex medical problems.  And  Mayo is leading the way on that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you made because A.I. is  able to work with doctors to improve the outcomes.  Isn't that right?  </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  That's absolutely right.  And I think it's also prediction.   It's early diagnosis but it's also predictive genomics, if you will.   Knowing what we know about people, who is likely to be at risk for this or  that so you can diagnose it early.  It's all of that together.  </p><p> And the young kids who want to do medicine, want to have a life of service,  they need to have that kind of an education to prepare them for that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What have you done differently in terms of A.I. at the clinic?  </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  We have well over 100 projects trying to predict how to read  x-rays better, how to predict from genomics, how things will play out.   We're working into everyday life at Mayo Clinic, monitoring patients'  hearts, who is at risk for heart disease, that sort of thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this money will go toward getting new students who will be  looking at A.I. as part of their curriculum, very different than the  doctors in the past.  </p><p>ALIX:  Exactly.  Medical education is going to have to evolve quickly now  and keep up the new technologies, new breakthroughs in science and apply it  right into the clinic for people.  Mayo Clinic can lead the way on that  with this gift and with the research and development it has.</p><p> Mayo has three shields with clinical care, education and research and the  combination of all those three working together is what this gift will  allow Mayo to do.  </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  We'll be offering a masters of artificial intelligence.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Masters of A.I. </p><p> NOSEWORTHTY:  Masters of A.I. and masters of regenerative science, and  masters of advanced biotechnology and bioengineering.  All of these, the  new wave will be right in the curriculum plus the (INAUDIBLE) start willing  to spend say an extra year to get that additional training.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Before we go, where have you seen the most progress in terms of  outcomes in terms of disease?  Is it cancer?  Is it somewhere else?  Heart  disease?  Where have you seen the biggest -- </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  I think it's in all the serious illnesses -- Maria.  We're  actually measuring outcomes much better, the quantitation of outcomes,  quality of life, life expectancy, readmission to hospital, all of those  things that are now being put on score cards to see what is the investment  to health care doing to reduce the costs and prove the outcome so that  quantitative outcomes research, it's still in its infancy, but it's  absolutely critical if we're going to have the best health care system in  the world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And particularly as you see spending from the NIH  dropping, you need private investors and private practitioners to come in  and help the situation. </p><p> And here comes you-- Jay Alix.  Thank you so much.  Great to see you both.   Thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>ALIX:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dr. John Noseworthy and Jay Alix joining us there.</p><p> Coming up, Congress returns to Washington.

I spoke with House Majority  leader Kevin McCarthy this weekend along with Congressman David Cicilline  on Democrats the \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" program about the agenda going  forward.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Well, we'll want to  find common ground.  We will look to make sure we continue to make our  military strong, make sure that we can combat China and others of their  aggressive actions and also when it comes to trade expanding, we want to  find places that we can find common ground.  But those place that's we  principally disagree with, we will stand up strongly to show America the  difference to make assuring that we can continue to grow this country.  </p><p> REP. DAVID CICILLINE (R), RHODE ISLAND:  Democrats ran on a very specific  agenda.  I helped craft it with my co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and  Communications Committee.  It's an -- it's an agenda for the people on this  country.  It's focusing on driving down the cost of health care, driving  down the cost of prescription drugs, protecting coverage for pre-existing  condition, raising family incomes by rebuilding our country with a serious  infrastructure plan for our roads, bridges, ports, transit systems, we'll  create 16 million good paying jobs.  And taking on the corruption in  Washington by getting money out of our political system.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Congressman-elect, or Florida's 6th  Congressional district and former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel Michael  Waltz.  Lieutenant Colonel, good to see you this morning.  Congratulations  to you and thank you for joining us.  </p><p> LT. COL. MICHAEL WALTZ (R), CONGRESSMAN-ELECT, FLORIDA:  Thank you.  Yes,  thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, let's talk first about the new Congress and what  you expect to get done now working with the Democrats.  </p><p> WALTZ:  Well, you know, one of the things that I'm very excited about in  this Congress is the amount of veterans that are running on both sides of  the aisle.  I think that's something that's really resonated with voters.   They understand that veterans know how to get things done.  They're not as  ideological.  You know, I can tell you Maria, in the fox hole, nobody cares  about party, race, religion, social economic background, the enemy's  bullets certainly don't care.  </p><p> And you know, I think you're going to see an approach or at least at an  ethos where compromise isn't a dirty word.  Where we can move the country  forward because you're going to have folks.  Right now, we're at a record  low in our nation's history at around 17 percent of veterans in Congress.   I think that's going to increase.  You're going to see people focused on  mission, on country and on getting things done.  That's what I heard from  hundreds of thousands of doors that people want results.  They don't want  resistance.  And they expect their elected representatives to accomplish  what they set out to do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, I guess, should we expect defense spending to stay elevated  then?  </p><p> WALTZ:  I think so.  You know, I can tell you from firsthand experience  after 17 years of war our military, our equipment is exhausted.  You have  pilots that are younger than the planes that they're flying.  And we face  unprecedented threats between Russia, China and still a metastasizing  growing Islamic extremism problem.  So, I think we're going to have to.   There's really not a choice there.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  One of the huge issues  though, Congressman-elect, it's Dagen McDowell.  Good to see you again.  </p><p> WALTZ:  Thanks Dagen, yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is that the U.S. is on course to spend more on the interest on  our debt than even on defense spending.  That's going to happen about four  to five years from now.  So in order to make sure that our military is  sound in terms of it's our financial support, we need to figure out how  we're going to rein in spending elsewhere.  What's your plan on that?  </p><p> WALTZ:  Well so, there's two ways, right, to -- you know, I'm a business  owner as well as a veteran and there's two ways to deal with debt.  You  deal with it with growth and with cutting spending.  I think President  Trump's absolutely spot-on on what he's doing to grow the economy as a  business owner himself.  And then I think you need members that have the  fortitude to stand up and take on -- to take on spending.  Not only do I  support the military but I also hold the Pentagon accountable for when  there is -- when there's waste involved in their spending in all government  agencies.  </p><p> But Dagen, we both know that on the one hand you have the discretionary  spending and then you have the nondiscretionary spending and what gets at  the heart of that is the cost of health care.  We have to take -- I'm very  -- I'm fascinated to see if the Democrats will take on what it takes to  lower the cost of care.  Tort reform, selling across state lines, going  into a free market system, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, really getting  serious about driving down the cost of care which would then make it more  accessible and affordable and help businesses like mine and help our debt.   .</p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Congressman, Mitch Roschelle.  One of the  things that concern business owners, my friend recently did a study of what  are on the mind of business leaders, and the number one thing that they're  looking for in a bipartisan way is cyber security.  And you talk about  defense spending.  I think they're interrelated.  Do you think that's an  area -- because I haven't heard much from Washington about policy around  protecting intellectual property.  You know, from -- not just from theft  but from a cyber security risk.  Is that something that you think could be  an agenda, especially, you know, more military people obviously they have a  pretty good sense of cyber warfare.  </p><p> WALTZ:  You know, I can -- I can tell you, watching China roll out its  sixth generation stealth fighter which looks exactly like ours, armed  drones which looks exactly like ours, underwater submersibles which look  like ours, doesn't sit well with veterans.  And they've essentially stolen  that intellectual property.  So, you know, this is -- this is about how the  private sector and the government come together in a way that's in line  with American values, not dictated from Washington.  </p><p> But look, I think we're getting to the point where we really have no choice  and the more business owners, the more veterans you have on the Hill that  understand those dynamics, I think the better.  So yes, that's something I  certainly want to take on.  </p><p> Look, we have to as a country.  We are having our technological edge be  stolen in front of our very eyes and at the -- you know, at the same time  this is something that President Trump I think has taken on, Republican  Congress needs to take it on.  And I hope the Democrats join us in that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what has taken place since the midterm  elections, Tuesday night.  There's still no winner for the state Senate.</p><p> WALTZ:  Less than a week.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's talk about Florida.  There's still no winner for the  gubernatorial and the state Senate race.</p><p> WALTZ:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The controversy over a recount is continuing this morning.   Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum has relinquished the race -- had  relinquished the race against Republican Ron DeSantis.  But he took that  back.  What do you think is going on here?  And what's your reaction to the  fact that in Arizona we see now a change in leadership post the midterms,  now Sinema is winning or won?  </p><p> WALTZ:  You know, in Florida this is so concerning.  Frankly, it's  embarrassing for our state.  It's two counties that year -- you know, cycle  after cycle we're having these problems.  It's incompetence at best.  It's  fraud, you know, frankly at worst, as many have alleged.  This is happening  year after year.  I think we need to see accountability when it comes to  these election officials.  I can tell you, I had four counties in my  district and the T's were crossed and the I's were dotted.  This is the --  this is the heart of our democracy.  As a veteran, this is what we fight to  defend and sacrifice to defend all over the world.  And they have -- they  have a solemn duty to get it right.  I'm glad to see so much attention but  -- on it.  But you know, once this is all said and done, I think you will  see Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott emerge as they currently are ahead.  There  needs to be some accountability afterwards so that we're not dealing with  this again in 2020.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to quickly point out something that Byron York  tweeted out that was mentioned on \"SPECIAL REPORT\" last night.  Like, Rick  Scott went into this, he was leading by 56,000 votes on election night,  tens of thousands of votes for the DeSantis lead going into this.  If a  recount reverses the initial margin of a few -- of more than a few hundred  votes it would be unprecedented, in the history of recent American  elections.  </p><p> WALTZ:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  According to FairVote, almost 4,700 state-wide elections between  2000 and 2016, only 26 of them went to a recount.  Of those 26, just three  recounts wound up changing the initial results of the race, it was one in  Washington, --</p><p> WALTZ:  Washington State.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- one in Vermont and one in Minnesota.  The average swing in  those three elections after the recounts, 311 votes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, watch these results.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is this largely because of Broward County?  </p><p> WALTZ:  Broward County and Palm Beach County.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WALTZ:  And this is -- but what has us so in sensed is this has been a  habitual problem.  This goes back to Bush versus Gore.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p> WALTZ:  And it happens cycle after cycle.  And what so many of us are  asking is, where is the accountability for these election officials?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're also asking that this morning.  Lieutenant colonel,  it's good to see you this morning, thanks very much.</p><p> WALTZ:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching as you take your post in the New Year.   Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz, Congressman-elect.  </p><p> Coming up, a nightmare on the court, the details after a player's gruesome  leg injury leaves some in tears, that's next.  </p><p> Then, Congress headed back to the Hill today, we break down how the  Democratic control of the House may impact your wallet.  Congressman Steve  Scalise is here.  Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, more of the NFL salute to service at Monday Night  Football.  Jared Max with the story now, Jared.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX SPORTS NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We have  been seeing NFL coaches wearing the Salute to Service gear, all available  for purchase at NFLShop.com.  Last night in Santa Clara, California, U.S.  Navy performed a flyover above Levi's Stadium.  Before the 49ers took on  the New York Giants, 49er's tightened George Kittle made sure to thank  every service member on the field last night.  Kittle amongst several  minors who donated game worn jerseys to raise money for the victims of the  wildfires.  Players, coaches and cheerleaders from Paradise High School  most now homeless from the fires, guests of the 49ers last night on the  field for the anthem.  </p><p> Before the Niners gave away 20-10 lead.  Giants' Q.B. Eli Manning tells his  critics I still got it.  Fourth quarter comeback, his first such win in two  years.  Odell Beckham Jr. dances the Carlton and Sterling Shepard with  catch the game winning score 27-23, Giants beat the Niners.  </p><p> Brooklyn Nets player Caris LeVert suffered a serious leg injury last night.   LeVert collided with Minnesota's Jeff Teague and came down hard on his leg.   He had to be carted off the court on a stretcher, hospitalized, no word on  the severity of this gruesome looking basketball injury.  </p><p> Golden State Warriors have a new plan, to allow around 200 more fans at its  home games.  The Warriors are selling monthly passes for fans to attend  games at Oracle Arena but -- but it's a really big but, the fans cannot  even see the court.  They can watch the game on T.V.  They can hear the  crowd roar.  And pay arena prices for booze and food and it only costs $100  a month.  Imagine that, Maria, you're paying $100 a month to get into the  arena to do what you can do at home, watch on T.V., minus the traffic.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.  I think they just want to be there for the  excitement of it but you can't see a darn thing.  Jared, thank you.</p><p> MAX:  Exactly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Catch Jared sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on  radio Sirius XM 115.</p><p> Quick break and then Washington and your wallet, how Democrats' control of  the House may impact your pocketbook.  That's next right here.  Congressman  Steve Scalise is with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're back for business, the House and the  Senate returning to Washington today for what will be an intense start to  the lame duck session.  Joining us right now is National Taxpayers Union  senior fellow and Center for a Free Economy board member Mattie Duppler.   Mattie, good to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p> MATTTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION:  Yes, good  morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we want to get a sense of what you believe can happen  between now and January, this next seven weeks, can the current Congress  get anything done knowing that they're going to have new pressures come  January with the House leadership?  </p><p> Bbb Maria, that is the perfect question to be asking.  Right now there's  been a lot of attention on what Democrats will do when they finally control  the House Chamber coming in in January.  But you're right, there are  several weeks of work still to be done.  </p><p> I'm watching a couple of different things here.  One is what happens on the  next betting decision, on December 7th parts of the government funding will  expire.  And that means Democrats have a choice to make.  Do they want to  be party that shows they can govern or will they take their heels in and  start to make demands on spending bills?  It really depends on who you're  listening to.  If you're trying to anticipate what Democrats will do, you  heard Chuck Schumer earlier this week talk about how he may want to load up  that spending bill with language that includes something to do with  investigations of the president.  That of course would set a signal that  Democrats are not willing to govern, do not have any interest in getting  things done.  And I think will make things very difficult in the New Year.  </p><p> So, we're have to see -- we'll have to see what happens with House  leadership.  If Nancy Pelosi decides that that is not the path she wants to  take, there could be an opportunity for bipartisan agreement on a spending  bill.  Typically in a lame duck session taxpayers do not benifit from  decisions that are made on spending bills there.  And Nancy Pelosi,  remember, when she was speaker, she was the one who governed probably some  of the biggest omnibus spending bills in the past.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And we had the majority leader Kevin McCarthy on  this weekend.  And he said that there are two appropriations bills that  they're going to get to.  Of course, one of the big issues at stake is the  Republican tax cut plan, 2.0.  McCarthy joined me on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" along with Democratic representative David Cicilline who want to  have the number four spot in Democratic leadership in the new Congress.   They have both different views on what they're expecting to happen.  Watch  this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been working on Tax Cuts 2.0.  Does that go away at this  point given the fact that not one Democrat voted for you -- first tax cut  plan?  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  I don't believe so.  Because it's already passed the House.  We  still have a number of weeks and session that's over in the Senate.  We  will continue to fight for it.  Because Maria, it is the right principle.   It is the right policy.  And that should overcome politics.  We should put  people before politics and I'll be excited to see the day that the  Democrats want to join us with that.  </p><p> CICILLINE:  The fact is that tax cut gave 83 percent of that tax cut to the  top one percent, to the richest people in this country and now the  Republicans are proposing we pay for that by cutting Medicare and Social  Security.  We can't do that.  We've got to protect Social Security and  Medicare.  We need a tax cut for middle class families not 83 percent of it  going to the top one percent, richest people in this country and the most  powerful corporations.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I've got a prospect on that because 80 percent of the tax  cut plan did not go to the top one percent as you know, Congressman.  The  tax cut plan lowered all income levels and they doubled the standard  deduction.  So, that talking point -- </p><p> CICILLINE:  Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, it is true.</p><p> CICILLINE:  And Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Maybe you get there because the corporate rate was cut.  Are  you saying you want to have corporate -- </p><p> CICILLINE:  Thad's right -- that's right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you want the corporate rate at 35 percent?  </p><p> CICILLINE:  Well, so, you acknowledge it's right.  83 percent does go to  the top one percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, do you want to raise the corporate tax rate?  Is  that what you're saying?  </p><p> CICILLINE:  Well, I don't -- what I say, we have to do is we have to be  responsible about that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you want to keep with this talking  point that is inaccurate.  That's fine.  You can do as you will.  </p><p> CICILLINE:  No, it's the fact, it's not inaccurate.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But do you -- the question is what do you going to do on taxes?   Are you looking to raise taxes, are you looking to reverse the economic  policies of this president?  </p><p> CICILLINE:  No, what I think we need to do is give a real tax cut to  working families, to middle class families, that's permanent and long- standing.  Not giving 82 percent (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That sounds like -- that sounds like what's being worked on  right now, Tax Cuts 2.0.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And of course, we know the facts on taxes, Mattie.  Mitch  Roschelle, you're here.  You responded and reacted to that interview.  You  and I were e-mailing each other.  Give us the facts on who pays the taxes.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  I also screamed at the television set on Sunday, just to be  clear.  But the top 10 percent of taxpayers in this country, and that's  those Households earning over $133,000 pay 70 percent of the tax.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Bottom line.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Right.  So, and that was based upon the last time the tax  foundation did this.  So the fact of the matter is, -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's just lies.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  -- it's just not true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mattie, is  that -- are we going to just have bluster for the  next two years, lots of lies and inaccuracies and get nothing done, what do  you think?  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Well, we will see.  Look, (INAUDIBLE) just called in the Arizona  for the Kyrsten Sinema.  She is one of the only Democrats who voted to  extend those tax cuts.  Those Democrats who wants to see those tax cuts  made permanent.  We'll see if Democrats continue to push back on that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and not one of them voted for the tax cut plan in general.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Exactly right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mattie, thank you so much.  Mattie Duppler there.  Still ahead,  divided in half, the details on Amazon's plans to split its second  headquarters, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   It is a busy morning.  It is Tuesday, November 13th.  Your top stories  right now 8:00 a.m. on button on the East Coast.  Markets are set to  rebound this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a modest gain at  the start of trading.</p><p> The Dow Jones Industrial average up 130 points right now, one-half of one  percent.  The S&amp;P is up two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ with a 53- point rally this morning up three quarters of a percent.  A much different  day than yesterday, where we saw serious broad-based sell-off on Wall  Street.  Apple and Goldman dragged the markets lower.  The Dow was down 600  plus points.  That was 2-1/3 percent.</p><p> The S&amp;P 500 sliding nearly two percent on the session.  And at the close,  the NASDAQ was the worst performer.  It was down nearly three percent on  the session as Apple and other technology stocks really took the NASDAQ  down sharply at the close.  Take a look at global markets this morning on  the heels of the strength you're seeing on Wall Street this morning.   European markets following suit.</p><p> The FT-100 is up a fraction, the CAC Quarante in Paris us a half of a  percent, 21 points higher and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  90  points higher in Germany.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances there,  take a look.  Worst performer was Japan, the Nikkei average down better  than two percent.</p><p> Well, the picks are in.  Amazon will soon call Long Island City York and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the decision to split its  headquarters, the second headquarters.  The announcement is expected as  early as today.  That would be the official announcement but we know this  is coming up one percent on Amazon this morning in terms of the stock.</p><p> Meanwhile, let's go to California where raging wildfires are continuing  this morning.  The infernos burning a path of devastation.  The death toll  up to nearly 50 people right now between these massive fires.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand that makes this the deadliest fire in the  history of United States.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are going to take you live to Southern California to get the  very latest there.  Massive devastation.  New questions this morning for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  important 737 jet.  That's the same model that was involved in the deadly  crash in Indonesia last month.  I'm going to be speaking with the Chairman  and CEPO Dennis Muilenburg this morning and he is here in studio in a Fox  Business Exclusive.</p><p> He will join me at 8:30 a.m. Eastern to answer these questions as well as  to tell us about the backdrop for his business today.  Also joining the  conversation this morning, House Majority Whip and Louisiana Congressman  Steve Scalise as Congress gets back to work this morning.  Also this  morning joining me is CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Lindsey,  good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Lindsey, we were talking earlier about the markets and about  that sell-off yesterday.  We just came off of the quarter where we saw  profit growth up 29 percent year-over-year.  So why are markets so nervous?</p><p> BELL:  We haven't seen growth that great since before 2000.  So that is a  very impressive number.  It's the third quarter of over 20 percent earnings  growth.  And that is largely due to the tax reform package that we got  earlier this year and fiscal stimulus.  But the problem now is that fiscal  stimulus is peaking, monetary policy is tightening.  The Fed is running off  its balance sheet here.</p><p> And the question is where do we go with growth from here?  There is a lot  of uncertainty still out there on trade and to me, between trade and the  Fed, those are the two biggest things as I look to 2019 to determine where  growth -- the growth trajectory will be going.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, we saw some of the big tech names come down a lot  yesterday, Apple down five percent which is a serious number for Apple.  Is  the worry about growth largely in some of these high flyers like in Apple,  or are we just talking about economic growth going from 4.2 percent in the  second quarter, 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter to something very  different in 2019.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  I think it's more about economic growth.  The tech sector is  being weighed on by the trade disputes obviously and then also I think that  with interest rates rising the evaluations that we've seen in some of that  really had investors turn a little more skittish.  It's been dragging the  market down but as we look to 2019, look, if we get 2-1/2 to -- to 2.9  percent GDP, that's really solid.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And really much better than what we saw the prior 10 years.  </p><p> BELL:  Exactly.  In a slowdown in growth from the four percent that we saw  in the last quarter could help you elongate this bull market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sounds like you think things went overdone yesterday on the  downside.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  And I just think volatility is here to stay for a while but we  are optimistic, we have 3100 price targets for the next 12 months in the  S&amp;P 500.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  3100 and it is now at 2726 on the standard &amp; poor's.  Lindsey,  thank you.  Great insights always from you.  I'm going to turn now back to  the Capitol Hill.  Congress is back in session today for its final two  month stretch, spending immigration and the fate of the Mueller probe  expected to dominate the debate.  Joining me right now is the House  Majority Whip, author of the new book, Back in the Game, Steve Scalise.</p><p> And we are really happy you are back in the game, Congressman.  It's good  to see you.  </p><p> REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  Maria, great to be back  with you.  Great to be back in the game.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations on the book.  You know, I  was so happy when I saw the book because I thought I'm really happy he is  writing about this incident.  The whole country was just so worried about  you after that shooting at the baseball -- at the baseball course.  So  we'll get to that in a moment.  But you just heard Lindsey Graham talking  about the economy.</p><p> Are you expecting growth to slow?  You just had this landmark tax cut  reform that you put in place earlier this year and now people are worried  that the economy is going to slow down. </p><p> SCALISE:  Well, you know, we were seeing so much economic growth and it was  working the way that we intended.  When you -- when you see tax cuts for  every single income group and of course lower to middle income people are  the ones who benefited the most.  And now with Nancy Pelosi being expected  to be sworn in as Speaker in January, it does concern people that they want  to go backward.</p><p> They want to raise taxes again, go to like kind of big government,  government-controlled healthcare.  All the things that Pelosi did when she  was speaker before.  So, you know, it is definitely concerned people and  slowed down the growth.  Let's see what happens but we're going to be  battling that too.  We're not going to -- we're not going to let this  country go back to those days, the 10 years of slow economic growth less  than two percent growth for eight straight years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know we're waiting on couple of situations in Florida this  morning but it looks like Republicans will keep the majority in the Senate  based on what we're seeing.  </p><p> SCALISE:  And actually grew their number in the Senate.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And grew their numbers but I'm talking about these, you know,  questions in Florida and -- but yes, growing the numbers in the Senate.  So  should that make us feel that the Democrats being in the House majority now  will not be subject to stopping the President's economic agenda?  I mean,  what does this mean in terms of the House leadership taking the majority?  </p><p> SCALISE:  Well, I think the most important thing that you don't see us go  backwards.  And, you know, even if Nancy PelosI's agenda which will be to  try to grow government, to try to raise taxes, higher, they're not going to  be successful ultimately because the bill would have to be signed by the  President.  But what it does mean is the things that we were going to do  tax cuts 2.0, the work that Chairman Brady and his committee were already  engaged in to try to make those tax cuts permanent.</p><p> To build on the growth we're seeing in our economy.  It's going to be very  difficult to get those things accomplished once Nancy Pelosi is speaker for  at least two-year period.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, do you think -- I was with David Cicilline, Democratic  Congressman who0 wants to get into leadership, the leadership race is  obviously happening this week, and he said he doesn't like the corporate  rate where it is.  Do you think there's any chance that he would be  successful in raising the corporate rate?  </p><p> SCALISE:  Well, I saw that interview and you pressed him I think  appropriately because ultimately he didn't want to say it but you can tell  what he was trying to imply was he wants to raise the corporate rate and  it's OK if he tries to do that which he will not be successful by the way.   But if he tried to, what does he going to do with those millions of jobs  that we're bringing back to America because we lowered the corporate rate  to be competitive.</p><p> America lost its competitive edge and everybody acknowledged that.  It  wasn't a partisan issue.  And so when we made our country competitive  again, we're seeing the benefits of it by millions of new jobs being  created for families who want to get in the work force.  Why would he want  to take that away, we're not going to let it happen but it shows you they  do want to raise those rates even higher.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They want to raise rates and they want to have investigations  around President Trump.  You've got six weeks or seven weeks before the end  of the year.  What can you get done in this next seven weeks?  I know you  have spending bills, appropriation bills that need to be tended to.  Tell  us what you're expecting in terms of success this year.  </p><p> SCALISE:  Maria, there are a few important bills that are right up front  and center that we have to deal with the funding of the Department of  Homeland Security which is critically important to keeping America safe.   And of course the big fight, there is going to be overfunding the wall.  In  the House we've been moving forward to try to give the President the $5  billion that he's requested to start fully building out the wall.</p><p> There is some money he has to start building about 100 miles of wall.  We  want to go a lot further, you know, that's going to be a battle we have.   The other big battle is going to be over the farm bill.  And Maria, Farm  Bill Policy expired a few weeks ago and the big fight has been over work  requirements.  You know, here you've got this great robust economy where  there are more job openings and people looking for work.</p><p> And yet we put a provision in the House that says, if there is a job out  there in your able body, you ought to be able to go and look for work  instead of getting taxpayer funded welfare benefits and the Democrats  oppose that, so we have a big impasse over that.  And imagine, at a time  when people are looking for work, the Federal government is paying people  not to work and we said, look, if there is a job out there for you, you  have to go take it or else stop getting taxpayer money.</p><p> And we'll even pay you to train you to work if there's not -- if you don't  have the proper training and that's what they're opposing right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  All right.  Are there any plans to cut  spending?  The idea of debt and deficits in our face and getting more  expensive just to hold the debt.  This conversation is getting louder.   What are the plans in terms of spending cuts and is it possible that the  Congress and the President make a mistake of looking for something to come  together with the Democrats choosing infrastructure and then creating even  more debt by spending $2 trillion on an infrastructure package.</p><p> SCALISE:  All right.  That is continuing to be a concern.  One of the  reason we didn't get an infrastructure package is because we couldn't get  an agreement over how to pay for it.  We weren't in this Republican-led  House, we weren't going to pass a bill that was just going to add to the  deficit.  One of the things we had in our healthcare bill that passed the  House had protections for people with preexisting conditions.</p><p> But a reforming Medicaid, one of the most broken forms of healthcare by  block granting it to the states, letting the states actually be innovative  and coming up with better ways to run healthcare for lower income people.   It's saved over $800 billion just through the innovation.  You didn't have  a reduction in money, it just actually allowed states to be more flexible  with the money.</p><p> That saved $800 billion.  It failed by one voted in the Senate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> SCALISE:  Huge disappointments there in a lot of fronts but it would have  made healthcare more affordable, protected people of preexisting conditions  and transformed Medicaid into a much better program at those kind of  savings.  That was what's at stake in this election.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  We all remember the infamous thumbs down on the Senate.   Let me -- let me ask you about the preexisting conditions because that's  another talking point on the left that the Republicans do not want to  protect preexisting conditions.  </p><p> SCALISE:  Yes.  It was a false claim.  In fact they spent millions of  dollars promoting that false claim.  And I talked to members and so many of  these swing districts and they said, look, they're lying about this,  they're spending two, $3 million in T.V. ads lying about it.  And so they  had to go on T.V. and spend -- they didn't have two million, they might had  a million and half to say that it wasn't true.</p><p> And so people got confused, they weren't sure what was the case.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCALISE:  But our bill -- our bill actually protected people with  preexisting conditions.  It's in the bill, they knew it, they didn't care,  they just said it anyway.  Look, you know, they're going to get the  majority.  I think it's going to be a short-lived majority but at the same  time a lot of those candidates who won said they're going to be pro-life  and pro-gun and they're going to vote against Nancy Pelosi.</p><p> Well, their very first vote as a member of Congress in January is going to  be for Nancy Pelosi as speaker.  You know, which side are they going to  choose, the -- you know, the people back home that they promised one thing  to or what's going to happen up in D.C.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you've got your leadership races this week, tomorrow night,  the vote tell us what you're feeling in terms of how things stack up.  Are  you expecting that Kevin McCarthy will be the Minority Leader and you will  tell us about the role that you're expecting.  </p><p> SCALISE:  Yes.  I think Kevin will get the votes and he will be the  minority leader.  I'm running for the minority whip position and feel real  confident and the votes that we have and, you know, we'll go forward but at  the same time it's going to be interesting to see which route they go, the  Democrats do when they're in power.  They're going to just be about  harassing the President, subpoenas and even impeachment.</p><p> That's not what the American people wanted.  You know, ultimately they're  going to have to -- they're going to have to decide which route they go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Just to change the conversation, so that's the  conversation for the next two years as opposed to what you've been able to  do in terms of legislation. </p><p> SCALISE:  And we've got to be I think a lot better at articulating the  things we stand for as conservatives.  That's one thing that I think we  didn't do well.  We've got to do a lot better at and we're going to get  there but I think there's going to be a sharp contrast now because you're  going to see the approach that Nancy Pelosi would take as speaker.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm glad you mentioned -- a lot of people mentioned the  messaging on the Republican side.  Let's talk about your book Back in the  Game, what role did your recovery have in writing this book?  Tell us why  you wrote the book.  </p><p> SCALISE:  Well, you know, as you talked about earlier, there were so many  people that came together to help me, you know, not only to save my life in  those first few hours after the shooting, but to help me get back in the  game and essence to be able to learn how to walk again.  Just to learn how  to do basic things that I couldn't do in those first few weeks after the  shooting.</p><p> And, you know, I had a lot of -- a lot of support and prayers by the people  like you were praying, people all over the country were praying and there  were so many miracles that we chronicle in this book and the book we talked  about.  What my wife Jennifer and I talk about these little miracles that  happened along the way.  And we also talked about the people who did so  many heroic things every step of the way to save not only myself but all  the other people that were out there that day.</p><p> And then ultimately to help me through the recovery process.  And it really  is an inspirational book because it could have been a lot different in how  it ended.  You know, so many cases like this don't end the way it did.   This actually has a happy ending and thanks to god, to miracles, and to the  support and prayers of so many people.  We chronicled it all in the book.   Back in the Game and I'm really happy with how it came out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We were so worried.  Everybody was worried about you, we -- I  mean, it was so serious.  Did it change the way you look at things?  Did it  change the way you approach your job?  </p><p> SCALISE:  Maria, if anything, it sharpened my focus on the things that  matter in life and I think I removed a lot of clutter in life.  You know,  all of us do things every day that some that we want to do, some that you  just kind of do because it's a routine and you focus on what's really  important, my family, my faith, you know, the work that I do, I love my  job.  You know, and it illuminated the things that aren't as important and  much happier today. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.  Thank you for your leadership.   So happy you're here.</p><p> SCALISE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Steve Scalise.  Check out the book back in the  game.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeting this on trade.   France makes excellent wine but so does the U.S.  The problem is that  France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France and  charges big tariffs while doing so.  Whereas the U.S. makes it easy for  French wines and charges very small tariffs.  It's not fair.  Must change.   The President obviously touting European leaders on trade this morning.</p><p> Switching gears.  We want to bring you to California and show you this  devastation which is just unreal.  We have two wildfires whipping across  the state. The campfire is the northern part, now it is the deadliest fire  in the state's history.  And the Woolsey fire taking a major toll on  Southern California.  Fox News' Jonathan Hunt is in Malibu this morning.   Jonathan?</p><p> JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.  Thousands of  families remain evacuated from this area of Southern California where the  Woolsey fire has hit so hard.  That likely to be out of Malibu and other  areas for I would say at least another 24 hours.  And take a look at what  hundreds of families are going to come back to find when they are  eventually let in.</p><p> Everything they have built over their lives, everything they've worked for  completely and utterly destroyed.  It is a similar story up north -- the  camp fire near Chico, California.  Now as you mentioned becoming officially  the deadliest in state history.  42 people have been killed in that fire.   More than 100 still remain unaccounted for and the entire town of Paradise  is basically wiped out.  Listen here to the fire chief.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DAVID HAWKS, DIVISION CHIEF, CAL FIRE-BUTTE COUNTY:  It's just absolutely  heartbreaking to drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.   My family lost their home in the fire, my parents did, my grandmother did.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> HUNT:  President Trump tweeted last night that he has now approved and  expedited major disaster declaration for California.  That tweet coming in  the wake of tweets over the weekend, in which he was critical of  California's forest management.  That sparked a firestorm of criticism.   He's now changing his tune paying tribute to the heroic firefighters who  are still on the frontlines, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Jonathan.  Thanks very much.  We will be watching.   Jonathan Hunt in Malibu this morning.  Coming up.  Concerns in the sky.  A  new report says Boeing withheld information on its 737 plane.  The same  model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash last month.  I'll be speaking  exclusively with the chairman and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg about  that in less than 10 minutes.</p><p> As we take a break, we are watching the price of oil this morning.  And as  you can see, it is down 1-1/4 percent below 60 right now.  We'll be right  back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  President Trump continuing to tweet this morning.  Here's what  he just posted.  The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low  approval rating in France, that's 26 percent.  And an unemployment rate of  almost 10 percent.  He was just trying to get on to another subject, by the  way, there is no country more nationalist than France.  Very proud people  and rightfully so.  Make France Great Again.  The President writes this  morning.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Vive la, France.  Sorry.  I  just want to quickly say we have our pickup trucks, everyone.  We have our  tariffs on pickup truck imports.  They have their protections for one.   Let's move along and get along. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  All right.  Well, stocks getting yesterday on  weakness from technology meanwhile especially Apple.  The NASDAQ was down  almost three percent.  This morning we are looking at a rebound a bit, the  Dow industrials are up 77, the S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up 39  points after that sharp sell-off yesterday.  Joining us right now Wells  Fargo Investment Institute Head, global market strategists, Paul  Christopher. </p><p> Paul, good to see you.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p> PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So when you come in today after since a rough day at the office  yesterday where the markets were down 600 points on the Dow.  What do you  do?  Are you a buyer or a seller here?  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We're a buyer.  Look, it's -- the markets, it's still  worried about growth, it's trying to put in a bottom.  You don't have to  put in all the chips at once here but people have a lot of cash.  Our  clients held a lot of cash and we would like for them to put in a little  bit here at a time.  We think this is the best buying opportunity in U.S.  large caps since the November 2016 election.</p><p> So don't have to put it all in at once.  We're still looking for a bottom  but do start to take some positions especially in those growth-oriented  sectors.  </p><p> BELL:  So Paul, does that mean you take some positions in the tech, maybe  some of the FAANG names that have been beaten up or maybe are in bear  market territory right now off of their highs?  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  It's a good question.  We've been market weight on  information technology.  We still think you should be market weight but  listen if you haven't had a chance to get into some of these stocks and now  you find yourself below market weight.  Again this is an opportunity to  take yourself back up to that waiting.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Paul, it's Dagen McDowell.  It seems like the market gets really  shaken every time that 10-year yield gets to about only 3-1/4 percent.   Realistically how high a yield, a longer term interest rate can stocks  handle given a lot of names that are still -- that still look really  overvalued?  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We think that bond yields, the 10-year for instance  will go a little bit higher over the next 12 months and that we think that  stocks will still be OK with that.  The problem is we're just getting this  transition period where we've gone from clearly low growth and low interest  rates to a little bit faster growth and somewhat higher interest rates and  that sort of a move always wrong foots markets until investors can  determine that yes earnings can continue to hit higher levels.</p><p> And it's -- those earnings ultimately over the long run that will be --  that will match the S&amp;P on the way up we think, you know, percentage for  percentage.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Paul, great to see you.   Thank you so much.  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Paul Christopher joining us.  Well Fargo.  New questions for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  737 model.  This is the same model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash  last week.  We will speak with Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg next,  exclusive coming up right after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast.  Futures are indicating  a gain at the start of trading this morning.  Dow Industrials expected to  be up 69 points, that is about a quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 is up  almost half a percent, and the NASDAQ with a 39-point gain, up two-thirds  of one percent.  This, after a sharp sell-off yesterday where the Dow lost  two percent and the NASDAQ lost almost three percent.</p><p> European markets were mixed, the FT-100 is down a fraction, as you can see,  but the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are both positive.  Although off of  the highest levels of the morning, for sure.  Overnight in Asia, mixed  performances, take a look, the worst performer was Japan overnight in Asia.   The Nikkei Average was down on the session about two percent, as you can  see there.  </p><p> Oil is extending its losing streak this morning.  Crude oil under pressure  again now 11 days in a row lower, down 1-1/3 percent, below $60.00 a  barrel.  What is the price of oil selling off tell us about the global  economy?  We want to look at that, coming up.  </p><p> All of those stories coming up this morning, but first, our top story this  half an hour, new questions this morning for Boeing, The Wall Street  journal is reporting that Boeing withheld information on its 737 model,  according to safety experts and others.  That is the same model involved in  the deadly Lion aircrash in Indonesia last month.  And joining me right now  to discuss that and a lot more in this Fox Business exclusive is the  Chairman, President, and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg.  Dennis, it's  good to see you this morning.</p><p> DENNIS MUILENBURG, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BOEING:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the story in The Journal obviously is very concerning.   What can you tell us in terms of what was told to the pilots and the  airlines about any new equipment in that 737?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Well, Maria, first of all, I think it's important that we all  express our sympathies for the loss of Lion Air Flight 610 and certainly,  our thoughts go with the families that have been affected.  We've been very  engaged with the investigative authorities throughout and providing all of  the information necessary to make sure we do a full assessment of the  situation.  And the bottom line here is the 737 max is safe, and safety is  a core value for us at Boeing, it always has been, and we ensure that our  airplanes are safe.  In fact, this airplane went through thousands of hours  of tests and evaluation, certification, working with the pilots, and we've  been very transparent on providing information and being fully cooperative  on the investigative activity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what happened?  Apparently, there were 10 computer -- the  computers about the angle of the nose were not accurate and then the plane  went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you have a sense of what went wrong?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes, as the Indonesian authorities have pointed out initially,  there were some indications of inaccurate angle attack signal that was  being sent to the airplane, and of course, our airplane has the ability to  handle that, and we have procedures in place.  And we've already issued a  couple of additional bulletins to our operators and pilots around the world  that point them back to existing flight procedures to handle that kind of  condition.  So again, we're going to continue to support the investigation  as it proceeds.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And was there -- I mean, one of the Boeing officials quoted in  The Journal today, one high-ranking Boeing official said that the company  had decided against disclosing more details to cockpit cruise due to  concerns about inundating average pilots with too much information.  Was  that a decision now that you regret?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Now, again, we ensure that we provide all of information  that's needed to safely fly our airplanes.  Again, this comes as out of  thousands of hours of testing and evaluating and simulating, and providing  the information that our pilots need to operate our airplanes safely, and  we'll continue to do that.  As I said, as part of the process here, we've  already issued a couple of bulletins to pilots and operators that point  them back to existing flight procedures to handle this kind of situation.   So, we're going to continue to fully cooperate in the investigation.  I  think it's really important -- again, the bottomline here, the 737 Max is a  very safe airplane and we're very confident in it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But was there a new -- well, there are new system that wasn't  disclosed to the pilots.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  No, there are new systems on the airplanes that are designed  to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane and to provide  control capability in high-angle of attack conditions, and those systems  operate properly.  And again, in certain failure modes, if there's an  inaccurate angle attack sensors feeding information to the -- to the  airplane, there's a procedure to handle that.  And so, again, as part of  the investigation process, we're going to make sure we fully understand  that.  We're going to make sure that we're providing all of the information  necessary and appropriate training, and go back to the core value here, is  that the airplane safe, we know how to fly it safely, and we're very  confident in that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Was that information in terms of what to do should something  change -- was that information available to the pilots?  Did they know how  to operate it should the nose be in a different position?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes.  In fact, that's part of the training manual, it's an  existing procedure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  So, the bulletin that we put out again last week and over the  weekend, pointed to that existing flight procedure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, obviously, I know that you're answering lots of  questions this morning and this week after this horrific crash, and you're  going to get more information.  What would be the timing on that?  When do  you expect to hear from the FAA on this?  </p><p> MUILENBURG:  Well, this is an ongoing investigation, so it will take  whatever time is necessary to make sure it's done thoroughly.  Again, we  participate fully in these investigations, we've provided technical  assistance, we'll continue to do that until the work is complete.  It's  very important that we do this in a diligent and thorough manner.   Bottomline is we want to ensure safety in the system, and continue to have  confidence in the 737 Max.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the 737 has been a cash cow for your business, this is a  very important business.  There were some headwinds in the supply chain in  terms of the 737, which I want to ask you about.  And I know over the  recent past, you've expanded the business, you've got commercial aerospace,  you've got defense, and then you've got services.  Tell us how business is  right now, because commercial aerospace has been driving the stock  obviously for several years right now?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Well, aerospace is a tremendous growth business.  We look out  over the next 10 years as an $8.1 trillion marketplace.  Passenger traffic  is growing at about six to seven percent per year sustained.  The world  needs about 43,000 new commercial airplanes over the next 20 years.  A part  of that is the 737 as we've ramped up to 52 a month, this year, we're  producing at 57 a month next year.  And we have had some supply chain  challenges as you -- as you pointed out, as we've been growing.  But we are  briskly moving to a recovery.  We just announced delivery numbers for  October earlier this morning, so we delivered 43 737s in October which is  an all-time record for October, and we're continuing to March smartly to  our recovery plan, and expect to meet our year-end targets for deliveries.   This year, for the first time, we'll deliver more than 800 commercial  airplanes.  By the end of the decade here, we'll be delivering more than  900 airplanes a year.  So, you can see the tremendous growth here in  commercial airplanes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible and I know you got an incredible backlog as  well --</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- which will continue that delivery calendar.  One out of four  or five planes go to China in terms of your deliveries.  Tell us about the  importance of the business in China.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes, China is very important to us.  Today, about a third of  our 737s go to China, about one-quarter of our overall deliveries.  So, if  you look at that marketplace around the world, 43,000 new airplanes over  the next 20 years, about 7,000 of those are in China.  It's the fastest  growing market segment right now.  China needs that lift capability to  serve their economic growth needs, so China is very interested in the  healthy aerospace economy.  </p><p> As you know here in the U.S. as well, there's a big advantage to a healthy  aerospace ecosystem.  We have about 90 percent of our manufacturing jobs  here in the U.S. even though we export about 80 percent of what we build.   So when you look at trade deficit versus trade surplus, aerospace is the  biggest trade surplus for the U.S., about $80 billion a year.  And our  business is the biggest piece of that.  So, that a mutually-beneficial  relationship between the U.S. and China as it applies to trade and the  aerospace is very important.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what happens now with this trade spat that we're having  with China then?  I mean, have you seen any backlash from the Chinese in  terms of your business, given the fact that the President is sitting there  waiting to put another 250 billion on exports from China on tariffs and  this fight between China and the U.S. intensifies?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  We've been very engaged in that dialogue, as you know, this is  a very important topic to us.  We've been talking with the President and  the U.S. administration, extensively.  They're very aware of the situation  and the importance of aerospace.  We've also had a very good dialogue with  Chinese leadership and our customers in China.  And we're encouraged by the  dialogue that's going on.  </p><p> I think you've seen some recent reports that President Trump and President  Xi plan to meet around the G20 summit that's coming up.  Some productive  dialogue going on on the trade front, we think both countries are  interested in a mutually successful aerospace ecosystem.  It's good for the  economies of both countries.  And here in the U.S., it's really important  to U.S. manufacturing jobs.  We have about 13,000 companies in our supply  chain here in the U.S. that are supporting that kind of manufacturing  growth.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Has the air supply chain changed in any way because of your  services business?  I mean, you're pursuing this more aggressive strategy,  does that mean that in time -- in terms of selling a plane to somebody or a  business, then you want to maintain that plane as well by using the  services there, but are you taking away business from the suppliers?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  We're actually see this as a grow the pie business.  So,  something we can do jointly with our suppliers.  Services is our biggest  single-growth opportunity.  When you look at that $8-trillion marketplace,  it's the place where we have the biggest opportunity to further grow.  And  we're bringing capabilities like parts distribution, maintenance, and  modifications.  New software, digital solutions, training solutions for our  customers, doing that jointly with our suppliers.  </p><p> To date -- year-to-date, our services business has grown 12 percent in a  market that's growing about three percent a year.  So, it is growing,  growing strongly, and by doing this jointly with our supply chain, we can  provide better light cycle value for our customers.  And that's really the  lens we're looking through here, not only how we design and build  airplanes, but how do we provide value for our customers for post- production support.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This sounds like a natural fit.  I mean, the commercial  aerospace business has been so strong, and walk us through that for a  moment because most people don't understand the number of people who've  never been on an airplane.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The number of people who are perhaps in Asia who are wanting to  travel, this is a big opportunity for you.  So, this is also an economic  growth story.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  It is.  And, Maria, you bring up a really great point.  As I  said earlier, traffic is growing -- passenger traffic at about six to seven  percent a year completely outstripping GDP.  And some of the things that  are driving that is the upcoming middle class that for the first time ever,  is able to travel.  So, we have this unique combination of backlogs, seven  years of backlog.  And every year in Asia alone, 150 million people fly for  the first time.  Less than -- less than 20 percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's amazing.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Less than 20 percent of the world's population has ever taken  a single flight.  So, think about the growth opportunity that's still ahead  of us, and we're feeding right into that with our design and productions.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But here we have worries in the market, down 600 points  yesterday, worries from economic worries that things are going to slow  down.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, where are we on that in your view?  You've got interest  rates rising obviously when a company or country buys a plane, or several  planes, they are in many parts doing it by borrowing, their borrowing costs  are going up with interest rates.  How much of a headwind will that be for  you?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  We're not seeing it affect our business.  Again, we have a  much longer term view.  Today, we have a backlog of almost 5800 commercial  airplanes if you think of that in terms of production volume, it's about  seven years of backlog.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  So, this gives us the opportunity to think long term in terms  of capital investment, innovation investment.  And while we pay attention  to things like interest rates and the financial markets, it's not something  that's really affecting near-term buying behavior.  You know, today, we're  selling 737 Maxes, filling our production skyline out in 2023 and beyond.   So, we have a much longer term perspective.  Aerospace is a strong long- term growing business.  It's not -- it's no longer a cyclical business.   This is a long term sustained growth business.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the competition is fierce.  I mean, airbus -- can airbus  sell to European countries and companies with no tariffs?  So, are you  disadvantaged by the tariff situation given the fact that a European  jetmaker Airbus can do it a lot cheaper?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Well, something we're paying close attention to.  To date, we  haven't been affected materially by the tariffs.  Things that have affected  steel and aluminum pricing.  We source 90 percent of our aluminum here in  the U.S. so it hasn't been a dramatic effect on us, but it's something  we're paying a close attention to.  The bottom line is it's a very  competitive marketplace because it's a very attractive marketplace.  Now,  we have to continue to invest, to compete.  We have to continue to invest  to innovate.  Tax reform, for example, in the U.S. has been something that  has really helped us gain a level-playing field globally so that we can  compete and win.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How can you grow the defense business at this point?  A lot of  worries that defense spending needs to either be capped or cut, given the  trillion-dollar deficits we're talking about every day and the debt of 21  trillion.  </p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes, we see the defense budget here in the U.S. sustained, and  if you look back a couple of years when we were in the middle of  sequestration.  We feel like we're in a stronger budget position now on  both sides of the aisle.  So, we look to the U.S. defense budget to remain  strong.  But we also see growth around the world.  Today, about a third of  our defense backlog is outside the U.S.  So, again, this is a very global  business, and there's a lot of defense growth opportunities outside of the  U.S., and I think the thing that's unique about Boeing is when we think  about growth, we look across commercial defense and services.  We're really  the only aerospace company that can bring great big critical mass to all  three of those sectors.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Dennis, it's great to have  you on the program.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Likewise.  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Dennis Muilenburg, ceo at Boeing.  We will  be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  President Trump just tweeting again.  He says this, \"By the  way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France  because of almost zero visibility.  I suggested driving, Secret Service  said no, too far from airport and big Paris shutdown.  Speech next day at  the American cemetery in pouring rain!  Little reported -- Fake News.\"  The  President referring to some criticism that he received from the media on  failing to go the cemetery that dual.</p><p> We want to turn to Amazon, congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  slamming Amazon's plans to partially bring (INAUDIBLE) headquarters to New  York City.  Joining me right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart  Varney.  And Stuart, there was a reason that so many cities across this  country were vying for Amazon to come to their city and set up their new  headlines.  Does she not understand business and economics?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, she does not.  I don't  think she wants to.  There's no pleasing some people, and that's the truth.   There's no pleasing a socialist.  I'll quote you exactly what she said.   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, Amazon is a-billion-dollar company.  The  idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks is  extremely concerning to residents here.  Has the company promised to hire  in the existing community?  What's the quality of jobs?  How many are  promised?  Are these jobs low wage or high wage?  Are there benefits?  Can  people collectively bargain?  There's just no satisfying a socialist.  They  see no benefit to investment, capital infusion and growth.  They don't see  it.  They simply see a big corporation.  Give me the money.  I just want  the money.  That's what it's all about.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm astonished, actually.  I would have thought that when you  bring 25,000 new jobs, a couple of billion dollars to your city, it would  be universally approved, but apparently not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the first thing she does, Dagen, is she complains that  Amazon is getting tax breaks (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And she says Queens City councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer and state  Senator Gianaris have also come out against the Amazon deal while Mayor  Bill de Blasio says that this could be the single biggest economic  development deal in the history of New York City.  So, here's a word,  Amazon, find another city, I dare you.</p><p>VARNEY:  For once, I'm on Bill de Blasio's side.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stuart, I know you'll have more in 10 minutes.  We'll see you  at the top of the hour, thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right  after MORNINGS WITH MARIA 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Stay with us.</p><p> But first, driving innovation, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the  journal's technology conference, featuring the CEO of Uber.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The future of technology, the Wall Street  Journal's Tech D.Live conference is underway this morning where big names  and descending on Laguna Beach, California.  Susan Li is there.  Susan,  good morning.</p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you, Maria.   Yes, we'll be talking all things tech here in Laguna beach.  That includes  government regulation, innovation, and future partnerships.  Now, later on,  to the program, will feature a lot of heavyweights, that includes Uber CEO,  Dara Khosrowshahi, one of the headliners.  And then, we have celebrity  attendance as well.  Gwyneth Paltrow will be holding the evening session  along with Kevin Hart, the comedian.  Last night, we heard from AT&amp;T's  Randall Stephenson who has some interesting things to say about President  Trump, about Jim Acosta, Time Warner and CNN, and we also heard from  (INAUDIBLE) of Google.  </p><p> Now, we also caught up with Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's former CEO,  billionaire, owner of the L.A. Clips.  And I think that the overarching  theme her are like going to be so far has been this -- talk about the  relationship between the White House and big tech.  And whether or not  they'll be more regulation in the future of big Silicon Valley names.  I  asked Steve Ballmer this.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT:  I don't think Microsoft has much  risk at all right now.  We certainly had ours in the past.  Amazon will  have their own set of issues.  The most important thing for anybody running  a successful tech company where there's not a clear issue.  It's just to  continue to do their job well, be responsible.  I think Amazon has done a  very good job so far.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LI:  Yes.  It was an -- a great job, Jeff Bezos has done a great job as  Steve Ballmer says.  We'll talk more later on today and we have more  interviews coming to you and coming on Fox Business from Laguna Beach.   Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff.  Susan, thank you.  Susan Lee joining us  there in Laguna.  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Back  In a Minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey  Bell.</p><p> BELL:  Look, the markets might be going well, but the bedrock of the  country, the consumer is strong and we saw that in Home Depot's numbers and  we'll here about that from retailers later this week.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Bullish (INAUDIBLE) Mitch?</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And I think the markets just need to calm down.  You know,  sometimes good news is bad news, and bad news is good news.  Right now, the  market just needs to calm down, calm down.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, it's the stability.  Look long term, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And New York City, I'm going to tweet this.  I think the  Governor of the New York -- of New York state and the major of New York  City, maybe need to do a conference call with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to  explain what 25,000 jobs mean in terms of the tax revenue, and how that  actually helps fix the New York City subways.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And there's a reason that every city in the country wanted the  Amazon headquarters.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  They all wanted it.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thank  you so much, and we'll see you in a few minutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday, November 13th, your top stories  right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets looking to rebound this morning after a serious selloff yesterday.   Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 95 points.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The market up about a third of a percent on the Dow, half a percent higher  on the S&amp;P, and about three quarters and percent higher on the NASDAQ with  a 49-point move this morning higher for NASDAQ.  </p><p>This after broad-based selloff yesterday for stock prices, Apple and  Goldman Sachs dragging down the Dow Industrials by better than 600 points  at the close.  </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly two percent on the session.  As you can see,  the NASDAQ the worst performer, down nearly three percent.  Apple leading  the charge in technology stocks lower yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning, also seeing a bit of a bounce.  The FT-100 is  up a fraction, 13 points higher there, 11 points higher on the CAC Quarante  in Paris, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 75, that's two-thirds of one  percent this morning.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances, as you see there.  Best performer in  China, up about one percent on the Shanghai Composite.</p><p>But the Nikkei Average in Japan down better than two percent overnight.</p><p>The picks are in, Amazon will soon call Long Island City, New York, and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the company's HQ2 selection  with the announcement coming as early as today.  </p><p>Amazon shares are up this morning, three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Raging wildfires in California.  This infernos -- the infernos are burning  a path of devastation.  The death toll now rising to nearly 50 people  between these massive fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KORY HONEA, SHERIFF, BUTTE COUNTY:  I understand that makes this the  deadliest fire in the history of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest and we will take you live to California  this morning.</p><p>There are new questions facing Boeing this morning.  A new report says the  jet-maker withheld information on the 737, the same model involved in the  deadly Indonesia crash last month.  </p><p>Boeing Chairman and CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, will join me in a Fox Business  exclusive this morning.  Stay with us for that exclusive coming up at 8:30  a.m. Eastern this morning.</p><p>Plus Tide detergent unveils new packaging, and it is going viral.  The  controversy coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner Mitch  Roschelle, and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, with us this  morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Cannot wait for that Boeing  interview.  That'll be fantastic.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that'll be good, because this is -- there are new  questions this morning, but at the same time, Boeing has been operating on  fire. </p><p>I mean, this company is seeing commercial airline business up strongly, the  defense business up strongly, and the stock has held up well.  </p><p>Of course, they are trading down in the month of October.  Like the other  defense contractors, they had a tough month. </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  It'll also be interesting because there are  some trade considerations with a company like Boeing.  Their rival Airbus  in Europe, so it'll be interesting to see what he has to say about that as  well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  And China is the number one market  for the business in terms of new planes and aerospace business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  We are at tend of earning season, which Lindsey will get  into.  Ninety percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, but we've got  retailers this week.  </p><p>Home Depot just came out with numbers beating on revenue and earnings per  share.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The numbers are on the screen right now.  The estimates call  for $2.26 a share.  The company is reporting earnings of $2.51 on revenue  of -- better than the estimate, which was 26.26 billion and here is the  renew estimate coming in better than expected at 23.6 billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Overall S&amp;P 500 earnings are up almost 29 percent from a  year ago.  The expectation going into the quarter was 22 percent, so it was  a terrific quarter on earnings.  </p><p>A lot misses on revenue, 40 percent of companies missing on revenue  expectations.  This was a beat.  We get Walmart later this week and some  other big retailers like a Macy's, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting to see this market performance, Lindsey, in  the face of 29 percent profit growth year over year.  </p><p>BELL:  I know.  And I think it's still like we always talk about, it's all  about the outlook.  The outlook was a little bit weaker than expected for  many companies as we looked forward to the fourth quarter and into 2019.  </p><p>There are rising raw material costs, the strong dollar certainly impacting,  but you and I was -- we're talking about that in the green room.  </p><p>And so expectations for growth in 2019 have been coming down.  All through  this year, we're looking for 10 percent earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p>Now we're at about eight and a half percent, which is still a very, very  good number, but there are still a lot of uncertainties out there with what  the fed's going to do, what's going to happen with trade, and then where is  the dollar going.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  What I -- what I like about the home improvement industry is  these are discretionary spends.  </p><p>BELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And it tells you something about the consumer, when they're  discretionarily spending on things.  You don't have to fix up your home,  you don't have to do home improvement, and when you do it, that's when the  customer feels strong.  </p><p>So, that may give us an indication of what the rest of the retail season  looks like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's also a really important focus on the consumer.  </p><p>This week, we will hear -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- as you said, from Walmart and Macy's tomorrow, but Home  Depot numbers' better than expected.  </p><p>As we worry about a growth slowdown, where is the consumer in that growth  slowdown?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, I mean you know what, I think the consumer remains  confident and higher interest rates aren't scaring them away from doing  home improvements.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is good because the home sales this year have been in kind  of a slow slide for much of -- much of the year in terms of declines in  home sales in consecutive months.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  Which is why Home Depot's stock hasn't done so well this year.   It's down about five percent year to date.  </p><p>These numbers look to be pretty strong, and we'll have to get into the  details.  But, you know, the concern is home sales have been weak, interest  rates are rising, are investors going -- are peep -- are consumers going to  invest in their homes and fixing them up?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you look at a market, like we saw yesterday, where Apple  was really the problem.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Down sharply.  And you wonder if that's indicator of slowdown.   People are worried about unit sales, worried about a slowdown in Apple.</p><p>This is the most important product that identifies really what we're  talking about in terms of consumer spending.  </p><p>What did you think about the market selloff yesterday?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that a lot of this is still a hangover from Apple  suddenly announcing that it's not going break out its unit sales because it  does look like they're trying to hide something, quite frankly.</p><p>And, you know, this was -- they act like that breaking out the unit sales  of these products isn't important today.  Well -- but -- you know, why was  it important then years ago when you -- when you launched the iPhone?</p><p>That's number one.  I'll just point out that stock is still up almost 15  percent year to date.</p><p>So it was roughly immune to what happened to, say, in Amazon in the month  of October when Amazon went into a full-blown bear market in that stock.  </p><p>Apple is still up, it's, you know, pretty -- seeing a pretty sharp decline  in the -- so far in November.  </p><p>But, again, still double-digit gain year to date.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's really indicative of the story overall, of the worry,  the story of this market.  We are worried about growth, worried that things  will turn down and you see a company like Apple and Home Depot really  indicative of the consumer.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And I think yesterday's action in Apple really did spook  especially tech investors because exactly to your point, Amazon's in bear- market territory.  Apple has been the value in the tech sector.  And it's  been able to hold up and support the group.  </p><p>And so if growth is slowing there, we -- do we have a bigger problem  overall?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was on a report about suppliers.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Two -- </p><p>BELL:  Two suppliers.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's another thing, the suppliers made guidance  warnings and, you know, you think thank back to what Dan Niles said a  couple of weeks ago with the inventory build-up.  </p><p>I mean he mentioned that Apple had inventories up 89 percent, quarter of a  quarter -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in the second quarter and that was an issue because if  you've got an economic slowdown and you've got people pulling back in terms  of spending, well, what are they going to do?</p><p>First, they're going to buy the inventory that they have.  Can they  actually get rid of all of that inventory?  </p><p>And if you see China slowing down, is China -- are the Chinese going to buy  a phone for a thousand dollars?  So, that's why Apple is such an important  indicator in terms of what's going on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will argue also that yesterday was kind of a delayed reaction  to that move-up in long-term interest rates last week where you saw the 10- year.  Every time -- and we've had this happen several times in the last  month or so.</p><p>Every time that 10-year treasury yield gets closer to 3.25 percent, because  it hit a new -- it was like a seven and a half year-high last week, that  rattles investors and the bond market was closed yesterday.  </p><p>But I think that that is definitely playing into, you know what, if longer- term interest rates are at three and a quarter, three and a half, you know,  those earnings, I need to pay a little bit less for those earnings way,  way, way out in the future on these big-growth companies.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, and that's a huge impact on the tech sector.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BELL:  Which is supposed to have the best earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let -- </p><p>BELL:  It has had the best growth in the past two years. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's zero in on this stock market and really what's going on  this morning.  Joining the conversation, we got the Chairman, President,  and CEO of Boeing here in studio this morning, Dennis Muilenburg.  </p><p>My special guest in the fact of this new report from the Journal on its  737.  </p><p>Louisiana Congressman and current House Majority Whip, Steve Scalise, joins  us with his reaction to the midterm elections and what can get done.</p><p>Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane  is with us this morning, along with the CEO of the Mayo Clinic, Dr. John  Noseworthy back with us as well.  </p><p>And Florida Congressman-elect, former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel  Michael Waltz, joining us as well.  A lot to talk about.  Big guest lineup  today, don't miss a moment of it.  </p><p>And of course we are watching markets this morning after that major selloff  yesterday driven by weakness in technology and Apple in familiar.  </p><p>Joining us now is Fort Pitt Capital Group Partner, Vice President, as well  as Senior Portfolio Manager, Kim Forrest.  Kim, good to see you.  Thanks  very much for joining us.  </p><p>Your reaction to the -- </p><p>KIM FORREST, VICE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FORT PITT CAPITAL  GROUP:  Thanks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the market selloff yesterday and what to do  now?</p><p>FORREST:  Sure.  Well, I think you guys covered it ably, you know.  All the  factors that you cited are just exactly in line with what I saw.  </p><p>The raise in interest rates, you know, made these higher price stocks a  little less desirable.  </p><p>I do think that Apple may not be something that the -- that is a great  thing about -- a great -- I don't know, point of data about how consumers  are spending because you did get those great Home Depot numbers.  </p><p>And I think Apple's its own little issue.  But that being beside that, I  think today is a tremendous opportunity if you have long-enough time  horizon -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FORREST:  -- to really look and see stocks that you may want to buy right  now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting you say Apple could have its own  issue.  I mentioned Dan Niles has been covering this company for years.  </p><p>FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  AlphaOne Capital Partners, he almost predicted this trouble for  Apple and the technology sector a month ago.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  I think you  absolutely are, and this is exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of  inventory out there.  </p><p>So, if you pick the biggest company in the world, Apple, for example, they  have 89 percent inventory growth year over year in the June quarter that  they reported.  Their revenues were up 17 percent.  </p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>Look at last year, they had one phone priced above a thousand dollars.   This holiday season, they have three phones priced above them.</p><p>The average selling price, they're trying to boost it by another hundred  dollars.  </p><p>The problem is, if you look at smartphone units overall, this will be the  first year in history that smartphone units are down year over year.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kim, you might say that Apple is its own specific story, but -- </p><p>FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- doesn't it feed on itself?  I mean if you've got a lot of  inventory out there in technology and you can't sell it because things are  slowing down, that's going to trickle into other retail and other tech.</p><p>FORREST:  Maybe.  We're going to put a big maybe there because here --  here's the issue, I look at tech very differently than a lot of analysts.   We're talking about Apple, which is almost solely consumer-oriented tech.  </p><p>I am really excited about more enterprise or business-related tech because  I think as wages are starting to go up, businesses have to once again think  about how do I make my employees more productive?  </p><p>And it's not by watching Netflix, it's not by, you know, participating on  Facebook and maybe it's not by buying Apple products.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>FORREST:  But still, semiconductors underlie this whole trend of making  people more productive through software and hardware -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>FORREST:  And it's delivered on semiconductors, so that's what I'm kind of  throwing out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>FORREST:  And I do think Apple is, you know, an issue in and of itself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  It is very high-priced products and maybe not everybody, you  know, needs to buy a new Apple phone every 18 months -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  -- like they have in the past.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about Amazon?  The Journal is reporting this morning  that the company is ready to choose New York City and Northern Virginia as  the new homes for Amazon's new headquarters.  </p><p>Kim, good or bad move on Amazon's part to split the second headquarters?   What do you think?  </p><p>FORREST:  Well, I really thought Pittsburgh was the winner here, but, you  know, we're going to leave that behind.</p><p>But, no, I think it's really smart, especially because it looks like  Amazon's going to have to develop its own in-house brands for clothing and  what better place than New York City to do that.</p><p>The Virginia aspect is kind of interesting, it's close to the government  and, you know, I think they need to address a whole lot of maybe regulatory  issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  So, you know, that makes a whole lot of sense there, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, just really quickly, I'm sure we'll get to this in the show,  but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has just been elected to Congress,  representing part of Queens, is calling in to question Amazon moving into  Queens.  </p><p>The idea of we receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a  time when our subway is crumbling out and our communities need more  investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here that -- </p><p>Well, we will just talk about that, because that shows a fundamental  misunderstanding of the way an economy works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a misunderstanding of what the whole point in giving  tax breaks to companies are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the whole point, is to lead to jobs.  </p><p>FORREST:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Twenty-five thousand jobs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you -- do you have a leave -- do you have a leave?  Because  that gives me a headache.  That economic analysis -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have an Advil for you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is just -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I might have an Advil for you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kim, thank you so much.  We will see you soon.  </p><p>FORREST:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're watching all of the above.  Kim Forrest joining us.   We'll take a break.  </p><p>When we come back, wild fires are out of control in California.  The  multiple blaze is burning across the state, becoming the deadliest in the  state history.  The very latest coming next.  </p><p>And then withholding data, new reports suggest Boeing did not share  potential problems with flight control systems.  It could have played a  role in the Lion Air jet crash next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  In Northern California, wild fire becoming the  deadliest in state history.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details right  now.  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  The  monster campfire has now killed at least 42 people in Northern California,  hundreds are still unaccounted for.  President Trump has approved a major  disaster declaration for the Golden State. </p><p>In Southern California, that's where you have the Woosley Fire that's  destroyed more than 400 homes and businesses.  That fire has killed at  least two people.  </p><p>Thousands of structures remain at risk, red-flag warning in effect for L.A.  and Ventura counties, and obviously the weather is not helping the  situation.</p><p>Well, Boeing reportedly withheld information on the Lion Air jet that  crashed in Indonesia last month, killing all 189 people on board.  </p><p>The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Boeing didn't tell airlines about  potential hazards in a new flight control feature on their 737 Max.  </p><p>The problem is that the system can push the plane's nose down so strongly  that pilots can't pull it back up.  The automated stall prevention system  is being investigated as playing a role in the crash.  </p><p>Shares of Boeing are up a quarter of one percent.  And premarket trading,  Maria, you will talk to Boeing Chairman, and CEO, President Dennis  Muilenburg.  That's at 8:30 this morning.  </p><p>Everybody stay tuned for that that.  </p><p>Well, fans worldwide are paying tribute to a real superhero.  Stan Lee, the  father of Spider-Man, The Hulk, Iron Man, and many other memorable comic  characters, died yesterday in Los Angeles.  </p><p>Lee was a legendary Writer and Publisher of Marvel Comics whose creations  revolutionized comic books.  </p><p>His comics were often turned into blockbuster movies, generating billions  of dollars worldwide. </p><p>Stanley dead at the age of 95.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Coming up next, midterm  madness.  More inconsistencies in the Florida recount process.  They are  popping up as the judge tells both sides to ramp down the rhetoric, that  and other races still not decided right after this break.  </p><p>And then a tidy box, this new design for Tide's detergent driving the  internet nuts this morning.  We will tell you why.  Stay with us on that.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching markets this morning after a big  selloff yesterday.  Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading this  morning.  </p><p>We are looking at a gain of about 145 points on the Dow Industrials, that's  two-thirds of one percent after a 600-point selloff yesterday.  </p><p>The S&amp;P is up 16, and the NASDAQ is up 60 points right now.</p><p>I want to turn to the midterm fallout.  New oversight, the hours on the  senate race has been called.  Kyrsten Sinema, becoming the first democrat  elected in 30 years.  </p><p>In Georgia, a judge extending the deadline to certify votes in the  governor's race there.  </p><p>Republican Brian Kemp is ahead by nearly 60,000 that votes right now, but  Democrat Stacey Abrams is filing a lawsuit to count rejected ballots.</p><p>And then in Florida, ballot drama, the recount is in full swing right now,  but large counties are scrambling to meet the deadline of Thursday.  </p><p>Fox News' Griff Jenkins is in Lauderhill, Florida.  He's at the Broward  County Office of Elections.</p><p>Griff, good morning to you.  </p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  </p><p>You may be watching the markets, but I'm watching ballots being separated  in Broward County.  Take a look at this.  The tabulation room, they still  have not begun the recount here.  </p><p>Now in 65 of Florida's 67 counties, they are either halfway done or even  more from the recount being done, but here in Palm Beach County, they're  far from it.  What they have to do is finish separating page one.  </p><p>Then they'll likely do a calibration of the machines and begin the actual  official tabulation recount.  That isn't expected any time before about  9:00 a.m. here so it's quite an issue as they race towards the Thursday  deadline to get those numbers in.  </p><p>But we were surprised, Maria, yesterday when the Election Supervisor here,  Dr. Brenda Snipes, came out, talked to the media, and addressed allegations  that she has made major mistakes this election, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRENDA SNIPES, SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS, BROWARD COUNTY:  The lawsuits, as  they are written, certainly cast dispersions on my character.  </p><p>I've have worked here for about 15 years and I have to say this is the  first time that this office or I have been under such attacks, so if we  make mistakes, we own mistakes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  Then the stunning development, FormerFlorida Governor, Jeb Bush,  tweeting that he believes Snipes failed to comply with the law in multiple  counts and called for her removal.  </p><p>Jeb was the one that appointed her in 2003 to replace the previous  supervisor who had to be removed for similar problems.  </p><p>Meanwhile, on the national level, Senator Nelson and Governor Scott trading  nasty barbs, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D), CALIFORNIA:  Scott cannot oversee this process in a  fair and impartial way, and thus he should remove himself from any role in  the recount process.</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  Our goal is that we follow the law.  We know  Brenda Snipes mixed illegal ballots with legal ballots.  We know they've  not let party officials in, the courts have said follow the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  If they do indeed get this recount started and meet that Thursday  deadline here in Broward County, Maria, lawyers tell me that they expect  the margin of error to be under that .25 percent and will be headed for a  hand recount after Thursday.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Griff, thank you much.  Griff Jenkins this morning on  that.  </p><p>This is an incredible story, that now we see that Sinema has actually won  in Arizona and these other two are so close.  </p><p>I mean, Georgia, 60,000 votes sounds like a lot, but she's still fighting  in Georgia, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She is still fighting in Georgia, so -- but the Republicans know  definitively that they will still have a 51-seat majority in the Senate,  that's the take away from that.</p><p>But in terms of what's going on down in Florida, there's a history in  Broward County of problems there.  </p><p>I just want to point that out because Brenda Snipes seems to suggest that  people are attacking her and her character, well, there have been glitches,  mistakes, and even illegal ballot destruction in her county under her  supervision.</p><p>The -- a court ruling found in May, Broward Election Supervisor Brenda  Snipes illegally destroyed ballots from a 2016 congressional race with  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was trying to push off this primary challenger,  Tim Canova.  </p><p>So again, there's a history of problems there and raises the issue of if  you were the steward of the county when these problems happened, why was  she still there going into the midterms?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why is she saying that she's been on this job 15 years and this  is the first time she's getting attacked when we know darn well that there  have been issues in the past?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think that Miami Herald and all the newspapers in the State  of Florida write about these problems often and so now that she's in the  national spotlight, maybe it feels a little bit different.  </p><p>But there are issues there and they're front and center during the  midterms.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Count and recount.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll keep following that.  </p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, searching for deal, Vice President  Pence is looking to set a trade agreement with japan that would serve as a  model for other countries.  </p><p>General Jack Keane is here, he will weigh on that.  </p><p>And then on precedence and security, as drug lord, El Chapo, sees his day  in a New York Court.  He will be here today in New York to face that.</p><p>The very latest straight ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures, indicating a bit of a bounce, this morning, after a sharp selloff  yesterday, Dow Industrials set to open up about 130 points that is one-half  of one percent, S&amp;P is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ with a gain of 57  points, good for gain of almost one percent out of the gate, this morning.  </p><p>This after the major indices took a big hit yesterday, a five percent  decline in Apple stock, took a chunk out of this market, that's a Dow  component and a NASDAQ component, the Dow was down 602 points at the close,  down better than two percent, S&amp;P was down about two percent, and the  NASDAQ with a 206-point selloff, was down almost 3 percent, yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the bouncing is continuing, the FT-100 is also  recovering along with stocks on Wall Street, that is up a quarter of a  percent, in London.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up almost half a percent  and the DAX Index in Germany, up three quarters of one percent, 87 points  higher.</p><p>Mixed performances in Asia, overnight, worst performer, Japan; Nikkei  Average down two percent, the Shanghai composite in China, up almost one  percent.</p><p>Crude oil slipping this morning, this after the price of oil closed lower,  yesterday, for 11 days in a row, the very latest on oil's bear market,  coming up.  It is down 20 percent from the highs, just 5 weeks ago.</p><p>Home Depot, reporting earnings this morning, they were better-than- expected, the improvement store out with double beat.  We will break it  down for you as the stock is up 2-1/4 percent, that's helping the Dow  Industrials for sure.</p><p>Zuckerberg won't go, the Facebook founder could be held in contempt after  declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.  And  another Tide controversy to report, the detergent's new packaging being  compared to a box of wine, we will get into all of that, coming up.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, mounting pressure on China,  Vice President Mike Pence headed to Singapore, to talk trade, with the  Association of the Southeast Asian Nations.  Speaking with Japanese Prime  Minister Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo, yesterday, the Vice President took a strong  stance on China, ahead of the President's meeting with President Xi, at the  end of the month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States seeks a  relationship with China that's based on fairness, reciprocity and respect  for sovereignty.  The difficulties that the United States and other nations  face with China have been well documented by our administration.  And China  knows where we stand.</p><p>Nevertheless, President Trump is looking forward to his meeting with  President Xi, in Argentina.  He believes that progress could be made, but  either way, we're confident that the United States remains in a strong  position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that is FOX News  Strategic Senior Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to see  this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to  see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you were just in Singapore, a few months ago, meeting with  leadership there, your take on the Vice President's comments and how  Singapore and the U.S. can team up here?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, yes, they're very concerned.  I just came back from Vietnam  this weekend also, they are very concerned about what China has been doing  in the region for years, and largely getting away with it.  You know,  because, the United States had never truly engaged competitively against  China.</p><p>And they think that we have a long way to make up for it, but they truly  appreciate the fact that the United States is back in the game, so to  speak, and they're pushing back on China's economic and political warfare  and also their militarization, particularly, the South China Sea.</p><p>And I think Vice President Pence's Seminole speech, a few weeks ago, on  China, caught everybody's attention in the Indo-Pacific.  And that was a  huge step forward for the United States, but most importantly for our  relationship with our allies.</p><p>So, I think Vice President Pence will be very welcome by the ASEAN leaders,  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and I think he will get positive  feedbacks for the fact that President Trump is, once again, exercising  American leadership in the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General, the President really has to walk a balance here,  because while pushing back on China, trying to get them to change their  behavior, it also could impact business.  We've got the CEO of Boeing  coming in here, this morning, to talk about his business.  In the coming  year and years, one in four or five planes made at Boeing, will go to  China.</p><p>This is the second largest market for Boeing, and that's just in the  aerospace maker, I mean, there are tons of other companies, as well,  looking to China for opportunities, so how does the President walk that  balance?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I think, there has to be a balance.  Listen, clearly, China  is a major market and American businesses will continue to do work there,  to be sure, but I think what the President has done and illuminated the  issue in trying to find the balance and stop stealing our intellectual  property, stop -- </p><p>If you have to do business in China, as you well know, Maria, you've got to  enter into a joint venture with them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  That's not the way we do business in Europe or in the Middle East,  and as a result to that joint venture, they get access to our intellectual  property.  That's got to stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.</p><p>KEANE:  So, I think -- I think if we continue to do business, that's fine,  but let's get it on a balance table where it's much more equitable and it's  kind of the way we do business in other parts of the world.  I will tell  you this, a lot of the supply chain that exists in China, and from American  businesses and other businesses are looking to go elsewhere.</p><p>And in Vietnam, that I just came back from, they are reaping some of the  benefits of that, as will other nations in the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean -- I guess business has been dealing with, you  know, succumbing to China and handing over their technology and going by  their rules for so long that they forgot how unfair it was.  Look, the  other major point in the Vice President's statement yesterday, was on North  Korea.  Watch this, got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE:  The President has made it clear that the time for implementing the  agreement is not a driving factor.  And as I assured you, Mr. Prime  Minister, the pressure campaign will continue, the sanctions will remain in  full force, until we achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of  North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New satellite images reportedly show that North Korea is moving  ahead with its nuclear program after Kim Jong-un's agreement with President  Trump, so your take on these developments, General?  What now?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, the Vice President's visit to Japan and talking  to Prime Minister Abe, I will tell you what, he got an earful from him  because that's the person that President Trump do talks in any other world  leader and he truly gives him very good perspective on what's going on in  North Korea and China.</p><p>Listen, the North Koreans, in principle, have agreed to denuclearized, in  fact, they have not taken a single step to do that.  What we wanted out of  the box was; one, give us an inventory of all of your sites and your  weapons themselves, two, give us a plan to destroy and disarm ballistic  missiles and nuclear weapons that has not happened.</p><p>And what we have to stay focused on, is the third thing, there's not been a  single ballistic missile or nuclear weapon that has been disarmed or  destroyed.  So while this progress on the fringes and there are a lot of  positive statements, the reality is, in terms of what needs to be done,  there hasn't been any substantive progress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And for the U.S., what does that mean?  Should the U.S. be  doing something different in terms of our strategy to get the  denuclearization back on track?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, that's a great question, and certainly that's something that  the National Security team of this administration is working on.  I would  suggest, one, we've got to -- we've got to get tough on China because  they've opened the aperture on the sanctions, and some of that backdoors  are happening.</p><p>The Russians have always backdoored North Korea.  We're not going to make  any progress with them.  The State Department has to make certain that the  other nations are not giving up, there's no missiles flying, there's no  tests being taken, there's a -- there's no sense of a crisis, so we have to  make sure the other countries are enforcing the sanctions.</p><p>And we've got to up our game ourselves and we can do that militarily, start  moving some things into the region, make sure that they know that we're  dead serious, it's either you give us the weapons, Mr. Chairman of North  Korea, or we're going to come take the weapons, that's the deal that's on  the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask you about oil, in that vein, President  Trump took aim at Saudi Arabia yesterday, after reports that the country  plans to cut oil production.  The President tweeted this yesterday,  hopefully Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production.  Oil  prices should be much lower based on supply.</p><p>Look, we know, General, that the U.S. has become one of the leading  producers at this point, and now, with the Saudis and OPEC, wanting to cut  production, they're trying to boost prices because it's in a bear market  right now, 20 percent lower from the highs.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  Well, this consensus in the last OPEC meeting, even the so- called Russian cartel, you know, they felt it was going to be a cutback  obviously, in Iranian crude, on the market and as a result of that, the  Russian cartel increased prices, but then this consensus developing now,  that there's going to be an oversupply in 2019.</p><p>I suspect -- the Saudis have made a decision to cut -- I think OPEC will  cut next month, in Vienna, and the Russians will likely follow suit.   That's the path that we are on.  I don't think there's anything that's  going to change it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have been expecting a change in Homeland Security.  I know  that the Washington Post is reporting that Kirstjen Nielsen, Homeland  Security Secretary, is out, and I was hearing the same thing actually, that  they've already had the discussion.</p><p>My sources told me that they've already had the conversation that the  Secretary is going to be out of that job in -- as the President changes its  administration after the midterms, your thoughts on Kirstjen Nielsen being  out?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I don't know anything about that, on the inside, honestly.   But I do know what I'm looking at and clearly, the administration has got  to be very frustrated with the open border that we have because there are  hundreds of people coming through every week, who are coming, seeking  asylum, and we have to release them.</p><p>And that's what's happening, because our system is so backed up with people  who are waiting to be processed.  The so-called catch and release, it's  hundreds, happening every week.  We are focused on the caravan to be sure,  but the equivalent to a caravan, is happening every month.</p><p>And that's got the administration's focus because they get daily reports on  all of this, and I think they are just genuinely dissatisfied with where  things are.  Certainly, the Congress is part of this problem, but it's not  the only part of the problem.  And I think that's likely what's driving the  replacements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the President -- the President cancelled the trip this  week, with Kirstjen Nielsen, to the southern border, in Texas.  Now,  that's, I guess, the Washington Post is saying this is the impetus.  But,  you know, as you say, he's been very frustrated with her, because of the  open borders, but she says it's a Congress problem.  She can't do anything  different because this is the law, General.</p><p>So, the President's frustrated with the person who is in the job, but  doesn't -- aren't her hands tied?</p><p>KEANE:  Her hands are somewhat tied.  But I suspect, now, this is just  speculation on my part, I suspect that the President has received some  advice from other advisers who are saying there are some other options that  we could be putting into play here, and certainly, having resources to cope  with the problem.</p><p>So we're not catching and release, would likely be a start.  And  increasingly, how we process these people in getting their hearings, would  be another part of the puzzle.  I just suspect that over time, there's been  a loss of confidence here if what you're reporting is accurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  There is going to be a replacement.  I think it's largely  immigration issue.  I don't even think it has to do with -- it's one of the  largest -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you're right.</p><p>KEANE:  departments in government.  I don't think that has to do with  anything else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  It's totally the immigration issue, 100  percent, that's what I'm hearing.  But real quick, General, before you go,  any thoughts on who might replace her?</p><p>KEANE:  No, I have no idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so  much.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As always, General Jack Keane, joining us there.  Coming up,  Zuckerberg skips out, why the Facebook founder could be held in contempt,  after declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.   And then, first Tide pods, now this, the internet goes crazy over Tide's  new detergent design, it looks like a case of boxed wine, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The trial of El Chapo set to begin today in New  York.  Lauren Simonetti with the details now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  The notorious Mexican drug lord will be in a Brooklyn federal  court this morning with unprecedented security for the jurors and for  Joaquin El Chapo Guzman himself.  Security will include snipers perched on  rooftops and an armored vehicle to transport Guzman.  He's accused of  spending quarter century smuggling more than 150 tons of cocaine into the  U.S.  He was extradited from Mexico last year after escaping prison two  times.  The trial expected to last more than four months.  Prosecutors say,  the evidence will include the testimony of over a dozen witnesses.  </p><p>Well, a Canadian politician says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be held  in contempt after he refused to appear before an international panel of  five governments that are investigating the company.  That politicians says  he might issue subpoena forcing Zuckerberg to appear before Canada's  parliament.  Zuckerberg had rejected an earlier request to appear before an  international grand committee looking into disinformation and election  meddling.  Facebook not commenting, shares of the company up $1.23 this  morning.</p><p>Well, Procter &amp; Gamble may have another packaging problem.  The company  debut its eco-box, which happens to look a lot like a wine box but that new  Tide box is generating some buzz on Twitter.  This is what one user wrote:  \"You all don't want kids eating Tide pods but when you make a wine box  tide, what do you want from me?  Well, he was referring to the Tide pod  challenge last year when teenagers were daring each other to eat the  detergent pods but would you drink the Tide wine?  I don't know, I hope  that's not an adult challenge coming up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a crazy story.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were eating the pods.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But looks like a wine box, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It does.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I have freshman in college, and I'm frightened right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Where do you think that stuff happens, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a keg, not a wine box.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, owing the best for your friends; how Petco plans to  provide your pet with only health foods.  That's next, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, President Trump just tweeting this, we want to  get this out: \"Emmanuel Macron suggesting building its own army to protect  Europe against the United States, China and Russia, but it was Germany in  World Wars I and 2.  How did that work for France?  They're starting to  learn German in Paris before U.S. came along.

Joining us right is the CEO of Petco, Ron Couglin, and  it's good to see you, Ron.  </p><p>RON COUGHLIN, CEO, PETCO:  It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  I was telling you during  commercial break, I only used to serve Ellabela steamed string beans as  treats and she died at almost 18 years old.  She lived a long and strong  life as a result.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  You what's amazing, over 50 percent of pet owners, cook for  their pets.  We were talking about it earlier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Only 50 percent.</p><p>COUGHLIN:  Over 50 percent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  And we're bringing human grade food actually into Petco shortly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about what you're doing?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Yes.  So, the big announcement today is that we're going to be  eliminating all cat and dog foods and treats with artificial flavors,  artificial colors, artificial preservatives.  You know, if you think about  the bet we love, do we want ethanol to be served to them, do we want sulfur  dioxide, do we want (INAUDIBLE), so the answer is no.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And those are in most pet foods?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Those are in certain pet foods.  Now, the reality is, Petco has  been weening off those products, other companies have much higher percent  of those foods.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, Charlie and Ramon don't eat those, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, they eat a food that you can't buy at Petco.  They eat blue  buffalo basic, limited ingredient, grain-free canned food and also -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And also, I.D. which is prescription and you're going to begin  to sell prescription dog food. </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  This week, we started doing prescription dog food  on Petco.com.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, big response from customers?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Yes, we've seen response thus far, but today is our announcement  day, so we're very proud of it.  It's big deal for the industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's higher premium that people will pay.  It's amazing  to me how much money people spend on their dogs and their cats.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anything -- most of my dogs have gastro, severe gastro  intestinal problems, so anything to keep them healthy but you were talking  about -- you're going to actually start selling cooked food, literally  human food for animals?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, humanization is one of the biggest trends,  folks like you but you don't always have time.  So, what we're going to do  is we're partnered with company called Just Food for Dogs, and we actually  are going to have kitchens.  Union Scare, right here, is going to have a  kitchen where we cook for your dog; you can come in and get fresh food  every day for your dog.  My dog right now is having salmon and sweet  potatoes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Lucky dog.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  So, if you're having salmon and sweet potatoes, your pet should  have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And does this make a difference in the dog's life?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Absolutely, it's all vet-driven mixtures.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can't feed them too much, though, because they'll get fat  and that's a huge problem, obesity in animals.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Ron, real quick, we've been talking about the Petco Foundation,  maybe a little bit on that.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, we're very proud of the Petco Foundation,  especially in times and of hurricanes, fires, et cetera.  We go in and take  care of the pets, we give free food, we give funding to the shelters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Ron.  That's fantastic.  Great, check out  Petco.  Ron Coughlin, thank you for joining us.  Still ahead, a diamond fit  for a ring, we will show you more of this ring designed by Apple's chief  designer; it's made entirely out of diamond, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, November 13th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 on the button on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets set to rebound this morning after a sharp selloff yesterday.   Futures indicate a gain of 128 points on the Dow, one-half of 1 percent at  the opening of trading.  The Nasdaq is up 56 points right now, almost 1  percent this morning after a broad-based selloff yesterday where the Nasdaq  was hit hard.</p><p>Apple and Goldman Sachs dragged the Dow lower but better than 600 points at  the close, down 2.3 percent on the Dow; down 2 percent on the S&amp;P; and on  the Nasdaq, the worst performer on the day, down nearly 3 percent as  technology took a real hit.</p><p>Global markets this morning are also recovering.  Take a look at European  indices.  The FT 100 is up a fraction.  The CAC 40 is up 23 points, that's  one-half of a percent.  And the DAX index in Germany is up 92 points.  That  is almost 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia, overnight mixed performances, the worst performer was Japan.   Nikkei average down better than 2 percent.</p><p>Well, the picks are in, Amazon will soon call Long Island City, New York  and Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the second headquarters  selection with the announcement coming as early as today.  The official  announcement.</p><p>Raging wild fires in California meanwhile, the death toll rising to nearly  50 people between the massive fires.  Residents are describing what  happened when infernos tore through their homes and their neighborhood.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was unbelievable.  You couldn't see 10 feet in front  of you.  I mean embers everywhere.  Smoke everywhere.</p><p>It's devastating.  It's beyond words.  I mean there's no way to explain it.   It -- I mean it loks like a nuclear blast went off here.  It's crazy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take you live to southern California with the very  latest coming up.</p><p>New questions for Boeing this morning.  A new report says that the jet  maker withheld information on its 737, the same model involved in the  deadly Indonesia crash last month.  Boeing's chairman and CEO Dennis  Muilenburg will join me in a Fox Business exclusive this morning.  That's  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that interview coming up.</p><p>And a scare on the court, a Nets player suffers a gruesome injury leaving  people in the crowd in tears.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PWC partner Mitch  Roschelle and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see  everybody this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for being here after a huge day yesterday in  markets.  Look, we're in a good earnings period, Lindsey, and yet the  market trades down 600 points on these growth concerns.  What's going on?  </p><p>BELL:  Yes. Growth is the big question mark for 2019.  Look, we're cycling  the tax reform package, fiscal stimulus is coming to a peak right now as we  look out to 2019, interest rates are rising.  It seems like global growth  could be slowing especially with China.</p><p>So the question is where do earnings go from here?  We're looking right now  at 8.5 percent growth for 2019, that's down from 10 percent that we saw all  through earlier this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Revenue?  </p><p>BELL:  Revenue, it actually ticked up a slight bit to 6.3 percent which is  pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about earnings of 10 percent.  </p><p>BELL:  Earnings of 8.5 percent for 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  </p><p>BELL:  Came down -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's way down.  No wonder markets are upset about things  slowing down.  For 2018 -- talking about earnings being up 25 percent;  going down to 8 percent in 2019.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  But so much of that was a one-timer from tax  reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think what the market isn't really fully digesting is the  forward guidance is in a new tax regime year over year mode.  And a lot of  people looking at the difference between the 20 plus percent earnings  growth in '18 and then less than 10 percent in '19 and they're having a  hard time digesting it.</p><p>We should put like -- maybe they should just watch this show and hear us  say this enough.  Because there's really no reason to freak out.  These are  still strong earnings numbers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  But a lot of this, I would  argue, is higher interest rates and the Federal Reserve still in the  process of winding down that multitrillion dollar balance sheet where  you've seen a deflation in assets, not just in the stock market, in the  last six weeks or so.</p><p>But look at what oil has done, down 11 days in a row.  That is a record  streak for declines in the cost of crude oil.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are a lot of things at play, maybe actual supply and  demand fundamentals, but also money just coming out of this was clearly an  over-inflated asset.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Apple, we'll talk about that.  What do the  price of oil and Apple tell you about the broader economy.</p><p>Coming up, my exclusive interview this morning with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk to him about what he's  seeing in the global economy, of course, commercial aerospace has been on  fire.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, House majority whip and Louisiana  Congressman Steve Scalise is here.  He's out with a new book.  Congressman- Elect Michael Waltz will join us, Green Beret.  And the CEO of the Mayo  Clinic is back, Dr. John Noseworthy, with some news today.  The host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney here as well.</p><p>We've got a big two hours coming up.  Don't miss a moment of it because we  are reporting this morning the news of the day.</p><p>Our top story right now is that sharp selloff in stocks.  Futures are  higher this morning as the technology sector tries to recover from a sharp  decline yesterday.  It pulled the markets lower, knocking off more than 600  points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>Yesterday it was a sharp selloff and Apple really drove things, drove a  technology slump.</p><p>Now today, this morning it is unchanged after taking a hit amid fresh  concerns over the demand for the iPhone.</p><p>Joining us right now is Scott Martin.  He is Kingsview Asset Management  CIO.  Scott -- good to see you this morning.  I know you've had your share  of worries out there for markets.  Is yesterday's performance telling us  anything about what's ahead?  </p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Probably.  You know, you're  right, Maria -- without the markets I've got enough to worry about.  So  thank you markets for making that even more compounded.  </p><p>Listen, I love what you guys talked about there in the intro to the hour.   Lindsey is absolutely right.  You know, the revenue numbers estimates have  come down, the earnings estimates have come down.</p><p>Mitch is right, too.  You know, guys -- I started some meditation over the  last couple of weeks so you should definitely try that at home, kids.  I  think that has helped me with some of the worries -- Maria.</p><p>And the market needs stop freaking out.  You know, that's the thing like --  kind of like they say in the meditation, be calm because even though  earnings like you said, Maria, and you pointed out astutely are not growing  at 20 plus percent, guess what, kids -- that was unsustainable.  I mean  those weren't numbers that we're going to keep repeating.</p><p>But the market maybe got fooled into thinking that or let's just say we got  valuation metrics that seemed to be aligned with the thinking that that was  going to continue.</p><p>So as we alight or let's say descend back to reasonable numbers and  reasonable economic growth expectation, Lindsey mentioned interest rates  going up and so forth, the market needs to settle into some price here and  then I think it can rebuild some of these losses.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Scott, is there -- if you want to be defensive or if you want  to stay in the market but not have to meditate and do yoga to stay calm --  where's the place to be right now?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, and I haven't found any good yoga or meditation stocks yet,  Mitch, but I'm still looking for them.  You know, there are places to be  and that's a great thing to point out, you know.  This is not a total  freak-out selloff, even kind of like we saw in February just yet or even  like we saw over Brexit or even like we saw, you know, back in the late  2000s, you know, 2008 and so on, because there are things that are working,  specifically -- and we haven't bought enough of this stuff yet but we're  accruing it.</p><p>Look at consumer staples, look at real estate.  Look at utilities.  You  know, if interest rates come down because people like say with the freak- out, you know, they freak-out and they buy bonds, they buy fixed income  instruments and that drives down interest rates.  Some of these interest  rate sensitive names tend to hang in there when equity markets go like they  did yesterday.  </p><p>So Mitch -- I would say those are three good sectors for the individual  investors at home to look at that we start to pick up as well that have  started to mitigate some of the volatility.  </p><p>BELL:  Hey -- Scotty.  So you mentioned a lot of defensive sectors there  which as you rightly point out they've been doing well more recently.  But  what hasn't been doing well is tech.  and that is what led the market over  the past two years.  </p><p>Right now you have two -- three quarters of the S&amp;P 500 tech sector in bear  market territory.  Do we need the tech sector though to continue to move  this bull market higher?  </p><p>MARTIN:  We need something to, Lindsey and I'll tell you that's the  interesting point is you had these great leadership names -- you know, your  favorite ones and ones we still own.  You know, Google, Apple, Microsoft,  Amazon, Netflix, Whatever, Broadcom, Adobe -- great companies that were  crushing earnings and getting high valuations, again like we talked about  that were probably undeserved. </p><p>And now Lindsey -- the market has no leadership, you know.  Everybody has  been calling in the so-called experts, have said, oh my gods, this is the  time for financials because the Fed is hiking interest rates.  When the  reality for the most part, they were just flattening the interest rate  curve.</p><p>And so to me, it needs leadership.  I don't know if it's tech necessarily.   I was hoping for a while there it was going to be industrials because we  were hopefully going to get some of these trade deals reworked and more in  our favor and that was going to work out for some of the companies like  Deere, Caterpillar and some of the other ones we own.</p><p>But maybe it's health care.  That gets worked out with you know, maybe a  bipartisan congress.  Who knows?  But I think you're right, Lindsey.  It  doesn't necessarily have to be tech but it has to be some leadership in  some other sector to take the reins of this market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about financials?  I mean that's probably tough  because you've got higher rates going on.  Tech is where the growth has  been.  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  Higher rates are interesting, Maria -- because even though  the fed's been hiking interest rates, rates did get a nice boost as we saw,  you know, into October and then they've kind of fallen off a bit.  I mean  look at, you know, last week we were at 3.25 again on the 10 year and now I  think I checked this morning we're at 3.15.</p><p>So, you know,, financials kind of remind me of all the girls that turned me  down in high school.  I had to bring that up.  Because they're never there,  you know.  Like financials every year we hear somebody make this bold call  on financials being there and being the one, and they're never doing it.</p><p>So to me I'm not ready to give up on financials but as far as overweighting  financials, I won't do that either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what about Amazon, the split decision expected to divide  its second headquarters between evenly between New York City and northern  Virginia.  According to the Journal this morning, the announcement is  probably -- could come as early as today.</p><p>Is this a smart decision?  What are your thoughts here?  Would you put new  money to work in this market right here?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, we would.  I would slowly start weighting it again.  I don't  think that, you know, you have to jump in on a day like today where, you  know, we had a little bit of mixed trading overseas, especially in the  Nikkei, for example as you pointed out all morning.  And we've got a little  bit of a bounce today.</p><p>But I mean guys, even Eli Manning had a decent football game last night.   So the market can bounce just like that as well.</p><p>But I think Maria -- there's some levels that are coming into play here  that are decent as far as some of these tech names that have sold off 20,  25 percent.  So I think you can start weighting in here with some money but  just have a quick kind of hook on it if things start to get worse again  because you may get some lower prices.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Scott always a pleasure.   Thanks so much for weighing in here.</p><p>MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scott Martin joining us there.</p><p>Turning to the devastation in California right now, the wildfires are  becoming the deadliest in state history.  Fox News' Ray Bogan is in Ventura  County this morning with the very latest.  Good morning to you -- ray.  </p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Maria -- good morning.  </p><p>We're at the incident command center for the Woolsey and Hill Fires where  in just a couple of hours, hundreds of firefighters will arrive to get  their morning briefing.  They're working 24 hour shifts.</p><p>In the meantime, some of them are sleeping in tents.  One man is even over  to my left in a sleeping bag.</p><p>Now, in northern California, investigators are looking into whether a  sparking PG&amp;E power line may have started the Camp Fire which has become  the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state's history.  42 people  have died.  They've been found in their homes and cars as they were trying  to escape. </p><p>At last update, the fire was 30 percent contained and Cal Fire doesn't  expect to have full containment for another week.  Nearly 6,500 homes have  been destroyed, including some belonging to firefighters and their  families.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID HAWKE, PARADISE FIRE CHIEF:  It's just absolutely heart-breaking to  drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.  My family lost  their home in the fire.  My parents did.  My grandmother did.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOGAN:  Now, here in southern California, the Woolsey Fire at last update  was 93,000 acres and 30 percent contained.  Firefighters estimate more than  400 buildings have been destroyed.</p><p>In both fires crews are working against dry, windy conditions and steep  terrain but California is getting help.  President Trump has approved a  major disaster declaration and in addition, Cal Fire is thanking 17 state  partners that have come from as far as Alaska and Georgia.  Maria, back to  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Ray.  Thank you so much.  We will follow this.  And  this is an incredibly devastating story.  Ray -- thank you.  Ray Bogan  there.  </p><p>Coming up, concerns in the sky.  The new report that Boeing withheld  information on its 737.  The same model involved in the deadly Indonesia  crash last month.  I'll speaking exclusively with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing this morning.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk about that  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern and also get his take on the on the commercial  aerospace boom he's been seeing.  Over the last few years.</p><p>Then an injury on the court, the details after a player's gruesome leg  injury leaves some in tears, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New information coming to light this morning following last month's crash  of a Boeing jet in Indonesia.  Lauren Simonetti with the Details now --  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hi -- Maria, Boeing reportedly withheld  information on the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max which killed all 189 people  on-board that day.  Safety experts and others telling the \"Wall Street  Journal\" that Boeing didn't tell airlines about potential hazards in their  new flight control feature on that plane.  The problem is that the system  can push the plane's nose down so strongly that pilots can't pull it back  up.</p><p>The automated stall prevention system is being investigated as playing a  role in that Lion Air crash.  Shares of Boeing trading up a quarter of a  percent, $358.  And programming note -- Maria will sit down with Boeing's  chairman, CEO and president Dennis Muilenburg in the next hour on Morning's  with Maria, 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Well, the Labor Department is trying to help people save money and curb  401-k cash-outs.  The department could soon allow companies to  automatically transfer (INAUDIBLE) accounts of $5,000 or less belonging to  employees who change jobs to the 401-k plan of their new employers.  It's  the effort to cut down on the premature flow of money out of retirement  plans.  Research shows that as many as 80 percent of people leaving jobs  with less than $5,000 in those accounts eventually cash out of them.</p><p>Well, check this out.  Apple's head designer, Johnnie Ives, has taken on a  project more elegant than your iPhone.  He designed a ring carved from a  single chunk of diamond.  It could sell for a quarter million dollars at an  auction at Sotheby's.  Sotheby's says the ring has up to 3,000 facets,  never seen before on a single piece.  It will be made to fit the buyer, up  to a size 5, which is actually pretty small.  All of those proceeds going  to charity.  But most designers start with the metal.  Johnnie Ives took  the metal out of the equation and started with the diamonds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow -- so it's all diamond all around.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All diamonds -- Baby.  And diamonds are my birth stone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they are a girl's best friend.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can hear the woman.  How are they supposed to know it's  diamonds?  You know, you can't tell.  Sorry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  All right.  Thank you -- Lauren.</p><p>Coming up, the state of health care in America.  The CEO of the Mayo Clinic  Dr. John Noseworthy is here.  He's weighing in on the industry innovations,  plus an exclusive announcement that will change health care, certainly at  the Mayo Clinic -- that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A major investment in the future of health care in America.   The Mayo Clinic School of Medicine receiving a $200 million gift from  philanthropist Jay Alix, the largest ever made to the clinic.</p><p>Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive are Alix Partners founder  Jay Alix and Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. John Noseworthy.  Great to see you both.   Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JAY ALIX, FOUNDER, ALIX PARTNERS:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p>DR. JOHN NOSEWORTHY, CEO, MAYO CLINIC:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Jay -- what a gift.  Congratulations to you that you're  able to do such a thing for the Mayo Clinic.  </p><p>ALIX:  Absolutely.</p><p>You know, Mayo is such a he deserving institution.  The medical school is  one of the top ranked medical schools in the country.  And to be able to be  involved with them, to help them with their mission is just a really great  opportunity for us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is going to help the medical school a lot, Dr.  Noseworthy.  And you're also going to be able to attract new talent with  this.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  Thanks -- Maria.  Yes, this is really going to help us a great  deal, attract the best students from all over the world, from all  backgrounds regardless of their ability to pay for medical education. </p><p>And it will help us with new curriculum and dual degrees and innovative  ways of teaching and technology and all those good things.  It's a  wonderful gift.  We're really grateful to Jay.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are now going to be on the board.</p><p>ALIX:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you want to see from the Mayo Clinic and how this  money could be best used.  </p><p>ALIX:  Well, what this gift is about is really helping attract the best  students for the medical school, to train the doctors of the future.  The  country is facing a crisis that we're going to need probably 110,000  doctors in the next 10 years that we don't have today and we don't know  where they're going to come from.</p><p>So we need to train more doctors and we have to provide the money and the  support and the scholarship to help those students get into medical school  and have the country have the right doctors in the future.  Mayo can do  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  It was major issue in this past election,  everybody said that health care was the number one matter that was very  important to voters.  The Democrats taking the House in the midterm  elections.  And they say one of the priorities is health care in America.</p><p>So John -- tell us where the needs are right now.  Tell us what your view  is in terms of what needs to be done to take health care up to the next  level.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  So the majority of Americans are concerned about access,  coverage, and the cost of health care and the need for transparency to  drive down the cost but also improve the outcomes.  And we support all of  that.</p><p>From Mayo Clinic's perspective, it's more than cost.  It's certainly cost  but it's also outcomes and the performance and how well health care  performs.  And at Mayo Clinic we're all about serious and complex illness  and how to finance as quickly and effectively and provide patients with the  best possible care.</p><p>So the doctors of the future are going to have to deal with transparency,  coverage cost, access, technology, how to drive the safest and highest  technology, most affordable health care system which we don't have at the  moment, as you know.  We're tied to these election cycles every two years.   So it's this and that and this and that and until the country decides that  it's really a priority for the citizens, we're not going to get that long- lasting answer that we need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you talk about outcomes.  You know, we've been all about  prevention these last several years, talking about getting ahead of  disease.  How might that money be used toward getting ahead of disease and  when you look at the needs in this country today.  I mean I know we haven't  done enough work or we need more money for Alzheimer's, for example.  And  you know, issues related to the brain.  Where are the needs in that regard?  </p><p>ALIX:  Well, I think we have really leading edge technologies now.  We have  artificial intelligence coming online.  What A.I. is going to do for  medicine and the digitization of medical, you know, personal health data is  going to revolutionize how we can do diagnosis.  And of course with it, you  know, early intervention, diagnosis and prevention we can really change  outcomes for all people who have serious complex medical problems.  And  Mayo is leading the way on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you made because A.I. is  able to work with doctors to improve the outcomes.  Isn't that right?  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  That's absolutely right.  And I think it's also prediction.   It's early diagnosis but it's also predictive genomics, if you will.   Knowing what we know about people, who is likely to be at risk for this or  that so you can diagnose it early.  It's all of that together.  </p><p>And the young kids who want to do medicine, want to have a life of service,  they need to have that kind of an education to prepare them for that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What have you done differently in terms of A.I. at the clinic?  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  We have well over 100 projects trying to predict how to read  x-rays better, how to predict from genomics, how things will play out.   We're working into everyday life at Mayo Clinic, monitoring patients'  hearts, who is at risk for heart disease, that sort of thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this money will go toward getting new students who will be  looking at A.I. as part of their curriculum, very different than the  doctors in the past.  </p><p>ALIX:  Exactly.  Medical education is going to have to evolve quickly now  and keep up the new technologies, new breakthroughs in science and apply it  right into the clinic for people.  Mayo Clinic can lead the way on that  with this gift and with the research and development it has.</p><p>Mayo has three shields with clinical care, education and research and the  combination of all those three working together is what this gift will  allow Mayo to do.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  We'll be offering a masters of artificial intelligence.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Masters of A.I. </p><p>NOSEWORTHTY:  Masters of A.I. and masters of regenerative science, and  masters of advanced biotechnology and bioengineering.  All of these, the  new wave will be right in the curriculum plus the (INAUDIBLE) start willing  to spend say an extra year to get that additional training.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we go, where have you seen the most progress in terms of  outcomes in terms of disease?  Is it cancer?  Is it somewhere else?  Heart  disease?  Where have you seen the biggest -- </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  I think it's in all the serious illnesses -- Maria.  We're  actually measuring outcomes much better, the quantitation of outcomes,  quality of life, life expectancy, readmission to hospital, all of those  things that are now being put on score cards to see what is the investment  to health care doing to reduce the costs and prove the outcome so that  quantitative outcomes research, it's still in its infancy, but it's  absolutely critical if we're going to have the best health care system in  the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And particularly as you see spending from the NIH  dropping, you need private investors and private practitioners to come in  and help the situation. </p><p>And here comes you-- Jay Alix.  Thank you so much.  Great to see you both.   Thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>ALIX:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. John Noseworthy and Jay Alix joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Congress returns to Washington.  We break down how the  Democratic control of the House may impact your wallet.</p><p>And then pay $100 to not watch the game, the new ticket option for Warriors  fans with no view of the court.  Wait until you hear this one.  Stay with  us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, November 13th,  your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures are indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning after a  sharp selloff yesterday.  The Dow Industrials set to be up 150 points right  out of the gate, that's two thirds of one percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up 17  right now and the NASDAQ is up 57 points, that's almost one percent higher.  </p><p>This after the major indices took a sharp hit yesterday, five percent  decline in the Dow and the NASDAQ component Apple, that took a chunk out of  markets with Apple down five percent, the Dow was down 2-1/3 percent and  the NASDAQ was down almost three percent at the close yesterday.  S&amp;P 500  with a decline of 55 points, down almost two percent.  </p><p>Well, that was then this morning we're seeing a bounce in the U.S. and  Europe.  FT-100 is up a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante is up a half a  percent and the DAX Index in Germany is up almost one percent.  </p><p>Mixed performances in Asia overnight to report.  Nikkei Average worst  performer in Japan, down about two percent.  The Shanghai Composite was the  winner up about one percent.  </p><p>Crude oil continues to slide this morning, take a look at the price, down  another two percent after oil closed lower yesterday for 11 days in a row,  we are looking at a bear market here.  It is down 20 percent from the highs  in just the last five weeks.  What does that tell us?  </p><p>Earnings out today, Home Depot with a double beat earlier this morning, the  stock is up 2-1/2 percent on better than expected earnings and revenue at  Home Depot. </p><p>Meanwhile, back in session, Congress returns to Washington today for the  first time since Democrats won the House in the midterm elections.  What  the divided House will mean for your wallet coming up. </p><p>And tragedy on the court, a star Nets player suffered a gruesome ankle  injury in last night's game.  We'll have the details coming up this  morning.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, Congress returning to  Washington today to a new political landscape.  I spoke with House Majority  leader Kevin McCarthy this weekend along with Congressman David Cicilline  on Democrats the \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" program about the agenda going  forward.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Well, we'll want to  find common ground.  We will look to make sure we continue to make our  military strong, make sure that we can combat China and others of their  aggressive actions and also when it comes to trade expanding, we want to  find places that we can find common ground.  But those place that's we  principally disagree with, we will stand up strongly to show America the  difference to make assuring that we can continue to grow this country.  </p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (R), RHODE ISLAND:  Democrats ran on a very specific  agenda.  I helped craft it with my co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and  Communications Committee.  It's an -- it's an agenda for the people on this  country.  It's focusing on driving down the cost of health care, driving  down the cost of prescription drugs, protecting coverage for pre-existing  condition, raising family incomes by rebuilding our country with a serious  infrastructure plan for our roads, bridges, ports, transit systems, we'll  create 16 million good paying jobs.  And taking on the corruption in  Washington by getting money out of our political system.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Congressman-elect, or Florida's 6th  Congressional district and former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel Michael  Waltz.  Lieutenant Colonel, good to see you this morning.  Congratulations  to you and thank you for joining us.  </p><p>LT. COL. MICHAEL WALTZ (R), CONGRESSMAN-ELECT, FLORIDA:  Thank you.  Yes,  thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, let's talk first about the new Congress and what  you expect to get done now working with the Democrats.  </p><p>WALTZ:  Well, you know, one of the things that I'm very excited about in  this Congress is the amount of veterans that are running on both sides of  the aisle.  I think that's something that's really resonated with voters.   They understand that veterans know how to get things done.  They're not as  ideological.  You know, I can tell you Maria, in the fox hole, nobody cares  about party, race, religion, social economic background, the enemy's  bullets certainly don't care.  </p><p>And you know, I think you're going to see an approach or at least at an  ethos where compromise isn't a dirty word.  Where we can move the country  forward because you're going to have folks.  Right now, we're at a record  low in our nation's history at around 17 percent of veterans in Congress.   I think that's going to increase.  You're going to see people focused on  mission, on country and on getting things done.  That's what I heard from  hundreds of thousands of doors that people want results.  They don't want  resistance.  And they expect their elected representatives to accomplish  what they set out to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I guess, should we expect defense spending to stay elevated  then?  </p><p>WALTZ:  I think so.  You know, I can tell you from firsthand experience  after 17 years of war our military, our equipment is exhausted.  You have  pilots that are younger than the planes that they're flying.  And we face  unprecedented threats between Russia, China and still a metastasizing  growing Islamic extremism problem.  So, I think we're going to have to.   There's really not a choice there.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  One of the huge issues  though, Congressman-elect, it's Dagen McDowell.  Good to see you again.  </p><p>WALTZ:  Thanks Dagen, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is that the U.S. is on course to spend more on the interest on  our debt than even on defense spending.  That's going to happen about four  to five years from now.  So in order to make sure that our military is  sound in terms of it's our financial support, we need to figure out how  we're going to rein in spending elsewhere.  What's your plan on that?  </p><p>WALTZ:  Well so, there's two ways, right, to -- you know, I'm a business  owner as well as a veteran and there's two ways to deal with debt.  You  deal with it with growth and with cutting spending.  I think President  Trump's absolutely spot-on on what he's doing to grow the economy as a  business owner himself.  And then I think you need members that have the  fortitude to stand up and take on -- to take on spending.  Not only do I  support the military but I also hold the Pentagon accountable for when  there is -- when there's waste involved in their spending in all government  agencies.  </p><p>But Dagen, we both know that on the one hand you have the discretionary  spending and then you have the nondiscretionary spending and what gets at  the heart of that is the cost of health care.  We have to take -- I'm very  -- I'm fascinated to see if the Democrats will take on what it takes to  lower the cost of care.  Tort reform, selling across state lines, going  into a free market system, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, really getting  serious about driving down the cost of care which would then make it more  accessible and affordable and help businesses like mine and help our debt.   .</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Congressman, Mitch Roschelle.  One of the  things that concern business owners, my friend recently did a study of what  are on the mind of business leaders, and the number one thing that they're  looking for in a bipartisan way is cyber security.  And you talk about  defense spending.  I think they're interrelated.  Do you think that's an  area -- because I haven't heard much from Washington about policy around  protecting intellectual property.  You know, from -- not just from theft  but from a cyber security risk.  Is that something that you think could be  an agenda, especially, you know, more military people obviously they have a  pretty good sense of cyber warfare.  </p><p>WALTZ:  You know, I can -- I can tell you, watching China roll out its  sixth generation stealth fighter which looks exactly like ours, armed  drones which looks exactly like ours, underwater submersibles which look  like ours, doesn't sit well with veterans.  And they've essentially stolen  that intellectual property.  So, you know, this is -- this is about how the  private sector and the government come together in a way that's in line  with American values, not dictated from Washington.  </p><p>But look, I think we're getting to the point where we really have no choice  and the more business owners, the more veterans you have on the Hill that  understand those dynamics, I think the better.  So yes, that's something I  certainly want to take on.  </p><p>Look, we have to as a country.  We are having our technological edge be  stolen in front of our very eyes and at the -- you know, at the same time  this is something that President Trump I think has taken on, Republican  Congress needs to take it on.  And I hope the Democrats join us in that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what has taken place since the midterm  elections, Tuesday night.  There's still no winner for the state Senate.</p><p>WALTZ:  Less than a week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's talk about Florida.  There's still no winner for the  gubernatorial and the state Senate race.</p><p>WALTZ:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The controversy over a recount is continuing this morning.   Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum has relinquished the race -- had  relinquished the race against Republican Ron DeSantis.  But he took that  back.  What do you think is going on here?  And what's your reaction to the  fact that in Arizona we see now a change in leadership post the midterms,  now Sinema is winning or won?  </p><p>WALTZ:  You know, in Florida this is so concerning.  Frankly, it's  embarrassing for our state.  It's two counties that year -- you know, cycle  after cycle we're having these problems.  It's incompetence at best.  It's  fraud, you know, frankly at worst, as many have alleged.  This is happening  year after year.  I think we need to see accountability when it comes to  these election officials.  I can tell you, I had four counties in my  district and the T's were crossed and the I's were dotted.  This is the --  this is the heart of our democracy.  As a veteran, this is what we fight to  defend and sacrifice to defend all over the world.  And they have -- they  have a solemn duty to get it right.  I'm glad to see so much attention but  -- on it.  But you know, once this is all said and done, I think you will  see Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott emerge as they currently are ahead.  There  needs to be some accountability afterwards so that we're not dealing with  this again in 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to quickly point out something that Byron York  tweeted out that was mentioned on \"SPECIAL REPORT\" last night.  Like, Rick  Scott went into this, he was leading by 56,000 votes on election night,  tens of thousands of votes for the DeSantis lead going into this.  If a  recount reverses the initial margin of a few -- of more than a few hundred  votes it would be unprecedented, in the history of recent American  elections.  </p><p>WALTZ:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  According to FairVote, almost 4,700 state-wide elections between  2000 and 2016, only 26 of them went to a recount.  Of those 26, just three  recounts wound up changing the initial results of the race, it was one in  Washington, --</p><p>WALTZ:  Washington State.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- one in Vermont and one in Minnesota.  The average swing in  those three elections after the recounts, 311 votes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, watch these results.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this largely because of Broward County?  </p><p>WALTZ:  Broward County and Palm Beach County.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALTZ:  And this is -- but what has us so in sensed is this has been a  habitual problem.  This goes back to Bush versus Gore.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p>WALTZ:  And it happens cycle after cycle.  And what so many of us are  asking is, where is the accountability for these election officials?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're also asking that this morning.  Lieutenant colonel,  it's good to see you this morning, thanks very much.</p><p>WALTZ:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching as you take your post in the New Year.   Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz, Congressman-elect.  </p><p>Coming up, a nightmare on the court, the details after a player's gruesome  leg injury leaves some in tears, that's next.  </p><p>Then, Congress headed back to the Hill today, we break down how the  Democratic control of the House may impact your wallet.  Congressman Steve  Scalise is here.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, more of the NFL salute to service at Monday Night  Football.  Jared Max with the story now, Jared.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX SPORTS NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We have  been seeing NFL coaches wearing the Salute to Service gear, all available  for purchase at NFLShop.com.  Last night in Santa Clara, California, U.S.  Navy performed a flyover above Levi's Stadium.  Before the 49ers took on  the New York Giants, 49er's tightened George Kittle made sure to thank  every service member on the field last night.  Kittle amongst several  minors who donated game worn jerseys to raise money for the victims of the  wildfires.  Players, coaches and cheerleaders from Paradise High School  most now homeless from the fires, guests of the 49ers last night on the  field for the anthem.  </p><p>Before the Niners gave away 20-10 lead.  Giants' Q.B. Eli Manning tells his  critics I still got it.  Fourth quarter comeback, his first such win in two  years.  Odell Beckham Jr. dances the Carlton and Sterling Shepard with  catch the game winning score 27-23, Giants beat the Niners.  </p><p>Brooklyn Nets player Caris LeVert suffered a serious leg injury last night.   LeVert collided with Minnesota's Jeff Teague and came down hard on his leg.   He had to be carted off the court on a stretcher, hospitalized, no word on  the severity of this gruesome looking basketball injury.  </p><p>Golden State Warriors have a new plan, to allow around 200 more fans at its  home games.  The Warriors are selling monthly passes for fans to attend  games at Oracle Arena but -- but it's a really big but, the fans cannot  even see the court.  They can watch the game on T.V.  They can hear the  crowd roar.  And pay arena prices for booze and food and it only costs $100  a month.  Imagine that, Maria, you're paying $100 a month to get into the  arena to do what you can do at home, watch on T.V., minus the traffic.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.  I think they just want to be there for the  excitement of it but you can't see a darn thing.  Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX:  Exactly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Catch Jared sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on  radio Sirius XM 115.</p><p>Quick break and then Washington and your wallet, how Democrats' control of  the House may impact your pocketbook.  That's next right here.  Congressman  Steve Scalise is with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're back for business, the House and the  Senate returning to Washington today for what will be an intense start to  the lame duck session.  Joining us right now is National Taxpayers Union  senior fellow and Center for a Free Economy board member Mattie Duppler.   Mattie, good to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>MATTTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION:  Yes, good  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we want to get a sense of what you believe can happen  between now and January, this next seven weeks, can the current Congress  get anything done knowing that they're going to have new pressures come  January with the House leadership?  </p><p>Bbb Maria, that is the perfect question to be asking.  Right now there's  been a lot of attention on what Democrats will do when they finally control  the House Chamber coming in in January.  But you're right, there are  several weeks of work still to be done.  </p><p>I'm watching a couple of different things here.  One is what happens on the  next betting decision, on December 7th parts of the government funding will  expire.  And that means Democrats have a choice to make.  Do they want to  be party that shows they can govern or will they take their heels in and  start to make demands on spending bills?  It really depends on who you're  listening to.  If you're trying to anticipate what Democrats will do, you  heard Chuck Schumer earlier this week talk about how he may want to load up  that spending bill with language that includes something to do with  investigations of the president.  That of course would set a signal that  Democrats are not willing to govern, do not have any interest in getting  things done.  And I think will make things very difficult in the New Year.  </p><p>So, we're have to see -- we'll have to see what happens with House  leadership.  If Nancy Pelosi decides that that is not the path she wants to  take, there could be an opportunity for bipartisan agreement on a spending  bill.  Typically in a lame duck session taxpayers do not benifit from  decisions that are made on spending bills there.  And Nancy Pelosi,  remember, when she was speaker, she was the one who governed probably some  of the biggest omnibus spending bills in the past.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And we had the majority leader Kevin McCarthy on  this weekend.  And he said that there are two appropriations bills that  they're going to get to.  Of course, one of the big issues at stake is the  Republican tax cut plan, 2.0.  McCarthy joined me on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" along with Democratic representative David Cicilline who want to  have the number four spot in Democratic leadership in the new Congress.   They have both different views on what they're expecting to happen.  Watch  this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been working on Tax Cuts 2.0.  Does that go away at this  point given the fact that not one Democrat voted for you -- first tax cut  plan?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't believe so.  Because it's already passed the House.  We  still have a number of weeks and session that's over in the Senate.  We  will continue to fight for it.  Because Maria, it is the right principle.   It is the right policy.  And that should overcome politics.  We should put  people before politics and I'll be excited to see the day that the  Democrats want to join us with that.  </p><p>CICILLINE:  The fact is that tax cut gave 83 percent of that tax cut to the  top one percent, to the richest people in this country and now the  Republicans are proposing we pay for that by cutting Medicare and Social  Security.  We can't do that.  We've got to protect Social Security and  Medicare.  We need a tax cut for middle class families not 83 percent of it  going to the top one percent, richest people in this country and the most  powerful corporations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I've got a prospect on that because 80 percent of the tax  cut plan did not go to the top one percent as you know, Congressman.  The  tax cut plan lowered all income levels and they doubled the standard  deduction.  So, that talking point -- </p><p>CICILLINE:  Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it is true.</p><p>CICILLINE:  And Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe you get there because the corporate rate was cut.  Are  you saying you want to have corporate -- </p><p>CICILLINE:  Thad's right -- that's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you want the corporate rate at 35 percent?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  Well, so, you acknowledge it's right.  83 percent does go to  the top one percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, do you want to raise the corporate tax rate?  Is  that what you're saying?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  Well, I don't -- what I say, we have to do is we have to be  responsible about that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you want to keep with this talking  point that is inaccurate.  That's fine.  You can do as you will.  </p><p>CICILLINE:  No, it's the fact, it's not inaccurate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do you -- the question is what do you going to do on taxes?   Are you looking to raise taxes, are you looking to reverse the economic  policies of this president?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  No, what I think we need to do is give a real tax cut to  working families, to middle class families, that's permanent and long- standing.  Not giving 82 percent (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That sounds like -- that sounds like what's being worked on  right now, Tax Cuts 2.0.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we know the facts on taxes, Mattie.  Mitch  Roschelle, you're here.  You responded and reacted to that interview.  You  and I were e-mailing each other.  Give us the facts on who pays the taxes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I also screamed at the television set on Sunday, just to be  clear.  But the top 10 percent of taxpayers in this country, and that's  those Households earning over $133,000 pay 70 percent of the tax.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Bottom line.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.  So, and that was based upon the last time the tax  foundation did this.  So the fact of the matter is, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just lies.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- it's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mattie, is  that -- are we going to just have bluster for the  next two years, lots of lies and inaccuracies and get nothing done, what do  you think?  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, we will see.  Look, (INAUDIBLE) just called in the Arizona  for the Kyrsten Sinema.  She is one of the only Democrats who voted to  extend those tax cuts.  Those Democrats who wants to see those tax cuts  made permanent.  We'll see if Democrats continue to push back on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and not one of them voted for the tax cut plan in general.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mattie, thank you so much.  Mattie Duppler there.  Still ahead,  divided in half, the details on Amazon's plans to split its second  headquarters, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   It is a busy morning.  It is Tuesday, November 13th.  Your top stories  right now 8:00 a.m. on button on the East Coast.  Markets are set to  rebound this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a modest gain at  the start of trading.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial average up 130 points right now, one-half of one  percent.  The S&amp;P is up two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ with a 53- point rally this morning up three quarters of a percent.  A much different  day than yesterday, where we saw serious broad-based sell-off on Wall  Street.  Apple and Goldman dragged the markets lower.  The Dow was down 600  plus points.  That was 2-1/3 percent.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 sliding nearly two percent on the session.  And at the close,  the NASDAQ was the worst performer.  It was down nearly three percent on  the session as Apple and other technology stocks really took the NASDAQ  down sharply at the close.  Take a look at global markets this morning on  the heels of the strength you're seeing on Wall Street this morning.   European markets following suit.</p><p>The FT-100 is up a fraction, the CAC Quarante in Paris us a half of a  percent, 21 points higher and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  90  points higher in Germany.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances there,  take a look.  Worst performer was Japan, the Nikkei average down better  than two percent.</p><p>Well, the picks are in.  Amazon will soon call Long Island City York and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the decision to split its  headquarters, the second headquarters.  The announcement is expected as  early as today.  That would be the official announcement but we know this  is coming up one percent on Amazon this morning in terms of the stock.</p><p>Meanwhile, let's go to California where raging wildfires are continuing  this morning.  The infernos burning a path of devastation.  The death toll  up to nearly 50 people right now between these massive fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand that makes this the deadliest fire in the  history of United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are going to take you live to Southern California to get the  very latest there.  Massive devastation.  New questions this morning for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  important 737 jet.  That's the same model that was involved in the deadly  crash in Indonesia last month.  I'm going to be speaking with the Chairman  and CEPO Dennis Muilenburg this morning and he is here in studio in a Fox  Business Exclusive.</p><p>He will join me at 8:30 a.m. Eastern to answer these questions as well as  to tell us about the backdrop for his business today.  Also joining the  conversation this morning, House Majority Whip and Louisiana Congressman  Steve Scalise as Congress gets back to work this morning.  Also this  morning joining me is CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Lindsey,  good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Lindsey, we were talking earlier about the markets and about  that sell-off yesterday.  We just came off of the quarter where we saw  profit growth up 29 percent year-over-year.  So why are markets so nervous?</p><p>BELL:  We haven't seen growth that great since before 2000.  So that is a  very impressive number.  It's the third quarter of over 20 percent earnings  growth.  And that is largely due to the tax reform package that we got  earlier this year and fiscal stimulus.  But the problem now is that fiscal  stimulus is peaking, monetary policy is tightening.  The Fed is running off  its balance sheet here.</p><p>And the question is where do we go with growth from here?  There is a lot  of uncertainty still out there on trade and to me, between trade and the  Fed, those are the two biggest things as I look to 2019 to determine where  growth -- the growth trajectory will be going.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, we saw some of the big tech names come down a lot  yesterday, Apple down five percent which is a serious number for Apple.  Is  the worry about growth largely in some of these high flyers like in Apple,  or are we just talking about economic growth going from 4.2 percent in the  second quarter, 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter to something very  different in 2019.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I think it's more about economic growth.  The tech sector is  being weighed on by the trade disputes obviously and then also I think that  with interest rates rising the evaluations that we've seen in some of that  really had investors turn a little more skittish.  It's been dragging the  market down but as we look to 2019, look, if we get 2-1/2 to -- to 2.9  percent GDP, that's really solid.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And really much better than what we saw the prior 10 years.  </p><p>BELL:  Exactly.  In a slowdown in growth from the four percent that we saw  in the last quarter could help you elongate this bull market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sounds like you think things went overdone yesterday on the  downside.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And I just think volatility is here to stay for a while but we  are optimistic, we have 3100 price targets for the next 12 months in the  S&amp;P 500.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  3100 and it is now at 2726 on the standard &amp; poor's.  Lindsey,  thank you.  Great insights always from you.  I'm going to turn now back to  the Capitol Hill.  Congress is back in session today for its final two  month stretch, spending immigration and the fate of the Mueller probe  expected to dominate the debate.  Joining me right now is the House  Majority Whip, author of the new book, Back in the Game, Steve Scalise.</p><p>And we are really happy you are back in the game, Congressman.  It's good  to see you.  </p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  Maria, great to be back  with you.  Great to be back in the game.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations on the book.  You know, I  was so happy when I saw the book because I thought I'm really happy he is  writing about this incident.  The whole country was just so worried about  you after that shooting at the baseball -- at the baseball course.  So  we'll get to that in a moment.  But you just heard Lindsey Graham talking  about the economy.</p><p>Are you expecting growth to slow?  You just had this landmark tax cut  reform that you put in place earlier this year and now people are worried  that the economy is going to slow down. </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, you know, we were seeing so much economic growth and it was  working the way that we intended.  When you -- when you see tax cuts for  every single income group and of course lower to middle income people are  the ones who benefited the most.  And now with Nancy Pelosi being expected  to be sworn in as Speaker in January, it does concern people that they want  to go backward.</p><p>They want to raise taxes again, go to like kind of big government,  government-controlled healthcare.  All the things that Pelosi did when she  was speaker before.  So, you know, it is definitely concerned people and  slowed down the growth.  Let's see what happens but we're going to be  battling that too.  We're not going to -- we're not going to let this  country go back to those days, the 10 years of slow economic growth less  than two percent growth for eight straight years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know we're waiting on couple of situations in Florida this  morning but it looks like Republicans will keep the majority in the Senate  based on what we're seeing.  </p><p>SCALISE:  And actually grew their number in the Senate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And grew their numbers but I'm talking about these, you know,  questions in Florida and -- but yes, growing the numbers in the Senate.  So  should that make us feel that the Democrats being in the House majority now  will not be subject to stopping the President's economic agenda?  I mean,  what does this mean in terms of the House leadership taking the majority?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, I think the most important thing that you don't see us go  backwards.  And, you know, even if Nancy PelosI's agenda which will be to  try to grow government, to try to raise taxes, higher, they're not going to  be successful ultimately because the bill would have to be signed by the  President.  But what it does mean is the things that we were going to do  tax cuts 2.0, the work that Chairman Brady and his committee were already  engaged in to try to make those tax cuts permanent.</p><p>To build on the growth we're seeing in our economy.  It's going to be very  difficult to get those things accomplished once Nancy Pelosi is speaker for  at least two-year period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, do you think -- I was with David Cicilline, Democratic  Congressman who0 wants to get into leadership, the leadership race is  obviously happening this week, and he said he doesn't like the corporate  rate where it is.  Do you think there's any chance that he would be  successful in raising the corporate rate?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, I saw that interview and you pressed him I think  appropriately because ultimately he didn't want to say it but you can tell  what he was trying to imply was he wants to raise the corporate rate and  it's OK if he tries to do that which he will not be successful by the way.   But if he tried to, what does he going to do with those millions of jobs  that we're bringing back to America because we lowered the corporate rate  to be competitive.</p><p>America lost its competitive edge and everybody acknowledged that.  It  wasn't a partisan issue.  And so when we made our country competitive  again, we're seeing the benefits of it by millions of new jobs being  created for families who want to get in the work force.  Why would he want  to take that away, we're not going to let it happen but it shows you they  do want to raise those rates even higher.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They want to raise rates and they want to have investigations  around President Trump.  You've got six weeks or seven weeks before the end  of the year.  What can you get done in this next seven weeks?  I know you  have spending bills, appropriation bills that need to be tended to.  Tell  us what you're expecting in terms of success this year.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Maria, there are a few important bills that are right up front  and center that we have to deal with the funding of the Department of  Homeland Security which is critically important to keeping America safe.   And of course the big fight, there is going to be overfunding the wall.  In  the House we've been moving forward to try to give the President the $5  billion that he's requested to start fully building out the wall.</p><p>There is some money he has to start building about 100 miles of wall.  We  want to go a lot further, you know, that's going to be a battle we have.   The other big battle is going to be over the farm bill.  And Maria, Farm  Bill Policy expired a few weeks ago and the big fight has been over work  requirements.  You know, here you've got this great robust economy where  there are more job openings and people looking for work.</p><p>And yet we put a provision in the House that says, if there is a job out  there in your able body, you ought to be able to go and look for work  instead of getting taxpayer funded welfare benefits and the Democrats  oppose that, so we have a big impasse over that.  And imagine, at a time  when people are looking for work, the Federal government is paying people  not to work and we said, look, if there is a job out there for you, you  have to go take it or else stop getting taxpayer money.</p><p>And we'll even pay you to train you to work if there's not -- if you don't  have the proper training and that's what they're opposing right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  All right.  Are there any plans to cut  spending?  The idea of debt and deficits in our face and getting more  expensive just to hold the debt.  This conversation is getting louder.   What are the plans in terms of spending cuts and is it possible that the  Congress and the President make a mistake of looking for something to come  together with the Democrats choosing infrastructure and then creating even  more debt by spending $2 trillion on an infrastructure package.</p><p>SCALISE:  All right.  That is continuing to be a concern.  One of the  reason we didn't get an infrastructure package is because we couldn't get  an agreement over how to pay for it.  We weren't in this Republican-led  House, we weren't going to pass a bill that was just going to add to the  deficit.  One of the things we had in our healthcare bill that passed the  House had protections for people with preexisting conditions.</p><p>But a reforming Medicaid, one of the most broken forms of healthcare by  block granting it to the states, letting the states actually be innovative  and coming up with better ways to run healthcare for lower income people.   It's saved over $800 billion just through the innovation.  You didn't have  a reduction in money, it just actually allowed states to be more flexible  with the money.</p><p>That saved $800 billion.  It failed by one voted in the Senate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SCALISE:  Huge disappointments there in a lot of fronts but it would have  made healthcare more affordable, protected people of preexisting conditions  and transformed Medicaid into a much better program at those kind of  savings.  That was what's at stake in this election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  We all remember the infamous thumbs down on the Senate.   Let me -- let me ask you about the preexisting conditions because that's  another talking point on the left that the Republicans do not want to  protect preexisting conditions.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Yes.  It was a false claim.  In fact they spent millions of  dollars promoting that false claim.  And I talked to members and so many of  these swing districts and they said, look, they're lying about this,  they're spending two, $3 million in T.V. ads lying about it.  And so they  had to go on T.V. and spend -- they didn't have two million, they might had  a million and half to say that it wasn't true.</p><p>And so people got confused, they weren't sure what was the case.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCALISE:  But our bill -- our bill actually protected people with  preexisting conditions.  It's in the bill, they knew it, they didn't care,  they just said it anyway.  Look, you know, they're going to get the  majority.  I think it's going to be a short-lived majority but at the same  time a lot of those candidates who won said they're going to be pro-life  and pro-gun and they're going to vote against Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Well, their very first vote as a member of Congress in January is going to  be for Nancy Pelosi as speaker.  You know, which side are they going to  choose, the -- you know, the people back home that they promised one thing  to or what's going to happen up in D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've got your leadership races this week, tomorrow night,  the vote tell us what you're feeling in terms of how things stack up.  Are  you expecting that Kevin McCarthy will be the Minority Leader and you will  tell us about the role that you're expecting.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Yes.  I think Kevin will get the votes and he will be the  minority leader.  I'm running for the minority whip position and feel real  confident and the votes that we have and, you know, we'll go forward but at  the same time it's going to be interesting to see which route they go, the  Democrats do when they're in power.  They're going to just be about  harassing the President, subpoenas and even impeachment.</p><p>That's not what the American people wanted.  You know, ultimately they're  going to have to -- they're going to have to decide which route they go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Just to change the conversation, so that's the  conversation for the next two years as opposed to what you've been able to  do in terms of legislation. </p><p>SCALISE:  And we've got to be I think a lot better at articulating the  things we stand for as conservatives.  That's one thing that I think we  didn't do well.  We've got to do a lot better at and we're going to get  there but I think there's going to be a sharp contrast now because you're  going to see the approach that Nancy Pelosi would take as speaker.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm glad you mentioned -- a lot of people mentioned the  messaging on the Republican side.  Let's talk about your book Back in the  Game, what role did your recovery have in writing this book?  Tell us why  you wrote the book.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, you know, as you talked about earlier, there were so many  people that came together to help me, you know, not only to save my life in  those first few hours after the shooting, but to help me get back in the  game and essence to be able to learn how to walk again.  Just to learn how  to do basic things that I couldn't do in those first few weeks after the  shooting.</p><p>And, you know, I had a lot of -- a lot of support and prayers by the people  like you were praying, people all over the country were praying and there  were so many miracles that we chronicle in this book and the book we talked  about.  What my wife Jennifer and I talk about these little miracles that  happened along the way.  And we also talked about the people who did so  many heroic things every step of the way to save not only myself but all  the other people that were out there that day.</p><p>And then ultimately to help me through the recovery process.  And it really  is an inspirational book because it could have been a lot different in how  it ended.  You know, so many cases like this don't end the way it did.   This actually has a happy ending and thanks to god, to miracles, and to the  support and prayers of so many people.  We chronicled it all in the book.   Back in the Game and I'm really happy with how it came out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were so worried.  Everybody was worried about you, we -- I  mean, it was so serious.  Did it change the way you look at things?  Did it  change the way you approach your job?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Maria, if anything, it sharpened my focus on the things that  matter in life and I think I removed a lot of clutter in life.  You know,  all of us do things every day that some that we want to do, some that you  just kind of do because it's a routine and you focus on what's really  important, my family, my faith, you know, the work that I do, I love my  job.  You know, and it illuminated the things that aren't as important and  much happier today. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.  Thank you for your leadership.   So happy you're here.</p><p>SCALISE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Steve Scalise.  Check out the book back in the  game.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeting this on trade.   France makes excellent wine but so does the U.S.  The problem is that  France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France and  charges big tariffs while doing so.  Whereas the U.S. makes it easy for  French wines and charges very small tariffs.  It's not fair.  Must change.   The President obviously touting European leaders on trade this morning.</p><p>Switching gears.  We want to bring you to California and show you this  devastation which is just unreal.  We have two wildfires whipping across  the state. The campfire is the northern part, now it is the deadliest fire  in the state's history.  And the Woolsey fire taking a major toll on  Southern California.  Fox News' Jonathan Hunt is in Malibu this morning.   Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.  Thousands of  families remain evacuated from this area of Southern California where the  Woolsey fire has hit so hard.  That likely to be out of Malibu and other  areas for I would say at least another 24 hours.  And take a look at what  hundreds of families are going to come back to find when they are  eventually let in.</p><p>Everything they have built over their lives, everything they've worked for  completely and utterly destroyed.  It is a similar story up north -- the  camp fire near Chico, California.  Now as you mentioned becoming officially  the deadliest in state history.  42 people have been killed in that fire.   More than 100 still remain unaccounted for and the entire town of Paradise  is basically wiped out.  Listen here to the fire chief.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID HAWKS, DIVISION CHIEF, CAL FIRE-BUTTE COUNTY:  It's just absolutely  heartbreaking to drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.   My family lost their home in the fire, my parents did, my grandmother did.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HUNT:  President Trump tweeted last night that he has now approved and  expedited major disaster declaration for California.  That tweet coming in  the wake of tweets over the weekend, in which he was critical of  California's forest management.  That sparked a firestorm of criticism.   He's now changing his tune paying tribute to the heroic firefighters who  are still on the frontlines, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jonathan.  Thanks very much.  We will be watching.   Jonathan Hunt in Malibu this morning.  Coming up.  Concerns in the sky.  A  new report says Boeing withheld information on its 737 plane.  The same  model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash last month.  I'll be speaking  exclusively with the chairman and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg about  that in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>As we take a break, we are watching the price of oil this morning.  And as  you can see, it is down 1-1/4 percent below 60 right now.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump continuing to tweet this morning.  Here's what  he just posted.  The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low  approval rating in France, that's 26 percent.  And an unemployment rate of  almost 10 percent.  He was just trying to get on to another subject, by the  way, there is no country more nationalist than France.  Very proud people  and rightfully so.  Make France Great Again.  The President writes this  morning.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Vive la, France.  Sorry.  I  just want to quickly say we have our pickup trucks, everyone.  We have our  tariffs on pickup truck imports.  They have their protections for one.   Let's move along and get along. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  All right.  Well, stocks getting yesterday on  weakness from technology meanwhile especially Apple.  The NASDAQ was down  almost three percent.  This morning we are looking at a rebound a bit, the  Dow industrials are up 77, the S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up 39  points after that sharp sell-off yesterday.  Joining us right now Wells  Fargo Investment Institute Head, global market strategists, Paul  Christopher. </p><p>Paul, good to see you.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when you come in today after since a rough day at the office  yesterday where the markets were down 600 points on the Dow.  What do you  do?  Are you a buyer or a seller here?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We're a buyer.  Look, it's -- the markets, it's still  worried about growth, it's trying to put in a bottom.  You don't have to  put in all the chips at once here but people have a lot of cash.  Our  clients held a lot of cash and we would like for them to put in a little  bit here at a time.  We think this is the best buying opportunity in U.S.  large caps since the November 2016 election.</p><p>So don't have to put it all in at once.  We're still looking for a bottom  but do start to take some positions especially in those growth-oriented  sectors.  </p><p>BELL:  So Paul, does that mean you take some positions in the tech, maybe  some of the FAANG names that have been beaten up or maybe are in bear  market territory right now off of their highs?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  It's a good question.  We've been market weight on  information technology.  We still think you should be market weight but  listen if you haven't had a chance to get into some of these stocks and now  you find yourself below market weight.  Again this is an opportunity to  take yourself back up to that waiting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Paul, it's Dagen McDowell.  It seems like the market gets really  shaken every time that 10-year yield gets to about only 3-1/4 percent.   Realistically how high a yield, a longer term interest rate can stocks  handle given a lot of names that are still -- that still look really  overvalued?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We think that bond yields, the 10-year for instance  will go a little bit higher over the next 12 months and that we think that  stocks will still be OK with that.  The problem is we're just getting this  transition period where we've gone from clearly low growth and low interest  rates to a little bit faster growth and somewhat higher interest rates and  that sort of a move always wrong foots markets until investors can  determine that yes earnings can continue to hit higher levels.</p><p>And it's -- those earnings ultimately over the long run that will be --  that will match the S&amp;P on the way up we think, you know, percentage for  percentage.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Paul, great to see you.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paul Christopher joining us.  Well Fargo.  New questions for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  737 model.  This is the same model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash  last week.  We will speak with Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg next,  exclusive coming up right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast.  Futures are indicating  a gain at the start of trading this morning.  Dow Industrials expected to  be up 69 points, that is about a quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 is up  almost half a percent, and the NASDAQ with a 39-point gain, up two-thirds  of one percent.  This, after a sharp sell-off yesterday where the Dow lost  two percent and the NASDAQ lost almost three percent.</p><p>European markets were mixed, the FT-100 is down a fraction, as you can see,  but the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are both positive.  Although off of  the highest levels of the morning, for sure.  Overnight in Asia, mixed  performances, take a look, the worst performer was Japan overnight in Asia.   The Nikkei Average was down on the session about two percent, as you can  see there.  </p><p>Oil is extending its losing streak this morning.  Crude oil under pressure  again now 11 days in a row lower, down 1-1/3 percent, below $60.00 a  barrel.  What is the price of oil selling off tell us about the global  economy?  We want to look at that, coming up.  </p><p>All of those stories coming up this morning, but first, our top story this  half an hour, new questions this morning for Boeing, The Wall Street  journal is reporting that Boeing withheld information on its 737 model,  according to safety experts and others.  That is the same model involved in  the deadly Lion aircrash in Indonesia last month.  And joining me right now  to discuss that and a lot more in this Fox Business exclusive is the  Chairman, President, and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg.  Dennis, it's  good to see you this morning.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BOEING:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the story in The Journal obviously is very concerning.   What can you tell us in terms of what was told to the pilots and the  airlines about any new equipment in that 737?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, Maria, first of all, I think it's important that we all  express our sympathies for the loss of Lion Air Flight 610 and certainly,  our thoughts go with the families that have been affected.  We've been very  engaged with the investigative authorities throughout and providing all of  the information necessary to make sure we do a full assessment of the  situation.  And the bottom line here is the 737 max is safe, and safety is  a core value for us at Boeing, it always has been, and we ensure that our  airplanes are safe.  In fact, this airplane went through thousands of hours  of tests and evaluation, certification, working with the pilots, and we've  been very transparent on providing information and being fully cooperative  on the investigative activity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what happened?  Apparently, there were 10 computer -- the  computers about the angle of the nose were not accurate and then the plane  went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you have a sense of what went wrong?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, as the Indonesian authorities have pointed out initially,  there were some indications of inaccurate angle attack signal that was  being sent to the airplane, and of course, our airplane has the ability to  handle that, and we have procedures in place.  And we've already issued a  couple of additional bulletins to our operators and pilots around the world  that point them back to existing flight procedures to handle that kind of  condition.  So again, we're going to continue to support the investigation  as it proceeds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And was there -- I mean, one of the Boeing officials quoted in  The Journal today, one high-ranking Boeing official said that the company  had decided against disclosing more details to cockpit cruise due to  concerns about inundating average pilots with too much information.  Was  that a decision now that you regret?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Now, again, we ensure that we provide all of information  that's needed to safely fly our airplanes.  Again, this comes as out of  thousands of hours of testing and evaluating and simulating, and providing  the information that our pilots need to operate our airplanes safely, and  we'll continue to do that.  As I said, as part of the process here, we've  already issued a couple of bulletins to pilots and operators that point  them back to existing flight procedures to handle this kind of situation.   So, we're going to continue to fully cooperate in the investigation.  I  think it's really important -- again, the bottomline here, the 737 Max is a  very safe airplane and we're very confident in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But was there a new -- well, there are new system that wasn't  disclosed to the pilots.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  No, there are new systems on the airplanes that are designed  to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane and to provide  control capability in high-angle of attack conditions, and those systems  operate properly.  And again, in certain failure modes, if there's an  inaccurate angle attack sensors feeding information to the -- to the  airplane, there's a procedure to handle that.  And so, again, as part of  the investigation process, we're going to make sure we fully understand  that.  We're going to make sure that we're providing all of the information  necessary and appropriate training, and go back to the core value here, is  that the airplane safe, we know how to fly it safely, and we're very  confident in that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was that information in terms of what to do should something  change -- was that information available to the pilots?  Did they know how  to operate it should the nose be in a different position?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.  In fact, that's part of the training manual, it's an  existing procedure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  So, the bulletin that we put out again last week and over the  weekend, pointed to that existing flight procedure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, obviously, I know that you're answering lots of  questions this morning and this week after this horrific crash, and you're  going to get more information.  What would be the timing on that?  When do  you expect to hear from the FAA on this?  </p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, this is an ongoing investigation, so it will take  whatever time is necessary to make sure it's done thoroughly.  Again, we  participate fully in these investigations, we've provided technical  assistance, we'll continue to do that until the work is complete.  It's  very important that we do this in a diligent and thorough manner.   Bottomline is we want to ensure safety in the system, and continue to have  confidence in the 737 Max.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the 737 has been a cash cow for your business, this is a  very important business.  There were some headwinds in the supply chain in  terms of the 737, which I want to ask you about.  And I know over the  recent past, you've expanded the business, you've got commercial aerospace,  you've got defense, and then you've got services.  Tell us how business is  right now, because commercial aerospace has been driving the stock  obviously for several years right now?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, aerospace is a tremendous growth business.  We look out  over the next 10 years as an $8.1 trillion marketplace.  Passenger traffic  is growing at about six to seven percent per year sustained.  The world  needs about 43,000 new commercial airplanes over the next 20 years.  A part  of that is the 737 as we've ramped up to 52 a month, this year, we're  producing at 57 a month next year.  And we have had some supply chain  challenges as you -- as you pointed out, as we've been growing.  But we are  briskly moving to a recovery.  We just announced delivery numbers for  October earlier this morning, so we delivered 43 737s in October which is  an all-time record for October, and we're continuing to March smartly to  our recovery plan, and expect to meet our year-end targets for deliveries.   This year, for the first time, we'll deliver more than 800 commercial  airplanes.  By the end of the decade here, we'll be delivering more than  900 airplanes a year.  So, you can see the tremendous growth here in  commercial airplanes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible and I know you got an incredible backlog as  well --</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which will continue that delivery calendar.  One out of four  or five planes go to China in terms of your deliveries.  Tell us about the  importance of the business in China.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, China is very important to us.  Today, about a third of  our 737s go to China, about one-quarter of our overall deliveries.  So, if  you look at that marketplace around the world, 43,000 new airplanes over  the next 20 years, about 7,000 of those are in China.  It's the fastest  growing market segment right now.  China needs that lift capability to  serve their economic growth needs, so China is very interested in the  healthy aerospace economy.  </p><p>As you know here in the U.S. as well, there's a big advantage to a healthy  aerospace ecosystem.  We have about 90 percent of our manufacturing jobs  here in the U.S. even though we export about 80 percent of what we build.   So when you look at trade deficit versus trade surplus, aerospace is the  biggest trade surplus for the U.S., about $80 billion a year.  And our  business is the biggest piece of that.  So, that a mutually-beneficial  relationship between the U.S. and China as it applies to trade and the  aerospace is very important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what happens now with this trade spat that we're having  with China then?  I mean, have you seen any backlash from the Chinese in  terms of your business, given the fact that the President is sitting there  waiting to put another 250 billion on exports from China on tariffs and  this fight between China and the U.S. intensifies?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We've been very engaged in that dialogue, as you know, this is  a very important topic to us.  We've been talking with the President and  the U.S. administration, extensively.  They're very aware of the situation  and the importance of aerospace.  We've also had a very good dialogue with  Chinese leadership and our customers in China.  And we're encouraged by the  dialogue that's going on.  </p><p>I think you've seen some recent reports that President Trump and President  Xi plan to meet around the G20 summit that's coming up.  Some productive  dialogue going on on the trade front, we think both countries are  interested in a mutually successful aerospace ecosystem.  It's good for the  economies of both countries.  And here in the U.S., it's really important  to U.S. manufacturing jobs.  We have about 13,000 companies in our supply  chain here in the U.S. that are supporting that kind of manufacturing  growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has the air supply chain changed in any way because of your  services business?  I mean, you're pursuing this more aggressive strategy,  does that mean that in time -- in terms of selling a plane to somebody or a  business, then you want to maintain that plane as well by using the  services there, but are you taking away business from the suppliers?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We're actually see this as a grow the pie business.  So,  something we can do jointly with our suppliers.  Services is our biggest  single-growth opportunity.  When you look at that $8-trillion marketplace,  it's the place where we have the biggest opportunity to further grow.  And  we're bringing capabilities like parts distribution, maintenance, and  modifications.  New software, digital solutions, training solutions for our  customers, doing that jointly with our suppliers.  </p><p>To date -- year-to-date, our services business has grown 12 percent in a  market that's growing about three percent a year.  So, it is growing,  growing strongly, and by doing this jointly with our supply chain, we can  provide better light cycle value for our customers.  And that's really the  lens we're looking through here, not only how we design and build  airplanes, but how do we provide value for our customers for post- production support.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This sounds like a natural fit.  I mean, the commercial  aerospace business has been so strong, and walk us through that for a  moment because most people don't understand the number of people who've  never been on an airplane.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The number of people who are perhaps in Asia who are wanting to  travel, this is a big opportunity for you.  So, this is also an economic  growth story.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  It is.  And, Maria, you bring up a really great point.  As I  said earlier, traffic is growing -- passenger traffic at about six to seven  percent a year completely outstripping GDP.  And some of the things that  are driving that is the upcoming middle class that for the first time ever,  is able to travel.  So, we have this unique combination of backlogs, seven  years of backlog.  And every year in Asia alone, 150 million people fly for  the first time.  Less than -- less than 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's amazing.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Less than 20 percent of the world's population has ever taken  a single flight.  So, think about the growth opportunity that's still ahead  of us, and we're feeding right into that with our design and productions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But here we have worries in the market, down 600 points  yesterday, worries from economic worries that things are going to slow  down.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where are we on that in your view?  You've got interest  rates rising obviously when a company or country buys a plane, or several  planes, they are in many parts doing it by borrowing, their borrowing costs  are going up with interest rates.  How much of a headwind will that be for  you?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We're not seeing it affect our business.  Again, we have a  much longer term view.  Today, we have a backlog of almost 5800 commercial  airplanes if you think of that in terms of production volume, it's about  seven years of backlog.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  So, this gives us the opportunity to think long term in terms  of capital investment, innovation investment.  And while we pay attention  to things like interest rates and the financial markets, it's not something  that's really affecting near-term buying behavior.  You know, today, we're  selling 737 Maxes, filling our production skyline out in 2023 and beyond.   So, we have a much longer term perspective.  Aerospace is a strong long- term growing business.  It's not -- it's no longer a cyclical business.   This is a long term sustained growth business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the competition is fierce.  I mean, airbus -- can airbus  sell to European countries and companies with no tariffs?  So, are you  disadvantaged by the tariff situation given the fact that a European  jetmaker Airbus can do it a lot cheaper?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, something we're paying close attention to.  To date, we  haven't been affected materially by the tariffs.  Things that have affected  steel and aluminum pricing.  We source 90 percent of our aluminum here in  the U.S. so it hasn't been a dramatic effect on us, but it's something  we're paying a close attention to.  The bottom line is it's a very  competitive marketplace because it's a very attractive marketplace.  Now,  we have to continue to invest, to compete.  We have to continue to invest  to innovate.  Tax reform, for example, in the U.S. has been something that  has really helped us gain a level-playing field globally so that we can  compete and win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can you grow the defense business at this point?  A lot of  worries that defense spending needs to either be capped or cut, given the  trillion-dollar deficits we're talking about every day and the debt of 21  trillion.  </p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, we see the defense budget here in the U.S. sustained, and  if you look back a couple of years when we were in the middle of  sequestration.  We feel like we're in a stronger budget position now on  both sides of the aisle.  So, we look to the U.S. defense budget to remain  strong.  But we also see growth around the world.  Today, about a third of  our defense backlog is outside the U.S.  So, again, this is a very global  business, and there's a lot of defense growth opportunities outside of the  U.S., and I think the thing that's unique about Boeing is when we think  about growth, we look across commercial defense and services.  We're really  the only aerospace company that can bring great big critical mass to all  three of those sectors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Dennis, it's great to have  you on the program.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Likewise.  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Dennis Muilenburg, ceo at Boeing.  We will  be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump just tweeting again.  He says this, \"By the  way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France  because of almost zero visibility.  I suggested driving, Secret Service  said no, too far from airport and big Paris shutdown.  Speech next day at  the American cemetery in pouring rain!  Little reported -- Fake News.\"  The  President referring to some criticism that he received from the media on  failing to go the cemetery that dual.</p><p>We want to turn to Amazon, congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  slamming Amazon's plans to partially bring (INAUDIBLE) headquarters to New  York City.  Joining me right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart  Varney.  And Stuart, there was a reason that so many cities across this  country were vying for Amazon to come to their city and set up their new  headlines.  Does she not understand business and economics?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, she does not.  I don't  think she wants to.  There's no pleasing some people, and that's the truth.   There's no pleasing a socialist.  I'll quote you exactly what she said.   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, Amazon is a-billion-dollar company.  The  idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks is  extremely concerning to residents here.  Has the company promised to hire  in the existing community?  What's the quality of jobs?  How many are  promised?  Are these jobs low wage or high wage?  Are there benefits?  Can  people collectively bargain?  There's just no satisfying a socialist.  They  see no benefit to investment, capital infusion and growth.  They don't see  it.  They simply see a big corporation.  Give me the money.  I just want  the money.  That's what it's all about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm astonished, actually.  I would have thought that when you  bring 25,000 new jobs, a couple of billion dollars to your city, it would  be universally approved, but apparently not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the first thing she does, Dagen, is she complains that  Amazon is getting tax breaks (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And she says Queens City councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer and state  Senator Gianaris have also come out against the Amazon deal while Mayor  Bill de Blasio says that this could be the single biggest economic  development deal in the history of New York City.  So, here's a word,  Amazon, find another city, I dare you.</p><p>VARNEY:  For once, I'm on Bill de Blasio's side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stuart, I know you'll have more in 10 minutes.  We'll see you  at the top of the hour, thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right  after MORNINGS WITH MARIA 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Stay with us.</p><p>But first, driving innovation, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the  journal's technology conference, featuring the CEO of Uber.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The future of technology, the Wall Street  Journal's Tech D.Live conference is underway this morning where big names  and descending on Laguna Beach, California.  Susan Li is there.  Susan,  good morning.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you, Maria.   Yes, we'll be talking all things tech here in Laguna beach.  That includes  government regulation, innovation, and future partnerships.  Now, later on,  to the program, will feature a lot of heavyweights, that includes Uber CEO,  Dara Khosrowshahi, one of the headliners.  And then, we have celebrity  attendance as well.  Gwyneth Paltrow will be holding the evening session  along with Kevin Hart, the comedian.  Last night, we heard from AT&amp;T's  Randall Stephenson who has some interesting things to say about President  Trump, about Jim Acosta, Time Warner and CNN, and we also heard from  (INAUDIBLE) of Google.  </p><p>Now, we also caught up with Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's former CEO,  billionaire, owner of the L.A. Clips.  And I think that the overarching  theme her are like going to be so far has been this -- talk about the  relationship between the White House and big tech.  And whether or not  they'll be more regulation in the future of big Silicon Valley names.  I  asked Steve Ballmer this.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT:  I don't think Microsoft has much  risk at all right now.  We certainly had ours in the past.  Amazon will  have their own set of issues.  The most important thing for anybody running  a successful tech company where there's not a clear issue.  It's just to  continue to do their job well, be responsible.  I think Amazon has done a  very good job so far.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LI:  Yes.  It was an -- a great job, Jeff Bezos has done a great job as  Steve Ballmer says.  We'll talk more later on today and we have more  interviews coming to you and coming on Fox Business from Laguna Beach.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff.  Susan, thank you.  Susan Lee joining us  there in Laguna.  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Back  In a Minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey  Bell.</p><p>BELL:  Look, the markets might be going well, but the bedrock of the  country, the consumer is strong and we saw that in Home Depot's numbers and  we'll here about that from retailers later this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bullish (INAUDIBLE) Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think the markets just need to calm down.  You know,  sometimes good news is bad news, and bad news is good news.  Right now, the  market just needs to calm down, calm down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, it's the stability.  Look long term, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And New York City, I'm going to tweet this.  I think the  Governor of the New York -- of New York state and the major of New York  City, maybe need to do a conference call with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to  explain what 25,000 jobs mean in terms of the tax revenue, and how that  actually helps fix the New York City subways.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's a reason that every city in the country wanted the  Amazon headquarters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  They all wanted it.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thank  you so much, and we'll see you in a few minutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday, November 13th, your top stories  right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets looking to rebound this morning after a serious selloff yesterday.   Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 95 points.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The market up about a third of a percent on the Dow, half a percent higher  on the S&amp;P, and about three quarters and percent higher on the NASDAQ with  a 49-point move this morning higher for NASDAQ.  </p><p>This after broad-based selloff yesterday for stock prices, Apple and  Goldman Sachs dragging down the Dow Industrials by better than 600 points  at the close.  </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly two percent on the session.  As you can see,  the NASDAQ the worst performer, down nearly three percent.  Apple leading  the charge in technology stocks lower yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning, also seeing a bit of a bounce.  The FT-100 is  up a fraction, 13 points higher there, 11 points higher on the CAC Quarante  in Paris, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 75, that's two-thirds of one  percent this morning.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances, as you see there.  Best performer in  China, up about one percent on the Shanghai Composite.</p><p>But the Nikkei Average in Japan down better than two percent overnight.</p><p>The picks are in, Amazon will soon call Long Island City, New York, and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the company's HQ2 selection  with the announcement coming as early as today.  </p><p>Amazon shares are up this morning, three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Raging wildfires in California.  This infernos -- the infernos are burning  a path of devastation.  The death toll now rising to nearly 50 people  between these massive fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KORY HONEA, SHERIFF, BUTTE COUNTY:  I understand that makes this the  deadliest fire in the history of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest and we will take you live to California  this morning.</p><p>There are new questions facing Boeing this morning.  A new report says the  jet-maker withheld information on the 737, the same model involved in the  deadly Indonesia crash last month.  </p><p>Boeing Chairman and CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, will join me in a Fox Business  exclusive this morning.  Stay with us for that exclusive coming up at 8:30  a.m. Eastern this morning.</p><p>Plus Tide detergent unveils new packaging, and it is going viral.  The  controversy coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner Mitch  Roschelle, and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, with us this  morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Cannot wait for that Boeing  interview.  That'll be fantastic.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that'll be good, because this is -- there are new  questions this morning, but at the same time, Boeing has been operating on  fire. </p><p>I mean, this company is seeing commercial airline business up strongly, the  defense business up strongly, and the stock has held up well.  </p><p>Of course, they are trading down in the month of October.  Like the other  defense contractors, they had a tough month. </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  It'll also be interesting because there are  some trade considerations with a company like Boeing.  Their rival Airbus  in Europe, so it'll be interesting to see what he has to say about that as  well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  And China is the number one market  for the business in terms of new planes and aerospace business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  We are at tend of earning season, which Lindsey will get  into.  Ninety percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, but we've got  retailers this week.  </p><p>Home Depot just came out with numbers beating on revenue and earnings per  share.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The numbers are on the screen right now.  The estimates call  for $2.26 a share.  The company is reporting earnings of $2.51 on revenue  of -- better than the estimate, which was 26.26 billion and here is the  renew estimate coming in better than expected at 23.6 billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Overall S&amp;P 500 earnings are up almost 29 percent from a  year ago.  The expectation going into the quarter was 22 percent, so it was  a terrific quarter on earnings.  </p><p>A lot misses on revenue, 40 percent of companies missing on revenue  expectations.  This was a beat.  We get Walmart later this week and some  other big retailers like a Macy's, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting to see this market performance, Lindsey, in  the face of 29 percent profit growth year over year.  </p><p>BELL:  I know.  And I think it's still like we always talk about, it's all  about the outlook.  The outlook was a little bit weaker than expected for  many companies as we looked forward to the fourth quarter and into 2019.  </p><p>There are rising raw material costs, the strong dollar certainly impacting,  but you and I was -- we're talking about that in the green room.  </p><p>And so expectations for growth in 2019 have been coming down.  All through  this year, we're looking for 10 percent earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p>Now we're at about eight and a half percent, which is still a very, very  good number, but there are still a lot of uncertainties out there with what  the fed's going to do, what's going to happen with trade, and then where is  the dollar going.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  What I -- what I like about the home improvement industry is  these are discretionary spends.  </p><p>BELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And it tells you something about the consumer, when they're  discretionarily spending on things.  You don't have to fix up your home,  you don't have to do home improvement, and when you do it, that's when the  customer feels strong.  </p><p>So, that may give us an indication of what the rest of the retail season  looks like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's also a really important focus on the consumer.  </p><p>This week, we will hear -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- as you said, from Walmart and Macy's tomorrow, but Home  Depot numbers' better than expected.  </p><p>As we worry about a growth slowdown, where is the consumer in that growth  slowdown?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, I mean you know what, I think the consumer remains  confident and higher interest rates aren't scaring them away from doing  home improvements.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is good because the home sales this year have been in kind  of a slow slide for much of -- much of the year in terms of declines in  home sales in consecutive months.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  Which is why Home Depot's stock hasn't done so well this year.   It's down about five percent year to date.  </p><p>These numbers look to be pretty strong, and we'll have to get into the  details.  But, you know, the concern is home sales have been weak, interest  rates are rising, are investors going -- are peep -- are consumers going to  invest in their homes and fixing them up?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you look at a market, like we saw yesterday, where Apple  was really the problem.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Down sharply.  And you wonder if that's indicator of slowdown.   People are worried about unit sales, worried about a slowdown in Apple.</p><p>This is the most important product that identifies really what we're  talking about in terms of consumer spending.  </p><p>What did you think about the market selloff yesterday?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that a lot of this is still a hangover from Apple  suddenly announcing that it's not going break out its unit sales because it  does look like they're trying to hide something, quite frankly.</p><p>And, you know, this was -- they act like that breaking out the unit sales  of these products isn't important today.  Well -- but -- you know, why was  it important then years ago when you -- when you launched the iPhone?</p><p>That's number one.  I'll just point out that stock is still up almost 15  percent year to date.</p><p>So it was roughly immune to what happened to, say, in Amazon in the month  of October when Amazon went into a full-blown bear market in that stock.  </p><p>Apple is still up, it's, you know, pretty -- seeing a pretty sharp decline  in the -- so far in November.  </p><p>But, again, still double-digit gain year to date.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's really indicative of the story overall, of the worry,  the story of this market.  We are worried about growth, worried that things  will turn down and you see a company like Apple and Home Depot really  indicative of the consumer.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And I think yesterday's action in Apple really did spook  especially tech investors because exactly to your point, Amazon's in bear- market territory.  Apple has been the value in the tech sector.  And it's  been able to hold up and support the group.  </p><p>And so if growth is slowing there, we -- do we have a bigger problem  overall?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was on a report about suppliers.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Two -- </p><p>BELL:  Two suppliers.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's another thing, the suppliers made guidance  warnings and, you know, you think thank back to what Dan Niles said a  couple of weeks ago with the inventory build-up.  </p><p>I mean he mentioned that Apple had inventories up 89 percent, quarter of a  quarter -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in the second quarter and that was an issue because if  you've got an economic slowdown and you've got people pulling back in terms  of spending, well, what are they going to do?</p><p>First, they're going to buy the inventory that they have.  Can they  actually get rid of all of that inventory?  </p><p>And if you see China slowing down, is China -- are the Chinese going to buy  a phone for a thousand dollars?  So, that's why Apple is such an important  indicator in terms of what's going on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will argue also that yesterday was kind of a delayed reaction  to that move-up in long-term interest rates last week where you saw the 10- year.  Every time -- and we've had this happen several times in the last  month or so.</p><p>Every time that 10-year treasury yield gets closer to 3.25 percent, because  it hit a new -- it was like a seven and a half year-high last week, that  rattles investors and the bond market was closed yesterday.  </p><p>But I think that that is definitely playing into, you know what, if longer- term interest rates are at three and a quarter, three and a half, you know,  those earnings, I need to pay a little bit less for those earnings way,  way, way out in the future on these big-growth companies.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, and that's a huge impact on the tech sector.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BELL:  Which is supposed to have the best earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let -- </p><p>BELL:  It has had the best growth in the past two years. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's zero in on this stock market and really what's going on  this morning.  Joining the conversation, we got the Chairman, President,  and CEO of Boeing here in studio this morning, Dennis Muilenburg.  </p><p>My special guest in the fact of this new report from the Journal on its  737.  </p><p>Louisiana Congressman and current House Majority Whip, Steve Scalise, joins  us with his reaction to the midterm elections and what can get done.</p><p>Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane  is with us this morning, along with the CEO of the Mayo Clinic, Dr. John  Noseworthy back with us as well.  </p><p>And Florida Congressman-elect, former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel  Michael Waltz, joining us as well.  A lot to talk about.  Big guest lineup  today, don't miss a moment of it.  </p><p>And of course we are watching markets this morning after that major selloff  yesterday driven by weakness in technology and Apple in familiar.  </p><p>Joining us now is Fort Pitt Capital Group Partner, Vice President, as well  as Senior Portfolio Manager, Kim Forrest.  Kim, good to see you.  Thanks  very much for joining us.  </p><p>Your reaction to the -- </p><p>KIM FORREST, VICE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FORT PITT CAPITAL  GROUP:  Thanks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the market selloff yesterday and what to do  now?</p><p>FORREST:  Sure.  Well, I think you guys covered it ably, you know.  All the  factors that you cited are just exactly in line with what I saw.  </p><p>The raise in interest rates, you know, made these higher price stocks a  little less desirable.  </p><p>I do think that Apple may not be something that the -- that is a great  thing about -- a great -- I don't know, point of data about how consumers  are spending because you did get those great Home Depot numbers.  </p><p>And I think Apple's its own little issue.  But that being beside that, I  think today is a tremendous opportunity if you have long-enough time  horizon -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FORREST:  -- to really look and see stocks that you may want to buy right  now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting you say Apple could have its own  issue.  I mentioned Dan Niles has been covering this company for years.  </p><p>FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  AlphaOne Capital Partners, he almost predicted this trouble for  Apple and the technology sector a month ago.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  I think you  absolutely are, and this is exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of  inventory out there.  </p><p>So, if you pick the biggest company in the world, Apple, for example, they  have 89 percent inventory growth year over year in the June quarter that  they reported.  Their revenues were up 17 percent.  </p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>Look at last year, they had one phone priced above a thousand dollars.   This holiday season, they have three phones priced above them.</p><p>The average selling price, they're trying to boost it by another hundred  dollars.  </p><p>The problem is, if you look at smartphone units overall, this will be the  first year in history that smartphone units are down year over year.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kim, you might say that Apple is its own specific story, but -- </p><p>FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- doesn't it feed on itself?  I mean if you've got a lot of  inventory out there in technology and you can't sell it because things are  slowing down, that's going to trickle into other retail and other tech.</p><p>FORREST:  Maybe.  We're going to put a big maybe there because here --  here's the issue, I look at tech very differently than a lot of analysts.   We're talking about Apple, which is almost solely consumer-oriented tech.  </p><p>I am really excited about more enterprise or business-related tech because  I think as wages are starting to go up, businesses have to once again think  about how do I make my employees more productive?  </p><p>And it's not by watching Netflix, it's not by, you know, participating on  Facebook and maybe it's not by buying Apple products.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>FORREST:  But still, semiconductors underlie this whole trend of making  people more productive through software and hardware -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>FORREST:  And it's delivered on semiconductors, so that's what I'm kind of  throwing out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>FORREST:  And I do think Apple is, you know, an issue in and of itself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  It is very high-priced products and maybe not everybody, you  know, needs to buy a new Apple phone every 18 months -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  -- like they have in the past.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about Amazon?  The Journal is reporting this morning  that the company is ready to choose New York City and Northern Virginia as  the new homes for Amazon's new headquarters.  </p><p>Kim, good or bad move on Amazon's part to split the second headquarters?   What do you think?  </p><p>FORREST:  Well, I really thought Pittsburgh was the winner here, but, you  know, we're going to leave that behind.</p><p>But, no, I think it's really smart, especially because it looks like  Amazon's going to have to develop its own in-house brands for clothing and  what better place than New York City to do that.</p><p>The Virginia aspect is kind of interesting, it's close to the government  and, you know, I think they need to address a whole lot of maybe regulatory  issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  So, you know, that makes a whole lot of sense there, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, just really quickly, I'm sure we'll get to this in the show,  but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has just been elected to Congress,  representing part of Queens, is calling in to question Amazon moving into  Queens.  </p><p>The idea of we receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a  time when our subway is crumbling out and our communities need more  investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here that -- </p><p>Well, we will just talk about that, because that shows a fundamental  misunderstanding of the way an economy works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a misunderstanding of what the whole point in giving  tax breaks to companies are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the whole point, is to lead to jobs.  </p><p>FORREST:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Twenty-five thousand jobs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you -- do you have a leave -- do you have a leave?  Because  that gives me a headache.  That economic analysis -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have an Advil for you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is just -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I might have an Advil for you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kim, thank you so much.  We will see you soon.  </p><p>FORREST:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're watching all of the above.  Kim Forrest joining us.   We'll take a break.  </p><p>When we come back, wild fires are out of control in California.  The  multiple blaze is burning across the state, becoming the deadliest in the  state history.  The very latest coming next.  </p><p>And then withholding data, new reports suggest Boeing did not share  potential problems with flight control systems.  It could have played a  role in the Lion Air jet crash next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  In Northern California, wild fire becoming the  deadliest in state history.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details right  now.  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  The  monster campfire has now killed at least 42 people in Northern California,  hundreds are still unaccounted for.  President Trump has approved a major  disaster declaration for the Golden State. </p><p>In Southern California, that's where you have the Woosley Fire that's  destroyed more than 400 homes and businesses.  That fire has killed at  least two people.  </p><p>Thousands of structures remain at risk, red-flag warning in effect for L.A.  and Ventura counties, and obviously the weather is not helping the  situation.</p><p>Well, Boeing reportedly withheld information on the Lion Air jet that  crashed in Indonesia last month, killing all 189 people on board.  </p><p>The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Boeing didn't tell airlines about  potential hazards in a new flight control feature on their 737 Max.  </p><p>The problem is that the system can push the plane's nose down so strongly  that pilots can't pull it back up.  The automated stall prevention system  is being investigated as playing a role in the crash.  </p><p>Shares of Boeing are up a quarter of one percent.  And premarket trading,  Maria, you will talk to Boeing Chairman, and CEO, President Dennis  Muilenburg.  That's at 8:30 this morning.  </p><p>Everybody stay tuned for that that.  </p><p>Well, fans worldwide are paying tribute to a real superhero.  Stan Lee, the  father of Spider-Man, The Hulk, Iron Man, and many other memorable comic  characters, died yesterday in Los Angeles.  </p><p>Lee was a legendary Writer and Publisher of Marvel Comics whose creations  revolutionized comic books.  </p><p>His comics were often turned into blockbuster movies, generating billions  of dollars worldwide. </p><p>Stanley dead at the age of 95.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Coming up next, midterm  madness.  More inconsistencies in the Florida recount process.  They are  popping up as the judge tells both sides to ramp down the rhetoric, that  and other races still not decided right after this break.  </p><p>And then a tidy box, this new design for Tide's detergent driving the  internet nuts this morning.  We will tell you why.  Stay with us on that.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching markets this morning after a big  selloff yesterday.  Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading this  morning.  </p><p>We are looking at a gain of about 145 points on the Dow Industrials, that's  two-thirds of one percent after a 600-point selloff yesterday.  </p><p>The S&amp;P is up 16, and the NASDAQ is up 60 points right now.</p><p>I want to turn to the midterm fallout.  New oversight, the hours on the  senate race has been called.  Kyrsten Sinema, becoming the first democrat  elected in 30 years.  </p><p>In Georgia, a judge extending the deadline to certify votes in the  governor's race there.  </p><p>Republican Brian Kemp is ahead by nearly 60,000 that votes right now, but  Democrat Stacey Abrams is filing a lawsuit to count rejected ballots.</p><p>And then in Florida, ballot drama, the recount is in full swing right now,  but large counties are scrambling to meet the deadline of Thursday.  </p><p>Fox News' Griff Jenkins is in Lauderhill, Florida.  He's at the Broward  County Office of Elections.</p><p>Griff, good morning to you.  </p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  </p><p>You may be watching the markets, but I'm watching ballots being separated  in Broward County.  Take a look at this.  The tabulation room, they still  have not begun the recount here.  </p><p>Now in 65 of Florida's 67 counties, they are either halfway done or even  more from the recount being done, but here in Palm Beach County, they're  far from it.  What they have to do is finish separating page one.  </p><p>Then they'll likely do a calibration of the machines and begin the actual  official tabulation recount.  That isn't expected any time before about  9:00 a.m. here so it's quite an issue as they race towards the Thursday  deadline to get those numbers in.  </p><p>But we were surprised, Maria, yesterday when the Election Supervisor here,  Dr. Brenda Snipes, came out, talked to the media, and addressed allegations  that she has made major mistakes this election, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRENDA SNIPES, SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS, BROWARD COUNTY:  The lawsuits, as  they are written, certainly cast dispersions on my character.  </p><p>I've have worked here for about 15 years and I have to say this is the  first time that this office or I have been under such attacks, so if we  make mistakes, we own mistakes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  Then the stunning development, FormerFlorida Governor, Jeb Bush,  tweeting that he believes Snipes failed to comply with the law in multiple  counts and called for her removal.  </p><p>Jeb was the one that appointed her in 2003 to replace the previous  supervisor who had to be removed for similar problems.  </p><p>Meanwhile, on the national level, Senator Nelson and Governor Scott trading  nasty barbs, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D), CALIFORNIA:  Scott cannot oversee this process in a  fair and impartial way, and thus he should remove himself from any role in  the recount process.</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  Our goal is that we follow the law.  We know  Brenda Snipes mixed illegal ballots with legal ballots.  We know they've  not let party officials in, the courts have said follow the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  If they do indeed get this recount started and meet that Thursday  deadline here in Broward County, Maria, lawyers tell me that they expect  the margin of error to be under that .25 percent and will be headed for a  hand recount after Thursday.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Griff, thank you much.  Griff Jenkins this morning on  that.  </p><p>This is an incredible story, that now we see that Sinema has actually won  in Arizona and these other two are so close.  </p><p>I mean, Georgia, 60,000 votes sounds like a lot, but she's still fighting  in Georgia, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She is still fighting in Georgia, so -- but the Republicans know  definitively that they will still have a 51-seat majority in the Senate,  that's the take away from that.</p><p>But in terms of what's going on down in Florida, there's a history in  Broward County of problems there.  </p><p>I just want to point that out because Brenda Snipes seems to suggest that  people are attacking her and her character, well, there have been glitches,  mistakes, and even illegal ballot destruction in her county under her  supervision.</p><p>The -- a court ruling found in May, Broward Election Supervisor Brenda  Snipes illegally destroyed ballots from a 2016 congressional race with  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was trying to push off this primary challenger,  Tim Canova.  </p><p>So again, there's a history of problems there and raises the issue of if  you were the steward of the county when these problems happened, why was  she still there going into the midterms?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why is she saying that she's been on this job 15 years and this  is the first time she's getting attacked when we know darn well that there  have been issues in the past?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think that Miami Herald and all the newspapers in the State  of Florida write about these problems often and so now that she's in the  national spotlight, maybe it feels a little bit different.  </p><p>But there are issues there and they're front and center during the  midterms.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Count and recount.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll keep following that.  </p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, searching for deal, Vice President  Pence is looking to set a trade agreement with japan that would serve as a  model for other countries.  </p><p>General Jack Keane is here, he will weigh on that.  </p><p>And then on precedence and security, as drug lord, El Chapo, sees his day  in a New York Court.  He will be here today in New York to face that.</p><p>The very latest straight ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures, indicating a bit of a bounce, this morning, after a sharp selloff  yesterday, Dow Industrials set to open up about 130 points that is one-half  of one percent, S&amp;P is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ with a gain of 57  points, good for gain of almost one percent out of the gate, this morning.  </p><p>This after the major indices took a big hit yesterday, a five percent  decline in Apple stock, took a chunk out of this market, that's a Dow  component and a NASDAQ component, the Dow was down 602 points at the close,  down better than two percent, S&amp;P was down about two percent, and the  NASDAQ with a 206-point selloff, was down almost 3 percent, yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the bouncing is continuing, the FT-100 is also  recovering along with stocks on Wall Street, that is up a quarter of a  percent, in London.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up almost half a percent  and the DAX Index in Germany, up three quarters of one percent, 87 points  higher.</p><p>Mixed performances in Asia, overnight, worst performer, Japan; Nikkei  Average down two percent, the Shanghai composite in China, up almost one  percent.</p><p>Crude oil slipping this morning, this after the price of oil closed lower,  yesterday, for 11 days in a row, the very latest on oil's bear market,  coming up.  It is down 20 percent from the highs, just 5 weeks ago.</p><p>Home Depot, reporting earnings this morning, they were better-than- expected, the improvement store out with double beat.  We will break it  down for you as the stock is up 2-1/4 percent, that's helping the Dow  Industrials for sure.</p><p>Zuckerberg won't go, the Facebook founder could be held in contempt after  declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.  And  another Tide controversy to report, the detergent's new packaging being  compared to a box of wine, we will get into all of that, coming up.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, mounting pressure on China,  Vice President Mike Pence headed to Singapore, to talk trade, with the  Association of the Southeast Asian Nations.  Speaking with Japanese Prime  Minister Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo, yesterday, the Vice President took a strong  stance on China, ahead of the President's meeting with President Xi, at the  end of the month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States seeks a  relationship with China that's based on fairness, reciprocity and respect  for sovereignty.  The difficulties that the United States and other nations  face with China have been well documented by our administration.  And China  knows where we stand.</p><p>Nevertheless, President Trump is looking forward to his meeting with  President Xi, in Argentina.  He believes that progress could be made, but  either way, we're confident that the United States remains in a strong  position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that is FOX News  Strategic Senior Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to see  this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to  see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you were just in Singapore, a few months ago, meeting with  leadership there, your take on the Vice President's comments and how  Singapore and the U.S. can team up here?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, yes, they're very concerned.  I just came back from Vietnam  this weekend also, they are very concerned about what China has been doing  in the region for years, and largely getting away with it.  You know,  because, the United States had never truly engaged competitively against  China.</p><p>And they think that we have a long way to make up for it, but they truly  appreciate the fact that the United States is back in the game, so to  speak, and they're pushing back on China's economic and political warfare  and also their militarization, particularly, the South China Sea.</p><p>And I think Vice President Pence's Seminole speech, a few weeks ago, on  China, caught everybody's attention in the Indo-Pacific.  And that was a  huge step forward for the United States, but most importantly for our  relationship with our allies.</p><p>So, I think Vice President Pence will be very welcome by the ASEAN leaders,  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and I think he will get positive  feedbacks for the fact that President Trump is, once again, exercising  American leadership in the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General, the President really has to walk a balance here,  because while pushing back on China, trying to get them to change their  behavior, it also could impact business.  We've got the CEO of Boeing  coming in here, this morning, to talk about his business.  In the coming  year and years, one in four or five planes made at Boeing, will go to  China.</p><p>This is the second largest market for Boeing, and that's just in the  aerospace maker, I mean, there are tons of other companies, as well,  looking to China for opportunities, so how does the President walk that  balance?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I think, there has to be a balance.  Listen, clearly, China  is a major market and American businesses will continue to do work there,  to be sure, but I think what the President has done and illuminated the  issue in trying to find the balance and stop stealing our intellectual  property, stop -- </p><p>If you have to do business in China, as you well know, Maria, you've got to  enter into a joint venture with them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  That's not the way we do business in Europe or in the Middle East,  and as a result to that joint venture, they get access to our intellectual  property.  That's got to stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.</p><p>KEANE:  So, I think -- I think if we continue to do business, that's fine,  but let's get it on a balance table where it's much more equitable and it's  kind of the way we do business in other parts of the world.  I will tell  you this, a lot of the supply chain that exists in China, and from American  businesses and other businesses are looking to go elsewhere.</p><p>And in Vietnam, that I just came back from, they are reaping some of the  benefits of that, as will other nations in the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean -- I guess business has been dealing with, you  know, succumbing to China and handing over their technology and going by  their rules for so long that they forgot how unfair it was.  Look, the  other major point in the Vice President's statement yesterday, was on North  Korea.  Watch this, got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE:  The President has made it clear that the time for implementing the  agreement is not a driving factor.  And as I assured you, Mr. Prime  Minister, the pressure campaign will continue, the sanctions will remain in  full force, until we achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of  North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New satellite images reportedly show that North Korea is moving  ahead with its nuclear program after Kim Jong-un's agreement with President  Trump, so your take on these developments, General?  What now?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, the Vice President's visit to Japan and talking  to Prime Minister Abe, I will tell you what, he got an earful from him  because that's the person that President Trump do talks in any other world  leader and he truly gives him very good perspective on what's going on in  North Korea and China.</p><p>Listen, the North Koreans, in principle, have agreed to denuclearized, in  fact, they have not taken a single step to do that.  What we wanted out of  the box was; one, give us an inventory of all of your sites and your  weapons themselves, two, give us a plan to destroy and disarm ballistic  missiles and nuclear weapons that has not happened.</p><p>And what we have to stay focused on, is the third thing, there's not been a  single ballistic missile or nuclear weapon that has been disarmed or  destroyed.  So while this progress on the fringes and there are a lot of  positive statements, the reality is, in terms of what needs to be done,  there hasn't been any substantive progress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And for the U.S., what does that mean?  Should the U.S. be  doing something different in terms of our strategy to get the  denuclearization back on track?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, that's a great question, and certainly that's something that  the National Security team of this administration is working on.  I would  suggest, one, we've got to -- we've got to get tough on China because  they've opened the aperture on the sanctions, and some of that backdoors  are happening.</p><p>The Russians have always backdoored North Korea.  We're not going to make  any progress with them.  The State Department has to make certain that the  other nations are not giving up, there's no missiles flying, there's no  tests being taken, there's a -- there's no sense of a crisis, so we have to  make sure the other countries are enforcing the sanctions.</p><p>And we've got to up our game ourselves and we can do that militarily, start  moving some things into the region, make sure that they know that we're  dead serious, it's either you give us the weapons, Mr. Chairman of North  Korea, or we're going to come take the weapons, that's the deal that's on  the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask you about oil, in that vein, President  Trump took aim at Saudi Arabia yesterday, after reports that the country  plans to cut oil production.  The President tweeted this yesterday,  hopefully Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production.  Oil  prices should be much lower based on supply.</p><p>Look, we know, General, that the U.S. has become one of the leading  producers at this point, and now, with the Saudis and OPEC, wanting to cut  production, they're trying to boost prices because it's in a bear market  right now, 20 percent lower from the highs.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  Well, this consensus in the last OPEC meeting, even the so- called Russian cartel, you know, they felt it was going to be a cutback  obviously, in Iranian crude, on the market and as a result of that, the  Russian cartel increased prices, but then this consensus developing now,  that there's going to be an oversupply in 2019.</p><p>I suspect -- the Saudis have made a decision to cut -- I think OPEC will  cut next month, in Vienna, and the Russians will likely follow suit.   That's the path that we are on.  I don't think there's anything that's  going to change it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have been expecting a change in Homeland Security.  I know  that the Washington Post is reporting that Kirstjen Nielsen, Homeland  Security Secretary, is out, and I was hearing the same thing actually, that  they've already had the discussion.</p><p>My sources told me that they've already had the conversation that the  Secretary is going to be out of that job in -- as the President changes its  administration after the midterms, your thoughts on Kirstjen Nielsen being  out?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I don't know anything about that, on the inside, honestly.   But I do know what I'm looking at and clearly, the administration has got  to be very frustrated with the open border that we have because there are  hundreds of people coming through every week, who are coming, seeking  asylum, and we have to release them.</p><p>And that's what's happening, because our system is so backed up with people  who are waiting to be processed.  The so-called catch and release, it's  hundreds, happening every week.  We are focused on the caravan to be sure,  but the equivalent to a caravan, is happening every month.</p><p>And that's got the administration's focus because they get daily reports on  all of this, and I think they are just genuinely dissatisfied with where  things are.  Certainly, the Congress is part of this problem, but it's not  the only part of the problem.  And I think that's likely what's driving the  replacements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the President -- the President cancelled the trip this  week, with Kirstjen Nielsen, to the southern border, in Texas.  Now,  that's, I guess, the Washington Post is saying this is the impetus.  But,  you know, as you say, he's been very frustrated with her, because of the  open borders, but she says it's a Congress problem.  She can't do anything  different because this is the law, General.</p><p>So, the President's frustrated with the person who is in the job, but  doesn't -- aren't her hands tied?</p><p>KEANE:  Her hands are somewhat tied.  But I suspect, now, this is just  speculation on my part, I suspect that the President has received some  advice from other advisers who are saying there are some other options that  we could be putting into play here, and certainly, having resources to cope  with the problem.</p><p>So we're not catching and release, would likely be a start.  And  increasingly, how we process these people in getting their hearings, would  be another part of the puzzle.  I just suspect that over time, there's been  a loss of confidence here if what you're reporting is accurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  There is going to be a replacement.  I think it's largely  immigration issue.  I don't even think it has to do with -- it's one of the  largest -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you're right.</p><p>KEANE:  departments in government.  I don't think that has to do with  anything else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  It's totally the immigration issue, 100  percent, that's what I'm hearing.  But real quick, General, before you go,  any thoughts on who might replace her?</p><p>KEANE:  No, I have no idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so  much.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As always, General Jack Keane, joining us there.  Coming up,  Zuckerberg skips out, why the Facebook founder could be held in contempt,  after declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.   And then, first Tide pods, now this, the internet goes crazy over Tide's  new detergent design, it looks like a case of boxed wine, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The trial of El Chapo set to begin today in New  York.  Lauren Simonetti with the details now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  The notorious Mexican drug lord will be in a Brooklyn federal  court this morning with unprecedented security for the jurors and for  Joaquin El Chapo Guzman himself.  Security will include snipers perched on  rooftops and an armored vehicle to transport Guzman.  He's accused of  spending quarter century smuggling more than 150 tons of cocaine into the  U.S.  He was extradited from Mexico last year after escaping prison two  times.  The trial expected to last more than four months.  Prosecutors say,  the evidence will include the testimony of over a dozen witnesses.  </p><p>Well, a Canadian politician says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be held  in contempt after he refused to appear before an international panel of  five governments that are investigating the company.  That politicians says  he might issue subpoena forcing Zuckerberg to appear before Canada's  parliament.  Zuckerberg had rejected an earlier request to appear before an  international grand committee looking into disinformation and election  meddling.  Facebook not commenting, shares of the company up $1.23 this  morning.</p><p>Well, Procter &amp; Gamble may have another packaging problem.  The company  debut its eco-box, which happens to look a lot like a wine box but that new  Tide box is generating some buzz on Twitter.  This is what one user wrote:  \"You all don't want kids eating Tide pods but when you make a wine box  tide, what do you want from me?  Well, he was referring to the Tide pod  challenge last year when teenagers were daring each other to eat the  detergent pods but would you drink the Tide wine?  I don't know, I hope  that's not an adult challenge coming up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a crazy story.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were eating the pods.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But looks like a wine box, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It does.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I have freshman in college, and I'm frightened right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Where do you think that stuff happens, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a keg, not a wine box.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, owing the best for your friends; how Petco plans to  provide your pet with only health foods.  That's next, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, President Trump just tweeting this, we want to  get this out: \"Emmanuel Macron suggesting building its own army to protect  Europe against the United States, China and Russia, but it was Germany in  World Wars I and 2.  How did that work for France?  They're starting to  learn German in Paris before U.S. came along.  Pay for NATO or not!\"  The  president taking about his meetings and NATO pay your fair share, once  again, this morning.  </p><p>Meanwhile there's this, putting your pet first which we all do here on this  program.  Petco becomes the only major retailer of pet supplies to ensure  healthy food for your furry family members.  In a first on Fox Business  announcement, the company is revealing it will not sell foods or treats  containing artificial colors, flavors and preservatives for dogs and cats  by May of 2019.  Joining us right is the CEO of Petco, Ron Couglin, and  it's good to see you, Ron.  </p><p>RON COUGHLIN, CEO, PETCO:  It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  I was telling you during  commercial break, I only used to serve Ellabela steamed string beans as  treats and she died at almost 18 years old.  She lived a long and strong  life as a result.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  You what's amazing, over 50 percent of pet owners, cook for  their pets.  We were talking about it earlier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Only 50 percent.</p><p>COUGHLIN:  Over 50 percent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  And we're bringing human grade food actually into Petco shortly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about what you're doing?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Yes.  So, the big announcement today is that we're going to be  eliminating all cat and dog foods and treats with artificial flavors,  artificial colors, artificial preservatives.  You know, if you think about  the bet we love, do we want ethanol to be served to them, do we want sulfur  dioxide, do we want (INAUDIBLE), so the answer is no.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And those are in most pet foods?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Those are in certain pet foods.  Now, the reality is, Petco has  been weening off those products, other companies have much higher percent  of those foods.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, Charlie and Ramon don't eat those, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, they eat a food that you can't buy at Petco.  They eat blue  buffalo basic, limited ingredient, grain-free canned food and also -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And also, I.D. which is prescription and you're going to begin  to sell prescription dog food. </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  This week, we started doing prescription dog food  on Petco.com.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, big response from customers?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Yes, we've seen response thus far, but today is our announcement  day, so we're very proud of it.  It's big deal for the industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's higher premium that people will pay.  It's amazing  to me how much money people spend on their dogs and their cats.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anything -- most of my dogs have gastro, severe gastro  intestinal problems, so anything to keep them healthy but you were talking  about -- you're going to actually start selling cooked food, literally  human food for animals?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, humanization is one of the biggest trends,  folks like you but you don't always have time.  So, what we're going to do  is we're partnered with company called Just Food for Dogs, and we actually  are going to have kitchens.  Union Scare, right here, is going to have a  kitchen where we cook for your dog; you can come in and get fresh food  every day for your dog.  My dog right now is having salmon and sweet  potatoes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Lucky dog.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  So, if you're having salmon and sweet potatoes, your pet should  have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And does this make a difference in the dog's life?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Absolutely, it's all vet-driven mixtures.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can't feed them too much, though, because they'll get fat  and that's a huge problem, obesity in animals.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Ron, real quick, we've been talking about the Petco Foundation,  maybe a little bit on that.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, we're very proud of the Petco Foundation,  especially in times and of hurricanes, fires, et cetera.  We go in and take  care of the pets, we give free food, we give funding to the shelters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Ron.  That's fantastic.  Great, check out  Petco.  Ron Coughlin, thank you for joining us.  Still ahead, a diamond fit  for a ring, we will show you more of this ring designed by Apple's chief  designer; it's made entirely out of diamond, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, November 13th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 on the button on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets set to rebound this morning after a sharp selloff yesterday.   Futures indicate a gain of 128 points on the Dow, one-half of 1 percent at  the opening of trading.  The Nasdaq is up 56 points right now, almost 1  percent this morning after a broad-based selloff yesterday where the Nasdaq  was hit hard.</p><p>Apple and Goldman Sachs dragged the Dow lower but better than 600 points at  the close, down 2.3 percent on the Dow; down 2 percent on the S&amp;P; and on  the Nasdaq, the worst performer on the day, down nearly 3 percent as  technology took a real hit.</p><p>Global markets this morning are also recovering.  Take a look at European  indices.  The FT 100 is up a fraction.  The CAC 40 is up 23 points, that's  one-half of a percent.  And the DAX index in Germany is up 92 points.  That  is almost 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia, overnight mixed performances, the worst performer was Japan.   Nikkei average down better than 2 percent.</p><p>Well, the picks are in, Amazon will soon call Long Island City, New York  and Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the second headquarters  selection with the announcement coming as early as today.  The official  announcement.</p><p>Raging wild fires in California meanwhile, the death toll rising to nearly  50 people between the massive fires.  Residents are describing what  happened when infernos tore through their homes and their neighborhood.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It was unbelievable.  You couldn't see 10 feet in front  of you.  I mean embers everywhere.  Smoke everywhere.</p><p>It's devastating.  It's beyond words.  I mean there's no way to explain it.   It -- I mean it loks like a nuclear blast went off here.  It's crazy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take you live to southern California with the very  latest coming up.</p><p>New questions for Boeing this morning.  A new report says that the jet  maker withheld information on its 737, the same model involved in the  deadly Indonesia crash last month.  Boeing's chairman and CEO Dennis  Muilenburg will join me in a Fox Business exclusive this morning.  That's  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that interview coming up.</p><p>And a scare on the court, a Nets player suffers a gruesome injury leaving  people in the crowd in tears.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PWC partner Mitch  Roschelle and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see  everybody this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for being here after a huge day yesterday in  markets.  Look, we're in a good earnings period, Lindsey, and yet the  market trades down 600 points on these growth concerns.  What's going on?  </p><p>BELL:  Yes. Growth is the big question mark for 2019.  Look, we're cycling  the tax reform package, fiscal stimulus is coming to a peak right now as we  look out to 2019, interest rates are rising.  It seems like global growth  could be slowing especially with China.</p><p>So the question is where do earnings go from here?  We're looking right now  at 8.5 percent growth for 2019, that's down from 10 percent that we saw all  through earlier this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Revenue?  </p><p>BELL:  Revenue, it actually ticked up a slight bit to 6.3 percent which is  pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about earnings of 10 percent.  </p><p>BELL:  Earnings of 8.5 percent for 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  </p><p>BELL:  Came down -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's way down.  No wonder markets are upset about things  slowing down.  For 2018 -- talking about earnings being up 25 percent;  going down to 8 percent in 2019.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  But so much of that was a one-timer from tax  reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think what the market isn't really fully digesting is the  forward guidance is in a new tax regime year over year mode.  And a lot of  people looking at the difference between the 20 plus percent earnings  growth in '18 and then less than 10 percent in '19 and they're having a  hard time digesting it.</p><p>We should put like -- maybe they should just watch this show and hear us  say this enough.  Because there's really no reason to freak out.  These are  still strong earnings numbers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  But a lot of this, I would  argue, is higher interest rates and the Federal Reserve still in the  process of winding down that multitrillion dollar balance sheet where  you've seen a deflation in assets, not just in the stock market, in the  last six weeks or so.</p><p>But look at what oil has done, down 11 days in a row.  That is a record  streak for declines in the cost of crude oil.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are a lot of things at play, maybe actual supply and  demand fundamentals, but also money just coming out of this was clearly an  over-inflated asset.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Apple, we'll talk about that.  What do the  price of oil and Apple tell you about the broader economy.</p><p>Coming up, my exclusive interview this morning with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk to him about what he's  seeing in the global economy, of course, commercial aerospace has been on  fire.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, House majority whip and Louisiana  Congressman Steve Scalise is here.  He's out with a new book.  Congressman- Elect Michael Waltz will join us, Green Beret.  And the CEO of the Mayo  Clinic is back, Dr. John Noseworthy, with some news today.  The host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney here as well.</p><p>We've got a big two hours coming up.  Don't miss a moment of it because we  are reporting this morning the news of the day.</p><p>Our top story right now is that sharp selloff in stocks.  Futures are  higher this morning as the technology sector tries to recover from a sharp  decline yesterday.  It pulled the markets lower, knocking off more than 600  points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>Yesterday it was a sharp selloff and Apple really drove things, drove a  technology slump.</p><p>Now today, this morning it is unchanged after taking a hit amid fresh  concerns over the demand for the iPhone.</p><p>Joining us right now is Scott Martin.  He is Kingsview Asset Management  CIO.  Scott -- good to see you this morning.  I know you've had your share  of worries out there for markets.  Is yesterday's performance telling us  anything about what's ahead?  </p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Probably.  You know, you're  right, Maria -- without the markets I've got enough to worry about.  So  thank you markets for making that even more compounded.  </p><p>Listen, I love what you guys talked about there in the intro to the hour.   Lindsey is absolutely right.  You know, the revenue numbers estimates have  come down, the earnings estimates have come down.</p><p>Mitch is right, too.  You know, guys -- I started some meditation over the  last couple of weeks so you should definitely try that at home, kids.  I  think that has helped me with some of the worries -- Maria.</p><p>And the market needs stop freaking out.  You know, that's the thing like --  kind of like they say in the meditation, be calm because even though  earnings like you said, Maria, and you pointed out astutely are not growing  at 20 plus percent, guess what, kids -- that was unsustainable.  I mean  those weren't numbers that we're going to keep repeating.</p><p>But the market maybe got fooled into thinking that or let's just say we got  valuation metrics that seemed to be aligned with the thinking that that was  going to continue.</p><p>So as we alight or let's say descend back to reasonable numbers and  reasonable economic growth expectation, Lindsey mentioned interest rates  going up and so forth, the market needs to settle into some price here and  then I think it can rebuild some of these losses.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Scott, is there -- if you want to be defensive or if you want  to stay in the market but not have to meditate and do yoga to stay calm --  where's the place to be right now?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, and I haven't found any good yoga or meditation stocks yet,  Mitch, but I'm still looking for them.  You know, there are places to be  and that's a great thing to point out, you know.  This is not a total  freak-out selloff, even kind of like we saw in February just yet or even  like we saw over Brexit or even like we saw, you know, back in the late  2000s, you know, 2008 and so on, because there are things that are working,  specifically -- and we haven't bought enough of this stuff yet but we're  accruing it.</p><p>Look at consumer staples, look at real estate.  Look at utilities.  You  know, if interest rates come down because people like say with the freak- out, you know, they freak-out and they buy bonds, they buy fixed income  instruments and that drives down interest rates.  Some of these interest  rate sensitive names tend to hang in there when equity markets go like they  did yesterday.  </p><p>So Mitch -- I would say those are three good sectors for the individual  investors at home to look at that we start to pick up as well that have  started to mitigate some of the volatility.  </p><p>BELL:  Hey -- Scotty.  So you mentioned a lot of defensive sectors there  which as you rightly point out they've been doing well more recently.  But  what hasn't been doing well is tech.  and that is what led the market over  the past two years.  </p><p>Right now you have two -- three quarters of the S&amp;P 500 tech sector in bear  market territory.  Do we need the tech sector though to continue to move  this bull market higher?  </p><p>MARTIN:  We need something to, Lindsey and I'll tell you that's the  interesting point is you had these great leadership names -- you know, your  favorite ones and ones we still own.  You know, Google, Apple, Microsoft,  Amazon, Netflix, Whatever, Broadcom, Adobe -- great companies that were  crushing earnings and getting high valuations, again like we talked about  that were probably undeserved. </p><p>And now Lindsey -- the market has no leadership, you know.  Everybody has  been calling in the so-called experts, have said, oh my gods, this is the  time for financials because the Fed is hiking interest rates.  When the  reality for the most part, they were just flattening the interest rate  curve.</p><p>And so to me, it needs leadership.  I don't know if it's tech necessarily.   I was hoping for a while there it was going to be industrials because we  were hopefully going to get some of these trade deals reworked and more in  our favor and that was going to work out for some of the companies like  Deere, Caterpillar and some of the other ones we own.</p><p>But maybe it's health care.  That gets worked out with you know, maybe a  bipartisan congress.  Who knows?  But I think you're right, Lindsey.  It  doesn't necessarily have to be tech but it has to be some leadership in  some other sector to take the reins of this market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about financials?  I mean that's probably tough  because you've got higher rates going on.  Tech is where the growth has  been.  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  Higher rates are interesting, Maria -- because even though  the fed's been hiking interest rates, rates did get a nice boost as we saw,  you know, into October and then they've kind of fallen off a bit.  I mean  look at, you know, last week we were at 3.25 again on the 10 year and now I  think I checked this morning we're at 3.15.</p><p>So, you know,, financials kind of remind me of all the girls that turned me  down in high school.  I had to bring that up.  Because they're never there,  you know.  Like financials every year we hear somebody make this bold call  on financials being there and being the one, and they're never doing it.</p><p>So to me I'm not ready to give up on financials but as far as overweighting  financials, I won't do that either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what about Amazon, the split decision expected to divide  its second headquarters between evenly between New York City and northern  Virginia.  According to the Journal this morning, the announcement is  probably -- could come as early as today.</p><p>Is this a smart decision?  What are your thoughts here?  Would you put new  money to work in this market right here?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, we would.  I would slowly start weighting it again.  I don't  think that, you know, you have to jump in on a day like today where, you  know, we had a little bit of mixed trading overseas, especially in the  Nikkei, for example as you pointed out all morning.  And we've got a little  bit of a bounce today.</p><p>But I mean guys, even Eli Manning had a decent football game last night.   So the market can bounce just like that as well.</p><p>But I think Maria -- there's some levels that are coming into play here  that are decent as far as some of these tech names that have sold off 20,  25 percent.  So I think you can start weighting in here with some money but  just have a quick kind of hook on it if things start to get worse again  because you may get some lower prices.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Scott always a pleasure.   Thanks so much for weighing in here.</p><p>MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scott Martin joining us there.</p><p>Turning to the devastation in California right now, the wildfires are  becoming the deadliest in state history.  Fox News' Ray Bogan is in Ventura  County this morning with the very latest.  Good morning to you -- ray.  </p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Maria -- good morning.  </p><p>We're at the incident command center for the Woolsey and Hill Fires where  in just a couple of hours, hundreds of firefighters will arrive to get  their morning briefing.  They're working 24 hour shifts.</p><p>In the meantime, some of them are sleeping in tents.  One man is even over  to my left in a sleeping bag.</p><p>Now, in northern California, investigators are looking into whether a  sparking PG&amp;E power line may have started the Camp Fire which has become  the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state's history.  42 people  have died.  They've been found in their homes and cars as they were trying  to escape. </p><p>At last update, the fire was 30 percent contained and Cal Fire doesn't  expect to have full containment for another week.  Nearly 6,500 homes have  been destroyed, including some belonging to firefighters and their  families.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID HAWKE, PARADISE FIRE CHIEF:  It's just absolutely heart-breaking to  drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.  My family lost  their home in the fire.  My parents did.  My grandmother did.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOGAN:  Now, here in southern California, the Woolsey Fire at last update  was 93,000 acres and 30 percent contained.  Firefighters estimate more than  400 buildings have been destroyed.</p><p>In both fires crews are working against dry, windy conditions and steep  terrain but California is getting help.  President Trump has approved a  major disaster declaration and in addition, Cal Fire is thanking 17 state  partners that have come from as far as Alaska and Georgia.  Maria, back to  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Ray.  Thank you so much.  We will follow this.  And  this is an incredibly devastating story.  Ray -- thank you.  Ray Bogan  there.  </p><p>Coming up, concerns in the sky.  The new report that Boeing withheld  information on its 737.  The same model involved in the deadly Indonesia  crash last month.  I'll speaking exclusively with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing this morning.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk about that  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern and also get his take on the on the commercial  aerospace boom he's been seeing.  Over the last few years.</p><p>Then an injury on the court, the details after a player's gruesome leg  injury leaves some in tears, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New information coming to light this morning following last month's crash  of a Boeing jet in Indonesia.  Lauren Simonetti with the Details now --  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hi -- Maria, Boeing reportedly withheld  information on the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max which killed all 189 people  on-board that day.  Safety experts and others telling the \"Wall Street  Journal\" that Boeing didn't tell airlines about potential hazards in their  new flight control feature on that plane.  The problem is that the system  can push the plane's nose down so strongly that pilots can't pull it back  up.</p><p>The automated stall prevention system is being investigated as playing a  role in that Lion Air crash.  Shares of Boeing trading up a quarter of a  percent, $358.  And programming note -- Maria will sit down with Boeing's  chairman, CEO and president Dennis Muilenburg in the next hour on Morning's  with Maria, 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Well, the Labor Department is trying to help people save money and curb  401-k cash-outs.  The department could soon allow companies to  automatically transfer (INAUDIBLE) accounts of $5,000 or less belonging to  employees who change jobs to the 401-k plan of their new employers.  It's  the effort to cut down on the premature flow of money out of retirement  plans.  Research shows that as many as 80 percent of people leaving jobs  with less than $5,000 in those accounts eventually cash out of them.</p><p>Well, check this out.  Apple's head designer, Johnnie Ives, has taken on a  project more elegant than your iPhone.  He designed a ring carved from a  single chunk of diamond.  It could sell for a quarter million dollars at an  auction at Sotheby's.  Sotheby's says the ring has up to 3,000 facets,  never seen before on a single piece.  It will be made to fit the buyer, up  to a size 5, which is actually pretty small.  All of those proceeds going  to charity.  But most designers start with the metal.  Johnnie Ives took  the metal out of the equation and started with the diamonds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow -- so it's all diamond all around.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All diamonds -- Baby.  And diamonds are my birth stone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they are a girl's best friend.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can hear the woman.  How are they supposed to know it's  diamonds?  You know, you can't tell.  Sorry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  All right.  Thank you -- Lauren.</p><p>Coming up, the state of health care in America.  The CEO of the Mayo Clinic  Dr. John Noseworthy is here.  He's weighing in on the industry innovations,  plus an exclusive announcement that will change health care, certainly at  the Mayo Clinic -- that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A major investment in the future of health care in America.   The Mayo Clinic School of Medicine receiving a $200 million gift from  philanthropist Jay Alix, the largest ever made to the clinic.</p><p>Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive are Alix Partners founder  Jay Alix and Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. John Noseworthy.  Great to see you both.   Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JAY ALIX, FOUNDER, ALIX PARTNERS:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p>DR. JOHN NOSEWORTHY, CEO, MAYO CLINIC:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Jay -- what a gift.  Congratulations to you that you're  able to do such a thing for the Mayo Clinic.  </p><p>ALIX:  Absolutely.</p><p>You know, Mayo is such a he deserving institution.  The medical school is  one of the top ranked medical schools in the country.  And to be able to be  involved with them, to help them with their mission is just a really great  opportunity for us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is going to help the medical school a lot, Dr.  Noseworthy.  And you're also going to be able to attract new talent with  this.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  Thanks -- Maria.  Yes, this is really going to help us a great  deal, attract the best students from all over the world, from all  backgrounds regardless of their ability to pay for medical education. </p><p>And it will help us with new curriculum and dual degrees and innovative  ways of teaching and technology and all those good things.  It's a  wonderful gift.  We're really grateful to Jay.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are now going to be on the board.</p><p>ALIX:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you want to see from the Mayo Clinic and how this  money could be best used.  </p><p>ALIX:  Well, what this gift is about is really helping attract the best  students for the medical school, to train the doctors of the future.  The  country is facing a crisis that we're going to need probably 110,000  doctors in the next 10 years that we don't have today and we don't know  where they're going to come from.</p><p>So we need to train more doctors and we have to provide the money and the  support and the scholarship to help those students get into medical school  and have the country have the right doctors in the future.  Mayo can do  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  It was major issue in this past election,  everybody said that health care was the number one matter that was very  important to voters.  The Democrats taking the House in the midterm  elections.  And they say one of the priorities is health care in America.</p><p>So John -- tell us where the needs are right now.  Tell us what your view  is in terms of what needs to be done to take health care up to the next  level.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  So the majority of Americans are concerned about access,  coverage, and the cost of health care and the need for transparency to  drive down the cost but also improve the outcomes.  And we support all of  that.</p><p>From Mayo Clinic's perspective, it's more than cost.  It's certainly cost  but it's also outcomes and the performance and how well health care  performs.  And at Mayo Clinic we're all about serious and complex illness  and how to finance as quickly and effectively and provide patients with the  best possible care.</p><p>So the doctors of the future are going to have to deal with transparency,  coverage cost, access, technology, how to drive the safest and highest  technology, most affordable health care system which we don't have at the  moment, as you know.  We're tied to these election cycles every two years.   So it's this and that and this and that and until the country decides that  it's really a priority for the citizens, we're not going to get that long- lasting answer that we need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you talk about outcomes.  You know, we've been all about  prevention these last several years, talking about getting ahead of  disease.  How might that money be used toward getting ahead of disease and  when you look at the needs in this country today.  I mean I know we haven't  done enough work or we need more money for Alzheimer's, for example.  And  you know, issues related to the brain.  Where are the needs in that regard?  </p><p>ALIX:  Well, I think we have really leading edge technologies now.  We have  artificial intelligence coming online.  What A.I. is going to do for  medicine and the digitization of medical, you know, personal health data is  going to revolutionize how we can do diagnosis.  And of course with it, you  know, early intervention, diagnosis and prevention we can really change  outcomes for all people who have serious complex medical problems.  And  Mayo is leading the way on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you made because A.I. is  able to work with doctors to improve the outcomes.  Isn't that right?  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  That's absolutely right.  And I think it's also prediction.   It's early diagnosis but it's also predictive genomics, if you will.   Knowing what we know about people, who is likely to be at risk for this or  that so you can diagnose it early.  It's all of that together.  </p><p>And the young kids who want to do medicine, want to have a life of service,  they need to have that kind of an education to prepare them for that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What have you done differently in terms of A.I. at the clinic?  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  We have well over 100 projects trying to predict how to read  x-rays better, how to predict from genomics, how things will play out.   We're working into everyday life at Mayo Clinic, monitoring patients'  hearts, who is at risk for heart disease, that sort of thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this money will go toward getting new students who will be  looking at A.I. as part of their curriculum, very different than the  doctors in the past.  </p><p>ALIX:  Exactly.  Medical education is going to have to evolve quickly now  and keep up the new technologies, new breakthroughs in science and apply it  right into the clinic for people.  Mayo Clinic can lead the way on that  with this gift and with the research and development it has.</p><p>Mayo has three shields with clinical care, education and research and the  combination of all those three working together is what this gift will  allow Mayo to do.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  We'll be offering a masters of artificial intelligence.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Masters of A.I. </p><p>NOSEWORTHTY:  Masters of A.I. and masters of regenerative science, and  masters of advanced biotechnology and bioengineering.  All of these, the  new wave will be right in the curriculum plus the (INAUDIBLE) start willing  to spend say an extra year to get that additional training.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we go, where have you seen the most progress in terms of  outcomes in terms of disease?  Is it cancer?  Is it somewhere else?  Heart  disease?  Where have you seen the biggest -- </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  I think it's in all the serious illnesses -- Maria.  We're  actually measuring outcomes much better, the quantitation of outcomes,  quality of life, life expectancy, readmission to hospital, all of those  things that are now being put on score cards to see what is the investment  to health care doing to reduce the costs and prove the outcome so that  quantitative outcomes research, it's still in its infancy, but it's  absolutely critical if we're going to have the best health care system in  the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And particularly as you see spending from the NIH  dropping, you need private investors and private practitioners to come in  and help the situation. </p><p>And here comes you-- Jay Alix.  Thank you so much.  Great to see you both.   Thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>ALIX:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. John Noseworthy and Jay Alix joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Congress returns to Washington.

And it is Tuesday, November 13th,  your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures are indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning after a  sharp selloff yesterday.  The Dow Industrials set to be up 150 points right  out of the gate, that's two thirds of one percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up 17  right now and the NASDAQ is up 57 points, that's almost one percent higher.  </p><p>This after the major indices took a sharp hit yesterday, five percent  decline in the Dow and the NASDAQ component Apple, that took a chunk out of  markets with Apple down five percent, the Dow was down 2-1/3 percent and  the NASDAQ was down almost three percent at the close yesterday.  S&amp;P 500  with a decline of 55 points, down almost two percent.  </p><p>Well, that was then this morning we're seeing a bounce in the U.S. and  Europe.  FT-100 is up a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante is up a half a  percent and the DAX Index in Germany is up almost one percent.  </p><p>Mixed performances in Asia overnight to report.  Nikkei Average worst  performer in Japan, down about two percent.

It is down 20 percent from the highs  in just the last five weeks.  What does that tell us?  </p><p>Earnings out today, Home Depot with a double beat earlier this morning, the  stock is up 2-1/2 percent on better than expected earnings and revenue at  Home Depot. </p><p>Meanwhile, back in session, Congress returns to Washington today for the  first time since Democrats won the House in the midterm elections.  What  the divided House will mean for your wallet coming up. </p><p>And tragedy on the court, a star Nets player suffered a gruesome ankle  injury in last night's game.  We'll have the details coming up this  morning.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, Congress returning to  Washington today to a new political landscape.  I spoke with House Majority  leader Kevin McCarthy this weekend along with Congressman David Cicilline  on Democrats the \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" program about the agenda going  forward.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Well, we'll want to  find common ground.  We will look to make sure we continue to make our  military strong, make sure that we can combat China and others of their  aggressive actions and also when it comes to trade expanding, we want to  find places that we can find common ground.  But those place that's we  principally disagree with, we will stand up strongly to show America the  difference to make assuring that we can continue to grow this country.  </p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (R), RHODE ISLAND:  Democrats ran on a very specific  agenda.  I helped craft it with my co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and  Communications Committee.  It's an -- it's an agenda for the people on this  country.  It's focusing on driving down the cost of health care, driving  down the cost of prescription drugs, protecting coverage for pre-existing  condition, raising family incomes by rebuilding our country with a serious  infrastructure plan for our roads, bridges, ports, transit systems, we'll  create 16 million good paying jobs.  And taking on the corruption in  Washington by getting money out of our political system.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Congressman-elect, or Florida's 6th  Congressional district and former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel Michael  Waltz.  Lieutenant Colonel, good to see you this morning.  Congratulations  to you and thank you for joining us.  </p><p>LT. COL. MICHAEL WALTZ (R), CONGRESSMAN-ELECT, FLORIDA:  Thank you.  Yes,  thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, let's talk first about the new Congress and what  you expect to get done now working with the Democrats.  </p><p>WALTZ:  Well, you know, one of the things that I'm very excited about in  this Congress is the amount of veterans that are running on both sides of  the aisle.  I think that's something that's really resonated with voters.   They understand that veterans know how to get things done.  They're not as  ideological.  You know, I can tell you Maria, in the fox hole, nobody cares  about party, race, religion, social economic background, the enemy's  bullets certainly don't care.  </p><p>And you know, I think you're going to see an approach or at least at an  ethos where compromise isn't a dirty word.  Where we can move the country  forward because you're going to have folks.  Right now, we're at a record  low in our nation's history at around 17 percent of veterans in Congress.   I think that's going to increase.  You're going to see people focused on  mission, on country and on getting things done.  That's what I heard from  hundreds of thousands of doors that people want results.  They don't want  resistance.  And they expect their elected representatives to accomplish  what they set out to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I guess, should we expect defense spending to stay elevated  then?  </p><p>WALTZ:  I think so.  You know, I can tell you from firsthand experience  after 17 years of war our military, our equipment is exhausted.  You have  pilots that are younger than the planes that they're flying.  And we face  unprecedented threats between Russia, China and still a metastasizing  growing Islamic extremism problem.  So, I think we're going to have to.   There's really not a choice there.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  One of the huge issues  though, Congressman-elect, it's Dagen McDowell.  Good to see you again.  </p><p>WALTZ:  Thanks Dagen, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is that the U.S. is on course to spend more on the interest on  our debt than even on defense spending.  That's going to happen about four  to five years from now.  So in order to make sure that our military is  sound in terms of it's our financial support, we need to figure out how  we're going to rein in spending elsewhere.  What's your plan on that?  </p><p>WALTZ:  Well so, there's two ways, right, to -- you know, I'm a business  owner as well as a veteran and there's two ways to deal with debt.  You  deal with it with growth and with cutting spending.  I think President  Trump's absolutely spot-on on what he's doing to grow the economy as a  business owner himself.  And then I think you need members that have the  fortitude to stand up and take on -- to take on spending.  Not only do I  support the military but I also hold the Pentagon accountable for when  there is -- when there's waste involved in their spending in all government  agencies.  </p><p>But Dagen, we both know that on the one hand you have the discretionary  spending and then you have the nondiscretionary spending and what gets at  the heart of that is the cost of health care.  We have to take -- I'm very  -- I'm fascinated to see if the Democrats will take on what it takes to  lower the cost of care.  Tort reform, selling across state lines, going  into a free market system, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, really getting  serious about driving down the cost of care which would then make it more  accessible and affordable and help businesses like mine and help our debt.   .</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Congressman, Mitch Roschelle.  One of the  things that concern business owners, my friend recently did a study of what  are on the mind of business leaders, and the number one thing that they're  looking for in a bipartisan way is cyber security.  And you talk about  defense spending.  I think they're interrelated.  Do you think that's an  area -- because I haven't heard much from Washington about policy around  protecting intellectual property.  You know, from -- not just from theft  but from a cyber security risk.  Is that something that you think could be  an agenda, especially, you know, more military people obviously they have a  pretty good sense of cyber warfare.  </p><p>WALTZ:  You know, I can -- I can tell you, watching China roll out its  sixth generation stealth fighter which looks exactly like ours, armed  drones which looks exactly like ours, underwater submersibles which look  like ours, doesn't sit well with veterans.  And they've essentially stolen  that intellectual property.  So, you know, this is -- this is about how the  private sector and the government come together in a way that's in line  with American values, not dictated from Washington.  </p><p>But look, I think we're getting to the point where we really have no choice  and the more business owners, the more veterans you have on the Hill that  understand those dynamics, I think the better.  So yes, that's something I  certainly want to take on.  </p><p>Look, we have to as a country.  We are having our technological edge be  stolen in front of our very eyes and at the -- you know, at the same time  this is something that President Trump I think has taken on, Republican  Congress needs to take it on.  And I hope the Democrats join us in that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what has taken place since the midterm  elections, Tuesday night.  There's still no winner for the state Senate.</p><p>WALTZ:  Less than a week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's talk about Florida.  There's still no winner for the  gubernatorial and the state Senate race.</p><p>WALTZ:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The controversy over a recount is continuing this morning.   Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum has relinquished the race -- had  relinquished the race against Republican Ron DeSantis.  But he took that  back.  What do you think is going on here?  And what's your reaction to the  fact that in Arizona we see now a change in leadership post the midterms,  now Sinema is winning or won?  </p><p>WALTZ:  You know, in Florida this is so concerning.  Frankly, it's  embarrassing for our state.  It's two counties that year -- you know, cycle  after cycle we're having these problems.  It's incompetence at best.  It's  fraud, you know, frankly at worst, as many have alleged.  This is happening  year after year.  I think we need to see accountability when it comes to  these election officials.  I can tell you, I had four counties in my  district and the T's were crossed and the I's were dotted.  This is the --  this is the heart of our democracy.  As a veteran, this is what we fight to  defend and sacrifice to defend all over the world.  And they have -- they  have a solemn duty to get it right.  I'm glad to see so much attention but  -- on it.  But you know, once this is all said and done, I think you will  see Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott emerge as they currently are ahead.  There  needs to be some accountability afterwards so that we're not dealing with  this again in 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to quickly point out something that Byron York  tweeted out that was mentioned on \"SPECIAL REPORT\" last night.  Like, Rick  Scott went into this, he was leading by 56,000 votes on election night,  tens of thousands of votes for the DeSantis lead going into this.  If a  recount reverses the initial margin of a few -- of more than a few hundred  votes it would be unprecedented, in the history of recent American  elections.  </p><p>WALTZ:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  According to FairVote, almost 4,700 state-wide elections between  2000 and 2016, only 26 of them went to a recount.  Of those 26, just three  recounts wound up changing the initial results of the race, it was one in  Washington, --</p><p>WALTZ:  Washington State.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- one in Vermont and one in Minnesota.  The average swing in  those three elections after the recounts, 311 votes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, watch these results.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this largely because of Broward County?  </p><p>WALTZ:  Broward County and Palm Beach County.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALTZ:  And this is -- but what has us so in sensed is this has been a  habitual problem.  This goes back to Bush versus Gore.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p>WALTZ:  And it happens cycle after cycle.  And what so many of us are  asking is, where is the accountability for these election officials?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're also asking that this morning.  Lieutenant colonel,  it's good to see you this morning, thanks very much.</p><p>WALTZ:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching as you take your post in the New Year.   Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz, Congressman-elect.  </p><p>Coming up, a nightmare on the court, the details after a player's gruesome  leg injury leaves some in tears, that's next.  </p><p>Then, Congress headed back to the Hill today, we break down how the  Democratic control of the House may impact your wallet.  Congressman Steve  Scalise is here.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, more of the NFL salute to service at Monday Night  Football.  Jared Max with the story now, Jared.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX SPORTS NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We have  been seeing NFL coaches wearing the Salute to Service gear, all available  for purchase at NFLShop.com.  Last night in Santa Clara, California, U.S.  Navy performed a flyover above Levi's Stadium.  Before the 49ers took on  the New York Giants, 49er's tightened George Kittle made sure to thank  every service member on the field last night.  Kittle amongst several  minors who donated game worn jerseys to raise money for the victims of the  wildfires.  Players, coaches and cheerleaders from Paradise High School  most now homeless from the fires, guests of the 49ers last night on the  field for the anthem.  </p><p>Before the Niners gave away 20-10 lead.  Giants' Q.B. Eli Manning tells his  critics I still got it.  Fourth quarter comeback, his first such win in two  years.  Odell Beckham Jr. dances the Carlton and Sterling Shepard with  catch the game winning score 27-23, Giants beat the Niners.  </p><p>Brooklyn Nets player Caris LeVert suffered a serious leg injury last night.   LeVert collided with Minnesota's Jeff Teague and came down hard on his leg.   He had to be carted off the court on a stretcher, hospitalized, no word on  the severity of this gruesome looking basketball injury.  </p><p>Golden State Warriors have a new plan, to allow around 200 more fans at its  home games.  The Warriors are selling monthly passes for fans to attend  games at Oracle Arena but -- but it's a really big but, the fans cannot  even see the court.  They can watch the game on T.V.  They can hear the  crowd roar.  And pay arena prices for booze and food and it only costs $100  a month.  Imagine that, Maria, you're paying $100 a month to get into the  arena to do what you can do at home, watch on T.V., minus the traffic.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.  I think they just want to be there for the  excitement of it but you can't see a darn thing.  Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX:  Exactly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Catch Jared sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on  radio Sirius XM 115.</p><p>Quick break and then Washington and your wallet, how Democrats' control of  the House may impact your pocketbook.  That's next right here.  Congressman  Steve Scalise is with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're back for business, the House and the  Senate returning to Washington today for what will be an intense start to  the lame duck session.  Joining us right now is National Taxpayers Union  senior fellow and Center for a Free Economy board member Mattie Duppler.   Mattie, good to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>MATTTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION:  Yes, good  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we want to get a sense of what you believe can happen  between now and January, this next seven weeks, can the current Congress  get anything done knowing that they're going to have new pressures come  January with the House leadership?  </p><p>Bbb Maria, that is the perfect question to be asking.  Right now there's  been a lot of attention on what Democrats will do when they finally control  the House Chamber coming in in January.  But you're right, there are  several weeks of work still to be done.  </p><p>I'm watching a couple of different things here.  One is what happens on the  next betting decision, on December 7th parts of the government funding will  expire.  And that means Democrats have a choice to make.  Do they want to  be party that shows they can govern or will they take their heels in and  start to make demands on spending bills?  It really depends on who you're  listening to.  If you're trying to anticipate what Democrats will do, you  heard Chuck Schumer earlier this week talk about how he may want to load up  that spending bill with language that includes something to do with  investigations of the president.  That of course would set a signal that  Democrats are not willing to govern, do not have any interest in getting  things done.  And I think will make things very difficult in the New Year.  </p><p>So, we're have to see -- we'll have to see what happens with House  leadership.  If Nancy Pelosi decides that that is not the path she wants to  take, there could be an opportunity for bipartisan agreement on a spending  bill.  Typically in a lame duck session taxpayers do not benifit from  decisions that are made on spending bills there.  And Nancy Pelosi,  remember, when she was speaker, she was the one who governed probably some  of the biggest omnibus spending bills in the past.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And we had the majority leader Kevin McCarthy on  this weekend.  And he said that there are two appropriations bills that  they're going to get to.  Of course, one of the big issues at stake is the  Republican tax cut plan, 2.0.  McCarthy joined me on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" along with Democratic representative David Cicilline who want to  have the number four spot in Democratic leadership in the new Congress.   They have both different views on what they're expecting to happen.  Watch  this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been working on Tax Cuts 2.0.  Does that go away at this  point given the fact that not one Democrat voted for you -- first tax cut  plan?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't believe so.  Because it's already passed the House.  We  still have a number of weeks and session that's over in the Senate.  We  will continue to fight for it.  Because Maria, it is the right principle.   It is the right policy.  And that should overcome politics.  We should put  people before politics and I'll be excited to see the day that the  Democrats want to join us with that.  </p><p>CICILLINE:  The fact is that tax cut gave 83 percent of that tax cut to the  top one percent, to the richest people in this country and now the  Republicans are proposing we pay for that by cutting Medicare and Social  Security.  We can't do that.  We've got to protect Social Security and  Medicare.  We need a tax cut for middle class families not 83 percent of it  going to the top one percent, richest people in this country and the most  powerful corporations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I've got a prospect on that because 80 percent of the tax  cut plan did not go to the top one percent as you know, Congressman.  The  tax cut plan lowered all income levels and they doubled the standard  deduction.  So, that talking point -- </p><p>CICILLINE:  Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it is true.</p><p>CICILLINE:  And Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe you get there because the corporate rate was cut.  Are  you saying you want to have corporate -- </p><p>CICILLINE:  Thad's right -- that's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you want the corporate rate at 35 percent?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  Well, so, you acknowledge it's right.  83 percent does go to  the top one percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, do you want to raise the corporate tax rate?  Is  that what you're saying?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  Well, I don't -- what I say, we have to do is we have to be  responsible about that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you want to keep with this talking  point that is inaccurate.  That's fine.  You can do as you will.  </p><p>CICILLINE:  No, it's the fact, it's not inaccurate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do you -- the question is what do you going to do on taxes?   Are you looking to raise taxes, are you looking to reverse the economic  policies of this president?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  No, what I think we need to do is give a real tax cut to  working families, to middle class families, that's permanent and long- standing.  Not giving 82 percent (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That sounds like -- that sounds like what's being worked on  right now, Tax Cuts 2.0.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we know the facts on taxes, Mattie.  Mitch  Roschelle, you're here.  You responded and reacted to that interview.  You  and I were e-mailing each other.  Give us the facts on who pays the taxes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I also screamed at the television set on Sunday, just to be  clear.  But the top 10 percent of taxpayers in this country, and that's  those Households earning over $133,000 pay 70 percent of the tax.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Bottom line.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.  So, and that was based upon the last time the tax  foundation did this.  So the fact of the matter is, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just lies.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- it's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mattie, is  that -- are we going to just have bluster for the  next two years, lots of lies and inaccuracies and get nothing done, what do  you think?  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, we will see.  Look, (INAUDIBLE) just called in the Arizona  for the Kyrsten Sinema.  She is one of the only Democrats who voted to  extend those tax cuts.  Those Democrats who wants to see those tax cuts  made permanent.  We'll see if Democrats continue to push back on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and not one of them voted for the tax cut plan in general.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mattie, thank you so much.  Mattie Duppler there.  Still ahead,  divided in half, the details on Amazon's plans to split its second  headquarters, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   It is a busy morning.  It is Tuesday, November 13th.  Your top stories  right now 8:00 a.m. on button on the East Coast.  Markets are set to  rebound this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a modest gain at  the start of trading.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial average up 130 points right now, one-half of one  percent.  The S&amp;P is up two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ with a 53- point rally this morning up three quarters of a percent.  A much different  day than yesterday, where we saw serious broad-based sell-off on Wall  Street.  Apple and Goldman dragged the markets lower.  The Dow was down 600  plus points.  That was 2-1/3 percent.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 sliding nearly two percent on the session.  And at the close,  the NASDAQ was the worst performer.  It was down nearly three percent on  the session as Apple and other technology stocks really took the NASDAQ  down sharply at the close.  Take a look at global markets this morning on  the heels of the strength you're seeing on Wall Street this morning.   European markets following suit.</p><p>The FT-100 is up a fraction, the CAC Quarante in Paris us a half of a  percent, 21 points higher and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  90  points higher in Germany.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances there,  take a look.  Worst performer was Japan, the Nikkei average down better  than two percent.</p><p>Well, the picks are in.  Amazon will soon call Long Island City York and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the decision to split its  headquarters, the second headquarters.  The announcement is expected as  early as today.  That would be the official announcement but we know this  is coming up one percent on Amazon this morning in terms of the stock.</p><p>Meanwhile, let's go to California where raging wildfires are continuing  this morning.  The infernos burning a path of devastation.  The death toll  up to nearly 50 people right now between these massive fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand that makes this the deadliest fire in the  history of United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are going to take you live to Southern California to get the  very latest there.  Massive devastation.  New questions this morning for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  important 737 jet.  That's the same model that was involved in the deadly  crash in Indonesia last month.  I'm going to be speaking with the Chairman  and CEPO Dennis Muilenburg this morning and he is here in studio in a Fox  Business Exclusive.</p><p>He will join me at 8:30 a.m. Eastern to answer these questions as well as  to tell us about the backdrop for his business today.  Also joining the  conversation this morning, House Majority Whip and Louisiana Congressman  Steve Scalise as Congress gets back to work this morning.  Also this  morning joining me is CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Lindsey,  good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Lindsey, we were talking earlier about the markets and about  that sell-off yesterday.  We just came off of the quarter where we saw  profit growth up 29 percent year-over-year.  So why are markets so nervous?</p><p>BELL:  We haven't seen growth that great since before 2000.  So that is a  very impressive number.  It's the third quarter of over 20 percent earnings  growth.  And that is largely due to the tax reform package that we got  earlier this year and fiscal stimulus.  But the problem now is that fiscal  stimulus is peaking, monetary policy is tightening.  The Fed is running off  its balance sheet here.</p><p>And the question is where do we go with growth from here?  There is a lot  of uncertainty still out there on trade and to me, between trade and the  Fed, those are the two biggest things as I look to 2019 to determine where  growth -- the growth trajectory will be going.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, we saw some of the big tech names come down a lot  yesterday, Apple down five percent which is a serious number for Apple.  Is  the worry about growth largely in some of these high flyers like in Apple,  or are we just talking about economic growth going from 4.2 percent in the  second quarter, 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter to something very  different in 2019.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I think it's more about economic growth.  The tech sector is  being weighed on by the trade disputes obviously and then also I think that  with interest rates rising the evaluations that we've seen in some of that  really had investors turn a little more skittish.  It's been dragging the  market down but as we look to 2019, look, if we get 2-1/2 to -- to 2.9  percent GDP, that's really solid.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And really much better than what we saw the prior 10 years.  </p><p>BELL:  Exactly.  In a slowdown in growth from the four percent that we saw  in the last quarter could help you elongate this bull market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sounds like you think things went overdone yesterday on the  downside.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And I just think volatility is here to stay for a while but we  are optimistic, we have 3100 price targets for the next 12 months in the  S&amp;P 500.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  3100 and it is now at 2726 on the standard &amp; poor's.  Lindsey,  thank you.  Great insights always from you.  I'm going to turn now back to  the Capitol Hill.  Congress is back in session today for its final two  month stretch, spending immigration and the fate of the Mueller probe  expected to dominate the debate.  Joining me right now is the House  Majority Whip, author of the new book, Back in the Game, Steve Scalise.</p><p>And we are really happy you are back in the game, Congressman.  It's good  to see you.  </p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  Maria, great to be back  with you.  Great to be back in the game.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations on the book.  You know, I  was so happy when I saw the book because I thought I'm really happy he is  writing about this incident.  The whole country was just so worried about  you after that shooting at the baseball -- at the baseball course.  So  we'll get to that in a moment.  But you just heard Lindsey Graham talking  about the economy.</p><p>Are you expecting growth to slow?  You just had this landmark tax cut  reform that you put in place earlier this year and now people are worried  that the economy is going to slow down. </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, you know, we were seeing so much economic growth and it was  working the way that we intended.  When you -- when you see tax cuts for  every single income group and of course lower to middle income people are  the ones who benefited the most.  And now with Nancy Pelosi being expected  to be sworn in as Speaker in January, it does concern people that they want  to go backward.</p><p>They want to raise taxes again, go to like kind of big government,  government-controlled healthcare.  All the things that Pelosi did when she  was speaker before.  So, you know, it is definitely concerned people and  slowed down the growth.  Let's see what happens but we're going to be  battling that too.  We're not going to -- we're not going to let this  country go back to those days, the 10 years of slow economic growth less  than two percent growth for eight straight years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know we're waiting on couple of situations in Florida this  morning but it looks like Republicans will keep the majority in the Senate  based on what we're seeing.  </p><p>SCALISE:  And actually grew their number in the Senate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And grew their numbers but I'm talking about these, you know,  questions in Florida and -- but yes, growing the numbers in the Senate.  So  should that make us feel that the Democrats being in the House majority now  will not be subject to stopping the President's economic agenda?  I mean,  what does this mean in terms of the House leadership taking the majority?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, I think the most important thing that you don't see us go  backwards.  And, you know, even if Nancy PelosI's agenda which will be to  try to grow government, to try to raise taxes, higher, they're not going to  be successful ultimately because the bill would have to be signed by the  President.  But what it does mean is the things that we were going to do  tax cuts 2.0, the work that Chairman Brady and his committee were already  engaged in to try to make those tax cuts permanent.</p><p>To build on the growth we're seeing in our economy.  It's going to be very  difficult to get those things accomplished once Nancy Pelosi is speaker for  at least two-year period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, do you think -- I was with David Cicilline, Democratic  Congressman who0 wants to get into leadership, the leadership race is  obviously happening this week, and he said he doesn't like the corporate  rate where it is.  Do you think there's any chance that he would be  successful in raising the corporate rate?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, I saw that interview and you pressed him I think  appropriately because ultimately he didn't want to say it but you can tell  what he was trying to imply was he wants to raise the corporate rate and  it's OK if he tries to do that which he will not be successful by the way.   But if he tried to, what does he going to do with those millions of jobs  that we're bringing back to America because we lowered the corporate rate  to be competitive.</p><p>America lost its competitive edge and everybody acknowledged that.  It  wasn't a partisan issue.  And so when we made our country competitive  again, we're seeing the benefits of it by millions of new jobs being  created for families who want to get in the work force.  Why would he want  to take that away, we're not going to let it happen but it shows you they  do want to raise those rates even higher.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They want to raise rates and they want to have investigations  around President Trump.  You've got six weeks or seven weeks before the end  of the year.  What can you get done in this next seven weeks?  I know you  have spending bills, appropriation bills that need to be tended to.  Tell  us what you're expecting in terms of success this year.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Maria, there are a few important bills that are right up front  and center that we have to deal with the funding of the Department of  Homeland Security which is critically important to keeping America safe.   And of course the big fight, there is going to be overfunding the wall.  In  the House we've been moving forward to try to give the President the $5  billion that he's requested to start fully building out the wall.</p><p>There is some money he has to start building about 100 miles of wall.  We  want to go a lot further, you know, that's going to be a battle we have.   The other big battle is going to be over the farm bill.  And Maria, Farm  Bill Policy expired a few weeks ago and the big fight has been over work  requirements.  You know, here you've got this great robust economy where  there are more job openings and people looking for work.</p><p>And yet we put a provision in the House that says, if there is a job out  there in your able body, you ought to be able to go and look for work  instead of getting taxpayer funded welfare benefits and the Democrats  oppose that, so we have a big impasse over that.  And imagine, at a time  when people are looking for work, the Federal government is paying people  not to work and we said, look, if there is a job out there for you, you  have to go take it or else stop getting taxpayer money.</p><p>And we'll even pay you to train you to work if there's not -- if you don't  have the proper training and that's what they're opposing right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  All right.  Are there any plans to cut  spending?  The idea of debt and deficits in our face and getting more  expensive just to hold the debt.  This conversation is getting louder.   What are the plans in terms of spending cuts and is it possible that the  Congress and the President make a mistake of looking for something to come  together with the Democrats choosing infrastructure and then creating even  more debt by spending $2 trillion on an infrastructure package.</p><p>SCALISE:  All right.  That is continuing to be a concern.  One of the  reason we didn't get an infrastructure package is because we couldn't get  an agreement over how to pay for it.  We weren't in this Republican-led  House, we weren't going to pass a bill that was just going to add to the  deficit.  One of the things we had in our healthcare bill that passed the  House had protections for people with preexisting conditions.</p><p>But a reforming Medicaid, one of the most broken forms of healthcare by  block granting it to the states, letting the states actually be innovative  and coming up with better ways to run healthcare for lower income people.   It's saved over $800 billion just through the innovation.  You didn't have  a reduction in money, it just actually allowed states to be more flexible  with the money.</p><p>That saved $800 billion.  It failed by one voted in the Senate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SCALISE:  Huge disappointments there in a lot of fronts but it would have  made healthcare more affordable, protected people of preexisting conditions  and transformed Medicaid into a much better program at those kind of  savings.  That was what's at stake in this election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  We all remember the infamous thumbs down on the Senate.   Let me -- let me ask you about the preexisting conditions because that's  another talking point on the left that the Republicans do not want to  protect preexisting conditions.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Yes.  It was a false claim.  In fact they spent millions of  dollars promoting that false claim.  And I talked to members and so many of  these swing districts and they said, look, they're lying about this,  they're spending two, $3 million in T.V. ads lying about it.  And so they  had to go on T.V. and spend -- they didn't have two million, they might had  a million and half to say that it wasn't true.</p><p>And so people got confused, they weren't sure what was the case.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCALISE:  But our bill -- our bill actually protected people with  preexisting conditions.  It's in the bill, they knew it, they didn't care,  they just said it anyway.  Look, you know, they're going to get the  majority.  I think it's going to be a short-lived majority but at the same  time a lot of those candidates who won said they're going to be pro-life  and pro-gun and they're going to vote against Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Well, their very first vote as a member of Congress in January is going to  be for Nancy Pelosi as speaker.  You know, which side are they going to  choose, the -- you know, the people back home that they promised one thing  to or what's going to happen up in D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've got your leadership races this week, tomorrow night,  the vote tell us what you're feeling in terms of how things stack up.  Are  you expecting that Kevin McCarthy will be the Minority Leader and you will  tell us about the role that you're expecting.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Yes.  I think Kevin will get the votes and he will be the  minority leader.  I'm running for the minority whip position and feel real  confident and the votes that we have and, you know, we'll go forward but at  the same time it's going to be interesting to see which route they go, the  Democrats do when they're in power.  They're going to just be about  harassing the President, subpoenas and even impeachment.</p><p>That's not what the American people wanted.  You know, ultimately they're  going to have to -- they're going to have to decide which route they go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Just to change the conversation, so that's the  conversation for the next two years as opposed to what you've been able to  do in terms of legislation. </p><p>SCALISE:  And we've got to be I think a lot better at articulating the  things we stand for as conservatives.  That's one thing that I think we  didn't do well.  We've got to do a lot better at and we're going to get  there but I think there's going to be a sharp contrast now because you're  going to see the approach that Nancy Pelosi would take as speaker.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm glad you mentioned -- a lot of people mentioned the  messaging on the Republican side.  Let's talk about your book Back in the  Game, what role did your recovery have in writing this book?  Tell us why  you wrote the book.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, you know, as you talked about earlier, there were so many  people that came together to help me, you know, not only to save my life in  those first few hours after the shooting, but to help me get back in the  game and essence to be able to learn how to walk again.  Just to learn how  to do basic things that I couldn't do in those first few weeks after the  shooting.</p><p>And, you know, I had a lot of -- a lot of support and prayers by the people  like you were praying, people all over the country were praying and there  were so many miracles that we chronicle in this book and the book we talked  about.  What my wife Jennifer and I talk about these little miracles that  happened along the way.  And we also talked about the people who did so  many heroic things every step of the way to save not only myself but all  the other people that were out there that day.</p><p>And then ultimately to help me through the recovery process.  And it really  is an inspirational book because it could have been a lot different in how  it ended.  You know, so many cases like this don't end the way it did.   This actually has a happy ending and thanks to god, to miracles, and to the  support and prayers of so many people.  We chronicled it all in the book.   Back in the Game and I'm really happy with how it came out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were so worried.  Everybody was worried about you, we -- I  mean, it was so serious.  Did it change the way you look at things?  Did it  change the way you approach your job?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Maria, if anything, it sharpened my focus on the things that  matter in life and I think I removed a lot of clutter in life.  You know,  all of us do things every day that some that we want to do, some that you  just kind of do because it's a routine and you focus on what's really  important, my family, my faith, you know, the work that I do, I love my  job.  You know, and it illuminated the things that aren't as important and  much happier today. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.  Thank you for your leadership.   So happy you're here.</p><p>SCALISE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Steve Scalise.  Check out the book back in the  game.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeting this on trade.   France makes excellent wine but so does the U.S.  The problem is that  France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France and  charges big tariffs while doing so.  Whereas the U.S. makes it easy for  French wines and charges very small tariffs.  It's not fair.  Must change.   The President obviously touting European leaders on trade this morning.</p><p>Switching gears.  We want to bring you to California and show you this  devastation which is just unreal.  We have two wildfires whipping across  the state. The campfire is the northern part, now it is the deadliest fire  in the state's history.  And the Woolsey fire taking a major toll on  Southern California.  Fox News' Jonathan Hunt is in Malibu this morning.   Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.  Thousands of  families remain evacuated from this area of Southern California where the  Woolsey fire has hit so hard.  That likely to be out of Malibu and other  areas for I would say at least another 24 hours.  And take a look at what  hundreds of families are going to come back to find when they are  eventually let in.</p><p>Everything they have built over their lives, everything they've worked for  completely and utterly destroyed.  It is a similar story up north -- the  camp fire near Chico, California.  Now as you mentioned becoming officially  the deadliest in state history.  42 people have been killed in that fire.   More than 100 still remain unaccounted for and the entire town of Paradise  is basically wiped out.  Listen here to the fire chief.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID HAWKS, DIVISION CHIEF, CAL FIRE-BUTTE COUNTY:  It's just absolutely  heartbreaking to drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.   My family lost their home in the fire, my parents did, my grandmother did.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HUNT:  President Trump tweeted last night that he has now approved and  expedited major disaster declaration for California.  That tweet coming in  the wake of tweets over the weekend, in which he was critical of  California's forest management.  That sparked a firestorm of criticism.   He's now changing his tune paying tribute to the heroic firefighters who  are still on the frontlines, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jonathan.  Thanks very much.  We will be watching.   Jonathan Hunt in Malibu this morning.  Coming up.  Concerns in the sky.  A  new report says Boeing withheld information on its 737 plane.  The same  model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash last month.  I'll be speaking  exclusively with the chairman and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg about  that in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>As we take a break, we are watching the price of oil this morning.  And as  you can see, it is down 1-1/4 percent below 60 right now.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump continuing to tweet this morning.  Here's what  he just posted.  The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low  approval rating in France, that's 26 percent.  And an unemployment rate of  almost 10 percent.  He was just trying to get on to another subject, by the  way, there is no country more nationalist than France.  Very proud people  and rightfully so.  Make France Great Again.  The President writes this  morning.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Vive la, France.  Sorry.  I  just want to quickly say we have our pickup trucks, everyone.  We have our  tariffs on pickup truck imports.  They have their protections for one.   Let's move along and get along. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  All right.  Well, stocks getting yesterday on  weakness from technology meanwhile especially Apple.  The NASDAQ was down  almost three percent.  This morning we are looking at a rebound a bit, the  Dow industrials are up 77, the S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up 39  points after that sharp sell-off yesterday.  Joining us right now Wells  Fargo Investment Institute Head, global market strategists, Paul  Christopher. </p><p>Paul, good to see you.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when you come in today after since a rough day at the office  yesterday where the markets were down 600 points on the Dow.  What do you  do?  Are you a buyer or a seller here?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We're a buyer.  Look, it's -- the markets, it's still  worried about growth, it's trying to put in a bottom.  You don't have to  put in all the chips at once here but people have a lot of cash.  Our  clients held a lot of cash and we would like for them to put in a little  bit here at a time.  We think this is the best buying opportunity in U.S.  large caps since the November 2016 election.</p><p>So don't have to put it all in at once.  We're still looking for a bottom  but do start to take some positions especially in those growth-oriented  sectors.  </p><p>BELL:  So Paul, does that mean you take some positions in the tech, maybe  some of the FAANG names that have been beaten up or maybe are in bear  market territory right now off of their highs?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  It's a good question.  We've been market weight on  information technology.  We still think you should be market weight but  listen if you haven't had a chance to get into some of these stocks and now  you find yourself below market weight.  Again this is an opportunity to  take yourself back up to that waiting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Paul, it's Dagen McDowell.  It seems like the market gets really  shaken every time that 10-year yield gets to about only 3-1/4 percent.   Realistically how high a yield, a longer term interest rate can stocks  handle given a lot of names that are still -- that still look really  overvalued?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We think that bond yields, the 10-year for instance  will go a little bit higher over the next 12 months and that we think that  stocks will still be OK with that.  The problem is we're just getting this  transition period where we've gone from clearly low growth and low interest  rates to a little bit faster growth and somewhat higher interest rates and  that sort of a move always wrong foots markets until investors can  determine that yes earnings can continue to hit higher levels.</p><p>And it's -- those earnings ultimately over the long run that will be --  that will match the S&amp;P on the way up we think, you know, percentage for  percentage.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Paul, great to see you.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paul Christopher joining us.  Well Fargo.  New questions for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  737 model.  This is the same model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash  last week.  We will speak with Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg next,  exclusive coming up right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast.  Futures are indicating  a gain at the start of trading this morning.  Dow Industrials expected to  be up 69 points, that is about a quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 is up  almost half a percent, and the NASDAQ with a 39-point gain, up two-thirds  of one percent.  This, after a sharp sell-off yesterday where the Dow lost  two percent and the NASDAQ lost almost three percent.</p><p>European markets were mixed, the FT-100 is down a fraction, as you can see,  but the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are both positive.  Although off of  the highest levels of the morning, for sure.  Overnight in Asia, mixed  performances, take a look, the worst performer was Japan overnight in Asia.   The Nikkei Average was down on the session about two percent, as you can  see there.  </p><p>Oil is extending its losing streak this morning.  Crude oil under pressure  again now 11 days in a row lower, down 1-1/3 percent, below $60.00 a  barrel.  What is the price of oil selling off tell us about the global  economy?  We want to look at that, coming up.  </p><p>All of those stories coming up this morning, but first, our top story this  half an hour, new questions this morning for Boeing, The Wall Street  journal is reporting that Boeing withheld information on its 737 model,  according to safety experts and others.  That is the same model involved in  the deadly Lion aircrash in Indonesia last month.  And joining me right now  to discuss that and a lot more in this Fox Business exclusive is the  Chairman, President, and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg.  Dennis, it's  good to see you this morning.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BOEING:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the story in The Journal obviously is very concerning.   What can you tell us in terms of what was told to the pilots and the  airlines about any new equipment in that 737?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, Maria, first of all, I think it's important that we all  express our sympathies for the loss of Lion Air Flight 610 and certainly,  our thoughts go with the families that have been affected.  We've been very  engaged with the investigative authorities throughout and providing all of  the information necessary to make sure we do a full assessment of the  situation.  And the bottom line here is the 737 max is safe, and safety is  a core value for us at Boeing, it always has been, and we ensure that our  airplanes are safe.  In fact, this airplane went through thousands of hours  of tests and evaluation, certification, working with the pilots, and we've  been very transparent on providing information and being fully cooperative  on the investigative activity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what happened?  Apparently, there were 10 computer -- the  computers about the angle of the nose were not accurate and then the plane  went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you have a sense of what went wrong?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, as the Indonesian authorities have pointed out initially,  there were some indications of inaccurate angle attack signal that was  being sent to the airplane, and of course, our airplane has the ability to  handle that, and we have procedures in place.  And we've already issued a  couple of additional bulletins to our operators and pilots around the world  that point them back to existing flight procedures to handle that kind of  condition.  So again, we're going to continue to support the investigation  as it proceeds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And was there -- I mean, one of the Boeing officials quoted in  The Journal today, one high-ranking Boeing official said that the company  had decided against disclosing more details to cockpit cruise due to  concerns about inundating average pilots with too much information.  Was  that a decision now that you regret?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Now, again, we ensure that we provide all of information  that's needed to safely fly our airplanes.  Again, this comes as out of  thousands of hours of testing and evaluating and simulating, and providing  the information that our pilots need to operate our airplanes safely, and  we'll continue to do that.  As I said, as part of the process here, we've  already issued a couple of bulletins to pilots and operators that point  them back to existing flight procedures to handle this kind of situation.   So, we're going to continue to fully cooperate in the investigation.  I  think it's really important -- again, the bottomline here, the 737 Max is a  very safe airplane and we're very confident in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But was there a new -- well, there are new system that wasn't  disclosed to the pilots.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  No, there are new systems on the airplanes that are designed  to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane and to provide  control capability in high-angle of attack conditions, and those systems  operate properly.  And again, in certain failure modes, if there's an  inaccurate angle attack sensors feeding information to the -- to the  airplane, there's a procedure to handle that.  And so, again, as part of  the investigation process, we're going to make sure we fully understand  that.  We're going to make sure that we're providing all of the information  necessary and appropriate training, and go back to the core value here, is  that the airplane safe, we know how to fly it safely, and we're very  confident in that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was that information in terms of what to do should something  change -- was that information available to the pilots?  Did they know how  to operate it should the nose be in a different position?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.  In fact, that's part of the training manual, it's an  existing procedure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  So, the bulletin that we put out again last week and over the  weekend, pointed to that existing flight procedure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, obviously, I know that you're answering lots of  questions this morning and this week after this horrific crash, and you're  going to get more information.  What would be the timing on that?  When do  you expect to hear from the FAA on this?  </p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, this is an ongoing investigation, so it will take  whatever time is necessary to make sure it's done thoroughly.  Again, we  participate fully in these investigations, we've provided technical  assistance, we'll continue to do that until the work is complete.  It's  very important that we do this in a diligent and thorough manner.   Bottomline is we want to ensure safety in the system, and continue to have  confidence in the 737 Max.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the 737 has been a cash cow for your business, this is a  very important business.  There were some headwinds in the supply chain in  terms of the 737, which I want to ask you about.  And I know over the  recent past, you've expanded the business, you've got commercial aerospace,  you've got defense, and then you've got services.  Tell us how business is  right now, because commercial aerospace has been driving the stock  obviously for several years right now?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, aerospace is a tremendous growth business.  We look out  over the next 10 years as an $8.1 trillion marketplace.  Passenger traffic  is growing at about six to seven percent per year sustained.  The world  needs about 43,000 new commercial airplanes over the next 20 years.  A part  of that is the 737 as we've ramped up to 52 a month, this year, we're  producing at 57 a month next year.  And we have had some supply chain  challenges as you -- as you pointed out, as we've been growing.  But we are  briskly moving to a recovery.  We just announced delivery numbers for  October earlier this morning, so we delivered 43 737s in October which is  an all-time record for October, and we're continuing to March smartly to  our recovery plan, and expect to meet our year-end targets for deliveries.   This year, for the first time, we'll deliver more than 800 commercial  airplanes.  By the end of the decade here, we'll be delivering more than  900 airplanes a year.  So, you can see the tremendous growth here in  commercial airplanes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible and I know you got an incredible backlog as  well --</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which will continue that delivery calendar.  One out of four  or five planes go to China in terms of your deliveries.  Tell us about the  importance of the business in China.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, China is very important to us.  Today, about a third of  our 737s go to China, about one-quarter of our overall deliveries.  So, if  you look at that marketplace around the world, 43,000 new airplanes over  the next 20 years, about 7,000 of those are in China.  It's the fastest  growing market segment right now.  China needs that lift capability to  serve their economic growth needs, so China is very interested in the  healthy aerospace economy.  </p><p>As you know here in the U.S. as well, there's a big advantage to a healthy  aerospace ecosystem.  We have about 90 percent of our manufacturing jobs  here in the U.S. even though we export about 80 percent of what we build.   So when you look at trade deficit versus trade surplus, aerospace is the  biggest trade surplus for the U.S., about $80 billion a year.  And our  business is the biggest piece of that.  So, that a mutually-beneficial  relationship between the U.S. and China as it applies to trade and the  aerospace is very important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what happens now with this trade spat that we're having  with China then?  I mean, have you seen any backlash from the Chinese in  terms of your business, given the fact that the President is sitting there  waiting to put another 250 billion on exports from China on tariffs and  this fight between China and the U.S. intensifies?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We've been very engaged in that dialogue, as you know, this is  a very important topic to us.  We've been talking with the President and  the U.S. administration, extensively.  They're very aware of the situation  and the importance of aerospace.  We've also had a very good dialogue with  Chinese leadership and our customers in China.  And we're encouraged by the  dialogue that's going on.  </p><p>I think you've seen some recent reports that President Trump and President  Xi plan to meet around the G20 summit that's coming up.  Some productive  dialogue going on on the trade front, we think both countries are  interested in a mutually successful aerospace ecosystem.  It's good for the  economies of both countries.  And here in the U.S., it's really important  to U.S. manufacturing jobs.  We have about 13,000 companies in our supply  chain here in the U.S. that are supporting that kind of manufacturing  growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has the air supply chain changed in any way because of your  services business?  I mean, you're pursuing this more aggressive strategy,  does that mean that in time -- in terms of selling a plane to somebody or a  business, then you want to maintain that plane as well by using the  services there, but are you taking away business from the suppliers?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We're actually see this as a grow the pie business.  So,  something we can do jointly with our suppliers.  Services is our biggest  single-growth opportunity.  When you look at that $8-trillion marketplace,  it's the place where we have the biggest opportunity to further grow.  And  we're bringing capabilities like parts distribution, maintenance, and  modifications.  New software, digital solutions, training solutions for our  customers, doing that jointly with our suppliers.  </p><p>To date -- year-to-date, our services business has grown 12 percent in a  market that's growing about three percent a year.  So, it is growing,  growing strongly, and by doing this jointly with our supply chain, we can  provide better light cycle value for our customers.  And that's really the  lens we're looking through here, not only how we design and build  airplanes, but how do we provide value for our customers for post- production support.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This sounds like a natural fit.  I mean, the commercial  aerospace business has been so strong, and walk us through that for a  moment because most people don't understand the number of people who've  never been on an airplane.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The number of people who are perhaps in Asia who are wanting to  travel, this is a big opportunity for you.  So, this is also an economic  growth story.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  It is.  And, Maria, you bring up a really great point.  As I  said earlier, traffic is growing -- passenger traffic at about six to seven  percent a year completely outstripping GDP.  And some of the things that  are driving that is the upcoming middle class that for the first time ever,  is able to travel.  So, we have this unique combination of backlogs, seven  years of backlog.  And every year in Asia alone, 150 million people fly for  the first time.  Less than -- less than 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's amazing.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Less than 20 percent of the world's population has ever taken  a single flight.  So, think about the growth opportunity that's still ahead  of us, and we're feeding right into that with our design and productions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But here we have worries in the market, down 600 points  yesterday, worries from economic worries that things are going to slow  down.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where are we on that in your view?  You've got interest  rates rising obviously when a company or country buys a plane, or several  planes, they are in many parts doing it by borrowing, their borrowing costs  are going up with interest rates.  How much of a headwind will that be for  you?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We're not seeing it affect our business.  Again, we have a  much longer term view.  Today, we have a backlog of almost 5800 commercial  airplanes if you think of that in terms of production volume, it's about  seven years of backlog.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  So, this gives us the opportunity to think long term in terms  of capital investment, innovation investment.  And while we pay attention  to things like interest rates and the financial markets, it's not something  that's really affecting near-term buying behavior.  You know, today, we're  selling 737 Maxes, filling our production skyline out in 2023 and beyond.   So, we have a much longer term perspective.  Aerospace is a strong long- term growing business.  It's not -- it's no longer a cyclical business.   This is a long term sustained growth business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the competition is fierce.  I mean, airbus -- can airbus  sell to European countries and companies with no tariffs?  So, are you  disadvantaged by the tariff situation given the fact that a European  jetmaker Airbus can do it a lot cheaper?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, something we're paying close attention to.  To date, we  haven't been affected materially by the tariffs.  Things that have affected  steel and aluminum pricing.  We source 90 percent of our aluminum here in  the U.S. so it hasn't been a dramatic effect on us, but it's something  we're paying a close attention to.  The bottom line is it's a very  competitive marketplace because it's a very attractive marketplace.  Now,  we have to continue to invest, to compete.  We have to continue to invest  to innovate.  Tax reform, for example, in the U.S. has been something that  has really helped us gain a level-playing field globally so that we can  compete and win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can you grow the defense business at this point?  A lot of  worries that defense spending needs to either be capped or cut, given the  trillion-dollar deficits we're talking about every day and the debt of 21  trillion.  </p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, we see the defense budget here in the U.S. sustained, and  if you look back a couple of years when we were in the middle of  sequestration.  We feel like we're in a stronger budget position now on  both sides of the aisle.  So, we look to the U.S. defense budget to remain  strong.  But we also see growth around the world.  Today, about a third of  our defense backlog is outside the U.S.  So, again, this is a very global  business, and there's a lot of defense growth opportunities outside of the  U.S., and I think the thing that's unique about Boeing is when we think  about growth, we look across commercial defense and services.  We're really  the only aerospace company that can bring great big critical mass to all  three of those sectors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Dennis, it's great to have  you on the program.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Likewise.  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Dennis Muilenburg, ceo at Boeing.  We will  be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump just tweeting again.  He says this, \"By the  way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France  because of almost zero visibility.  I suggested driving, Secret Service  said no, too far from airport and big Paris shutdown.  Speech next day at  the American cemetery in pouring rain!  Little reported -- Fake News.\"  The  President referring to some criticism that he received from the media on  failing to go the cemetery that dual.</p><p>We want to turn to Amazon, congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  slamming Amazon's plans to partially bring (INAUDIBLE) headquarters to New  York City.  Joining me right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart  Varney.  And Stuart, there was a reason that so many cities across this  country were vying for Amazon to come to their city and set up their new  headlines.  Does she not understand business and economics?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, she does not.  I don't  think she wants to.  There's no pleasing some people, and that's the truth.   There's no pleasing a socialist.  I'll quote you exactly what she said.   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, Amazon is a-billion-dollar company.  The  idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks is  extremely concerning to residents here.  Has the company promised to hire  in the existing community?  What's the quality of jobs?  How many are  promised?  Are these jobs low wage or high wage?  Are there benefits?  Can  people collectively bargain?  There's just no satisfying a socialist.  They  see no benefit to investment, capital infusion and growth.  They don't see  it.  They simply see a big corporation.  Give me the money.  I just want  the money.  That's what it's all about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm astonished, actually.  I would have thought that when you  bring 25,000 new jobs, a couple of billion dollars to your city, it would  be universally approved, but apparently not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the first thing she does, Dagen, is she complains that  Amazon is getting tax breaks (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And she says Queens City councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer and state  Senator Gianaris have also come out against the Amazon deal while Mayor  Bill de Blasio says that this could be the single biggest economic  development deal in the history of New York City.  So, here's a word,  Amazon, find another city, I dare you.</p><p>VARNEY:  For once, I'm on Bill de Blasio's side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stuart, I know you'll have more in 10 minutes.  We'll see you  at the top of the hour, thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right  after MORNINGS WITH MARIA 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Stay with us.</p><p>But first, driving innovation, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the  journal's technology conference, featuring the CEO of Uber.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The future of technology, the Wall Street  Journal's Tech D.Live conference is underway this morning where big names  and descending on Laguna Beach, California.  Susan Li is there.  Susan,  good morning.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you, Maria.   Yes, we'll be talking all things tech here in Laguna beach.  That includes  government regulation, innovation, and future partnerships.  Now, later on,  to the program, will feature a lot of heavyweights, that includes Uber CEO,  Dara Khosrowshahi, one of the headliners.  And then, we have celebrity  attendance as well.  Gwyneth Paltrow will be holding the evening session  along with Kevin Hart, the comedian.  Last night, we heard from AT&amp;T's  Randall Stephenson who has some interesting things to say about President  Trump, about Jim Acosta, Time Warner and CNN, and we also heard from  (INAUDIBLE) of Google.  </p><p>Now, we also caught up with Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's former CEO,  billionaire, owner of the L.A. Clips.  And I think that the overarching  theme her are like going to be so far has been this -- talk about the  relationship between the White House and big tech.  And whether or not  they'll be more regulation in the future of big Silicon Valley names.  I  asked Steve Ballmer this.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT:  I don't think Microsoft has much  risk at all right now.  We certainly had ours in the past.  Amazon will  have their own set of issues.  The most important thing for anybody running  a successful tech company where there's not a clear issue.  It's just to  continue to do their job well, be responsible.  I think Amazon has done a  very good job so far.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LI:  Yes.  It was an -- a great job, Jeff Bezos has done a great job as  Steve Ballmer says.  We'll talk more later on today and we have more  interviews coming to you and coming on Fox Business from Laguna Beach.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff.  Susan, thank you.  Susan Lee joining us  there in Laguna.  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Back  In a Minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey  Bell.</p><p>BELL:  Look, the markets might be going well, but the bedrock of the  country, the consumer is strong and we saw that in Home Depot's numbers and  we'll here about that from retailers later this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bullish (INAUDIBLE) Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think the markets just need to calm down.  You know,  sometimes good news is bad news, and bad news is good news.  Right now, the  market just needs to calm down, calm down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, it's the stability.  Look long term, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And New York City, I'm going to tweet this.  I think the  Governor of the New York -- of New York state and the major of New York  City, maybe need to do a conference call with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to  explain what 25,000 jobs mean in terms of the tax revenue, and how that  actually helps fix the New York City subways.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's a reason that every city in the country wanted the  Amazon headquarters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  They all wanted it.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thank  you so much, and we'll see you in a few minutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday, November 13th, your top stories  right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets looking to rebound this morning after a serious selloff yesterday.   Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 95 points.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The market up about a third of a percent on the Dow, half a percent higher  on the S&amp;P, and about three quarters and percent higher on the NASDAQ with  a 49-point move this morning higher for NASDAQ.  </p><p>This after broad-based selloff yesterday for stock prices, Apple and  Goldman Sachs dragging down the Dow Industrials by better than 600 points  at the close.  </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly two percent on the session.  As you can see,  the NASDAQ the worst performer, down nearly three percent.  Apple leading  the charge in technology stocks lower yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning, also seeing a bit of a bounce.  The FT-100 is  up a fraction, 13 points higher there, 11 points higher on the CAC Quarante  in Paris, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 75, that's two-thirds of one  percent this morning.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances, as you see there.  Best performer in  China, up about one percent on the Shanghai Composite.</p><p>But the Nikkei Average in Japan down better than two percent overnight.</p><p>The picks are in, Amazon will soon call Long Island City, New York, and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the company's HQ2 selection  with the announcement coming as early as today.  </p><p>Amazon shares are up this morning, three quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Raging wildfires in California.  This infernos -- the infernos are burning  a path of devastation.  The death toll now rising to nearly 50 people  between these massive fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KORY HONEA, SHERIFF, BUTTE COUNTY:  I understand that makes this the  deadliest fire in the history of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest and we will take you live to California  this morning.</p><p>There are new questions facing Boeing this morning.  A new report says the  jet-maker withheld information on the 737, the same model involved in the  deadly Indonesia crash last month.  </p><p>Boeing Chairman and CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, will join me in a Fox Business  exclusive this morning.  Stay with us for that exclusive coming up at 8:30  a.m. Eastern this morning.</p><p>Plus Tide detergent unveils new packaging, and it is going viral.  The  controversy coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner Mitch  Roschelle, and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, with us this  morning.  Good to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Cannot wait for that Boeing  interview.  That'll be fantastic.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that'll be good, because this is -- there are new  questions this morning, but at the same time, Boeing has been operating on  fire. </p><p>I mean, this company is seeing commercial airline business up strongly, the  defense business up strongly, and the stock has held up well.  </p><p>Of course, they are trading down in the month of October.  Like the other  defense contractors, they had a tough month. </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  It'll also be interesting because there are  some trade considerations with a company like Boeing.  Their rival Airbus  in Europe, so it'll be interesting to see what he has to say about that as  well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  And China is the number one market  for the business in terms of new planes and aerospace business.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  We are at tend of earning season, which Lindsey will get  into.  Ninety percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, but we've got  retailers this week.  </p><p>Home Depot just came out with numbers beating on revenue and earnings per  share.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The numbers are on the screen right now.  The estimates call  for $2.26 a share.  The company is reporting earnings of $2.51 on revenue  of -- better than the estimate, which was 26.26 billion and here is the  renew estimate coming in better than expected at 23.6 billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Overall S&amp;P 500 earnings are up almost 29 percent from a  year ago.  The expectation going into the quarter was 22 percent, so it was  a terrific quarter on earnings.  </p><p>A lot misses on revenue, 40 percent of companies missing on revenue  expectations.  This was a beat.  We get Walmart later this week and some  other big retailers like a Macy's, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting to see this market performance, Lindsey, in  the face of 29 percent profit growth year over year.  </p><p>BELL:  I know.  And I think it's still like we always talk about, it's all  about the outlook.  The outlook was a little bit weaker than expected for  many companies as we looked forward to the fourth quarter and into 2019.  </p><p>There are rising raw material costs, the strong dollar certainly impacting,  but you and I was -- we're talking about that in the green room.  </p><p>And so expectations for growth in 2019 have been coming down.  All through  this year, we're looking for 10 percent earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p>Now we're at about eight and a half percent, which is still a very, very  good number, but there are still a lot of uncertainties out there with what  the fed's going to do, what's going to happen with trade, and then where is  the dollar going.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  What I -- what I like about the home improvement industry is  these are discretionary spends.  </p><p>BELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And it tells you something about the consumer, when they're  discretionarily spending on things.  You don't have to fix up your home,  you don't have to do home improvement, and when you do it, that's when the  customer feels strong.  </p><p>So, that may give us an indication of what the rest of the retail season  looks like.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's also a really important focus on the consumer.  </p><p>This week, we will hear -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- as you said, from Walmart and Macy's tomorrow, but Home  Depot numbers' better than expected.  </p><p>As we worry about a growth slowdown, where is the consumer in that growth  slowdown?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, I mean you know what, I think the consumer remains  confident and higher interest rates aren't scaring them away from doing  home improvements.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is good because the home sales this year have been in kind  of a slow slide for much of -- much of the year in terms of declines in  home sales in consecutive months.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  Which is why Home Depot's stock hasn't done so well this year.   It's down about five percent year to date.  </p><p>These numbers look to be pretty strong, and we'll have to get into the  details.  But, you know, the concern is home sales have been weak, interest  rates are rising, are investors going -- are peep -- are consumers going to  invest in their homes and fixing them up?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you look at a market, like we saw yesterday, where Apple  was really the problem.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Down sharply.  And you wonder if that's indicator of slowdown.   People are worried about unit sales, worried about a slowdown in Apple.</p><p>This is the most important product that identifies really what we're  talking about in terms of consumer spending.  </p><p>What did you think about the market selloff yesterday?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that a lot of this is still a hangover from Apple  suddenly announcing that it's not going break out its unit sales because it  does look like they're trying to hide something, quite frankly.</p><p>And, you know, this was -- they act like that breaking out the unit sales  of these products isn't important today.  Well -- but -- you know, why was  it important then years ago when you -- when you launched the iPhone?</p><p>That's number one.  I'll just point out that stock is still up almost 15  percent year to date.</p><p>So it was roughly immune to what happened to, say, in Amazon in the month  of October when Amazon went into a full-blown bear market in that stock.  </p><p>Apple is still up, it's, you know, pretty -- seeing a pretty sharp decline  in the -- so far in November.  </p><p>But, again, still double-digit gain year to date.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's really indicative of the story overall, of the worry,  the story of this market.  We are worried about growth, worried that things  will turn down and you see a company like Apple and Home Depot really  indicative of the consumer.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And I think yesterday's action in Apple really did spook  especially tech investors because exactly to your point, Amazon's in bear- market territory.  Apple has been the value in the tech sector.  And it's  been able to hold up and support the group.  </p><p>And so if growth is slowing there, we -- do we have a bigger problem  overall?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was on a report about suppliers.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Two -- </p><p>BELL:  Two suppliers.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's another thing, the suppliers made guidance  warnings and, you know, you think thank back to what Dan Niles said a  couple of weeks ago with the inventory build-up.  </p><p>I mean he mentioned that Apple had inventories up 89 percent, quarter of a  quarter -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in the second quarter and that was an issue because if  you've got an economic slowdown and you've got people pulling back in terms  of spending, well, what are they going to do?</p><p>First, they're going to buy the inventory that they have.  Can they  actually get rid of all of that inventory?  </p><p>And if you see China slowing down, is China -- are the Chinese going to buy  a phone for a thousand dollars?  So, that's why Apple is such an important  indicator in terms of what's going on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will argue also that yesterday was kind of a delayed reaction  to that move-up in long-term interest rates last week where you saw the 10- year.  Every time -- and we've had this happen several times in the last  month or so.</p><p>Every time that 10-year treasury yield gets closer to 3.25 percent, because  it hit a new -- it was like a seven and a half year-high last week, that  rattles investors and the bond market was closed yesterday.  </p><p>But I think that that is definitely playing into, you know what, if longer- term interest rates are at three and a quarter, three and a half, you know,  those earnings, I need to pay a little bit less for those earnings way,  way, way out in the future on these big-growth companies.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, and that's a huge impact on the tech sector.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BELL:  Which is supposed to have the best earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let -- </p><p>BELL:  It has had the best growth in the past two years. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's zero in on this stock market and really what's going on  this morning.  Joining the conversation, we got the Chairman, President,  and CEO of Boeing here in studio this morning, Dennis Muilenburg.  </p><p>My special guest in the fact of this new report from the Journal on its  737.  </p><p>Louisiana Congressman and current House Majority Whip, Steve Scalise, joins  us with his reaction to the midterm elections and what can get done.</p><p>Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane  is with us this morning, along with the CEO of the Mayo Clinic, Dr. John  Noseworthy back with us as well.  </p><p>And Florida Congressman-elect, former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel  Michael Waltz, joining us as well.  A lot to talk about.  Big guest lineup  today, don't miss a moment of it.  </p><p>And of course we are watching markets this morning after that major selloff  yesterday driven by weakness in technology and Apple in familiar.  </p><p>Joining us now is Fort Pitt Capital Group Partner, Vice President, as well  as Senior Portfolio Manager, Kim Forrest.  Kim, good to see you.  Thanks  very much for joining us.  </p><p>Your reaction to the -- </p><p>KIM FORREST, VICE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FORT PITT CAPITAL  GROUP:  Thanks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the market selloff yesterday and what to do  now?</p><p>FORREST:  Sure.  Well, I think you guys covered it ably, you know.  All the  factors that you cited are just exactly in line with what I saw.  </p><p>The raise in interest rates, you know, made these higher price stocks a  little less desirable.  </p><p>I do think that Apple may not be something that the -- that is a great  thing about -- a great -- I don't know, point of data about how consumers  are spending because you did get those great Home Depot numbers.  </p><p>And I think Apple's its own little issue.  But that being beside that, I  think today is a tremendous opportunity if you have long-enough time  horizon -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FORREST:  -- to really look and see stocks that you may want to buy right  now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting you say Apple could have its own  issue.  I mentioned Dan Niles has been covering this company for years.  </p><p>FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  AlphaOne Capital Partners, he almost predicted this trouble for  Apple and the technology sector a month ago.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?</p><p>DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  I think you  absolutely are, and this is exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of  inventory out there.  </p><p>So, if you pick the biggest company in the world, Apple, for example, they  have 89 percent inventory growth year over year in the June quarter that  they reported.  Their revenues were up 17 percent.  </p><p>Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p>Look at last year, they had one phone priced above a thousand dollars.   This holiday season, they have three phones priced above them.</p><p>The average selling price, they're trying to boost it by another hundred  dollars.  </p><p>The problem is, if you look at smartphone units overall, this will be the  first year in history that smartphone units are down year over year.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kim, you might say that Apple is its own specific story, but -- </p><p>FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- doesn't it feed on itself?  I mean if you've got a lot of  inventory out there in technology and you can't sell it because things are  slowing down, that's going to trickle into other retail and other tech.</p><p>FORREST:  Maybe.  We're going to put a big maybe there because here --  here's the issue, I look at tech very differently than a lot of analysts.   We're talking about Apple, which is almost solely consumer-oriented tech.  </p><p>I am really excited about more enterprise or business-related tech because  I think as wages are starting to go up, businesses have to once again think  about how do I make my employees more productive?  </p><p>And it's not by watching Netflix, it's not by, you know, participating on  Facebook and maybe it's not by buying Apple products.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>FORREST:  But still, semiconductors underlie this whole trend of making  people more productive through software and hardware -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>FORREST:  And it's delivered on semiconductors, so that's what I'm kind of  throwing out there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>FORREST:  And I do think Apple is, you know, an issue in and of itself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  It is very high-priced products and maybe not everybody, you  know, needs to buy a new Apple phone every 18 months -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  -- like they have in the past.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about Amazon?  The Journal is reporting this morning  that the company is ready to choose New York City and Northern Virginia as  the new homes for Amazon's new headquarters.  </p><p>Kim, good or bad move on Amazon's part to split the second headquarters?   What do you think?  </p><p>FORREST:  Well, I really thought Pittsburgh was the winner here, but, you  know, we're going to leave that behind.</p><p>But, no, I think it's really smart, especially because it looks like  Amazon's going to have to develop its own in-house brands for clothing and  what better place than New York City to do that.</p><p>The Virginia aspect is kind of interesting, it's close to the government  and, you know, I think they need to address a whole lot of maybe regulatory  issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>FORREST:  So, you know, that makes a whole lot of sense there, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, just really quickly, I'm sure we'll get to this in the show,  but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has just been elected to Congress,  representing part of Queens, is calling in to question Amazon moving into  Queens.  </p><p>The idea of we receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a  time when our subway is crumbling out and our communities need more  investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here that -- </p><p>Well, we will just talk about that, because that shows a fundamental  misunderstanding of the way an economy works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a misunderstanding of what the whole point in giving  tax breaks to companies are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the whole point, is to lead to jobs.  </p><p>FORREST:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Twenty-five thousand jobs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you -- do you have a leave -- do you have a leave?  Because  that gives me a headache.  That economic analysis -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have an Advil for you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is just -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I might have an Advil for you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kim, thank you so much.  We will see you soon.  </p><p>FORREST:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're watching all of the above.  Kim Forrest joining us.   We'll take a break.  </p><p>When we come back, wild fires are out of control in California.  The  multiple blaze is burning across the state, becoming the deadliest in the  state history.  The very latest coming next.  </p><p>And then withholding data, new reports suggest Boeing did not share  potential problems with flight control systems.  It could have played a  role in the Lion Air jet crash next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  In Northern California, wild fire becoming the  deadliest in state history.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details right  now.  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  The  monster campfire has now killed at least 42 people in Northern California,  hundreds are still unaccounted for.  President Trump has approved a major  disaster declaration for the Golden State. </p><p>In Southern California, that's where you have the Woosley Fire that's  destroyed more than 400 homes and businesses.  That fire has killed at  least two people.  </p><p>Thousands of structures remain at risk, red-flag warning in effect for L.A.  and Ventura counties, and obviously the weather is not helping the  situation.</p><p>Well, Boeing reportedly withheld information on the Lion Air jet that  crashed in Indonesia last month, killing all 189 people on board.  </p><p>The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Boeing didn't tell airlines about  potential hazards in a new flight control feature on their 737 Max.  </p><p>The problem is that the system can push the plane's nose down so strongly  that pilots can't pull it back up.  The automated stall prevention system  is being investigated as playing a role in the crash.  </p><p>Shares of Boeing are up a quarter of one percent.  And premarket trading,  Maria, you will talk to Boeing Chairman, and CEO, President Dennis  Muilenburg.  That's at 8:30 this morning.  </p><p>Everybody stay tuned for that that.  </p><p>Well, fans worldwide are paying tribute to a real superhero.  Stan Lee, the  father of Spider-Man, The Hulk, Iron Man, and many other memorable comic  characters, died yesterday in Los Angeles.  </p><p>Lee was a legendary Writer and Publisher of Marvel Comics whose creations  revolutionized comic books.  </p><p>His comics were often turned into blockbuster movies, generating billions  of dollars worldwide. </p><p>Stanley dead at the age of 95.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Coming up next, midterm  madness.  More inconsistencies in the Florida recount process.  They are  popping up as the judge tells both sides to ramp down the rhetoric, that  and other races still not decided right after this break.  </p><p>And then a tidy box, this new design for Tide's detergent driving the  internet nuts this morning.  We will tell you why.  Stay with us on that.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching markets this morning after a big  selloff yesterday.  Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading this  morning.  </p><p>We are looking at a gain of about 145 points on the Dow Industrials, that's  two-thirds of one percent after a 600-point selloff yesterday.  </p><p>The S&amp;P is up 16, and the NASDAQ is up 60 points right now.</p><p>I want to turn to the midterm fallout.  New oversight, the hours on the  senate race has been called.  Kyrsten Sinema, becoming the first democrat  elected in 30 years.  </p><p>In Georgia, a judge extending the deadline to certify votes in the  governor's race there.  </p><p>Republican Brian Kemp is ahead by nearly 60,000 that votes right now, but  Democrat Stacey Abrams is filing a lawsuit to count rejected ballots.</p><p>And then in Florida, ballot drama, the recount is in full swing right now,  but large counties are scrambling to meet the deadline of Thursday.  </p><p>Fox News' Griff Jenkins is in Lauderhill, Florida.  He's at the Broward  County Office of Elections.</p><p>Griff, good morning to you.  </p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  </p><p>You may be watching the markets, but I'm watching ballots being separated  in Broward County.  Take a look at this.  The tabulation room, they still  have not begun the recount here.  </p><p>Now in 65 of Florida's 67 counties, they are either halfway done or even  more from the recount being done, but here in Palm Beach County, they're  far from it.  What they have to do is finish separating page one.  </p><p>Then they'll likely do a calibration of the machines and begin the actual  official tabulation recount.  That isn't expected any time before about  9:00 a.m. here so it's quite an issue as they race towards the Thursday  deadline to get those numbers in.  </p><p>But we were surprised, Maria, yesterday when the Election Supervisor here,  Dr. Brenda Snipes, came out, talked to the media, and addressed allegations  that she has made major mistakes this election, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRENDA SNIPES, SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS, BROWARD COUNTY:  The lawsuits, as  they are written, certainly cast dispersions on my character.  </p><p>I've have worked here for about 15 years and I have to say this is the  first time that this office or I have been under such attacks, so if we  make mistakes, we own mistakes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  Then the stunning development, FormerFlorida Governor, Jeb Bush,  tweeting that he believes Snipes failed to comply with the law in multiple  counts and called for her removal.  </p><p>Jeb was the one that appointed her in 2003 to replace the previous  supervisor who had to be removed for similar problems.  </p><p>Meanwhile, on the national level, Senator Nelson and Governor Scott trading  nasty barbs, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D), CALIFORNIA:  Scott cannot oversee this process in a  fair and impartial way, and thus he should remove himself from any role in  the recount process.</p><p>GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  Our goal is that we follow the law.  We know  Brenda Snipes mixed illegal ballots with legal ballots.  We know they've  not let party officials in, the courts have said follow the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENKINS:  If they do indeed get this recount started and meet that Thursday  deadline here in Broward County, Maria, lawyers tell me that they expect  the margin of error to be under that .25 percent and will be headed for a  hand recount after Thursday.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Griff, thank you much.  Griff Jenkins this morning on  that.  </p><p>This is an incredible story, that now we see that Sinema has actually won  in Arizona and these other two are so close.  </p><p>I mean, Georgia, 60,000 votes sounds like a lot, but she's still fighting  in Georgia, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She is still fighting in Georgia, so -- but the Republicans know  definitively that they will still have a 51-seat majority in the Senate,  that's the take away from that.</p><p>But in terms of what's going on down in Florida, there's a history in  Broward County of problems there.  </p><p>I just want to point that out because Brenda Snipes seems to suggest that  people are attacking her and her character, well, there have been glitches,  mistakes, and even illegal ballot destruction in her county under her  supervision.</p><p>The -- a court ruling found in May, Broward Election Supervisor Brenda  Snipes illegally destroyed ballots from a 2016 congressional race with  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was trying to push off this primary challenger,  Tim Canova.  </p><p>So again, there's a history of problems there and raises the issue of if  you were the steward of the county when these problems happened, why was  she still there going into the midterms?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why is she saying that she's been on this job 15 years and this  is the first time she's getting attacked when we know darn well that there  have been issues in the past?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think that Miami Herald and all the newspapers in the State  of Florida write about these problems often and so now that she's in the  national spotlight, maybe it feels a little bit different.  </p><p>But there are issues there and they're front and center during the  midterms.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Count and recount.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll keep following that.  </p><p>We'll take a break.  When we come back, searching for deal, Vice President  Pence is looking to set a trade agreement with japan that would serve as a  model for other countries.  </p><p>General Jack Keane is here, he will weigh on that.  </p><p>And then on precedence and security, as drug lord, El Chapo, sees his day  in a New York Court.  He will be here today in New York to face that.</p><p>The very latest straight ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Futures, indicating a bit of a bounce, this morning, after a sharp selloff  yesterday, Dow Industrials set to open up about 130 points that is one-half  of one percent, S&amp;P is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ with a gain of 57  points, good for gain of almost one percent out of the gate, this morning.  </p><p>This after the major indices took a big hit yesterday, a five percent  decline in Apple stock, took a chunk out of this market, that's a Dow  component and a NASDAQ component, the Dow was down 602 points at the close,  down better than two percent, S&amp;P was down about two percent, and the  NASDAQ with a 206-point selloff, was down almost 3 percent, yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the bouncing is continuing, the FT-100 is also  recovering along with stocks on Wall Street, that is up a quarter of a  percent, in London.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up almost half a percent  and the DAX Index in Germany, up three quarters of one percent, 87 points  higher.</p><p>Mixed performances in Asia, overnight, worst performer, Japan; Nikkei  Average down two percent, the Shanghai composite in China, up almost one  percent.</p><p>Crude oil slipping this morning, this after the price of oil closed lower,  yesterday, for 11 days in a row, the very latest on oil's bear market,  coming up.  It is down 20 percent from the highs, just 5 weeks ago.</p><p>Home Depot, reporting earnings this morning, they were better-than- expected, the improvement store out with double beat.  We will break it  down for you as the stock is up 2-1/4 percent, that's helping the Dow  Industrials for sure.</p><p>Zuckerberg won't go, the Facebook founder could be held in contempt after  declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.  And  another Tide controversy to report, the detergent's new packaging being  compared to a box of wine, we will get into all of that, coming up.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, mounting pressure on China,  Vice President Mike Pence headed to Singapore, to talk trade, with the  Association of the Southeast Asian Nations.  Speaking with Japanese Prime  Minister Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo, yesterday, the Vice President took a strong  stance on China, ahead of the President's meeting with President Xi, at the  end of the month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States seeks a  relationship with China that's based on fairness, reciprocity and respect  for sovereignty.  The difficulties that the United States and other nations  face with China have been well documented by our administration.  And China  knows where we stand.</p><p>Nevertheless, President Trump is looking forward to his meeting with  President Xi, in Argentina.  He believes that progress could be made, but  either way, we're confident that the United States remains in a strong  position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that is FOX News  Strategic Senior Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to see  this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to  see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you were just in Singapore, a few months ago, meeting with  leadership there, your take on the Vice President's comments and how  Singapore and the U.S. can team up here?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, yes, they're very concerned.  I just came back from Vietnam  this weekend also, they are very concerned about what China has been doing  in the region for years, and largely getting away with it.  You know,  because, the United States had never truly engaged competitively against  China.</p><p>And they think that we have a long way to make up for it, but they truly  appreciate the fact that the United States is back in the game, so to  speak, and they're pushing back on China's economic and political warfare  and also their militarization, particularly, the South China Sea.</p><p>And I think Vice President Pence's Seminole speech, a few weeks ago, on  China, caught everybody's attention in the Indo-Pacific.  And that was a  huge step forward for the United States, but most importantly for our  relationship with our allies.</p><p>So, I think Vice President Pence will be very welcome by the ASEAN leaders,  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and I think he will get positive  feedbacks for the fact that President Trump is, once again, exercising  American leadership in the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General, the President really has to walk a balance here,  because while pushing back on China, trying to get them to change their  behavior, it also could impact business.  We've got the CEO of Boeing  coming in here, this morning, to talk about his business.  In the coming  year and years, one in four or five planes made at Boeing, will go to  China.</p><p>This is the second largest market for Boeing, and that's just in the  aerospace maker, I mean, there are tons of other companies, as well,  looking to China for opportunities, so how does the President walk that  balance?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I think, there has to be a balance.  Listen, clearly, China  is a major market and American businesses will continue to do work there,  to be sure, but I think what the President has done and illuminated the  issue in trying to find the balance and stop stealing our intellectual  property, stop -- </p><p>If you have to do business in China, as you well know, Maria, you've got to  enter into a joint venture with them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  That's not the way we do business in Europe or in the Middle East,  and as a result to that joint venture, they get access to our intellectual  property.  That's got to stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.</p><p>KEANE:  So, I think -- I think if we continue to do business, that's fine,  but let's get it on a balance table where it's much more equitable and it's  kind of the way we do business in other parts of the world.  I will tell  you this, a lot of the supply chain that exists in China, and from American  businesses and other businesses are looking to go elsewhere.</p><p>And in Vietnam, that I just came back from, they are reaping some of the  benefits of that, as will other nations in the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean -- I guess business has been dealing with, you  know, succumbing to China and handing over their technology and going by  their rules for so long that they forgot how unfair it was.  Look, the  other major point in the Vice President's statement yesterday, was on North  Korea.  Watch this, got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE:  The President has made it clear that the time for implementing the  agreement is not a driving factor.  And as I assured you, Mr. Prime  Minister, the pressure campaign will continue, the sanctions will remain in  full force, until we achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of  North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  New satellite images reportedly show that North Korea is moving  ahead with its nuclear program after Kim Jong-un's agreement with President  Trump, so your take on these developments, General?  What now?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, first of all, the Vice President's visit to Japan and talking  to Prime Minister Abe, I will tell you what, he got an earful from him  because that's the person that President Trump do talks in any other world  leader and he truly gives him very good perspective on what's going on in  North Korea and China.</p><p>Listen, the North Koreans, in principle, have agreed to denuclearized, in  fact, they have not taken a single step to do that.  What we wanted out of  the box was; one, give us an inventory of all of your sites and your  weapons themselves, two, give us a plan to destroy and disarm ballistic  missiles and nuclear weapons that has not happened.</p><p>And what we have to stay focused on, is the third thing, there's not been a  single ballistic missile or nuclear weapon that has been disarmed or  destroyed.  So while this progress on the fringes and there are a lot of  positive statements, the reality is, in terms of what needs to be done,  there hasn't been any substantive progress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And for the U.S., what does that mean?  Should the U.S. be  doing something different in terms of our strategy to get the  denuclearization back on track?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, that's a great question, and certainly that's something that  the National Security team of this administration is working on.  I would  suggest, one, we've got to -- we've got to get tough on China because  they've opened the aperture on the sanctions, and some of that backdoors  are happening.</p><p>The Russians have always backdoored North Korea.  We're not going to make  any progress with them.  The State Department has to make certain that the  other nations are not giving up, there's no missiles flying, there's no  tests being taken, there's a -- there's no sense of a crisis, so we have to  make sure the other countries are enforcing the sanctions.</p><p>And we've got to up our game ourselves and we can do that militarily, start  moving some things into the region, make sure that they know that we're  dead serious, it's either you give us the weapons, Mr. Chairman of North  Korea, or we're going to come take the weapons, that's the deal that's on  the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask you about oil, in that vein, President  Trump took aim at Saudi Arabia yesterday, after reports that the country  plans to cut oil production.  The President tweeted this yesterday,  hopefully Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production.  Oil  prices should be much lower based on supply.</p><p>Look, we know, General, that the U.S. has become one of the leading  producers at this point, and now, with the Saudis and OPEC, wanting to cut  production, they're trying to boost prices because it's in a bear market  right now, 20 percent lower from the highs.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  Well, this consensus in the last OPEC meeting, even the so- called Russian cartel, you know, they felt it was going to be a cutback  obviously, in Iranian crude, on the market and as a result of that, the  Russian cartel increased prices, but then this consensus developing now,  that there's going to be an oversupply in 2019.</p><p>I suspect -- the Saudis have made a decision to cut -- I think OPEC will  cut next month, in Vienna, and the Russians will likely follow suit.   That's the path that we are on.  I don't think there's anything that's  going to change it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I have been expecting a change in Homeland Security.  I know  that the Washington Post is reporting that Kirstjen Nielsen, Homeland  Security Secretary, is out, and I was hearing the same thing actually, that  they've already had the discussion.</p><p>My sources told me that they've already had the conversation that the  Secretary is going to be out of that job in -- as the President changes its  administration after the midterms, your thoughts on Kirstjen Nielsen being  out?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, I don't know anything about that, on the inside, honestly.   But I do know what I'm looking at and clearly, the administration has got  to be very frustrated with the open border that we have because there are  hundreds of people coming through every week, who are coming, seeking  asylum, and we have to release them.</p><p>And that's what's happening, because our system is so backed up with people  who are waiting to be processed.  The so-called catch and release, it's  hundreds, happening every week.  We are focused on the caravan to be sure,  but the equivalent to a caravan, is happening every month.</p><p>And that's got the administration's focus because they get daily reports on  all of this, and I think they are just genuinely dissatisfied with where  things are.  Certainly, the Congress is part of this problem, but it's not  the only part of the problem.  And I think that's likely what's driving the  replacements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the President -- the President cancelled the trip this  week, with Kirstjen Nielsen, to the southern border, in Texas.  Now,  that's, I guess, the Washington Post is saying this is the impetus.  But,  you know, as you say, he's been very frustrated with her, because of the  open borders, but she says it's a Congress problem.  She can't do anything  different because this is the law, General.</p><p>So, the President's frustrated with the person who is in the job, but  doesn't -- aren't her hands tied?</p><p>KEANE:  Her hands are somewhat tied.  But I suspect, now, this is just  speculation on my part, I suspect that the President has received some  advice from other advisers who are saying there are some other options that  we could be putting into play here, and certainly, having resources to cope  with the problem.</p><p>So we're not catching and release, would likely be a start.  And  increasingly, how we process these people in getting their hearings, would  be another part of the puzzle.  I just suspect that over time, there's been  a loss of confidence here if what you're reporting is accurate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  There is going to be a replacement.  I think it's largely  immigration issue.  I don't even think it has to do with -- it's one of the  largest -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you're right.</p><p>KEANE:  departments in government.  I don't think that has to do with  anything else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  It's totally the immigration issue, 100  percent, that's what I'm hearing.  But real quick, General, before you go,  any thoughts on who might replace her?</p><p>KEANE:  No, I have no idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so  much.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As always, General Jack Keane, joining us there.  Coming up,  Zuckerberg skips out, why the Facebook founder could be held in contempt,  after declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.   And then, first Tide pods, now this, the internet goes crazy over Tide's  new detergent design, it looks like a case of boxed wine, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The trial of El Chapo set to begin today in New  York.  Lauren Simonetti with the details now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  The notorious Mexican drug lord will be in a Brooklyn federal  court this morning with unprecedented security for the jurors and for  Joaquin El Chapo Guzman himself.  Security will include snipers perched on  rooftops and an armored vehicle to transport Guzman.  He's accused of  spending quarter century smuggling more than 150 tons of cocaine into the  U.S.  He was extradited from Mexico last year after escaping prison two  times.  The trial expected to last more than four months.  Prosecutors say,  the evidence will include the testimony of over a dozen witnesses.  </p><p>Well, a Canadian politician says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be held  in contempt after he refused to appear before an international panel of  five governments that are investigating the company.  That politicians says  he might issue subpoena forcing Zuckerberg to appear before Canada's  parliament.  Zuckerberg had rejected an earlier request to appear before an  international grand committee looking into disinformation and election  meddling.  Facebook not commenting, shares of the company up $1.23 this  morning.</p><p>Well, Procter &amp; Gamble may have another packaging problem.  The company  debut its eco-box, which happens to look a lot like a wine box but that new  Tide box is generating some buzz on Twitter.  This is what one user wrote:  \"You all don't want kids eating Tide pods but when you make a wine box  tide, what do you want from me?  Well, he was referring to the Tide pod  challenge last year when teenagers were daring each other to eat the  detergent pods but would you drink the Tide wine?  I don't know, I hope  that's not an adult challenge coming up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a crazy story.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were eating the pods.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But looks like a wine box, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It does.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I have freshman in college, and I'm frightened right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Where do you think that stuff happens, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a keg, not a wine box.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, owing the best for your friends; how Petco plans to  provide your pet with only health foods.  That's next, stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, President Trump just tweeting this, we want to  get this out: \"Emmanuel Macron suggesting building its own army to protect  Europe against the United States, China and Russia, but it was Germany in  World Wars I and 2.  How did that work for France?  They're starting to  learn German in Paris before U.S. came along.  Pay for NATO or not!\"  The  president taking about his meetings and NATO pay your fair share, once  again, this morning.  </p><p>Meanwhile there's this, putting your pet first which we all do here on this  program.  Petco becomes the only major retailer of pet supplies to ensure  healthy food for your furry family members.  In a first on Fox Business  announcement, the company is revealing it will not sell foods or treats  containing artificial colors, flavors and preservatives for dogs and cats  by May of 2019.  Joining us right is the CEO of Petco, Ron Couglin, and  it's good to see you, Ron.  </p><p>RON COUGHLIN, CEO, PETCO:  It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  I was telling you during  commercial break, I only used to serve Ellabela steamed string beans as  treats and she died at almost 18 years old.  She lived a long and strong  life as a result.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  You what's amazing, over 50 percent of pet owners, cook for  their pets.  We were talking about it earlier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Only 50 percent.</p><p>COUGHLIN:  Over 50 percent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  And we're bringing human grade food actually into Petco shortly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about what you're doing?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Yes.  So, the big announcement today is that we're going to be  eliminating all cat and dog foods and treats with artificial flavors,  artificial colors, artificial preservatives.  You know, if you think about  the bet we love, do we want ethanol to be served to them, do we want sulfur  dioxide, do we want (INAUDIBLE), so the answer is no.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And those are in most pet foods?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Those are in certain pet foods.  Now, the reality is, Petco has  been weening off those products, other companies have much higher percent  of those foods.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, Charlie and Ramon don't eat those, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, they eat a food that you can't buy at Petco.  They eat blue  buffalo basic, limited ingredient, grain-free canned food and also -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And also, I.D. which is prescription and you're going to begin  to sell prescription dog food. </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  This week, we started doing prescription dog food  on Petco.com.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, big response from customers?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Yes, we've seen response thus far, but today is our announcement  day, so we're very proud of it.  It's big deal for the industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's higher premium that people will pay.  It's amazing  to me how much money people spend on their dogs and their cats.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anything -- most of my dogs have gastro, severe gastro  intestinal problems, so anything to keep them healthy but you were talking  about -- you're going to actually start selling cooked food, literally  human food for animals?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, humanization is one of the biggest trends,  folks like you but you don't always have time.  So, what we're going to do  is we're partnered with company called Just Food for Dogs, and we actually  are going to have kitchens.  Union Scare, right here, is going to have a  kitchen where we cook for your dog; you can come in and get fresh food  every day for your dog.  My dog right now is having salmon and sweet  potatoes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Lucky dog.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  So, if you're having salmon and sweet potatoes, your pet should  have it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And does this make a difference in the dog's life?  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  Absolutely, it's all vet-driven mixtures.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can't feed them too much, though, because they'll get fat  and that's a huge problem, obesity in animals.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Ron, real quick, we've been talking about the Petco Foundation,  maybe a little bit on that.  </p><p>COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, we're very proud of the Petco Foundation,  especially in times and of hurricanes, fires, et cetera.  We go in and take  care of the pets, we give free food, we give funding to the shelters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Ron.  That's fantastic.  Great, check out  Petco.  Ron Coughlin, thank you for joining us.  Still ahead, a diamond fit  for a ring, we will show you more of this ring designed by Apple's chief  designer; it's made entirely out of diamond, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, November 13th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 on the button on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets set to rebound this morning after a sharp selloff yesterday.   Futures indicate a gain of 128 points on the Dow, one-half of 1 percent at  the opening of trading.  The Nasdaq is up 56 points right now, almost 1  percent this morning after a broad-based selloff yesterday where the Nasdaq  was hit hard.</p><p>Apple and Goldman Sachs dragged the Dow lower but better than 600 points at  the close, down 2.3 percent on the Dow; down 2 percent on the S&amp;P; and on  the Nasdaq, the worst performer on the day, down nearly 3 percent as  technology took a real hit.</p><p>Global markets this morning are also recovering.  Take a look at European  indices.  The FT 100 is up a fraction.  The CAC 40 is up 23 points, that's  one-half of a percent.  And the DAX index in Germany is up 92 points.  That  is almost 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia, overnight mixed performances, the worst performer was Japan.   Nikkei average down better than 2 percent.</p><p>Well, the picks are in, Amazon will soon call Long Island City, New York  and Crystal City, Virginia home.

You couldn't see 10 feet in front  of you.  I mean embers everywhere.  Smoke everywhere.</p><p>It's devastating.  It's beyond words.  I mean there's no way to explain it.   It -- I mean it loks like a nuclear blast went off here.  It's crazy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take you live to southern California with the very  latest coming up.</p><p>New questions for Boeing this morning.  A new report says that the jet  maker withheld information on its 737, the same model involved in the  deadly Indonesia crash last month.  Boeing's chairman and CEO Dennis  Muilenburg will join me in a Fox Business exclusive this morning.  That's  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that interview coming up.</p><p>And a scare on the court, a Nets player suffers a gruesome injury leaving  people in the crowd in tears.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PWC partner Mitch  Roschelle and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see  everybody this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for being here after a huge day yesterday in  markets.  Look, we're in a good earnings period, Lindsey, and yet the  market trades down 600 points on these growth concerns.  What's going on?  </p><p>BELL:  Yes. Growth is the big question mark for 2019.  Look, we're cycling  the tax reform package, fiscal stimulus is coming to a peak right now as we  look out to 2019, interest rates are rising.  It seems like global growth  could be slowing especially with China.</p><p>So the question is where do earnings go from here?  We're looking right now  at 8.5 percent growth for 2019, that's down from 10 percent that we saw all  through earlier this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Revenue?  </p><p>BELL:  Revenue, it actually ticked up a slight bit to 6.3 percent which is  pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about earnings of 10 percent.  </p><p>BELL:  Earnings of 8.5 percent for 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  </p><p>BELL:  Came down -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's way down.  No wonder markets are upset about things  slowing down.  For 2018 -- talking about earnings being up 25 percent;  going down to 8 percent in 2019.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  But so much of that was a one-timer from tax  reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think what the market isn't really fully digesting is the  forward guidance is in a new tax regime year over year mode.  And a lot of  people looking at the difference between the 20 plus percent earnings  growth in '18 and then less than 10 percent in '19 and they're having a  hard time digesting it.</p><p>We should put like -- maybe they should just watch this show and hear us  say this enough.  Because there's really no reason to freak out.  These are  still strong earnings numbers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  But a lot of this, I would  argue, is higher interest rates and the Federal Reserve still in the  process of winding down that multitrillion dollar balance sheet where  you've seen a deflation in assets, not just in the stock market, in the  last six weeks or so.</p><p>But look at what oil has done, down 11 days in a row.  That is a record  streak for declines in the cost of crude oil.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are a lot of things at play, maybe actual supply and  demand fundamentals, but also money just coming out of this was clearly an  over-inflated asset.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's Apple, we'll talk about that.  What do the  price of oil and Apple tell you about the broader economy.</p><p>Coming up, my exclusive interview this morning with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk to him about what he's  seeing in the global economy, of course, commercial aerospace has been on  fire.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, House majority whip and Louisiana  Congressman Steve Scalise is here.  He's out with a new book.  Congressman- Elect Michael Waltz will join us, Green Beret.  And the CEO of the Mayo  Clinic is back, Dr. John Noseworthy, with some news today.  The host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney here as well.</p><p>We've got a big two hours coming up.  Don't miss a moment of it because we  are reporting this morning the news of the day.</p><p>Our top story right now is that sharp selloff in stocks.  Futures are  higher this morning as the technology sector tries to recover from a sharp  decline yesterday.  It pulled the markets lower, knocking off more than 600  points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>Yesterday it was a sharp selloff and Apple really drove things, drove a  technology slump.</p><p>Now today, this morning it is unchanged after taking a hit amid fresh  concerns over the demand for the iPhone.</p><p>Joining us right now is Scott Martin.  He is Kingsview Asset Management  CIO.  Scott -- good to see you this morning.  I know you've had your share  of worries out there for markets.  Is yesterday's performance telling us  anything about what's ahead?  </p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Probably.  You know, you're  right, Maria -- without the markets I've got enough to worry about.  So  thank you markets for making that even more compounded.  </p><p>Listen, I love what you guys talked about there in the intro to the hour.   Lindsey is absolutely right.  You know, the revenue numbers estimates have  come down, the earnings estimates have come down.</p><p>Mitch is right, too.  You know, guys -- I started some meditation over the  last couple of weeks so you should definitely try that at home, kids.  I  think that has helped me with some of the worries -- Maria.</p><p>And the market needs stop freaking out.  You know, that's the thing like --  kind of like they say in the meditation, be calm because even though  earnings like you said, Maria, and you pointed out astutely are not growing  at 20 plus percent, guess what, kids -- that was unsustainable.  I mean  those weren't numbers that we're going to keep repeating.</p><p>But the market maybe got fooled into thinking that or let's just say we got  valuation metrics that seemed to be aligned with the thinking that that was  going to continue.</p><p>So as we alight or let's say descend back to reasonable numbers and  reasonable economic growth expectation, Lindsey mentioned interest rates  going up and so forth, the market needs to settle into some price here and  then I think it can rebuild some of these losses.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Scott, is there -- if you want to be defensive or if you want  to stay in the market but not have to meditate and do yoga to stay calm --  where's the place to be right now?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, and I haven't found any good yoga or meditation stocks yet,  Mitch, but I'm still looking for them.  You know, there are places to be  and that's a great thing to point out, you know.  This is not a total  freak-out selloff, even kind of like we saw in February just yet or even  like we saw over Brexit or even like we saw, you know, back in the late  2000s, you know, 2008 and so on, because there are things that are working,  specifically -- and we haven't bought enough of this stuff yet but we're  accruing it.</p><p>Look at consumer staples, look at real estate.  Look at utilities.  You  know, if interest rates come down because people like say with the freak- out, you know, they freak-out and they buy bonds, they buy fixed income  instruments and that drives down interest rates.  Some of these interest  rate sensitive names tend to hang in there when equity markets go like they  did yesterday.  </p><p>So Mitch -- I would say those are three good sectors for the individual  investors at home to look at that we start to pick up as well that have  started to mitigate some of the volatility.  </p><p>BELL:  Hey -- Scotty.  So you mentioned a lot of defensive sectors there  which as you rightly point out they've been doing well more recently.  But  what hasn't been doing well is tech.  and that is what led the market over  the past two years.  </p><p>Right now you have two -- three quarters of the S&amp;P 500 tech sector in bear  market territory.  Do we need the tech sector though to continue to move  this bull market higher?  </p><p>MARTIN:  We need something to, Lindsey and I'll tell you that's the  interesting point is you had these great leadership names -- you know, your  favorite ones and ones we still own.  You know, Google, Apple, Microsoft,  Amazon, Netflix, Whatever, Broadcom, Adobe -- great companies that were  crushing earnings and getting high valuations, again like we talked about  that were probably undeserved. </p><p>And now Lindsey -- the market has no leadership, you know.  Everybody has  been calling in the so-called experts, have said, oh my gods, this is the  time for financials because the Fed is hiking interest rates.  When the  reality for the most part, they were just flattening the interest rate  curve.</p><p>And so to me, it needs leadership.  I don't know if it's tech necessarily.   I was hoping for a while there it was going to be industrials because we  were hopefully going to get some of these trade deals reworked and more in  our favor and that was going to work out for some of the companies like  Deere, Caterpillar and some of the other ones we own.</p><p>But maybe it's health care.  That gets worked out with you know, maybe a  bipartisan congress.  Who knows?  But I think you're right, Lindsey.  It  doesn't necessarily have to be tech but it has to be some leadership in  some other sector to take the reins of this market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about financials?  I mean that's probably tough  because you've got higher rates going on.  Tech is where the growth has  been.  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  Higher rates are interesting, Maria -- because even though  the fed's been hiking interest rates, rates did get a nice boost as we saw,  you know, into October and then they've kind of fallen off a bit.  I mean  look at, you know, last week we were at 3.25 again on the 10 year and now I  think I checked this morning we're at 3.15.</p><p>So, you know,, financials kind of remind me of all the girls that turned me  down in high school.  I had to bring that up.  Because they're never there,  you know.  Like financials every year we hear somebody make this bold call  on financials being there and being the one, and they're never doing it.</p><p>So to me I'm not ready to give up on financials but as far as overweighting  financials, I won't do that either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, what about Amazon, the split decision expected to divide  its second headquarters between evenly between New York City and northern  Virginia.  According to the Journal this morning, the announcement is  probably -- could come as early as today.</p><p>Is this a smart decision?  What are your thoughts here?  Would you put new  money to work in this market right here?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes, we would.  I would slowly start weighting it again.  I don't  think that, you know, you have to jump in on a day like today where, you  know, we had a little bit of mixed trading overseas, especially in the  Nikkei, for example as you pointed out all morning.  And we've got a little  bit of a bounce today.</p><p>But I mean guys, even Eli Manning had a decent football game last night.   So the market can bounce just like that as well.</p><p>But I think Maria -- there's some levels that are coming into play here  that are decent as far as some of these tech names that have sold off 20,  25 percent.  So I think you can start weighting in here with some money but  just have a quick kind of hook on it if things start to get worse again  because you may get some lower prices.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Scott always a pleasure.   Thanks so much for weighing in here.</p><p>MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scott Martin joining us there.</p><p>Turning to the devastation in California right now, the wildfires are  becoming the deadliest in state history.  Fox News' Ray Bogan is in Ventura  County this morning with the very latest.  Good morning to you -- ray.  </p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Maria -- good morning.  </p><p>We're at the incident command center for the Woolsey and Hill Fires where  in just a couple of hours, hundreds of firefighters will arrive to get  their morning briefing.  They're working 24 hour shifts.</p><p>In the meantime, some of them are sleeping in tents.  One man is even over  to my left in a sleeping bag.</p><p>Now, in northern California, investigators are looking into whether a  sparking PG&amp;E power line may have started the Camp Fire which has become  the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state's history.  42 people  have died.  They've been found in their homes and cars as they were trying  to escape. </p><p>At last update, the fire was 30 percent contained and Cal Fire doesn't  expect to have full containment for another week.  Nearly 6,500 homes have  been destroyed, including some belonging to firefighters and their  families.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID HAWKE, PARADISE FIRE CHIEF:  It's just absolutely heart-breaking to  drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.  My family lost  their home in the fire.  My parents did.  My grandmother did.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOGAN:  Now, here in southern California, the Woolsey Fire at last update  was 93,000 acres and 30 percent contained.  Firefighters estimate more than  400 buildings have been destroyed.</p><p>In both fires crews are working against dry, windy conditions and steep  terrain but California is getting help.  President Trump has approved a  major disaster declaration and in addition, Cal Fire is thanking 17 state  partners that have come from as far as Alaska and Georgia.  Maria, back to  you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Ray.  Thank you so much.  We will follow this.  And  this is an incredibly devastating story.  Ray -- thank you.  Ray Bogan  there.  </p><p>Coming up, concerns in the sky.  The new report that Boeing withheld  information on its 737.  The same model involved in the deadly Indonesia  crash last month.  I'll speaking exclusively with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing this morning.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk about that  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern and also get his take on the on the commercial  aerospace boom he's been seeing.  Over the last few years.</p><p>Then an injury on the court, the details after a player's gruesome leg  injury leaves some in tears, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New information coming to light this morning following last month's crash  of a Boeing jet in Indonesia.  Lauren Simonetti with the Details now --  Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hi -- Maria, Boeing reportedly withheld  information on the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max which killed all 189 people  on-board that day.  Safety experts and others telling the \"Wall Street  Journal\" that Boeing didn't tell airlines about potential hazards in their  new flight control feature on that plane.  The problem is that the system  can push the plane's nose down so strongly that pilots can't pull it back  up.</p><p>The automated stall prevention system is being investigated as playing a  role in that Lion Air crash.  Shares of Boeing trading up a quarter of a  percent, $358.  And programming note -- Maria will sit down with Boeing's  chairman, CEO and president Dennis Muilenburg in the next hour on Morning's  with Maria, 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Well, the Labor Department is trying to help people save money and curb  401-k cash-outs.  The department could soon allow companies to  automatically transfer (INAUDIBLE) accounts of $5,000 or less belonging to  employees who change jobs to the 401-k plan of their new employers.  It's  the effort to cut down on the premature flow of money out of retirement  plans.  Research shows that as many as 80 percent of people leaving jobs  with less than $5,000 in those accounts eventually cash out of them.</p><p>Well, check this out.  Apple's head designer, Johnnie Ives, has taken on a  project more elegant than your iPhone.  He designed a ring carved from a  single chunk of diamond.  It could sell for a quarter million dollars at an  auction at Sotheby's.  Sotheby's says the ring has up to 3,000 facets,  never seen before on a single piece.  It will be made to fit the buyer, up  to a size 5, which is actually pretty small.  All of those proceeds going  to charity.  But most designers start with the metal.  Johnnie Ives took  the metal out of the equation and started with the diamonds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow -- so it's all diamond all around.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All diamonds -- Baby.  And diamonds are my birth stone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they are a girl's best friend.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can hear the woman.  How are they supposed to know it's  diamonds?  You know, you can't tell.  Sorry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  All right.  Thank you -- Lauren.</p><p>Coming up, the state of health care in America.  The CEO of the Mayo Clinic  Dr. John Noseworthy is here.  He's weighing in on the industry innovations,  plus an exclusive announcement that will change health care, certainly at  the Mayo Clinic -- that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A major investment in the future of health care in America.   The Mayo Clinic School of Medicine receiving a $200 million gift from  philanthropist Jay Alix, the largest ever made to the clinic.</p><p>Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive are Alix Partners founder  Jay Alix and Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. John Noseworthy.  Great to see you both.   Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JAY ALIX, FOUNDER, ALIX PARTNERS:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p>DR. JOHN NOSEWORTHY, CEO, MAYO CLINIC:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Jay -- what a gift.  Congratulations to you that you're  able to do such a thing for the Mayo Clinic.  </p><p>ALIX:  Absolutely.</p><p>You know, Mayo is such a he deserving institution.  The medical school is  one of the top ranked medical schools in the country.  And to be able to be  involved with them, to help them with their mission is just a really great  opportunity for us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is going to help the medical school a lot, Dr.  Noseworthy.  And you're also going to be able to attract new talent with  this.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  Thanks -- Maria.  Yes, this is really going to help us a great  deal, attract the best students from all over the world, from all  backgrounds regardless of their ability to pay for medical education. </p><p>And it will help us with new curriculum and dual degrees and innovative  ways of teaching and technology and all those good things.  It's a  wonderful gift.  We're really grateful to Jay.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are now going to be on the board.</p><p>ALIX:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you want to see from the Mayo Clinic and how this  money could be best used.  </p><p>ALIX:  Well, what this gift is about is really helping attract the best  students for the medical school, to train the doctors of the future.  The  country is facing a crisis that we're going to need probably 110,000  doctors in the next 10 years that we don't have today and we don't know  where they're going to come from.</p><p>So we need to train more doctors and we have to provide the money and the  support and the scholarship to help those students get into medical school  and have the country have the right doctors in the future.  Mayo can do  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  It was major issue in this past election,  everybody said that health care was the number one matter that was very  important to voters.  The Democrats taking the House in the midterm  elections.  And they say one of the priorities is health care in America.</p><p>So John -- tell us where the needs are right now.  Tell us what your view  is in terms of what needs to be done to take health care up to the next  level.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  So the majority of Americans are concerned about access,  coverage, and the cost of health care and the need for transparency to  drive down the cost but also improve the outcomes.  And we support all of  that.</p><p>From Mayo Clinic's perspective, it's more than cost.  It's certainly cost  but it's also outcomes and the performance and how well health care  performs.  And at Mayo Clinic we're all about serious and complex illness  and how to finance as quickly and effectively and provide patients with the  best possible care.</p><p>So the doctors of the future are going to have to deal with transparency,  coverage cost, access, technology, how to drive the safest and highest  technology, most affordable health care system which we don't have at the  moment, as you know.  We're tied to these election cycles every two years.   So it's this and that and this and that and until the country decides that  it's really a priority for the citizens, we're not going to get that long- lasting answer that we need.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you talk about outcomes.  You know, we've been all about  prevention these last several years, talking about getting ahead of  disease.  How might that money be used toward getting ahead of disease and  when you look at the needs in this country today.  I mean I know we haven't  done enough work or we need more money for Alzheimer's, for example.  And  you know, issues related to the brain.  Where are the needs in that regard?  </p><p>ALIX:  Well, I think we have really leading edge technologies now.  We have  artificial intelligence coming online.  What A.I. is going to do for  medicine and the digitization of medical, you know, personal health data is  going to revolutionize how we can do diagnosis.  And of course with it, you  know, early intervention, diagnosis and prevention we can really change  outcomes for all people who have serious complex medical problems.  And  Mayo is leading the way on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you made because A.I. is  able to work with doctors to improve the outcomes.  Isn't that right?  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  That's absolutely right.  And I think it's also prediction.   It's early diagnosis but it's also predictive genomics, if you will.   Knowing what we know about people, who is likely to be at risk for this or  that so you can diagnose it early.  It's all of that together.  </p><p>And the young kids who want to do medicine, want to have a life of service,  they need to have that kind of an education to prepare them for that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What have you done differently in terms of A.I. at the clinic?  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  We have well over 100 projects trying to predict how to read  x-rays better, how to predict from genomics, how things will play out.   We're working into everyday life at Mayo Clinic, monitoring patients'  hearts, who is at risk for heart disease, that sort of thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this money will go toward getting new students who will be  looking at A.I. as part of their curriculum, very different than the  doctors in the past.  </p><p>ALIX:  Exactly.  Medical education is going to have to evolve quickly now  and keep up the new technologies, new breakthroughs in science and apply it  right into the clinic for people.  Mayo Clinic can lead the way on that  with this gift and with the research and development it has.</p><p>Mayo has three shields with clinical care, education and research and the  combination of all those three working together is what this gift will  allow Mayo to do.  </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  We'll be offering a masters of artificial intelligence.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Masters of A.I. </p><p>NOSEWORTHTY:  Masters of A.I. and masters of regenerative science, and  masters of advanced biotechnology and bioengineering.  All of these, the  new wave will be right in the curriculum plus the (INAUDIBLE) start willing  to spend say an extra year to get that additional training.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we go, where have you seen the most progress in terms of  outcomes in terms of disease?  Is it cancer?  Is it somewhere else?  Heart  disease?  Where have you seen the biggest -- </p><p>NOSEWORTHY:  I think it's in all the serious illnesses -- Maria.  We're  actually measuring outcomes much better, the quantitation of outcomes,  quality of life, life expectancy, readmission to hospital, all of those  things that are now being put on score cards to see what is the investment  to health care doing to reduce the costs and prove the outcome so that  quantitative outcomes research, it's still in its infancy, but it's  absolutely critical if we're going to have the best health care system in  the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And particularly as you see spending from the NIH  dropping, you need private investors and private practitioners to come in  and help the situation. </p><p>And here comes you-- Jay Alix.  Thank you so much.  Great to see you both.   Thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>ALIX:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. John Noseworthy and Jay Alix joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Congress returns to Washington.  We break down how the  Democratic control of the House may impact your wallet.</p><p>And then pay $100 to not watch the game, the new ticket option for Warriors  fans with no view of the court.  Wait until you hear this one.  Stay with  us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, November 13th,  your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Futures are indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning after a  sharp selloff yesterday.  The Dow Industrials set to be up 150 points right  out of the gate, that's two thirds of one percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up 17  right now and the NASDAQ is up 57 points, that's almost one percent higher.  </p><p>This after the major indices took a sharp hit yesterday, five percent  decline in the Dow and the NASDAQ component Apple, that took a chunk out of  markets with Apple down five percent, the Dow was down 2-1/3 percent and  the NASDAQ was down almost three percent at the close yesterday.  S&amp;P 500  with a decline of 55 points, down almost two percent.  </p><p>Well, that was then this morning we're seeing a bounce in the U.S. and  Europe.  FT-100 is up a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante is up a half a  percent and the DAX Index in Germany is up almost one percent.  </p><p>Mixed performances in Asia overnight to report.  Nikkei Average worst  performer in Japan, down about two percent.  The Shanghai Composite was the  winner up about one percent.  </p><p>Crude oil continues to slide this morning, take a look at the price, down  another two percent after oil closed lower yesterday for 11 days in a row,  we are looking at a bear market here.  It is down 20 percent from the highs  in just the last five weeks.  What does that tell us?  </p><p>Earnings out today, Home Depot with a double beat earlier this morning, the  stock is up 2-1/2 percent on better than expected earnings and revenue at  Home Depot. </p><p>Meanwhile, back in session, Congress returns to Washington today for the  first time since Democrats won the House in the midterm elections.  What  the divided House will mean for your wallet coming up. </p><p>And tragedy on the court, a star Nets player suffered a gruesome ankle  injury in last night's game.  We'll have the details coming up this  morning.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, Congress returning to  Washington today to a new political landscape.  I spoke with House Majority  leader Kevin McCarthy this weekend along with Congressman David Cicilline  on Democrats the \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" program about the agenda going  forward.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Well, we'll want to  find common ground.  We will look to make sure we continue to make our  military strong, make sure that we can combat China and others of their  aggressive actions and also when it comes to trade expanding, we want to  find places that we can find common ground.  But those place that's we  principally disagree with, we will stand up strongly to show America the  difference to make assuring that we can continue to grow this country.  </p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (R), RHODE ISLAND:  Democrats ran on a very specific  agenda.  I helped craft it with my co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and  Communications Committee.  It's an -- it's an agenda for the people on this  country.  It's focusing on driving down the cost of health care, driving  down the cost of prescription drugs, protecting coverage for pre-existing  condition, raising family incomes by rebuilding our country with a serious  infrastructure plan for our roads, bridges, ports, transit systems, we'll  create 16 million good paying jobs.  And taking on the corruption in  Washington by getting money out of our political system.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Congressman-elect, or Florida's 6th  Congressional district and former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel Michael  Waltz.  Lieutenant Colonel, good to see you this morning.  Congratulations  to you and thank you for joining us.  </p><p>LT. COL. MICHAEL WALTZ (R), CONGRESSMAN-ELECT, FLORIDA:  Thank you.  Yes,  thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, let's talk first about the new Congress and what  you expect to get done now working with the Democrats.  </p><p>WALTZ:  Well, you know, one of the things that I'm very excited about in  this Congress is the amount of veterans that are running on both sides of  the aisle.  I think that's something that's really resonated with voters.   They understand that veterans know how to get things done.  They're not as  ideological.  You know, I can tell you Maria, in the fox hole, nobody cares  about party, race, religion, social economic background, the enemy's  bullets certainly don't care.  </p><p>And you know, I think you're going to see an approach or at least at an  ethos where compromise isn't a dirty word.  Where we can move the country  forward because you're going to have folks.  Right now, we're at a record  low in our nation's history at around 17 percent of veterans in Congress.   I think that's going to increase.  You're going to see people focused on  mission, on country and on getting things done.  That's what I heard from  hundreds of thousands of doors that people want results.  They don't want  resistance.  And they expect their elected representatives to accomplish  what they set out to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, I guess, should we expect defense spending to stay elevated  then?  </p><p>WALTZ:  I think so.  You know, I can tell you from firsthand experience  after 17 years of war our military, our equipment is exhausted.  You have  pilots that are younger than the planes that they're flying.  And we face  unprecedented threats between Russia, China and still a metastasizing  growing Islamic extremism problem.  So, I think we're going to have to.   There's really not a choice there.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  One of the huge issues  though, Congressman-elect, it's Dagen McDowell.  Good to see you again.  </p><p>WALTZ:  Thanks Dagen, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is that the U.S. is on course to spend more on the interest on  our debt than even on defense spending.  That's going to happen about four  to five years from now.  So in order to make sure that our military is  sound in terms of it's our financial support, we need to figure out how  we're going to rein in spending elsewhere.  What's your plan on that?  </p><p>WALTZ:  Well so, there's two ways, right, to -- you know, I'm a business  owner as well as a veteran and there's two ways to deal with debt.  You  deal with it with growth and with cutting spending.  I think President  Trump's absolutely spot-on on what he's doing to grow the economy as a  business owner himself.  And then I think you need members that have the  fortitude to stand up and take on -- to take on spending.  Not only do I  support the military but I also hold the Pentagon accountable for when  there is -- when there's waste involved in their spending in all government  agencies.  </p><p>But Dagen, we both know that on the one hand you have the discretionary  spending and then you have the nondiscretionary spending and what gets at  the heart of that is the cost of health care.  We have to take -- I'm very  -- I'm fascinated to see if the Democrats will take on what it takes to  lower the cost of care.  Tort reform, selling across state lines, going  into a free market system, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, really getting  serious about driving down the cost of care which would then make it more  accessible and affordable and help businesses like mine and help our debt.   .</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Congressman, Mitch Roschelle.  One of the  things that concern business owners, my friend recently did a study of what  are on the mind of business leaders, and the number one thing that they're  looking for in a bipartisan way is cyber security.  And you talk about  defense spending.  I think they're interrelated.  Do you think that's an  area -- because I haven't heard much from Washington about policy around  protecting intellectual property.  You know, from -- not just from theft  but from a cyber security risk.  Is that something that you think could be  an agenda, especially, you know, more military people obviously they have a  pretty good sense of cyber warfare.  </p><p>WALTZ:  You know, I can -- I can tell you, watching China roll out its  sixth generation stealth fighter which looks exactly like ours, armed  drones which looks exactly like ours, underwater submersibles which look  like ours, doesn't sit well with veterans.  And they've essentially stolen  that intellectual property.  So, you know, this is -- this is about how the  private sector and the government come together in a way that's in line  with American values, not dictated from Washington.  </p><p>But look, I think we're getting to the point where we really have no choice  and the more business owners, the more veterans you have on the Hill that  understand those dynamics, I think the better.  So yes, that's something I  certainly want to take on.  </p><p>Look, we have to as a country.  We are having our technological edge be  stolen in front of our very eyes and at the -- you know, at the same time  this is something that President Trump I think has taken on, Republican  Congress needs to take it on.  And I hope the Democrats join us in that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what has taken place since the midterm  elections, Tuesday night.  There's still no winner for the state Senate.</p><p>WALTZ:  Less than a week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's talk about Florida.  There's still no winner for the  gubernatorial and the state Senate race.</p><p>WALTZ:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The controversy over a recount is continuing this morning.   Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum has relinquished the race -- had  relinquished the race against Republican Ron DeSantis.  But he took that  back.  What do you think is going on here?  And what's your reaction to the  fact that in Arizona we see now a change in leadership post the midterms,  now Sinema is winning or won?  </p><p>WALTZ:  You know, in Florida this is so concerning.  Frankly, it's  embarrassing for our state.  It's two counties that year -- you know, cycle  after cycle we're having these problems.  It's incompetence at best.  It's  fraud, you know, frankly at worst, as many have alleged.  This is happening  year after year.  I think we need to see accountability when it comes to  these election officials.  I can tell you, I had four counties in my  district and the T's were crossed and the I's were dotted.  This is the --  this is the heart of our democracy.  As a veteran, this is what we fight to  defend and sacrifice to defend all over the world.  And they have -- they  have a solemn duty to get it right.  I'm glad to see so much attention but  -- on it.  But you know, once this is all said and done, I think you will  see Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott emerge as they currently are ahead.  There  needs to be some accountability afterwards so that we're not dealing with  this again in 2020.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to quickly point out something that Byron York  tweeted out that was mentioned on \"SPECIAL REPORT\" last night.  Like, Rick  Scott went into this, he was leading by 56,000 votes on election night,  tens of thousands of votes for the DeSantis lead going into this.  If a  recount reverses the initial margin of a few -- of more than a few hundred  votes it would be unprecedented, in the history of recent American  elections.  </p><p>WALTZ:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  According to FairVote, almost 4,700 state-wide elections between  2000 and 2016, only 26 of them went to a recount.  Of those 26, just three  recounts wound up changing the initial results of the race, it was one in  Washington, --</p><p>WALTZ:  Washington State.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- one in Vermont and one in Minnesota.  The average swing in  those three elections after the recounts, 311 votes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, watch these results.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this largely because of Broward County?  </p><p>WALTZ:  Broward County and Palm Beach County.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALTZ:  And this is -- but what has us so in sensed is this has been a  habitual problem.  This goes back to Bush versus Gore.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p>WALTZ:  And it happens cycle after cycle.  And what so many of us are  asking is, where is the accountability for these election officials?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're also asking that this morning.  Lieutenant colonel,  it's good to see you this morning, thanks very much.</p><p>WALTZ:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching as you take your post in the New Year.   Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz, Congressman-elect.  </p><p>Coming up, a nightmare on the court, the details after a player's gruesome  leg injury leaves some in tears, that's next.  </p><p>Then, Congress headed back to the Hill today, we break down how the  Democratic control of the House may impact your wallet.  Congressman Steve  Scalise is here.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, more of the NFL salute to service at Monday Night  Football.  Jared Max with the story now, Jared.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX SPORTS NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We have  been seeing NFL coaches wearing the Salute to Service gear, all available  for purchase at NFLShop.com.  Last night in Santa Clara, California, U.S.  Navy performed a flyover above Levi's Stadium.  Before the 49ers took on  the New York Giants, 49er's tightened George Kittle made sure to thank  every service member on the field last night.  Kittle amongst several  minors who donated game worn jerseys to raise money for the victims of the  wildfires.  Players, coaches and cheerleaders from Paradise High School  most now homeless from the fires, guests of the 49ers last night on the  field for the anthem.  </p><p>Before the Niners gave away 20-10 lead.  Giants' Q.B. Eli Manning tells his  critics I still got it.  Fourth quarter comeback, his first such win in two  years.  Odell Beckham Jr. dances the Carlton and Sterling Shepard with  catch the game winning score 27-23, Giants beat the Niners.  </p><p>Brooklyn Nets player Caris LeVert suffered a serious leg injury last night.   LeVert collided with Minnesota's Jeff Teague and came down hard on his leg.   He had to be carted off the court on a stretcher, hospitalized, no word on  the severity of this gruesome looking basketball injury.  </p><p>Golden State Warriors have a new plan, to allow around 200 more fans at its  home games.  The Warriors are selling monthly passes for fans to attend  games at Oracle Arena but -- but it's a really big but, the fans cannot  even see the court.  They can watch the game on T.V.  They can hear the  crowd roar.  And pay arena prices for booze and food and it only costs $100  a month.  Imagine that, Maria, you're paying $100 a month to get into the  arena to do what you can do at home, watch on T.V., minus the traffic.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.  I think they just want to be there for the  excitement of it but you can't see a darn thing.

Joining us right now is National Taxpayers Union  senior fellow and Center for a Free Economy board member Mattie Duppler.   Mattie, good to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>MATTTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION:  Yes, good  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we want to get a sense of what you believe can happen  between now and January, this next seven weeks, can the current Congress  get anything done knowing that they're going to have new pressures come  January with the House leadership?  </p><p>Bbb Maria, that is the perfect question to be asking.  Right now there's  been a lot of attention on what Democrats will do when they finally control  the House Chamber coming in in January.  But you're right, there are  several weeks of work still to be done.  </p><p>I'm watching a couple of different things here.  One is what happens on the  next betting decision, on December 7th parts of the government funding will  expire.  And that means Democrats have a choice to make.  Do they want to  be party that shows they can govern or will they take their heels in and  start to make demands on spending bills?  It really depends on who you're  listening to.  If you're trying to anticipate what Democrats will do, you  heard Chuck Schumer earlier this week talk about how he may want to load up  that spending bill with language that includes something to do with  investigations of the president.  That of course would set a signal that  Democrats are not willing to govern, do not have any interest in getting  things done.  And I think will make things very difficult in the New Year.  </p><p>So, we're have to see -- we'll have to see what happens with House  leadership.  If Nancy Pelosi decides that that is not the path she wants to  take, there could be an opportunity for bipartisan agreement on a spending  bill.  Typically in a lame duck session taxpayers do not benifit from  decisions that are made on spending bills there.  And Nancy Pelosi,  remember, when she was speaker, she was the one who governed probably some  of the biggest omnibus spending bills in the past.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And we had the majority leader Kevin McCarthy on  this weekend.  And he said that there are two appropriations bills that  they're going to get to.  Of course, one of the big issues at stake is the  Republican tax cut plan, 2.0.  McCarthy joined me on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" along with Democratic representative David Cicilline who want to  have the number four spot in Democratic leadership in the new Congress.   They have both different views on what they're expecting to happen.  Watch  this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been working on Tax Cuts 2.0.  Does that go away at this  point given the fact that not one Democrat voted for you -- first tax cut  plan?  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  I don't believe so.  Because it's already passed the House.  We  still have a number of weeks and session that's over in the Senate.  We  will continue to fight for it.  Because Maria, it is the right principle.   It is the right policy.  And that should overcome politics.  We should put  people before politics and I'll be excited to see the day that the  Democrats want to join us with that.  </p><p>CICILLINE:  The fact is that tax cut gave 83 percent of that tax cut to the  top one percent, to the richest people in this country and now the  Republicans are proposing we pay for that by cutting Medicare and Social  Security.  We can't do that.  We've got to protect Social Security and  Medicare.  We need a tax cut for middle class families not 83 percent of it  going to the top one percent, richest people in this country and the most  powerful corporations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I've got a prospect on that because 80 percent of the tax  cut plan did not go to the top one percent as you know, Congressman.  The  tax cut plan lowered all income levels and they doubled the standard  deduction.  So, that talking point -- </p><p>CICILLINE:  Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it is true.</p><p>CICILLINE:  And Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe you get there because the corporate rate was cut.  Are  you saying you want to have corporate -- </p><p>CICILLINE:  Thad's right -- that's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you want the corporate rate at 35 percent?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  Well, so, you acknowledge it's right.  83 percent does go to  the top one percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, do you want to raise the corporate tax rate?  Is  that what you're saying?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  Well, I don't -- what I say, we have to do is we have to be  responsible about that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you want to keep with this talking  point that is inaccurate.  That's fine.  You can do as you will.  </p><p>CICILLINE:  No, it's the fact, it's not inaccurate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do you -- the question is what do you going to do on taxes?   Are you looking to raise taxes, are you looking to reverse the economic  policies of this president?  </p><p>CICILLINE:  No, what I think we need to do is give a real tax cut to  working families, to middle class families, that's permanent and long- standing.  Not giving 82 percent (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That sounds like -- that sounds like what's being worked on  right now, Tax Cuts 2.0.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And of course, we know the facts on taxes, Mattie.  Mitch  Roschelle, you're here.  You responded and reacted to that interview.  You  and I were e-mailing each other.  Give us the facts on who pays the taxes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I also screamed at the television set on Sunday, just to be  clear.  But the top 10 percent of taxpayers in this country, and that's  those Households earning over $133,000 pay 70 percent of the tax.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Bottom line.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.  So, and that was based upon the last time the tax  foundation did this.  So the fact of the matter is, -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just lies.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- it's just not true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mattie, is  that -- are we going to just have bluster for the  next two years, lots of lies and inaccuracies and get nothing done, what do  you think?  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, we will see.  Look, (INAUDIBLE) just called in the Arizona  for the Kyrsten Sinema.  She is one of the only Democrats who voted to  extend those tax cuts.  Those Democrats who wants to see those tax cuts  made permanent.  We'll see if Democrats continue to push back on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and not one of them voted for the tax cut plan in general.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  Exactly right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mattie, thank you so much.  Mattie Duppler there.  Still ahead,  divided in half, the details on Amazon's plans to split its second  headquarters, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   It is a busy morning.  It is Tuesday, November 13th.  Your top stories  right now 8:00 a.m. on button on the East Coast.  Markets are set to  rebound this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a modest gain at  the start of trading.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial average up 130 points right now, one-half of one  percent.  The S&amp;P is up two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ with a 53- point rally this morning up three quarters of a percent.  A much different  day than yesterday, where we saw serious broad-based sell-off on Wall  Street.  Apple and Goldman dragged the markets lower.  The Dow was down 600  plus points.  That was 2-1/3 percent.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 sliding nearly two percent on the session.  And at the close,  the NASDAQ was the worst performer.  It was down nearly three percent on  the session as Apple and other technology stocks really took the NASDAQ  down sharply at the close.  Take a look at global markets this morning on  the heels of the strength you're seeing on Wall Street this morning.   European markets following suit.</p><p>The FT-100 is up a fraction, the CAC Quarante in Paris us a half of a  percent, 21 points higher and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  90  points higher in Germany.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances there,  take a look.  Worst performer was Japan, the Nikkei average down better  than two percent.</p><p>Well, the picks are in.  Amazon will soon call Long Island City York and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the decision to split its  headquarters, the second headquarters.  The announcement is expected as  early as today.  That would be the official announcement but we know this  is coming up one percent on Amazon this morning in terms of the stock.</p><p>Meanwhile, let's go to California where raging wildfires are continuing  this morning.  The infernos burning a path of devastation.  The death toll  up to nearly 50 people right now between these massive fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand that makes this the deadliest fire in the  history of United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are going to take you live to Southern California to get the  very latest there.  Massive devastation.  New questions this morning for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  important 737 jet.  That's the same model that was involved in the deadly  crash in Indonesia last month.  I'm going to be speaking with the Chairman  and CEPO Dennis Muilenburg this morning and he is here in studio in a Fox  Business Exclusive.</p><p>He will join me at 8:30 a.m. Eastern to answer these questions as well as  to tell us about the backdrop for his business today.  Also joining the  conversation this morning, House Majority Whip and Louisiana Congressman  Steve Scalise as Congress gets back to work this morning.  Also this  morning joining me is CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Lindsey,  good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Lindsey, we were talking earlier about the markets and about  that sell-off yesterday.  We just came off of the quarter where we saw  profit growth up 29 percent year-over-year.  So why are markets so nervous?</p><p>BELL:  We haven't seen growth that great since before 2000.  So that is a  very impressive number.  It's the third quarter of over 20 percent earnings  growth.  And that is largely due to the tax reform package that we got  earlier this year and fiscal stimulus.  But the problem now is that fiscal  stimulus is peaking, monetary policy is tightening.  The Fed is running off  its balance sheet here.</p><p>And the question is where do we go with growth from here?  There is a lot  of uncertainty still out there on trade and to me, between trade and the  Fed, those are the two biggest things as I look to 2019 to determine where  growth -- the growth trajectory will be going.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, we saw some of the big tech names come down a lot  yesterday, Apple down five percent which is a serious number for Apple.  Is  the worry about growth largely in some of these high flyers like in Apple,  or are we just talking about economic growth going from 4.2 percent in the  second quarter, 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter to something very  different in 2019.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  I think it's more about economic growth.  The tech sector is  being weighed on by the trade disputes obviously and then also I think that  with interest rates rising the evaluations that we've seen in some of that  really had investors turn a little more skittish.  It's been dragging the  market down but as we look to 2019, look, if we get 2-1/2 to -- to 2.9  percent GDP, that's really solid.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And really much better than what we saw the prior 10 years.  </p><p>BELL:  Exactly.  In a slowdown in growth from the four percent that we saw  in the last quarter could help you elongate this bull market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sounds like you think things went overdone yesterday on the  downside.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And I just think volatility is here to stay for a while but we  are optimistic, we have 3100 price targets for the next 12 months in the  S&amp;P 500.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  3100 and it is now at 2726 on the standard &amp; poor's.  Lindsey,  thank you.  Great insights always from you.  I'm going to turn now back to  the Capitol Hill.  Congress is back in session today for its final two  month stretch, spending immigration and the fate of the Mueller probe  expected to dominate the debate.  Joining me right now is the House  Majority Whip, author of the new book, Back in the Game, Steve Scalise.</p><p>And we are really happy you are back in the game, Congressman.  It's good  to see you.  </p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  Maria, great to be back  with you.  Great to be back in the game.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations on the book.  You know, I  was so happy when I saw the book because I thought I'm really happy he is  writing about this incident.  The whole country was just so worried about  you after that shooting at the baseball -- at the baseball course.  So  we'll get to that in a moment.  But you just heard Lindsey Graham talking  about the economy.</p><p>Are you expecting growth to slow?  You just had this landmark tax cut  reform that you put in place earlier this year and now people are worried  that the economy is going to slow down. </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, you know, we were seeing so much economic growth and it was  working the way that we intended.  When you -- when you see tax cuts for  every single income group and of course lower to middle income people are  the ones who benefited the most.  And now with Nancy Pelosi being expected  to be sworn in as Speaker in January, it does concern people that they want  to go backward.</p><p>They want to raise taxes again, go to like kind of big government,  government-controlled healthcare.  All the things that Pelosi did when she  was speaker before.  So, you know, it is definitely concerned people and  slowed down the growth.  Let's see what happens but we're going to be  battling that too.  We're not going to -- we're not going to let this  country go back to those days, the 10 years of slow economic growth less  than two percent growth for eight straight years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know we're waiting on couple of situations in Florida this  morning but it looks like Republicans will keep the majority in the Senate  based on what we're seeing.  </p><p>SCALISE:  And actually grew their number in the Senate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And grew their numbers but I'm talking about these, you know,  questions in Florida and -- but yes, growing the numbers in the Senate.  So  should that make us feel that the Democrats being in the House majority now  will not be subject to stopping the President's economic agenda?  I mean,  what does this mean in terms of the House leadership taking the majority?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, I think the most important thing that you don't see us go  backwards.  And, you know, even if Nancy PelosI's agenda which will be to  try to grow government, to try to raise taxes, higher, they're not going to  be successful ultimately because the bill would have to be signed by the  President.  But what it does mean is the things that we were going to do  tax cuts 2.0, the work that Chairman Brady and his committee were already  engaged in to try to make those tax cuts permanent.</p><p>To build on the growth we're seeing in our economy.  It's going to be very  difficult to get those things accomplished once Nancy Pelosi is speaker for  at least two-year period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, do you think -- I was with David Cicilline, Democratic  Congressman who0 wants to get into leadership, the leadership race is  obviously happening this week, and he said he doesn't like the corporate  rate where it is.  Do you think there's any chance that he would be  successful in raising the corporate rate?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, I saw that interview and you pressed him I think  appropriately because ultimately he didn't want to say it but you can tell  what he was trying to imply was he wants to raise the corporate rate and  it's OK if he tries to do that which he will not be successful by the way.   But if he tried to, what does he going to do with those millions of jobs  that we're bringing back to America because we lowered the corporate rate  to be competitive.</p><p>America lost its competitive edge and everybody acknowledged that.  It  wasn't a partisan issue.  And so when we made our country competitive  again, we're seeing the benefits of it by millions of new jobs being  created for families who want to get in the work force.  Why would he want  to take that away, we're not going to let it happen but it shows you they  do want to raise those rates even higher.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They want to raise rates and they want to have investigations  around President Trump.  You've got six weeks or seven weeks before the end  of the year.  What can you get done in this next seven weeks?  I know you  have spending bills, appropriation bills that need to be tended to.  Tell  us what you're expecting in terms of success this year.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Maria, there are a few important bills that are right up front  and center that we have to deal with the funding of the Department of  Homeland Security which is critically important to keeping America safe.   And of course the big fight, there is going to be overfunding the wall.  In  the House we've been moving forward to try to give the President the $5  billion that he's requested to start fully building out the wall.</p><p>There is some money he has to start building about 100 miles of wall.  We  want to go a lot further, you know, that's going to be a battle we have.   The other big battle is going to be over the farm bill.  And Maria, Farm  Bill Policy expired a few weeks ago and the big fight has been over work  requirements.  You know, here you've got this great robust economy where  there are more job openings and people looking for work.</p><p>And yet we put a provision in the House that says, if there is a job out  there in your able body, you ought to be able to go and look for work  instead of getting taxpayer funded welfare benefits and the Democrats  oppose that, so we have a big impasse over that.  And imagine, at a time  when people are looking for work, the Federal government is paying people  not to work and we said, look, if there is a job out there for you, you  have to go take it or else stop getting taxpayer money.</p><p>And we'll even pay you to train you to work if there's not -- if you don't  have the proper training and that's what they're opposing right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  All right.  Are there any plans to cut  spending?  The idea of debt and deficits in our face and getting more  expensive just to hold the debt.  This conversation is getting louder.   What are the plans in terms of spending cuts and is it possible that the  Congress and the President make a mistake of looking for something to come  together with the Democrats choosing infrastructure and then creating even  more debt by spending $2 trillion on an infrastructure package.</p><p>SCALISE:  All right.  That is continuing to be a concern.  One of the  reason we didn't get an infrastructure package is because we couldn't get  an agreement over how to pay for it.  We weren't in this Republican-led  House, we weren't going to pass a bill that was just going to add to the  deficit.  One of the things we had in our healthcare bill that passed the  House had protections for people with preexisting conditions.</p><p>But a reforming Medicaid, one of the most broken forms of healthcare by  block granting it to the states, letting the states actually be innovative  and coming up with better ways to run healthcare for lower income people.   It's saved over $800 billion just through the innovation.  You didn't have  a reduction in money, it just actually allowed states to be more flexible  with the money.</p><p>That saved $800 billion.  It failed by one voted in the Senate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SCALISE:  Huge disappointments there in a lot of fronts but it would have  made healthcare more affordable, protected people of preexisting conditions  and transformed Medicaid into a much better program at those kind of  savings.  That was what's at stake in this election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  We all remember the infamous thumbs down on the Senate.   Let me -- let me ask you about the preexisting conditions because that's  another talking point on the left that the Republicans do not want to  protect preexisting conditions.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Yes.  It was a false claim.  In fact they spent millions of  dollars promoting that false claim.  And I talked to members and so many of  these swing districts and they said, look, they're lying about this,  they're spending two, $3 million in T.V. ads lying about it.  And so they  had to go on T.V. and spend -- they didn't have two million, they might had  a million and half to say that it wasn't true.</p><p>And so people got confused, they weren't sure what was the case.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCALISE:  But our bill -- our bill actually protected people with  preexisting conditions.  It's in the bill, they knew it, they didn't care,  they just said it anyway.  Look, you know, they're going to get the  majority.  I think it's going to be a short-lived majority but at the same  time a lot of those candidates who won said they're going to be pro-life  and pro-gun and they're going to vote against Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Well, their very first vote as a member of Congress in January is going to  be for Nancy Pelosi as speaker.  You know, which side are they going to  choose, the -- you know, the people back home that they promised one thing  to or what's going to happen up in D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've got your leadership races this week, tomorrow night,  the vote tell us what you're feeling in terms of how things stack up.  Are  you expecting that Kevin McCarthy will be the Minority Leader and you will  tell us about the role that you're expecting.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Yes.  I think Kevin will get the votes and he will be the  minority leader.  I'm running for the minority whip position and feel real  confident and the votes that we have and, you know, we'll go forward but at  the same time it's going to be interesting to see which route they go, the  Democrats do when they're in power.  They're going to just be about  harassing the President, subpoenas and even impeachment.</p><p>That's not what the American people wanted.  You know, ultimately they're  going to have to -- they're going to have to decide which route they go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Just to change the conversation, so that's the  conversation for the next two years as opposed to what you've been able to  do in terms of legislation. </p><p>SCALISE:  And we've got to be I think a lot better at articulating the  things we stand for as conservatives.  That's one thing that I think we  didn't do well.  We've got to do a lot better at and we're going to get  there but I think there's going to be a sharp contrast now because you're  going to see the approach that Nancy Pelosi would take as speaker.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm glad you mentioned -- a lot of people mentioned the  messaging on the Republican side.  Let's talk about your book Back in the  Game, what role did your recovery have in writing this book?  Tell us why  you wrote the book.  </p><p>SCALISE:  Well, you know, as you talked about earlier, there were so many  people that came together to help me, you know, not only to save my life in  those first few hours after the shooting, but to help me get back in the  game and essence to be able to learn how to walk again.  Just to learn how  to do basic things that I couldn't do in those first few weeks after the  shooting.</p><p>And, you know, I had a lot of -- a lot of support and prayers by the people  like you were praying, people all over the country were praying and there  were so many miracles that we chronicle in this book and the book we talked  about.  What my wife Jennifer and I talk about these little miracles that  happened along the way.  And we also talked about the people who did so  many heroic things every step of the way to save not only myself but all  the other people that were out there that day.</p><p>And then ultimately to help me through the recovery process.  And it really  is an inspirational book because it could have been a lot different in how  it ended.  You know, so many cases like this don't end the way it did.   This actually has a happy ending and thanks to god, to miracles, and to the  support and prayers of so many people.  We chronicled it all in the book.   Back in the Game and I'm really happy with how it came out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were so worried.  Everybody was worried about you, we -- I  mean, it was so serious.  Did it change the way you look at things?  Did it  change the way you approach your job?  </p><p>SCALISE:  Maria, if anything, it sharpened my focus on the things that  matter in life and I think I removed a lot of clutter in life.  You know,  all of us do things every day that some that we want to do, some that you  just kind of do because it's a routine and you focus on what's really  important, my family, my faith, you know, the work that I do, I love my  job.  You know, and it illuminated the things that aren't as important and  much happier today. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.  Thank you for your leadership.   So happy you're here.</p><p>SCALISE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Steve Scalise.  Check out the book back in the  game.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeting this on trade.   France makes excellent wine but so does the U.S.  The problem is that  France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France and  charges big tariffs while doing so.  Whereas the U.S. makes it easy for  French wines and charges very small tariffs.  It's not fair.  Must change.   The President obviously touting European leaders on trade this morning.</p><p>Switching gears.  We want to bring you to California and show you this  devastation which is just unreal.  We have two wildfires whipping across  the state. The campfire is the northern part, now it is the deadliest fire  in the state's history.  And the Woolsey fire taking a major toll on  Southern California.  Fox News' Jonathan Hunt is in Malibu this morning.   Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.  Thousands of  families remain evacuated from this area of Southern California where the  Woolsey fire has hit so hard.  That likely to be out of Malibu and other  areas for I would say at least another 24 hours.  And take a look at what  hundreds of families are going to come back to find when they are  eventually let in.</p><p>Everything they have built over their lives, everything they've worked for  completely and utterly destroyed.  It is a similar story up north -- the  camp fire near Chico, California.  Now as you mentioned becoming officially  the deadliest in state history.  42 people have been killed in that fire.   More than 100 still remain unaccounted for and the entire town of Paradise  is basically wiped out.  Listen here to the fire chief.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID HAWKS, DIVISION CHIEF, CAL FIRE-BUTTE COUNTY:  It's just absolutely  heartbreaking to drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.   My family lost their home in the fire, my parents did, my grandmother did.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HUNT:  President Trump tweeted last night that he has now approved and  expedited major disaster declaration for California.  That tweet coming in  the wake of tweets over the weekend, in which he was critical of  California's forest management.  That sparked a firestorm of criticism.   He's now changing his tune paying tribute to the heroic firefighters who  are still on the frontlines, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jonathan.  Thanks very much.  We will be watching.   Jonathan Hunt in Malibu this morning.  Coming up.  Concerns in the sky.  A  new report says Boeing withheld information on its 737 plane.  The same  model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash last month.  I'll be speaking  exclusively with the chairman and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg about  that in less than 10 minutes.</p><p>As we take a break, we are watching the price of oil this morning.  And as  you can see, it is down 1-1/4 percent below 60 right now.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump continuing to tweet this morning.  Here's what  he just posted.  The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low  approval rating in France, that's 26 percent.  And an unemployment rate of  almost 10 percent.  He was just trying to get on to another subject, by the  way, there is no country more nationalist than France.  Very proud people  and rightfully so.  Make France Great Again.  The President writes this  morning.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Vive la, France.  Sorry.  I  just want to quickly say we have our pickup trucks, everyone.  We have our  tariffs on pickup truck imports.  They have their protections for one.   Let's move along and get along. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  All right.  Well, stocks getting yesterday on  weakness from technology meanwhile especially Apple.  The NASDAQ was down  almost three percent.  This morning we are looking at a rebound a bit, the  Dow industrials are up 77, the S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up 39  points after that sharp sell-off yesterday.  Joining us right now Wells  Fargo Investment Institute Head, global market strategists, Paul  Christopher. </p><p>Paul, good to see you.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when you come in today after since a rough day at the office  yesterday where the markets were down 600 points on the Dow.  What do you  do?  Are you a buyer or a seller here?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We're a buyer.  Look, it's -- the markets, it's still  worried about growth, it's trying to put in a bottom.  You don't have to  put in all the chips at once here but people have a lot of cash.  Our  clients held a lot of cash and we would like for them to put in a little  bit here at a time.  We think this is the best buying opportunity in U.S.  large caps since the November 2016 election.</p><p>So don't have to put it all in at once.  We're still looking for a bottom  but do start to take some positions especially in those growth-oriented  sectors.  </p><p>BELL:  So Paul, does that mean you take some positions in the tech, maybe  some of the FAANG names that have been beaten up or maybe are in bear  market territory right now off of their highs?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  It's a good question.  We've been market weight on  information technology.  We still think you should be market weight but  listen if you haven't had a chance to get into some of these stocks and now  you find yourself below market weight.  Again this is an opportunity to  take yourself back up to that waiting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Paul, it's Dagen McDowell.  It seems like the market gets really  shaken every time that 10-year yield gets to about only 3-1/4 percent.   Realistically how high a yield, a longer term interest rate can stocks  handle given a lot of names that are still -- that still look really  overvalued?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We think that bond yields, the 10-year for instance  will go a little bit higher over the next 12 months and that we think that  stocks will still be OK with that.  The problem is we're just getting this  transition period where we've gone from clearly low growth and low interest  rates to a little bit faster growth and somewhat higher interest rates and  that sort of a move always wrong foots markets until investors can  determine that yes earnings can continue to hit higher levels.</p><p>And it's -- those earnings ultimately over the long run that will be --  that will match the S&amp;P on the way up we think, you know, percentage for  percentage.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Paul, great to see you.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paul Christopher joining us.  Well Fargo.  New questions for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  737 model.  This is the same model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash  last week.  We will speak with Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg next,  exclusive coming up right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast.  Futures are indicating  a gain at the start of trading this morning.  Dow Industrials expected to  be up 69 points, that is about a quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 is up  almost half a percent, and the NASDAQ with a 39-point gain, up two-thirds  of one percent.  This, after a sharp sell-off yesterday where the Dow lost  two percent and the NASDAQ lost almost three percent.</p><p>European markets were mixed, the FT-100 is down a fraction, as you can see,  but the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are both positive.  Although off of  the highest levels of the morning, for sure.  Overnight in Asia, mixed  performances, take a look, the worst performer was Japan overnight in Asia.   The Nikkei Average was down on the session about two percent, as you can  see there.  </p><p>Oil is extending its losing streak this morning.  Crude oil under pressure  again now 11 days in a row lower, down 1-1/3 percent, below $60.00 a  barrel.  What is the price of oil selling off tell us about the global  economy?  We want to look at that, coming up.  </p><p>All of those stories coming up this morning, but first, our top story this  half an hour, new questions this morning for Boeing, The Wall Street  journal is reporting that Boeing withheld information on its 737 model,  according to safety experts and others.  That is the same model involved in  the deadly Lion aircrash in Indonesia last month.  And joining me right now  to discuss that and a lot more in this Fox Business exclusive is the  Chairman, President, and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg.  Dennis, it's  good to see you this morning.</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BOEING:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the story in The Journal obviously is very concerning.   What can you tell us in terms of what was told to the pilots and the  airlines about any new equipment in that 737?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, Maria, first of all, I think it's important that we all  express our sympathies for the loss of Lion Air Flight 610 and certainly,  our thoughts go with the families that have been affected.  We've been very  engaged with the investigative authorities throughout and providing all of  the information necessary to make sure we do a full assessment of the  situation.  And the bottom line here is the 737 max is safe, and safety is  a core value for us at Boeing, it always has been, and we ensure that our  airplanes are safe.  In fact, this airplane went through thousands of hours  of tests and evaluation, certification, working with the pilots, and we've  been very transparent on providing information and being fully cooperative  on the investigative activity.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what happened?  Apparently, there were 10 computer -- the  computers about the angle of the nose were not accurate and then the plane  went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you have a sense of what went wrong?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, as the Indonesian authorities have pointed out initially,  there were some indications of inaccurate angle attack signal that was  being sent to the airplane, and of course, our airplane has the ability to  handle that, and we have procedures in place.  And we've already issued a  couple of additional bulletins to our operators and pilots around the world  that point them back to existing flight procedures to handle that kind of  condition.  So again, we're going to continue to support the investigation  as it proceeds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And was there -- I mean, one of the Boeing officials quoted in  The Journal today, one high-ranking Boeing official said that the company  had decided against disclosing more details to cockpit cruise due to  concerns about inundating average pilots with too much information.  Was  that a decision now that you regret?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Now, again, we ensure that we provide all of information  that's needed to safely fly our airplanes.  Again, this comes as out of  thousands of hours of testing and evaluating and simulating, and providing  the information that our pilots need to operate our airplanes safely, and  we'll continue to do that.  As I said, as part of the process here, we've  already issued a couple of bulletins to pilots and operators that point  them back to existing flight procedures to handle this kind of situation.   So, we're going to continue to fully cooperate in the investigation.  I  think it's really important -- again, the bottomline here, the 737 Max is a  very safe airplane and we're very confident in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But was there a new -- well, there are new system that wasn't  disclosed to the pilots.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  No, there are new systems on the airplanes that are designed  to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane and to provide  control capability in high-angle of attack conditions, and those systems  operate properly.  And again, in certain failure modes, if there's an  inaccurate angle attack sensors feeding information to the -- to the  airplane, there's a procedure to handle that.  And so, again, as part of  the investigation process, we're going to make sure we fully understand  that.  We're going to make sure that we're providing all of the information  necessary and appropriate training, and go back to the core value here, is  that the airplane safe, we know how to fly it safely, and we're very  confident in that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was that information in terms of what to do should something  change -- was that information available to the pilots?  Did they know how  to operate it should the nose be in a different position?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.  In fact, that's part of the training manual, it's an  existing procedure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  So, the bulletin that we put out again last week and over the  weekend, pointed to that existing flight procedure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, obviously, I know that you're answering lots of  questions this morning and this week after this horrific crash, and you're  going to get more information.  What would be the timing on that?  When do  you expect to hear from the FAA on this?  </p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, this is an ongoing investigation, so it will take  whatever time is necessary to make sure it's done thoroughly.  Again, we  participate fully in these investigations, we've provided technical  assistance, we'll continue to do that until the work is complete.  It's  very important that we do this in a diligent and thorough manner.   Bottomline is we want to ensure safety in the system, and continue to have  confidence in the 737 Max.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the 737 has been a cash cow for your business, this is a  very important business.  There were some headwinds in the supply chain in  terms of the 737, which I want to ask you about.  And I know over the  recent past, you've expanded the business, you've got commercial aerospace,  you've got defense, and then you've got services.  Tell us how business is  right now, because commercial aerospace has been driving the stock  obviously for several years right now?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, aerospace is a tremendous growth business.  We look out  over the next 10 years as an $8.1 trillion marketplace.  Passenger traffic  is growing at about six to seven percent per year sustained.  The world  needs about 43,000 new commercial airplanes over the next 20 years.  A part  of that is the 737 as we've ramped up to 52 a month, this year, we're  producing at 57 a month next year.  And we have had some supply chain  challenges as you -- as you pointed out, as we've been growing.  But we are  briskly moving to a recovery.  We just announced delivery numbers for  October earlier this morning, so we delivered 43 737s in October which is  an all-time record for October, and we're continuing to March smartly to  our recovery plan, and expect to meet our year-end targets for deliveries.   This year, for the first time, we'll deliver more than 800 commercial  airplanes.  By the end of the decade here, we'll be delivering more than  900 airplanes a year.  So, you can see the tremendous growth here in  commercial airplanes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible and I know you got an incredible backlog as  well --</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which will continue that delivery calendar.  One out of four  or five planes go to China in terms of your deliveries.  Tell us about the  importance of the business in China.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, China is very important to us.  Today, about a third of  our 737s go to China, about one-quarter of our overall deliveries.  So, if  you look at that marketplace around the world, 43,000 new airplanes over  the next 20 years, about 7,000 of those are in China.  It's the fastest  growing market segment right now.  China needs that lift capability to  serve their economic growth needs, so China is very interested in the  healthy aerospace economy.  </p><p>As you know here in the U.S. as well, there's a big advantage to a healthy  aerospace ecosystem.  We have about 90 percent of our manufacturing jobs  here in the U.S. even though we export about 80 percent of what we build.   So when you look at trade deficit versus trade surplus, aerospace is the  biggest trade surplus for the U.S., about $80 billion a year.  And our  business is the biggest piece of that.  So, that a mutually-beneficial  relationship between the U.S. and China as it applies to trade and the  aerospace is very important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what happens now with this trade spat that we're having  with China then?  I mean, have you seen any backlash from the Chinese in  terms of your business, given the fact that the President is sitting there  waiting to put another 250 billion on exports from China on tariffs and  this fight between China and the U.S. intensifies?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We've been very engaged in that dialogue, as you know, this is  a very important topic to us.  We've been talking with the President and  the U.S. administration, extensively.  They're very aware of the situation  and the importance of aerospace.  We've also had a very good dialogue with  Chinese leadership and our customers in China.  And we're encouraged by the  dialogue that's going on.  </p><p>I think you've seen some recent reports that President Trump and President  Xi plan to meet around the G20 summit that's coming up.  Some productive  dialogue going on on the trade front, we think both countries are  interested in a mutually successful aerospace ecosystem.  It's good for the  economies of both countries.  And here in the U.S., it's really important  to U.S. manufacturing jobs.  We have about 13,000 companies in our supply  chain here in the U.S. that are supporting that kind of manufacturing  growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has the air supply chain changed in any way because of your  services business?  I mean, you're pursuing this more aggressive strategy,  does that mean that in time -- in terms of selling a plane to somebody or a  business, then you want to maintain that plane as well by using the  services there, but are you taking away business from the suppliers?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We're actually see this as a grow the pie business.  So,  something we can do jointly with our suppliers.  Services is our biggest  single-growth opportunity.  When you look at that $8-trillion marketplace,  it's the place where we have the biggest opportunity to further grow.  And  we're bringing capabilities like parts distribution, maintenance, and  modifications.  New software, digital solutions, training solutions for our  customers, doing that jointly with our suppliers.  </p><p>To date -- year-to-date, our services business has grown 12 percent in a  market that's growing about three percent a year.  So, it is growing,  growing strongly, and by doing this jointly with our supply chain, we can  provide better light cycle value for our customers.  And that's really the  lens we're looking through here, not only how we design and build  airplanes, but how do we provide value for our customers for post- production support.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This sounds like a natural fit.  I mean, the commercial  aerospace business has been so strong, and walk us through that for a  moment because most people don't understand the number of people who've  never been on an airplane.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The number of people who are perhaps in Asia who are wanting to  travel, this is a big opportunity for you.  So, this is also an economic  growth story.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  It is.  And, Maria, you bring up a really great point.  As I  said earlier, traffic is growing -- passenger traffic at about six to seven  percent a year completely outstripping GDP.  And some of the things that  are driving that is the upcoming middle class that for the first time ever,  is able to travel.  So, we have this unique combination of backlogs, seven  years of backlog.  And every year in Asia alone, 150 million people fly for  the first time.  Less than -- less than 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's amazing.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Less than 20 percent of the world's population has ever taken  a single flight.  So, think about the growth opportunity that's still ahead  of us, and we're feeding right into that with our design and productions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But here we have worries in the market, down 600 points  yesterday, worries from economic worries that things are going to slow  down.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where are we on that in your view?  You've got interest  rates rising obviously when a company or country buys a plane, or several  planes, they are in many parts doing it by borrowing, their borrowing costs  are going up with interest rates.  How much of a headwind will that be for  you?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  We're not seeing it affect our business.  Again, we have a  much longer term view.  Today, we have a backlog of almost 5800 commercial  airplanes if you think of that in terms of production volume, it's about  seven years of backlog.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  So, this gives us the opportunity to think long term in terms  of capital investment, innovation investment.  And while we pay attention  to things like interest rates and the financial markets, it's not something  that's really affecting near-term buying behavior.  You know, today, we're  selling 737 Maxes, filling our production skyline out in 2023 and beyond.   So, we have a much longer term perspective.  Aerospace is a strong long- term growing business.  It's not -- it's no longer a cyclical business.   This is a long term sustained growth business.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the competition is fierce.  I mean, airbus -- can airbus  sell to European countries and companies with no tariffs?  So, are you  disadvantaged by the tariff situation given the fact that a European  jetmaker Airbus can do it a lot cheaper?</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Well, something we're paying close attention to.  To date, we  haven't been affected materially by the tariffs.  Things that have affected  steel and aluminum pricing.  We source 90 percent of our aluminum here in  the U.S. so it hasn't been a dramatic effect on us, but it's something  we're paying a close attention to.  The bottom line is it's a very  competitive marketplace because it's a very attractive marketplace.  Now,  we have to continue to invest, to compete.  We have to continue to invest  to innovate.  Tax reform, for example, in the U.S. has been something that  has really helped us gain a level-playing field globally so that we can  compete and win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How can you grow the defense business at this point?  A lot of  worries that defense spending needs to either be capped or cut, given the  trillion-dollar deficits we're talking about every day and the debt of 21  trillion.  </p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, we see the defense budget here in the U.S. sustained, and  if you look back a couple of years when we were in the middle of  sequestration.  We feel like we're in a stronger budget position now on  both sides of the aisle.  So, we look to the U.S. defense budget to remain  strong.  But we also see growth around the world.  Today, about a third of  our defense backlog is outside the U.S.  So, again, this is a very global  business, and there's a lot of defense growth opportunities outside of the  U.S., and I think the thing that's unique about Boeing is when we think  about growth, we look across commercial defense and services.  We're really  the only aerospace company that can bring great big critical mass to all  three of those sectors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Dennis, it's great to have  you on the program.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Likewise.  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Dennis Muilenburg, ceo at Boeing.  We will  be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump just tweeting again.  He says this, \"By the  way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France  because of almost zero visibility.  I suggested driving, Secret Service  said no, too far from airport and big Paris shutdown.  Speech next day at  the American cemetery in pouring rain!  Little reported -- Fake News.\"  The  President referring to some criticism that he received from the media on  failing to go the cemetery that dual.</p><p>We want to turn to Amazon, congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  slamming Amazon's plans to partially bring (INAUDIBLE) headquarters to New  York City.  Joining me right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart  Varney.  And Stuart, there was a reason that so many cities across this  country were vying for Amazon to come to their city and set up their new  headlines.  Does she not understand business and economics?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, she does not.  I don't  think she wants to.  There's no pleasing some people, and that's the truth.   There's no pleasing a socialist.  I'll quote you exactly what she said.   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, Amazon is a-billion-dollar company.  The  idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks is  extremely concerning to residents here.  Has the company promised to hire  in the existing community?  What's the quality of jobs?  How many are  promised?  Are these jobs low wage or high wage?  Are there benefits?  Can  people collectively bargain?  There's just no satisfying a socialist.  They  see no benefit to investment, capital infusion and growth.  They don't see  it.  They simply see a big corporation.  Give me the money.  I just want  the money.  That's what it's all about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm astonished, actually.  I would have thought that when you  bring 25,000 new jobs, a couple of billion dollars to your city, it would  be universally approved, but apparently not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the first thing she does, Dagen, is she complains that  Amazon is getting tax breaks (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And she says Queens City councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer and state  Senator Gianaris have also come out against the Amazon deal while Mayor  Bill de Blasio says that this could be the single biggest economic  development deal in the history of New York City.  So, here's a word,  Amazon, find another city, I dare you.</p><p>VARNEY:  For once, I'm on Bill de Blasio's side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stuart, I know you'll have more in 10 minutes.  We'll see you  at the top of the hour, thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right  after MORNINGS WITH MARIA 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Stay with us.</p><p>But first, driving innovation, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the  journal's technology conference, featuring the CEO of Uber.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The future of technology, the Wall Street  Journal's Tech D.Live conference is underway this morning where big names  and descending on Laguna Beach, California.  Susan Li is there.  Susan,  good morning.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you, Maria.   Yes, we'll be talking all things tech here in Laguna beach.  That includes  government regulation, innovation, and future partnerships.  Now, later on,  to the program, will feature a lot of heavyweights, that includes Uber CEO,  Dara Khosrowshahi, one of the headliners.  And then, we have celebrity  attendance as well.  Gwyneth Paltrow will be holding the evening session  along with Kevin Hart, the comedian.  Last night, we heard from AT&amp;T's  Randall Stephenson who has some interesting things to say about President  Trump, about Jim Acosta, Time Warner and CNN, and we also heard from  (INAUDIBLE) of Google.  </p><p>Now, we also caught up with Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's former CEO,  billionaire, owner of the L.A. Clips.  And I think that the overarching  theme her are like going to be so far has been this -- talk about the  relationship between the White House and big tech.  And whether or not  they'll be more regulation in the future of big Silicon Valley names.  I  asked Steve Ballmer this.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT:  I don't think Microsoft has much  risk at all right now.  We certainly had ours in the past.  Amazon will  have their own set of issues.  The most important thing for anybody running  a successful tech company where there's not a clear issue.  It's just to  continue to do their job well, be responsible.  I think Amazon has done a  very good job so far.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LI:  Yes.  It was an -- a great job, Jeff Bezos has done a great job as  Steve Ballmer says.  We'll talk more later on today and we have more  interviews coming to you and coming on Fox Business from Laguna Beach.   Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff.  Susan, thank you.  Susan Lee joining us  there in Laguna.  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Back  In a Minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey  Bell.</p><p>BELL:  Look, the markets might be going well, but the bedrock of the  country, the consumer is strong and we saw that in Home Depot's numbers and  we'll here about that from retailers later this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bullish (INAUDIBLE) Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think the markets just need to calm down.  You know,  sometimes good news is bad news, and bad news is good news.  Right now, the  market just needs to calm down, calm down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, it's the stability.  Look long term, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And New York City, I'm going to tweet this.  I think the  Governor of the New York -- of New York state and the major of New York  City, maybe need to do a conference call with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to  explain what 25,000 jobs mean in terms of the tax revenue, and how that  actually helps fix the New York City subways.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's a reason that every city in the country wanted the  Amazon headquarters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  They all wanted it.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner Mitch  Roschelle, and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell, with us this  morning.  Good to see you.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Cannot wait for that Boeing  interview.  That'll be fantastic.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that'll be good, because this is -- there are new  questions this morning, but at the same time, Boeing has been operating on  fire. </p><p> I mean, this company is seeing commercial airline business up strongly, the  defense business up strongly, and the stock has held up well.  </p><p> Of course, they are trading down in the month of October.  Like the other  defense contractors, they had a tough month. </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  It'll also be interesting because there are  some trade considerations with a company like Boeing.  Their rival Airbus  in Europe, so it'll be interesting to see what he has to say about that as  well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're absolutely right.  And China is the number one market  for the business in terms of new planes and aerospace business.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  We are at tend of earning season, which Lindsey will get  into.  Ninety percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, but we've got  retailers this week.  </p><p> Home Depot just came out with numbers beating on revenue and earnings per  share.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The numbers are on the screen right now.  The estimates call  for $2.26 a share.  The company is reporting earnings of $2.51 on revenue  of -- better than the estimate, which was 26.26 billion and here is the  renew estimate coming in better than expected at 23.6 billion.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Overall S&amp;P 500 earnings are up almost 29 percent from a  year ago.  The expectation going into the quarter was 22 percent, so it was  a terrific quarter on earnings.  </p><p> A lot misses on revenue, 40 percent of companies missing on revenue  expectations.  This was a beat.  We get Walmart later this week and some  other big retailers like a Macy's, so.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's interesting to see this market performance, Lindsey, in  the face of 29 percent profit growth year over year.  </p><p> BELL:  I know.  And I think it's still like we always talk about, it's all  about the outlook.  The outlook was a little bit weaker than expected for  many companies as we looked forward to the fourth quarter and into 2019.  </p><p> There are rising raw material costs, the strong dollar certainly impacting,  but you and I was -- we're talking about that in the green room.  </p><p> And so expectations for growth in 2019 have been coming down.  All through  this year, we're looking for 10 percent earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p> Now we're at about eight and a half percent, which is still a very, very  good number, but there are still a lot of uncertainties out there with what  the fed's going to do, what's going to happen with trade, and then where is  the dollar going.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  What I -- what I like about the home improvement industry is  these are discretionary spends.  </p><p> BELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And it tells you something about the consumer, when they're  discretionarily spending on things.  You don't have to fix up your home,  you don't have to do home improvement, and when you do it, that's when the  customer feels strong.  </p><p> So, that may give us an indication of what the rest of the retail season  looks like.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's also a really important focus on the consumer.  </p><p> This week, we will hear -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- as you said, from Walmart and Macy's tomorrow, but Home  Depot numbers' better than expected.  </p><p> As we worry about a growth slowdown, where is the consumer in that growth  slowdown?</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Well, I mean you know what, I think the consumer remains  confident and higher interest rates aren't scaring them away from doing  home improvements.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which is good because the home sales this year have been in kind  of a slow slide for much of -- much of the year in terms of declines in  home sales in consecutive months.</p><p> BELL:  Yes.  Which is why Home Depot's stock hasn't done so well this year.   It's down about five percent year to date.  </p><p> These numbers look to be pretty strong, and we'll have to get into the  details.  But, you know, the concern is home sales have been weak, interest  rates are rising, are investors going -- are peep -- are consumers going to  invest in their homes and fixing them up?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you look at a market, like we saw yesterday, where Apple  was really the problem.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Down sharply.  And you wonder if that's indicator of slowdown.   People are worried about unit sales, worried about a slowdown in Apple.</p><p> This is the most important product that identifies really what we're  talking about in terms of consumer spending.  </p><p> What did you think about the market selloff yesterday?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that a lot of this is still a hangover from Apple  suddenly announcing that it's not going break out its unit sales because it  does look like they're trying to hide something, quite frankly.</p><p> And, you know, this was -- they act like that breaking out the unit sales  of these products isn't important today.  Well -- but -- you know, why was  it important then years ago when you -- when you launched the iPhone?</p><p> That's number one.  I'll just point out that stock is still up almost 15  percent year to date.</p><p> So it was roughly immune to what happened to, say, in Amazon in the month  of October when Amazon went into a full-blown bear market in that stock.  </p><p>Apple is still up, it's, you know, pretty -- seeing a pretty sharp decline  in the -- so far in November.  </p><p> But, again, still double-digit gain year to date.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's really indicative of the story overall, of the worry,  the story of this market.  We are worried about growth, worried that things  will turn down and you see a company like Apple and Home Depot really  indicative of the consumer.</p><p> BELL:  Yes.  And I think yesterday's action in Apple really did spook  especially tech investors because exactly to your point, Amazon's in bear- market territory.  Apple has been the value in the tech sector.  And it's  been able to hold up and support the group.  </p><p> And so if growth is slowing there, we -- do we have a bigger problem  overall?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was on a report about suppliers.</p><p> BELL:  Right.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Two -- </p><p> BELL:  Two suppliers.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's another thing, the suppliers made guidance  warnings and, you know, you think thank back to what Dan Niles said a  couple of weeks ago with the inventory build-up.  </p><p> I mean he mentioned that Apple had inventories up 89 percent, quarter of a  quarter -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- in the second quarter and that was an issue because if  you've got an economic slowdown and you've got people pulling back in terms  of spending, well, what are they going to do?</p><p> First, they're going to buy the inventory that they have.  Can they  actually get rid of all of that inventory?  </p><p> And if you see China slowing down, is China -- are the Chinese going to buy  a phone for a thousand dollars?  So, that's why Apple is such an important  indicator in terms of what's going on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I will argue also that yesterday was kind of a delayed reaction  to that move-up in long-term interest rates last week where you saw the 10- year.  Every time -- and we've had this happen several times in the last  month or so.</p><p> Every time that 10-year treasury yield gets closer to 3.25 percent, because  it hit a new -- it was like a seven and a half year-high last week, that  rattles investors and the bond market was closed yesterday.  </p><p> But I think that that is definitely playing into, you know what, if longer- term interest rates are at three and a quarter, three and a half, you know,  those earnings, I need to pay a little bit less for those earnings way,  way, way out in the future on these big-growth companies.</p><p> BELL:  Yes, and that's a huge impact on the tech sector.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BELL:  Which is supposed to have the best earnings growth in 2019.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let -- </p><p> BELL:  It has had the best growth in the past two years. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's zero in on this stock market and really what's going on  this morning.  Joining the conversation, we got the Chairman, President,  and CEO of Boeing here in studio this morning, Dennis Muilenburg.  </p><p> My special guest in the fact of this new report from the Journal on its  737.  </p><p>Louisiana Congressman and current House Majority Whip, Steve Scalise, joins  us with his reaction to the midterm elections and what can get done.</p><p> Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane  is with us this morning, along with the CEO of the Mayo Clinic, Dr. John  Noseworthy back with us as well.  </p><p> And Florida Congressman-elect, former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel  Michael Waltz, joining us as well.  A lot to talk about.  Big guest lineup  today, don't miss a moment of it.  </p><p> And of course we are watching markets this morning after that major selloff  yesterday driven by weakness in technology and Apple in familiar.  </p><p> Joining us now is Fort Pitt Capital Group Partner, Vice President, as well  as Senior Portfolio Manager, Kim Forrest.  Kim, good to see you.  Thanks  very much for joining us.  </p><p> Your reaction to the -- </p><p> KIM FORREST, VICE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FORT PITT CAPITAL  GROUP:  Thanks.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the market selloff yesterday and what to do  now?</p><p> FORREST:  Sure.  Well, I think you guys covered it ably, you know.  All the  factors that you cited are just exactly in line with what I saw.  </p><p> The raise in interest rates, you know, made these higher price stocks a  little less desirable.  </p><p> I do think that Apple may not be something that the -- that is a great  thing about -- a great -- I don't know, point of data about how consumers  are spending because you did get those great Home Depot numbers.  </p><p> And I think Apple's its own little issue.  But that being beside that, I  think today is a tremendous opportunity if you have long-enough time  horizon -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> FORREST:  -- to really look and see stocks that you may want to buy right  now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting you say Apple could have its own  issue.  I mentioned Dan Niles has been covering this company for years.  </p><p> FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  AlphaOne Capital Partners, he almost predicted this trouble for  Apple and the technology sector a month ago.  Watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are we looking at fundamentals deteriorating within technology?</p><p> DAN NILES, FOUNDING PARTNER, ALPHAONE CAPITAL PARTNERS:  I think you  absolutely are, and this is exacerbated by the fact that you have a lot of  inventory out there.  </p><p> So, if you pick the biggest company in the world, Apple, for example, they  have 89 percent inventory growth year over year in the June quarter that  they reported.  Their revenues were up 17 percent.  </p><p> Well, what if the iPhone doesn't sell well?  They're going to have to barn  that inventory off when we get into the March quarter.  </p><p> Look at last year, they had one phone priced above a thousand dollars.   This holiday season, they have three phones priced above them.</p><p> The average selling price, they're trying to boost it by another hundred  dollars.  </p><p> The problem is, if you look at smartphone units overall, this will be the  first year in history that smartphone units are down year over year.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kim, you might say that Apple is its own specific story, but -- </p><p> FORREST:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- doesn't it feed on itself?  I mean if you've got a lot of  inventory out there in technology and you can't sell it because things are  slowing down, that's going to trickle into other retail and other tech.</p><p> FORREST:  Maybe.  We're going to put a big maybe there because here --  here's the issue, I look at tech very differently than a lot of analysts.   We're talking about Apple, which is almost solely consumer-oriented tech.  </p><p> I am really excited about more enterprise or business-related tech because  I think as wages are starting to go up, businesses have to once again think  about how do I make my employees more productive?  </p><p> And it's not by watching Netflix, it's not by, you know, participating on  Facebook and maybe it's not by buying Apple products.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> FORREST:  But still, semiconductors underlie this whole trend of making  people more productive through software and hardware -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> FORREST:  And it's delivered on semiconductors, so that's what I'm kind of  throwing out there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p> FORREST:  And I do think Apple is, you know, an issue in and of itself.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> FORREST:  It is very high-priced products and maybe not everybody, you  know, needs to buy a new Apple phone every 18 months -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> FORREST:  -- like they have in the past.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, what about Amazon?  The Journal is reporting this morning  that the company is ready to choose New York City and Northern Virginia as  the new homes for Amazon's new headquarters.  </p><p> Kim, good or bad move on Amazon's part to split the second headquarters?   What do you think?  </p><p> FORREST:  Well, I really thought Pittsburgh was the winner here, but, you  know, we're going to leave that behind.</p><p> But, no, I think it's really smart, especially because it looks like  Amazon's going to have to develop its own in-house brands for clothing and  what better place than New York City to do that.</p><p> The Virginia aspect is kind of interesting, it's close to the government  and, you know, I think they need to address a whole lot of maybe regulatory  issues.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> FORREST:  So, you know, that makes a whole lot of sense there, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Oh, just really quickly, I'm sure we'll get to this in the show,  but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has just been elected to Congress,  representing part of Queens, is calling in to question Amazon moving into  Queens.  </p><p> The idea of we receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a  time when our subway is crumbling out and our communities need more  investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here that -- </p><p> Well, we will just talk about that, because that shows a fundamental  misunderstanding of the way an economy works.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it's a misunderstanding of what the whole point in giving  tax breaks to companies are.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's the whole point, is to lead to jobs.  </p><p> FORREST:  Right.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Twenty-five thousand jobs.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you -- do you have a leave -- do you have a leave?  Because  that gives me a headache.  That economic analysis -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I have an Advil for you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- is just -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I might have an Advil for you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kim, thank you so much.  We will see you soon.  </p><p> FORREST:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're watching all of the above.  Kim Forrest joining us.   We'll take a break.  </p><p> When we come back, wild fires are out of control in California.  The  multiple blaze is burning across the state, becoming the deadliest in the  state history.  The very latest coming next.  </p><p> And then withholding data, new reports suggest Boeing did not share  potential problems with flight control systems.  It could have played a  role in the Lion Air jet crash next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  In Northern California, wild fire becoming the  deadliest in state history.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details right  now.  Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  The  monster campfire has now killed at least 42 people in Northern California,  hundreds are still unaccounted for.  President Trump has approved a major  disaster declaration for the Golden State. </p><p> In Southern California, that's where you have the Woosley Fire that's  destroyed more than 400 homes and businesses.  That fire has killed at  least two people.  </p><p> Thousands of structures remain at risk, red-flag warning in effect for L.A.  and Ventura counties, and obviously the weather is not helping the  situation.</p><p> Well, Boeing reportedly withheld information on the Lion Air jet that  crashed in Indonesia last month, killing all 189 people on board.  </p><p> The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Boeing didn't tell airlines about  potential hazards in a new flight control feature on their 737 Max.  </p><p> The problem is that the system can push the plane's nose down so strongly  that pilots can't pull it back up.  The automated stall prevention system  is being investigated as playing a role in the crash.  </p><p> Shares of Boeing are up a quarter of one percent.  And premarket trading,  Maria, you will talk to Boeing Chairman, and CEO, President Dennis  Muilenburg.  That's at 8:30 this morning.  </p><p> Everybody stay tuned for that that.  </p><p> Well, fans worldwide are paying tribute to a real superhero.  Stan Lee, the  father of Spider-Man, The Hulk, Iron Man, and many other memorable comic  characters, died yesterday in Los Angeles.  </p><p> Lee was a legendary Writer and Publisher of Marvel Comics whose creations  revolutionized comic books.  </p><p> His comics were often turned into blockbuster movies, generating billions  of dollars worldwide. </p><p> Stanley dead at the age of 95.  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren.  Thank you so much.  Coming up next, midterm  madness.  More inconsistencies in the Florida recount process.  They are  popping up as the judge tells both sides to ramp down the rhetoric, that  and other races still not decided right after this break.  </p><p> And then a tidy box, this new design for Tide's detergent driving the  internet nuts this morning.  We will tell you why.  Stay with us on that.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching markets this morning after a big  selloff yesterday.  Futures indicating a rally at the start of trading this  morning.  </p><p> We are looking at a gain of about 145 points on the Dow Industrials, that's  two-thirds of one percent after a 600-point selloff yesterday.  </p><p> The S&amp;P is up 16, and the NASDAQ is up 60 points right now.</p><p> I want to turn to the midterm fallout.  New oversight, the hours on the  senate race has been called.  Kyrsten Sinema, becoming the first democrat  elected in 30 years.  </p><p> In Georgia, a judge extending the deadline to certify votes in the  governor's race there.  </p><p> Republican Brian Kemp is ahead by nearly 60,000 that votes right now, but  Democrat Stacey Abrams is filing a lawsuit to count rejected ballots.</p><p> And then in Florida, ballot drama, the recount is in full swing right now,  but large counties are scrambling to meet the deadline of Thursday.  </p><p> Fox News' Griff Jenkins is in Lauderhill, Florida.  He's at the Broward  County Office of Elections.</p><p> Griff, good morning to you.  </p><p> GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  </p><p> You may be watching the markets, but I'm watching ballots being separated  in Broward County.  Take a look at this.  The tabulation room, they still  have not begun the recount here.  </p><p> Now in 65 of Florida's 67 counties, they are either halfway done or even  more from the recount being done, but here in Palm Beach County, they're  far from it.  What they have to do is finish separating page one.  </p><p> Then they'll likely do a calibration of the machines and begin the actual  official tabulation recount.  That isn't expected any time before about  9:00 a.m. here so it's quite an issue as they race towards the Thursday  deadline to get those numbers in.  </p><p> But we were surprised, Maria, yesterday when the Election Supervisor here,  Dr. Brenda Snipes, came out, talked to the media, and addressed allegations  that she has made major mistakes this election, take a listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BRENDA SNIPES, SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS, BROWARD COUNTY:  The lawsuits, as  they are written, certainly cast dispersions on my character.  </p><p> I've have worked here for about 15 years and I have to say this is the  first time that this office or I have been under such attacks, so if we  make mistakes, we own mistakes.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JENKINS:  Then the stunning development, FormerFlorida Governor, Jeb Bush,  tweeting that he believes Snipes failed to comply with the law in multiple  counts and called for her removal.  </p><p> Jeb was the one that appointed her in 2003 to replace the previous  supervisor who had to be removed for similar problems.  </p><p> Meanwhile, on the national level, Senator Nelson and Governor Scott trading  nasty barbs, listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. BILL NELSON (D), CALIFORNIA:  Scott cannot oversee this process in a  fair and impartial way, and thus he should remove himself from any role in  the recount process.</p><p> GOV. RICK SCOTT (R), FLORIDA:  Our goal is that we follow the law.  We know  Brenda Snipes mixed illegal ballots with legal ballots.  We know they've  not let party officials in, the courts have said follow the law.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JENKINS:  If they do indeed get this recount started and meet that Thursday  deadline here in Broward County, Maria, lawyers tell me that they expect  the margin of error to be under that .25 percent and will be headed for a  hand recount after Thursday.  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Griff, thank you much.  Griff Jenkins this morning on  that.  </p><p> This is an incredible story, that now we see that Sinema has actually won  in Arizona and these other two are so close.  </p><p> I mean, Georgia, 60,000 votes sounds like a lot, but she's still fighting  in Georgia, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She is still fighting in Georgia, so -- but the Republicans know  definitively that they will still have a 51-seat majority in the Senate,  that's the take away from that.</p><p> But in terms of what's going on down in Florida, there's a history in  Broward County of problems there.  </p><p> I just want to point that out because Brenda Snipes seems to suggest that  people are attacking her and her character, well, there have been glitches,  mistakes, and even illegal ballot destruction in her county under her  supervision.</p><p> The -- a court ruling found in May, Broward Election Supervisor Brenda  Snipes illegally destroyed ballots from a 2016 congressional race with  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was trying to push off this primary challenger,  Tim Canova.  </p><p> So again, there's a history of problems there and raises the issue of if  you were the steward of the county when these problems happened, why was  she still there going into the midterms?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why is she saying that she's been on this job 15 years and this  is the first time she's getting attacked when we know darn well that there  have been issues in the past?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think that Miami Herald and all the newspapers in the State  of Florida write about these problems often and so now that she's in the  national spotlight, maybe it feels a little bit different.  </p><p> But there are issues there and they're front and center during the  midterms.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Count and recount.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll keep following that.  </p><p> We'll take a break.  When we come back, searching for deal, Vice President  Pence is looking to set a trade agreement with japan that would serve as a  model for other countries.  </p><p> General Jack Keane is here, he will weigh on that.  </p><p> And then on precedence and security, as drug lord, El Chapo, sees his day  in a New York Court.  He will be here today in New York to face that.</p><p> The very latest straight ahead.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Futures, indicating a bit of a bounce, this morning, after a sharp selloff  yesterday, Dow Industrials set to open up about 130 points that is one-half  of one percent, S&amp;P is up 16 right now, and the NASDAQ with a gain of 57  points, good for gain of almost one percent out of the gate, this morning.  </p><p> This after the major indices took a big hit yesterday, a five percent  decline in Apple stock, took a chunk out of this market, that's a Dow  component and a NASDAQ component, the Dow was down 602 points at the close,  down better than two percent, S&amp;P was down about two percent, and the  NASDAQ with a 206-point selloff, was down almost 3 percent, yesterday.</p><p> In Europe this morning, the bouncing is continuing, the FT-100 is also  recovering along with stocks on Wall Street, that is up a quarter of a  percent, in London.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up almost half a percent  and the DAX Index in Germany, up three quarters of one percent, 87 points  higher.</p><p> Mixed performances in Asia, overnight, worst performer, Japan; Nikkei  Average down two percent, the Shanghai composite in China, up almost one  percent.</p><p> Crude oil slipping this morning, this after the price of oil closed lower,  yesterday, for 11 days in a row, the very latest on oil's bear market,  coming up.  It is down 20 percent from the highs, just 5 weeks ago.</p><p>Home Depot, reporting earnings this morning, they were better-than- expected, the improvement store out with double beat.  We will break it  down for you as the stock is up 2-1/4 percent, that's helping the Dow  Industrials for sure.</p><p> Zuckerberg won't go, the Facebook founder could be held in contempt after  declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.  And  another Tide controversy to report, the detergent's new packaging being  compared to a box of wine, we will get into all of that, coming up.</p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour, mounting pressure on China,  Vice President Mike Pence headed to Singapore, to talk trade, with the  Association of the Southeast Asian Nations.  Speaking with Japanese Prime  Minister Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo, yesterday, the Vice President took a strong  stance on China, ahead of the President's meeting with President Xi, at the  end of the month.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The United States seeks a  relationship with China that's based on fairness, reciprocity and respect  for sovereignty.  The difficulties that the United States and other nations  face with China have been well documented by our administration.  And China  knows where we stand.</p><p> Nevertheless, President Trump is looking forward to his meeting with  President Xi, in Argentina.  He believes that progress could be made, but  either way, we're confident that the United States remains in a strong  position.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that is FOX News  Strategic Senior Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's good to see  this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p> GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to  see you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you were just in Singapore, a few months ago, meeting with  leadership there, your take on the Vice President's comments and how  Singapore and the U.S. can team up here?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, yes, they're very concerned.  I just came back from Vietnam  this weekend also, they are very concerned about what China has been doing  in the region for years, and largely getting away with it.  You know,  because, the United States had never truly engaged competitively against  China.</p><p> And they think that we have a long way to make up for it, but they truly  appreciate the fact that the United States is back in the game, so to  speak, and they're pushing back on China's economic and political warfare  and also their militarization, particularly, the South China Sea.</p><p> And I think Vice President Pence's Seminole speech, a few weeks ago, on  China, caught everybody's attention in the Indo-Pacific.  And that was a  huge step forward for the United States, but most importantly for our  relationship with our allies.</p><p> So, I think Vice President Pence will be very welcome by the ASEAN leaders,  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and I think he will get positive  feedbacks for the fact that President Trump is, once again, exercising  American leadership in the region.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General, the President really has to walk a balance here,  because while pushing back on China, trying to get them to change their  behavior, it also could impact business.  We've got the CEO of Boeing  coming in here, this morning, to talk about his business.  In the coming  year and years, one in four or five planes made at Boeing, will go to  China.</p><p> This is the second largest market for Boeing, and that's just in the  aerospace maker, I mean, there are tons of other companies, as well,  looking to China for opportunities, so how does the President walk that  balance?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, I think, there has to be a balance.  Listen, clearly, China  is a major market and American businesses will continue to do work there,  to be sure, but I think what the President has done and illuminated the  issue in trying to find the balance and stop stealing our intellectual  property, stop -- </p><p> If you have to do business in China, as you well know, Maria, you've got to  enter into a joint venture with them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  That's not the way we do business in Europe or in the Middle East,  and as a result to that joint venture, they get access to our intellectual  property.  That's got to stop.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.</p><p> KEANE:  So, I think -- I think if we continue to do business, that's fine,  but let's get it on a balance table where it's much more equitable and it's  kind of the way we do business in other parts of the world.  I will tell  you this, a lot of the supply chain that exists in China, and from American  businesses and other businesses are looking to go elsewhere.</p><p> And in Vietnam, that I just came back from, they are reaping some of the  benefits of that, as will other nations in the region.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean -- I guess business has been dealing with, you  know, succumbing to China and handing over their technology and going by  their rules for so long that they forgot how unfair it was.  Look, the  other major point in the Vice President's statement yesterday, was on North  Korea.  Watch this, got to get your reaction.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PENCE:  The President has made it clear that the time for implementing the  agreement is not a driving factor.  And as I assured you, Mr. Prime  Minister, the pressure campaign will continue, the sanctions will remain in  full force, until we achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization of  North Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  New satellite images reportedly show that North Korea is moving  ahead with its nuclear program after Kim Jong-un's agreement with President  Trump, so your take on these developments, General?  What now?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, first of all, the Vice President's visit to Japan and talking  to Prime Minister Abe, I will tell you what, he got an earful from him  because that's the person that President Trump do talks in any other world  leader and he truly gives him very good perspective on what's going on in  North Korea and China.</p><p> Listen, the North Koreans, in principle, have agreed to denuclearized, in  fact, they have not taken a single step to do that.  What we wanted out of  the box was; one, give us an inventory of all of your sites and your  weapons themselves, two, give us a plan to destroy and disarm ballistic  missiles and nuclear weapons that has not happened.</p><p> And what we have to stay focused on, is the third thing, there's not been a  single ballistic missile or nuclear weapon that has been disarmed or  destroyed.  So while this progress on the fringes and there are a lot of  positive statements, the reality is, in terms of what needs to be done,  there hasn't been any substantive progress.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And for the U.S., what does that mean?  Should the U.S. be  doing something different in terms of our strategy to get the  denuclearization back on track?</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, that's a great question, and certainly that's something that  the National Security team of this administration is working on.  I would  suggest, one, we've got to -- we've got to get tough on China because  they've opened the aperture on the sanctions, and some of that backdoors  are happening.</p><p> The Russians have always backdoored North Korea.  We're not going to make  any progress with them.  The State Department has to make certain that the  other nations are not giving up, there's no missiles flying, there's no  tests being taken, there's a -- there's no sense of a crisis, so we have to  make sure the other countries are enforcing the sanctions.</p><p> And we've got to up our game ourselves and we can do that militarily, start  moving some things into the region, make sure that they know that we're  dead serious, it's either you give us the weapons, Mr. Chairman of North  Korea, or we're going to come take the weapons, that's the deal that's on  the table.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me ask you about oil, in that vein, President  Trump took aim at Saudi Arabia yesterday, after reports that the country  plans to cut oil production.  The President tweeted this yesterday,  hopefully Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production.  Oil  prices should be much lower based on supply.</p><p> Look, we know, General, that the U.S. has become one of the leading  producers at this point, and now, with the Saudis and OPEC, wanting to cut  production, they're trying to boost prices because it's in a bear market  right now, 20 percent lower from the highs.</p><p> KEANE:  Yes.  Well, this consensus in the last OPEC meeting, even the so- called Russian cartel, you know, they felt it was going to be a cutback  obviously, in Iranian crude, on the market and as a result of that, the  Russian cartel increased prices, but then this consensus developing now,  that there's going to be an oversupply in 2019.</p><p> I suspect -- the Saudis have made a decision to cut -- I think OPEC will  cut next month, in Vienna, and the Russians will likely follow suit.   That's the path that we are on.  I don't think there's anything that's  going to change it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I have been expecting a change in Homeland Security.  I know  that the Washington Post is reporting that Kirstjen Nielsen, Homeland  Security Secretary, is out, and I was hearing the same thing actually, that  they've already had the discussion.</p><p> My sources told me that they've already had the conversation that the  Secretary is going to be out of that job in -- as the President changes its  administration after the midterms, your thoughts on Kirstjen Nielsen being  out?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, I don't know anything about that, on the inside, honestly.   But I do know what I'm looking at and clearly, the administration has got  to be very frustrated with the open border that we have because there are  hundreds of people coming through every week, who are coming, seeking  asylum, and we have to release them.</p><p> And that's what's happening, because our system is so backed up with people  who are waiting to be processed.  The so-called catch and release, it's  hundreds, happening every week.  We are focused on the caravan to be sure,  but the equivalent to a caravan, is happening every month.</p><p> And that's got the administration's focus because they get daily reports on  all of this, and I think they are just genuinely dissatisfied with where  things are.  Certainly, the Congress is part of this problem, but it's not  the only part of the problem.  And I think that's likely what's driving the  replacements.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, the President -- the President cancelled the trip this  week, with Kirstjen Nielsen, to the southern border, in Texas.  Now,  that's, I guess, the Washington Post is saying this is the impetus.  But,  you know, as you say, he's been very frustrated with her, because of the  open borders, but she says it's a Congress problem.  She can't do anything  different because this is the law, General.</p><p> So, the President's frustrated with the person who is in the job, but  doesn't -- aren't her hands tied?</p><p> KEANE:  Her hands are somewhat tied.  But I suspect, now, this is just  speculation on my part, I suspect that the President has received some  advice from other advisers who are saying there are some other options that  we could be putting into play here, and certainly, having resources to cope  with the problem.</p><p> So we're not catching and release, would likely be a start.  And  increasingly, how we process these people in getting their hearings, would  be another part of the puzzle.  I just suspect that over time, there's been  a loss of confidence here if what you're reporting is accurate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KEANE:  There is going to be a replacement.  I think it's largely  immigration issue.  I don't even think it has to do with -- it's one of the  largest -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, you're right.</p><p> KEANE:  departments in government.  I don't think that has to do with  anything else.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, you're right.  It's totally the immigration issue, 100  percent, that's what I'm hearing.  But real quick, General, before you go,  any thoughts on who might replace her?</p><p> KEANE:  No, I have no idea.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  General, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so  much.</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  As always, General Jack Keane, joining us there.  Coming up,  Zuckerberg skips out, why the Facebook founder could be held in contempt,  after declining to appear in front of an international grand committee.   And then, first Tide pods, now this, the internet goes crazy over Tide's  new detergent design, it looks like a case of boxed wine, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The trial of El Chapo set to begin today in New  York.  Lauren Simonetti with the details now, Lauren.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  The notorious Mexican drug lord will be in a Brooklyn federal  court this morning with unprecedented security for the jurors and for  Joaquin El Chapo Guzman himself.  Security will include snipers perched on  rooftops and an armored vehicle to transport Guzman.  He's accused of  spending quarter century smuggling more than 150 tons of cocaine into the  U.S.  He was extradited from Mexico last year after escaping prison two  times.  The trial expected to last more than four months.  Prosecutors say,  the evidence will include the testimony of over a dozen witnesses.  </p><p> Well, a Canadian politician says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be held  in contempt after he refused to appear before an international panel of  five governments that are investigating the company.  That politicians says  he might issue subpoena forcing Zuckerberg to appear before Canada's  parliament.  Zuckerberg had rejected an earlier request to appear before an  international grand committee looking into disinformation and election  meddling.  Facebook not commenting, shares of the company up $1.23 this  morning.</p><p> Well, Procter &amp; Gamble may have another packaging problem.  The company  debut its eco-box, which happens to look a lot like a wine box but that new  Tide box is generating some buzz on Twitter.  This is what one user wrote:  \"You all don't want kids eating Tide pods but when you make a wine box  tide, what do you want from me?  Well, he was referring to the Tide pod  challenge last year when teenagers were daring each other to eat the  detergent pods but would you drink the Tide wine?  I don't know, I hope  that's not an adult challenge coming up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was a crazy story.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They were eating the pods.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  But looks like a wine box, right?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It does.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  I have freshman in college, and I'm frightened right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Where do you think that stuff happens, right?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's a keg, not a wine box.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Coming up, owing the best for your friends; how Petco plans to  provide your pet with only health foods.  That's next, stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, President Trump just tweeting this, we want to  get this out: \"Emmanuel Macron suggesting building its own army to protect  Europe against the United States, China and Russia, but it was Germany in  World Wars I and 2.  How did that work for France?  They're starting to  learn German in Paris before U.S. came along.  Pay for NATO or not!\"  The  president taking about his meetings and NATO pay your fair share, once  again, this morning.  </p><p> Meanwhile there's this, putting your pet first which we all do here on this  program.  Petco becomes the only major retailer of pet supplies to ensure  healthy food for your furry family members.  In a first on Fox Business  announcement, the company is revealing it will not sell foods or treats  containing artificial colors, flavors and preservatives for dogs and cats  by May of 2019.  Joining us right is the CEO of Petco, Ron Couglin, and  it's good to see you, Ron.  </p><p> RON COUGHLIN, CEO, PETCO:  It's great to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  I was telling you during  commercial break, I only used to serve Ellabela steamed string beans as  treats and she died at almost 18 years old.  She lived a long and strong  life as a result.  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  You what's amazing, over 50 percent of pet owners, cook for  their pets.  We were talking about it earlier.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Only 50 percent.</p><p> COUGHLIN:  Over 50 percent.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  And we're bringing human grade food actually into Petco shortly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, tell us about what you're doing?  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  Yes.  So, the big announcement today is that we're going to be  eliminating all cat and dog foods and treats with artificial flavors,  artificial colors, artificial preservatives.  You know, if you think about  the bet we love, do we want ethanol to be served to them, do we want sulfur  dioxide, do we want (INAUDIBLE), so the answer is no.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And those are in most pet foods?  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  Those are in certain pet foods.  Now, the reality is, Petco has  been weening off those products, other companies have much higher percent  of those foods.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen, Charlie and Ramon don't eat those, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, they eat a food that you can't buy at Petco.  They eat blue  buffalo basic, limited ingredient, grain-free canned food and also -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And also, I.D. which is prescription and you're going to begin  to sell prescription dog food. </p><p> COUGHLIN:  That's right.  This week, we started doing prescription dog food  on Petco.com.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, big response from customers?  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  Yes, we've seen response thus far, but today is our announcement  day, so we're very proud of it.  It's big deal for the industry.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's higher premium that people will pay.  It's amazing  to me how much money people spend on their dogs and their cats.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Anything -- most of my dogs have gastro, severe gastro  intestinal problems, so anything to keep them healthy but you were talking  about -- you're going to actually start selling cooked food, literally  human food for animals?  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, humanization is one of the biggest trends,  folks like you but you don't always have time.  So, what we're going to do  is we're partnered with company called Just Food for Dogs, and we actually  are going to have kitchens.  Union Scare, right here, is going to have a  kitchen where we cook for your dog; you can come in and get fresh food  every day for your dog.  My dog right now is having salmon and sweet  potatoes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Lucky dog.  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  So, if you're having salmon and sweet potatoes, your pet should  have it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And does this make a difference in the dog's life?  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  Absolutely, it's all vet-driven mixtures.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can't feed them too much, though, because they'll get fat  and that's a huge problem, obesity in animals.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Ron, real quick, we've been talking about the Petco Foundation,  maybe a little bit on that.  </p><p> COUGHLIN:  That's right.  So, we're very proud of the Petco Foundation,  especially in times and of hurricanes, fires, et cetera.  We go in and take  care of the pets, we give free food, we give funding to the shelters.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Ron.  That's fantastic.  Great, check out  Petco.  Ron Coughlin, thank you for joining us.  Still ahead, a diamond fit  for a ring, we will show you more of this ring designed by Apple's chief  designer; it's made entirely out of diamond, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, November 13th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 on the button on the East Coast.</p><p> Markets set to rebound this morning after a sharp selloff yesterday.   Futures indicate a gain of 128 points on the Dow, one-half of 1 percent at  the opening of trading.  The Nasdaq is up 56 points right now, almost 1  percent this morning after a broad-based selloff yesterday where the Nasdaq  was hit hard.</p><p>Apple and Goldman Sachs dragged the Dow lower but better than 600 points at  the close, down 2.3 percent on the Dow; down 2 percent on the S&amp;P; and on  the Nasdaq, the worst performer on the day, down nearly 3 percent as  technology took a real hit.</p><p> Global markets this morning are also recovering.  Take a look at European  indices.  The FT 100 is up a fraction.  The CAC 40 is up 23 points, that's  one-half of a percent.  And the DAX index in Germany is up 92 points.  That  is almost 1 percent.</p><p> In Asia, overnight mixed performances, the worst performer was Japan.   Nikkei average down better than 2 percent.</p><p> Well, the picks are in, Amazon will soon call Long Island City, New York  and Crystal City, Virginia home.

You couldn't see 10 feet in front  of you.  I mean embers everywhere.  Smoke everywhere.</p><p> It's devastating.  It's beyond words.  I mean there's no way to explain it.   It -- I mean it loks like a nuclear blast went off here.  It's crazy.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will take you live to southern California with the very  latest coming up.</p><p> New questions for Boeing this morning.  A new report says that the jet  maker withheld information on its 737, the same model involved in the  deadly Indonesia crash last month.  Boeing's chairman and CEO Dennis  Muilenburg will join me in a Fox Business exclusive this morning.  That's  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that interview coming up.</p><p> And a scare on the court, a Nets player suffers a gruesome injury leaving  people in the crowd in tears.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PWC partner Mitch  Roschelle and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see  everybody this morning.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for being here after a huge day yesterday in  markets.  Look, we're in a good earnings period, Lindsey, and yet the  market trades down 600 points on these growth concerns.  What's going on?  </p><p> BELL:  Yes. Growth is the big question mark for 2019.  Look, we're cycling  the tax reform package, fiscal stimulus is coming to a peak right now as we  look out to 2019, interest rates are rising.  It seems like global growth  could be slowing especially with China.</p><p> So the question is where do earnings go from here?  We're looking right now  at 8.5 percent growth for 2019, that's down from 10 percent that we saw all  through earlier this year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Revenue?  </p><p> BELL:  Revenue, it actually ticked up a slight bit to 6.3 percent which is  pretty good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're talking about earnings of 10 percent.  </p><p> BELL:  Earnings of 8.5 percent for 2019.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  </p><p> BELL:  Came down -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's way down.  No wonder markets are upset about things  slowing down.  For 2018 -- talking about earnings being up 25 percent;  going down to 8 percent in 2019.  </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  But so much of that was a one-timer from tax  reform.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And I think what the market isn't really fully digesting is the  forward guidance is in a new tax regime year over year mode.  And a lot of  people looking at the difference between the 20 plus percent earnings  growth in '18 and then less than 10 percent in '19 and they're having a  hard time digesting it.</p><p> We should put like -- maybe they should just watch this show and hear us  say this enough.  Because there's really no reason to freak out.  These are  still strong earnings numbers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BELL:  Yes.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  But a lot of this, I would  argue, is higher interest rates and the Federal Reserve still in the  process of winding down that multitrillion dollar balance sheet where  you've seen a deflation in assets, not just in the stock market, in the  last six weeks or so.</p><p> But look at what oil has done, down 11 days in a row.  That is a record  streak for declines in the cost of crude oil.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There are a lot of things at play, maybe actual supply and  demand fundamentals, but also money just coming out of this was clearly an  over-inflated asset.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then there's Apple, we'll talk about that.  What do the  price of oil and Apple tell you about the broader economy.</p><p> Coming up, my exclusive interview this morning with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk to him about what he's  seeing in the global economy, of course, commercial aerospace has been on  fire.</p><p> Joining the conversation this morning, House majority whip and Louisiana  Congressman Steve Scalise is here.  He's out with a new book.  Congressman- Elect Michael Waltz will join us, Green Beret.  And the CEO of the Mayo  Clinic is back, Dr. John Noseworthy, with some news today.  The host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney here as well.</p><p> We've got a big two hours coming up.  Don't miss a moment of it because we  are reporting this morning the news of the day.</p><p> Our top story right now is that sharp selloff in stocks.  Futures are  higher this morning as the technology sector tries to recover from a sharp  decline yesterday.  It pulled the markets lower, knocking off more than 600  points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p> Yesterday it was a sharp selloff and Apple really drove things, drove a  technology slump.</p><p> Now today, this morning it is unchanged after taking a hit amid fresh  concerns over the demand for the iPhone.</p><p> Joining us right now is Scott Martin.  He is Kingsview Asset Management  CIO.  Scott -- good to see you this morning.  I know you've had your share  of worries out there for markets.  Is yesterday's performance telling us  anything about what's ahead?  </p><p> SCOTT MARTIN, CIO, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Probably.  You know, you're  right, Maria -- without the markets I've got enough to worry about.  So  thank you markets for making that even more compounded.  </p><p> Listen, I love what you guys talked about there in the intro to the hour.   Lindsey is absolutely right.  You know, the revenue numbers estimates have  come down, the earnings estimates have come down.</p><p> Mitch is right, too.  You know, guys -- I started some meditation over the  last couple of weeks so you should definitely try that at home, kids.  I  think that has helped me with some of the worries -- Maria.</p><p> And the market needs stop freaking out.  You know, that's the thing like --  kind of like they say in the meditation, be calm because even though  earnings like you said, Maria, and you pointed out astutely are not growing  at 20 plus percent, guess what, kids -- that was unsustainable.  I mean  those weren't numbers that we're going to keep repeating.</p><p> But the market maybe got fooled into thinking that or let's just say we got  valuation metrics that seemed to be aligned with the thinking that that was  going to continue.</p><p> So as we alight or let's say descend back to reasonable numbers and  reasonable economic growth expectation, Lindsey mentioned interest rates  going up and so forth, the market needs to settle into some price here and  then I think it can rebuild some of these losses.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Scott, is there -- if you want to be defensive or if you want  to stay in the market but not have to meditate and do yoga to stay calm --  where's the place to be right now?</p><p> MARTIN:  Yes, and I haven't found any good yoga or meditation stocks yet,  Mitch, but I'm still looking for them.  You know, there are places to be  and that's a great thing to point out, you know.  This is not a total  freak-out selloff, even kind of like we saw in February just yet or even  like we saw over Brexit or even like we saw, you know, back in the late  2000s, you know, 2008 and so on, because there are things that are working,  specifically -- and we haven't bought enough of this stuff yet but we're  accruing it.</p><p> Look at consumer staples, look at real estate.  Look at utilities.  You  know, if interest rates come down because people like say with the freak- out, you know, they freak-out and they buy bonds, they buy fixed income  instruments and that drives down interest rates.  Some of these interest  rate sensitive names tend to hang in there when equity markets go like they  did yesterday.  </p><p> So Mitch -- I would say those are three good sectors for the individual  investors at home to look at that we start to pick up as well that have  started to mitigate some of the volatility.  </p><p> BELL:  Hey -- Scotty.  So you mentioned a lot of defensive sectors there  which as you rightly point out they've been doing well more recently.  But  what hasn't been doing well is tech.  and that is what led the market over  the past two years.  </p><p> Right now you have two -- three quarters of the S&amp;P 500 tech sector in bear  market territory.  Do we need the tech sector though to continue to move  this bull market higher?  </p><p> MARTIN:  We need something to, Lindsey and I'll tell you that's the  interesting point is you had these great leadership names -- you know, your  favorite ones and ones we still own.  You know, Google, Apple, Microsoft,  Amazon, Netflix, Whatever, Broadcom, Adobe -- great companies that were  crushing earnings and getting high valuations, again like we talked about  that were probably undeserved. </p><p> And now Lindsey -- the market has no leadership, you know.  Everybody has  been calling in the so-called experts, have said, oh my gods, this is the  time for financials because the Fed is hiking interest rates.  When the  reality for the most part, they were just flattening the interest rate  curve.</p><p> And so to me, it needs leadership.  I don't know if it's tech necessarily.   I was hoping for a while there it was going to be industrials because we  were hopefully going to get some of these trade deals reworked and more in  our favor and that was going to work out for some of the companies like  Deere, Caterpillar and some of the other ones we own.</p><p> But maybe it's health care.  That gets worked out with you know, maybe a  bipartisan congress.  Who knows?  But I think you're right, Lindsey.  It  doesn't necessarily have to be tech but it has to be some leadership in  some other sector to take the reins of this market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, what about financials?  I mean that's probably tough  because you've got higher rates going on.  Tech is where the growth has  been.  </p><p> MARTIN:  Yes.  Higher rates are interesting, Maria -- because even though  the fed's been hiking interest rates, rates did get a nice boost as we saw,  you know, into October and then they've kind of fallen off a bit.  I mean  look at, you know, last week we were at 3.25 again on the 10 year and now I  think I checked this morning we're at 3.15.</p><p> So, you know,, financials kind of remind me of all the girls that turned me  down in high school.  I had to bring that up.  Because they're never there,  you know.  Like financials every year we hear somebody make this bold call  on financials being there and being the one, and they're never doing it.</p><p> So to me I'm not ready to give up on financials but as far as overweighting  financials, I won't do that either.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now, what about Amazon, the split decision expected to divide  its second headquarters between evenly between New York City and northern  Virginia.  According to the Journal this morning, the announcement is  probably -- could come as early as today.</p><p> Is this a smart decision?  What are your thoughts here?  Would you put new  money to work in this market right here?  </p><p> MARTIN:  Yes, we would.  I would slowly start weighting it again.  I don't  think that, you know, you have to jump in on a day like today where, you  know, we had a little bit of mixed trading overseas, especially in the  Nikkei, for example as you pointed out all morning.  And we've got a little  bit of a bounce today.</p><p> But I mean guys, even Eli Manning had a decent football game last night.   So the market can bounce just like that as well.</p><p> But I think Maria -- there's some levels that are coming into play here  that are decent as far as some of these tech names that have sold off 20,  25 percent.  So I think you can start weighting in here with some money but  just have a quick kind of hook on it if things start to get worse again  because you may get some lower prices.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Scott always a pleasure.   Thanks so much for weighing in here.</p><p> MARTIN:  See you guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Scott Martin joining us there.</p><p> Turning to the devastation in California right now, the wildfires are  becoming the deadliest in state history.  Fox News' Ray Bogan is in Ventura  County this morning with the very latest.  Good morning to you -- ray.  </p><p> RAY BOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Maria -- good morning.  </p><p> We're at the incident command center for the Woolsey and Hill Fires where  in just a couple of hours, hundreds of firefighters will arrive to get  their morning briefing.  They're working 24 hour shifts.</p><p> In the meantime, some of them are sleeping in tents.  One man is even over  to my left in a sleeping bag.</p><p> Now, in northern California, investigators are looking into whether a  sparking PG&amp;E power line may have started the Camp Fire which has become  the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state's history.  42 people  have died.  They've been found in their homes and cars as they were trying  to escape. </p><p> At last update, the fire was 30 percent contained and Cal Fire doesn't  expect to have full containment for another week.  Nearly 6,500 homes have  been destroyed, including some belonging to firefighters and their  families.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID HAWKE, PARADISE FIRE CHIEF:  It's just absolutely heart-breaking to  drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.  My family lost  their home in the fire.  My parents did.  My grandmother did.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOGAN:  Now, here in southern California, the Woolsey Fire at last update  was 93,000 acres and 30 percent contained.  Firefighters estimate more than  400 buildings have been destroyed.</p><p> In both fires crews are working against dry, windy conditions and steep  terrain but California is getting help.  President Trump has approved a  major disaster declaration and in addition, Cal Fire is thanking 17 state  partners that have come from as far as Alaska and Georgia.  Maria, back to  you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right Ray.  Thank you so much.  We will follow this.  And  this is an incredibly devastating story.  Ray -- thank you.  Ray Bogan  there.  </p><p> Coming up, concerns in the sky.  The new report that Boeing withheld  information on its 737.  The same model involved in the deadly Indonesia  crash last month.  I'll speaking exclusively with the chairman and CEO of  Boeing this morning.  Dennis Muilenburg is here.  We will talk about that  at 8:30 a.m. Eastern and also get his take on the on the commercial  aerospace boom he's been seeing.  Over the last few years.</p><p> Then an injury on the court, the details after a player's gruesome leg  injury leaves some in tears, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> New information coming to light this morning following last month's crash  of a Boeing jet in Indonesia.  Lauren Simonetti with the Details now --  Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hi -- Maria, Boeing reportedly withheld  information on the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max which killed all 189 people  on-board that day.  Safety experts and others telling the \"Wall Street  Journal\" that Boeing didn't tell airlines about potential hazards in their  new flight control feature on that plane.  The problem is that the system  can push the plane's nose down so strongly that pilots can't pull it back  up.</p><p> The automated stall prevention system is being investigated as playing a  role in that Lion Air crash.  Shares of Boeing trading up a quarter of a  percent, $358.  And programming note -- Maria will sit down with Boeing's  chairman, CEO and president Dennis Muilenburg in the next hour on Morning's  with Maria, 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p> Well, the Labor Department is trying to help people save money and curb  401-k cash-outs.  The department could soon allow companies to  automatically transfer (INAUDIBLE) accounts of $5,000 or less belonging to  employees who change jobs to the 401-k plan of their new employers.  It's  the effort to cut down on the premature flow of money out of retirement  plans.  Research shows that as many as 80 percent of people leaving jobs  with less than $5,000 in those accounts eventually cash out of them.</p><p> Well, check this out.  Apple's head designer, Johnnie Ives, has taken on a  project more elegant than your iPhone.  He designed a ring carved from a  single chunk of diamond.  It could sell for a quarter million dollars at an  auction at Sotheby's.  Sotheby's says the ring has up to 3,000 facets,  never seen before on a single piece.  It will be made to fit the buyer, up  to a size 5, which is actually pretty small.  All of those proceeds going  to charity.  But most designers start with the metal.  Johnnie Ives took  the metal out of the equation and started with the diamonds.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow -- so it's all diamond all around.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  All diamonds -- Baby.  And diamonds are my birth stone.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they are a girl's best friend.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can hear the woman.  How are they supposed to know it's  diamonds?  You know, you can't tell.  Sorry.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.  All right.  Thank you -- Lauren.</p><p> Coming up, the state of health care in America.  The CEO of the Mayo Clinic  Dr. John Noseworthy is here.  He's weighing in on the industry innovations,  plus an exclusive announcement that will change health care, certainly at  the Mayo Clinic -- that's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A major investment in the future of health care in America.   The Mayo Clinic School of Medicine receiving a $200 million gift from  philanthropist Jay Alix, the largest ever made to the clinic.</p><p> Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive are Alix Partners founder  Jay Alix and Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. John Noseworthy.  Great to see you both.   Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> JAY ALIX, FOUNDER, ALIX PARTNERS:  Hi -- Maria.</p><p> DR. JOHN NOSEWORTHY, CEO, MAYO CLINIC:  Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Jay -- what a gift.  Congratulations to you that you're  able to do such a thing for the Mayo Clinic.  </p><p> ALIX:  Absolutely.</p><p> You know, Mayo is such a he deserving institution.  The medical school is  one of the top ranked medical schools in the country.  And to be able to be  involved with them, to help them with their mission is just a really great  opportunity for us.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this is going to help the medical school a lot, Dr.  Noseworthy.  And you're also going to be able to attract new talent with  this.  </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  Thanks -- Maria.  Yes, this is really going to help us a great  deal, attract the best students from all over the world, from all  backgrounds regardless of their ability to pay for medical education. </p><p> And it will help us with new curriculum and dual degrees and innovative  ways of teaching and technology and all those good things.  It's a  wonderful gift.  We're really grateful to Jay.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you are now going to be on the board.</p><p> ALIX:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you want to see from the Mayo Clinic and how this  money could be best used.  </p><p> ALIX:  Well, what this gift is about is really helping attract the best  students for the medical school, to train the doctors of the future.  The  country is facing a crisis that we're going to need probably 110,000  doctors in the next 10 years that we don't have today and we don't know  where they're going to come from.</p><p> So we need to train more doctors and we have to provide the money and the  support and the scholarship to help those students get into medical school  and have the country have the right doctors in the future.  Mayo can do  that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you're right.  It was major issue in this past election,  everybody said that health care was the number one matter that was very  important to voters.  The Democrats taking the House in the midterm  elections.  And they say one of the priorities is health care in America.</p><p> So John -- tell us where the needs are right now.  Tell us what your view  is in terms of what needs to be done to take health care up to the next  level.  </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  So the majority of Americans are concerned about access,  coverage, and the cost of health care and the need for transparency to  drive down the cost but also improve the outcomes.  And we support all of  that.</p><p> From Mayo Clinic's perspective, it's more than cost.  It's certainly cost  but it's also outcomes and the performance and how well health care  performs.  And at Mayo Clinic we're all about serious and complex illness  and how to finance as quickly and effectively and provide patients with the  best possible care.</p><p> So the doctors of the future are going to have to deal with transparency,  coverage cost, access, technology, how to drive the safest and highest  technology, most affordable health care system which we don't have at the  moment, as you know.  We're tied to these election cycles every two years.   So it's this and that and this and that and until the country decides that  it's really a priority for the citizens, we're not going to get that long- lasting answer that we need.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, you talk about outcomes.  You know, we've been all about  prevention these last several years, talking about getting ahead of  disease.  How might that money be used toward getting ahead of disease and  when you look at the needs in this country today.  I mean I know we haven't  done enough work or we need more money for Alzheimer's, for example.  And  you know, issues related to the brain.  Where are the needs in that regard?  </p><p> ALIX:  Well, I think we have really leading edge technologies now.  We have  artificial intelligence coming online.  What A.I. is going to do for  medicine and the digitization of medical, you know, personal health data is  going to revolutionize how we can do diagnosis.  And of course with it, you  know, early intervention, diagnosis and prevention we can really change  outcomes for all people who have serious complex medical problems.  And  Mayo is leading the way on that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is a really important point that you made because A.I. is  able to work with doctors to improve the outcomes.  Isn't that right?  </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  That's absolutely right.  And I think it's also prediction.   It's early diagnosis but it's also predictive genomics, if you will.   Knowing what we know about people, who is likely to be at risk for this or  that so you can diagnose it early.  It's all of that together.  </p><p> And the young kids who want to do medicine, want to have a life of service,  they need to have that kind of an education to prepare them for that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What have you done differently in terms of A.I. at the clinic?  </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  We have well over 100 projects trying to predict how to read  x-rays better, how to predict from genomics, how things will play out.   We're working into everyday life at Mayo Clinic, monitoring patients'  hearts, who is at risk for heart disease, that sort of thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And this money will go toward getting new students who will be  looking at A.I. as part of their curriculum, very different than the  doctors in the past.  </p><p> ALIX:  Exactly.  Medical education is going to have to evolve quickly now  and keep up the new technologies, new breakthroughs in science and apply it  right into the clinic for people.  Mayo Clinic can lead the way on that  with this gift and with the research and development it has.</p><p> Mayo has three shields with clinical care, education and research and the  combination of all those three working together is what this gift will  allow Mayo to do.  </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  We'll be offering a masters of artificial intelligence.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Masters of A.I. </p><p> NOSEWORTHTY:  Masters of A.I. and masters of regenerative science, and  masters of advanced biotechnology and bioengineering.  All of these, the  new wave will be right in the curriculum plus the (INAUDIBLE) start willing  to spend say an extra year to get that additional training.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Before we go, where have you seen the most progress in terms of  outcomes in terms of disease?  Is it cancer?  Is it somewhere else?  Heart  disease?  Where have you seen the biggest -- </p><p> NOSEWORTHY:  I think it's in all the serious illnesses -- Maria.  We're  actually measuring outcomes much better, the quantitation of outcomes,  quality of life, life expectancy, readmission to hospital, all of those  things that are now being put on score cards to see what is the investment  to health care doing to reduce the costs and prove the outcome so that  quantitative outcomes research, it's still in its infancy, but it's  absolutely critical if we're going to have the best health care system in  the world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And particularly as you see spending from the NIH  dropping, you need private investors and private practitioners to come in  and help the situation. </p><p> And here comes you-- Jay Alix.  Thank you so much.  Great to see you both.   Thank you very much for joining us.</p><p> ALIX:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dr. John Noseworthy and Jay Alix joining us there.</p><p> Coming up, Congress returns to Washington.

Wait until you hear this one.  Stay with  us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, November 13th,  your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> Futures are indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning after a  sharp selloff yesterday.  The Dow Industrials set to be up 150 points right  out of the gate, that's two thirds of one percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up 17  right now and the NASDAQ is up 57 points, that's almost one percent higher.  </p><p> This after the major indices took a sharp hit yesterday, five percent  decline in the Dow and the NASDAQ component Apple, that took a chunk out of  markets with Apple down five percent, the Dow was down 2-1/3 percent and  the NASDAQ was down almost three percent at the close yesterday.  S&amp;P 500  with a decline of 55 points, down almost two percent.  </p><p> Well, that was then this morning we're seeing a bounce in the U.S. and  Europe.  FT-100 is up a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante is up a half a  percent and the DAX Index in Germany is up almost one percent.  </p><p> Mixed performances in Asia overnight to report.  Nikkei Average worst  performer in Japan, down about two percent.  The Shanghai Composite was the  winner up about one percent.  </p><p> Crude oil continues to slide this morning, take a look at the price, down  another two percent after oil closed lower yesterday for 11 days in a row,  we are looking at a bear market here.  It is down 20 percent from the highs  in just the last five weeks.  What does that tell us?  </p><p> Earnings out today, Home Depot with a double beat earlier this morning, the  stock is up 2-1/2 percent on better than expected earnings and revenue at  Home Depot. </p><p> Meanwhile, back in session, Congress returns to Washington today for the  first time since Democrats won the House in the midterm elections.  What  the divided House will mean for your wallet coming up. </p><p> And tragedy on the court, a star Nets player suffered a gruesome ankle  injury in last night's game.  We'll have the details coming up this  morning.  </p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour, Congress returning to  Washington today to a new political landscape.  I spoke with House Majority  leader Kevin McCarthy this weekend along with Congressman David Cicilline  on Democrats the \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" program about the agenda going  forward.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Well, we'll want to  find common ground.  We will look to make sure we continue to make our  military strong, make sure that we can combat China and others of their  aggressive actions and also when it comes to trade expanding, we want to  find places that we can find common ground.  But those place that's we  principally disagree with, we will stand up strongly to show America the  difference to make assuring that we can continue to grow this country.  </p><p> REP. DAVID CICILLINE (R), RHODE ISLAND:  Democrats ran on a very specific  agenda.  I helped craft it with my co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and  Communications Committee.  It's an -- it's an agenda for the people on this  country.  It's focusing on driving down the cost of health care, driving  down the cost of prescription drugs, protecting coverage for pre-existing  condition, raising family incomes by rebuilding our country with a serious  infrastructure plan for our roads, bridges, ports, transit systems, we'll  create 16 million good paying jobs.  And taking on the corruption in  Washington by getting money out of our political system.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Congressman-elect, or Florida's 6th  Congressional district and former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel Michael  Waltz.  Lieutenant Colonel, good to see you this morning.  Congratulations  to you and thank you for joining us.  </p><p> LT. COL. MICHAEL WALTZ (R), CONGRESSMAN-ELECT, FLORIDA:  Thank you.  Yes,  thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, let's talk first about the new Congress and what  you expect to get done now working with the Democrats.  </p><p> WALTZ:  Well, you know, one of the things that I'm very excited about in  this Congress is the amount of veterans that are running on both sides of  the aisle.  I think that's something that's really resonated with voters.   They understand that veterans know how to get things done.  They're not as  ideological.  You know, I can tell you Maria, in the fox hole, nobody cares  about party, race, religion, social economic background, the enemy's  bullets certainly don't care.  </p><p> And you know, I think you're going to see an approach or at least at an  ethos where compromise isn't a dirty word.  Where we can move the country  forward because you're going to have folks.  Right now, we're at a record  low in our nation's history at around 17 percent of veterans in Congress.   I think that's going to increase.  You're going to see people focused on  mission, on country and on getting things done.  That's what I heard from  hundreds of thousands of doors that people want results.  They don't want  resistance.  And they expect their elected representatives to accomplish  what they set out to do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, I guess, should we expect defense spending to stay elevated  then?  </p><p> WALTZ:  I think so.  You know, I can tell you from firsthand experience  after 17 years of war our military, our equipment is exhausted.  You have  pilots that are younger than the planes that they're flying.  And we face  unprecedented threats between Russia, China and still a metastasizing  growing Islamic extremism problem.  So, I think we're going to have to.   There's really not a choice there.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  One of the huge issues  though, Congressman-elect, it's Dagen McDowell.  Good to see you again.  </p><p> WALTZ:  Thanks Dagen, yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is that the U.S. is on course to spend more on the interest on  our debt than even on defense spending.  That's going to happen about four  to five years from now.  So in order to make sure that our military is  sound in terms of it's our financial support, we need to figure out how  we're going to rein in spending elsewhere.  What's your plan on that?  </p><p> WALTZ:  Well so, there's two ways, right, to -- you know, I'm a business  owner as well as a veteran and there's two ways to deal with debt.  You  deal with it with growth and with cutting spending.  I think President  Trump's absolutely spot-on on what he's doing to grow the economy as a  business owner himself.  And then I think you need members that have the  fortitude to stand up and take on -- to take on spending.  Not only do I  support the military but I also hold the Pentagon accountable for when  there is -- when there's waste involved in their spending in all government  agencies.  </p><p> But Dagen, we both know that on the one hand you have the discretionary  spending and then you have the nondiscretionary spending and what gets at  the heart of that is the cost of health care.  We have to take -- I'm very  -- I'm fascinated to see if the Democrats will take on what it takes to  lower the cost of care.  Tort reform, selling across state lines, going  into a free market system, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, really getting  serious about driving down the cost of care which would then make it more  accessible and affordable and help businesses like mine and help our debt.   .</p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Congressman, Mitch Roschelle.  One of the  things that concern business owners, my friend recently did a study of what  are on the mind of business leaders, and the number one thing that they're  looking for in a bipartisan way is cyber security.  And you talk about  defense spending.  I think they're interrelated.  Do you think that's an  area -- because I haven't heard much from Washington about policy around  protecting intellectual property.  You know, from -- not just from theft  but from a cyber security risk.  Is that something that you think could be  an agenda, especially, you know, more military people obviously they have a  pretty good sense of cyber warfare.  </p><p> WALTZ:  You know, I can -- I can tell you, watching China roll out its  sixth generation stealth fighter which looks exactly like ours, armed  drones which looks exactly like ours, underwater submersibles which look  like ours, doesn't sit well with veterans.  And they've essentially stolen  that intellectual property.  So, you know, this is -- this is about how the  private sector and the government come together in a way that's in line  with American values, not dictated from Washington.  </p><p> But look, I think we're getting to the point where we really have no choice  and the more business owners, the more veterans you have on the Hill that  understand those dynamics, I think the better.  So yes, that's something I  certainly want to take on.  </p><p> Look, we have to as a country.  We are having our technological edge be  stolen in front of our very eyes and at the -- you know, at the same time  this is something that President Trump I think has taken on, Republican  Congress needs to take it on.  And I hope the Democrats join us in that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's pretty incredible what has taken place since the midterm  elections, Tuesday night.  There's still no winner for the state Senate.</p><p> WALTZ:  Less than a week.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's talk about Florida.  There's still no winner for the  gubernatorial and the state Senate race.</p><p> WALTZ:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The controversy over a recount is continuing this morning.   Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum has relinquished the race -- had  relinquished the race against Republican Ron DeSantis.  But he took that  back.  What do you think is going on here?  And what's your reaction to the  fact that in Arizona we see now a change in leadership post the midterms,  now Sinema is winning or won?  </p><p> WALTZ:  You know, in Florida this is so concerning.  Frankly, it's  embarrassing for our state.  It's two counties that year -- you know, cycle  after cycle we're having these problems.  It's incompetence at best.  It's  fraud, you know, frankly at worst, as many have alleged.  This is happening  year after year.  I think we need to see accountability when it comes to  these election officials.  I can tell you, I had four counties in my  district and the T's were crossed and the I's were dotted.  This is the --  this is the heart of our democracy.  As a veteran, this is what we fight to  defend and sacrifice to defend all over the world.  And they have -- they  have a solemn duty to get it right.  I'm glad to see so much attention but  -- on it.  But you know, once this is all said and done, I think you will  see Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott emerge as they currently are ahead.  There  needs to be some accountability afterwards so that we're not dealing with  this again in 2020.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to quickly point out something that Byron York  tweeted out that was mentioned on \"SPECIAL REPORT\" last night.  Like, Rick  Scott went into this, he was leading by 56,000 votes on election night,  tens of thousands of votes for the DeSantis lead going into this.  If a  recount reverses the initial margin of a few -- of more than a few hundred  votes it would be unprecedented, in the history of recent American  elections.  </p><p> WALTZ:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  According to FairVote, almost 4,700 state-wide elections between  2000 and 2016, only 26 of them went to a recount.  Of those 26, just three  recounts wound up changing the initial results of the race, it was one in  Washington, --</p><p> WALTZ:  Washington State.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- one in Vermont and one in Minnesota.  The average swing in  those three elections after the recounts, 311 votes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, watch these results.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is this largely because of Broward County?  </p><p> WALTZ:  Broward County and Palm Beach County.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WALTZ:  And this is -- but what has us so in sensed is this has been a  habitual problem.  This goes back to Bush versus Gore.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p> WALTZ:  And it happens cycle after cycle.  And what so many of us are  asking is, where is the accountability for these election officials?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're also asking that this morning.  Lieutenant colonel,  it's good to see you this morning, thanks very much.</p><p> WALTZ:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching as you take your post in the New Year.   Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz, Congressman-elect.  </p><p> Coming up, a nightmare on the court, the details after a player's gruesome  leg injury leaves some in tears, that's next.  </p><p> Then, Congress headed back to the Hill today, we break down how the  Democratic control of the House may impact your wallet.  Congressman Steve  Scalise is here.  Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, more of the NFL salute to service at Monday Night  Football.  Jared Max with the story now, Jared.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX SPORTS NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We have  been seeing NFL coaches wearing the Salute to Service gear, all available  for purchase at NFLShop.com.  Last night in Santa Clara, California, U.S.  Navy performed a flyover above Levi's Stadium.  Before the 49ers took on  the New York Giants, 49er's tightened George Kittle made sure to thank  every service member on the field last night.  Kittle amongst several  minors who donated game worn jerseys to raise money for the victims of the  wildfires.  Players, coaches and cheerleaders from Paradise High School  most now homeless from the fires, guests of the 49ers last night on the  field for the anthem.  </p><p> Before the Niners gave away 20-10 lead.  Giants' Q.B. Eli Manning tells his  critics I still got it.  Fourth quarter comeback, his first such win in two  years.  Odell Beckham Jr. dances the Carlton and Sterling Shepard with  catch the game winning score 27-23, Giants beat the Niners.  </p><p> Brooklyn Nets player Caris LeVert suffered a serious leg injury last night.   LeVert collided with Minnesota's Jeff Teague and came down hard on his leg.   He had to be carted off the court on a stretcher, hospitalized, no word on  the severity of this gruesome looking basketball injury.  </p><p> Golden State Warriors have a new plan, to allow around 200 more fans at its  home games.  The Warriors are selling monthly passes for fans to attend  games at Oracle Arena but -- but it's a really big but, the fans cannot  even see the court.  They can watch the game on T.V.  They can hear the  crowd roar.  And pay arena prices for booze and food and it only costs $100  a month.  Imagine that, Maria, you're paying $100 a month to get into the  arena to do what you can do at home, watch on T.V., minus the traffic.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's crazy.  I think they just want to be there for the  excitement of it but you can't see a darn thing.  Jared, thank you.</p><p> MAX:  Exactly.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Catch Jared sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on  radio Sirius XM 115.</p><p> Quick break and then Washington and your wallet, how Democrats' control of  the House may impact your pocketbook.  That's next right here.  Congressman  Steve Scalise is with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're back for business, the House and the  Senate returning to Washington today for what will be an intense start to  the lame duck session.  Joining us right now is National Taxpayers Union  senior fellow and Center for a Free Economy board member Mattie Duppler.   Mattie, good to see you, thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p> MATTTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION:  Yes, good  morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, we want to get a sense of what you believe can happen  between now and January, this next seven weeks, can the current Congress  get anything done knowing that they're going to have new pressures come  January with the House leadership?  </p><p> Bbb Maria, that is the perfect question to be asking.  Right now there's  been a lot of attention on what Democrats will do when they finally control  the House Chamber coming in in January.  But you're right, there are  several weeks of work still to be done.  </p><p> I'm watching a couple of different things here.  One is what happens on the  next betting decision, on December 7th parts of the government funding will  expire.  And that means Democrats have a choice to make.  Do they want to  be party that shows they can govern or will they take their heels in and  start to make demands on spending bills?  It really depends on who you're  listening to.  If you're trying to anticipate what Democrats will do, you  heard Chuck Schumer earlier this week talk about how he may want to load up  that spending bill with language that includes something to do with  investigations of the president.  That of course would set a signal that  Democrats are not willing to govern, do not have any interest in getting  things done.  And I think will make things very difficult in the New Year.  </p><p> So, we're have to see -- we'll have to see what happens with House  leadership.  If Nancy Pelosi decides that that is not the path she wants to  take, there could be an opportunity for bipartisan agreement on a spending  bill.  Typically in a lame duck session taxpayers do not benifit from  decisions that are made on spending bills there.  And Nancy Pelosi,  remember, when she was speaker, she was the one who governed probably some  of the biggest omnibus spending bills in the past.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  And we had the majority leader Kevin McCarthy on  this weekend.  And he said that there are two appropriations bills that  they're going to get to.  Of course, one of the big issues at stake is the  Republican tax cut plan, 2.0.  McCarthy joined me on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" along with Democratic representative David Cicilline who want to  have the number four spot in Democratic leadership in the new Congress.   They have both different views on what they're expecting to happen.  Watch  this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've been working on Tax Cuts 2.0.  Does that go away at this  point given the fact that not one Democrat voted for you -- first tax cut  plan?  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  I don't believe so.  Because it's already passed the House.  We  still have a number of weeks and session that's over in the Senate.  We  will continue to fight for it.  Because Maria, it is the right principle.   It is the right policy.  And that should overcome politics.  We should put  people before politics and I'll be excited to see the day that the  Democrats want to join us with that.  </p><p> CICILLINE:  The fact is that tax cut gave 83 percent of that tax cut to the  top one percent, to the richest people in this country and now the  Republicans are proposing we pay for that by cutting Medicare and Social  Security.  We can't do that.  We've got to protect Social Security and  Medicare.  We need a tax cut for middle class families not 83 percent of it  going to the top one percent, richest people in this country and the most  powerful corporations.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I've got a prospect on that because 80 percent of the tax  cut plan did not go to the top one percent as you know, Congressman.  The  tax cut plan lowered all income levels and they doubled the standard  deduction.  So, that talking point -- </p><p> CICILLINE:  Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, it is true.</p><p> CICILLINE:  And Maria, that's just not true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Maybe you get there because the corporate rate was cut.  Are  you saying you want to have corporate -- </p><p> CICILLINE:  Thad's right -- that's right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you want the corporate rate at 35 percent?  </p><p> CICILLINE:  Well, so, you acknowledge it's right.  83 percent does go to  the top one percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, do you want to raise the corporate tax rate?  Is  that what you're saying?  </p><p> CICILLINE:  Well, I don't -- what I say, we have to do is we have to be  responsible about that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand that you want to keep with this talking  point that is inaccurate.  That's fine.  You can do as you will.  </p><p> CICILLINE:  No, it's the fact, it's not inaccurate.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But do you -- the question is what do you going to do on taxes?   Are you looking to raise taxes, are you looking to reverse the economic  policies of this president?  </p><p> CICILLINE:  No, what I think we need to do is give a real tax cut to  working families, to middle class families, that's permanent and long- standing.  Not giving 82 percent (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That sounds like -- that sounds like what's being worked on  right now, Tax Cuts 2.0.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And of course, we know the facts on taxes, Mattie.  Mitch  Roschelle, you're here.  You responded and reacted to that interview.  You  and I were e-mailing each other.  Give us the facts on who pays the taxes.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  I also screamed at the television set on Sunday, just to be  clear.  But the top 10 percent of taxpayers in this country, and that's  those Households earning over $133,000 pay 70 percent of the tax.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Bottom line.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Right.  So, and that was based upon the last time the tax  foundation did this.  So the fact of the matter is, -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's just lies.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  -- it's just not true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mattie, is  that -- are we going to just have bluster for the  next two years, lots of lies and inaccuracies and get nothing done, what do  you think?  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Well, we will see.  Look, (INAUDIBLE) just called in the Arizona  for the Kyrsten Sinema.  She is one of the only Democrats who voted to  extend those tax cuts.  Those Democrats who wants to see those tax cuts  made permanent.  We'll see if Democrats continue to push back on that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, and not one of them voted for the tax cut plan in general.  </p><p> DUPPLER:  Exactly right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mattie, thank you so much.  Mattie Duppler there.  Still ahead,  divided in half, the details on Amazon's plans to split its second  headquarters, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Tuesday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   It is a busy morning.  It is Tuesday, November 13th.  Your top stories  right now 8:00 a.m. on button on the East Coast.  Markets are set to  rebound this morning.  Take a look at futures indicating a modest gain at  the start of trading.</p><p> The Dow Jones Industrial average up 130 points right now, one-half of one  percent.  The S&amp;P is up two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ with a 53- point rally this morning up three quarters of a percent.  A much different  day than yesterday, where we saw serious broad-based sell-off on Wall  Street.  Apple and Goldman dragged the markets lower.  The Dow was down 600  plus points.  That was 2-1/3 percent.</p><p> The S&amp;P 500 sliding nearly two percent on the session.  And at the close,  the NASDAQ was the worst performer.  It was down nearly three percent on  the session as Apple and other technology stocks really took the NASDAQ  down sharply at the close.  Take a look at global markets this morning on  the heels of the strength you're seeing on Wall Street this morning.   European markets following suit.</p><p> The FT-100 is up a fraction, the CAC Quarante in Paris us a half of a  percent, 21 points higher and the DAX Index up almost one percent.  90  points higher in Germany.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances there,  take a look.  Worst performer was Japan, the Nikkei average down better  than two percent.</p><p> Well, the picks are in.  Amazon will soon call Long Island City York and  Crystal City, Virginia home.  The details on the decision to split its  headquarters, the second headquarters.  The announcement is expected as  early as today.  That would be the official announcement but we know this  is coming up one percent on Amazon this morning in terms of the stock.</p><p> Meanwhile, let's go to California where raging wildfires are continuing  this morning.  The infernos burning a path of devastation.  The death toll  up to nearly 50 people right now between these massive fires.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand that makes this the deadliest fire in the  history of United States.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are going to take you live to Southern California to get the  very latest there.  Massive devastation.  New questions this morning for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  important 737 jet.  That's the same model that was involved in the deadly  crash in Indonesia last month.  I'm going to be speaking with the Chairman  and CEPO Dennis Muilenburg this morning and he is here in studio in a Fox  Business Exclusive.</p><p> He will join me at 8:30 a.m. Eastern to answer these questions as well as  to tell us about the backdrop for his business today.  Also joining the  conversation this morning, House Majority Whip and Louisiana Congressman  Steve Scalise as Congress gets back to work this morning.  Also this  morning joining me is CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Lindsey,  good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Lindsey, we were talking earlier about the markets and about  that sell-off yesterday.  We just came off of the quarter where we saw  profit growth up 29 percent year-over-year.  So why are markets so nervous?</p><p> BELL:  We haven't seen growth that great since before 2000.  So that is a  very impressive number.  It's the third quarter of over 20 percent earnings  growth.  And that is largely due to the tax reform package that we got  earlier this year and fiscal stimulus.  But the problem now is that fiscal  stimulus is peaking, monetary policy is tightening.  The Fed is running off  its balance sheet here.</p><p> And the question is where do we go with growth from here?  There is a lot  of uncertainty still out there on trade and to me, between trade and the  Fed, those are the two biggest things as I look to 2019 to determine where  growth -- the growth trajectory will be going.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, we saw some of the big tech names come down a lot  yesterday, Apple down five percent which is a serious number for Apple.  Is  the worry about growth largely in some of these high flyers like in Apple,  or are we just talking about economic growth going from 4.2 percent in the  second quarter, 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter to something very  different in 2019.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  I think it's more about economic growth.  The tech sector is  being weighed on by the trade disputes obviously and then also I think that  with interest rates rising the evaluations that we've seen in some of that  really had investors turn a little more skittish.  It's been dragging the  market down but as we look to 2019, look, if we get 2-1/2 to -- to 2.9  percent GDP, that's really solid.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And really much better than what we saw the prior 10 years.  </p><p> BELL:  Exactly.  In a slowdown in growth from the four percent that we saw  in the last quarter could help you elongate this bull market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sounds like you think things went overdone yesterday on the  downside.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  And I just think volatility is here to stay for a while but we  are optimistic, we have 3100 price targets for the next 12 months in the  S&amp;P 500.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  3100 and it is now at 2726 on the standard &amp; poor's.  Lindsey,  thank you.  Great insights always from you.  I'm going to turn now back to  the Capitol Hill.  Congress is back in session today for its final two  month stretch, spending immigration and the fate of the Mueller probe  expected to dominate the debate.  Joining me right now is the House  Majority Whip, author of the new book, Back in the Game, Steve Scalise.</p><p> And we are really happy you are back in the game, Congressman.  It's good  to see you.  </p><p> REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  Maria, great to be back  with you.  Great to be back in the game.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congratulations on the book.  You know, I  was so happy when I saw the book because I thought I'm really happy he is  writing about this incident.  The whole country was just so worried about  you after that shooting at the baseball -- at the baseball course.  So  we'll get to that in a moment.  But you just heard Lindsey Graham talking  about the economy.</p><p> Are you expecting growth to slow?  You just had this landmark tax cut  reform that you put in place earlier this year and now people are worried  that the economy is going to slow down. </p><p> SCALISE:  Well, you know, we were seeing so much economic growth and it was  working the way that we intended.  When you -- when you see tax cuts for  every single income group and of course lower to middle income people are  the ones who benefited the most.  And now with Nancy Pelosi being expected  to be sworn in as Speaker in January, it does concern people that they want  to go backward.</p><p> They want to raise taxes again, go to like kind of big government,  government-controlled healthcare.  All the things that Pelosi did when she  was speaker before.  So, you know, it is definitely concerned people and  slowed down the growth.  Let's see what happens but we're going to be  battling that too.  We're not going to -- we're not going to let this  country go back to those days, the 10 years of slow economic growth less  than two percent growth for eight straight years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know we're waiting on couple of situations in Florida this  morning but it looks like Republicans will keep the majority in the Senate  based on what we're seeing.  </p><p> SCALISE:  And actually grew their number in the Senate.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And grew their numbers but I'm talking about these, you know,  questions in Florida and -- but yes, growing the numbers in the Senate.  So  should that make us feel that the Democrats being in the House majority now  will not be subject to stopping the President's economic agenda?  I mean,  what does this mean in terms of the House leadership taking the majority?  </p><p> SCALISE:  Well, I think the most important thing that you don't see us go  backwards.  And, you know, even if Nancy PelosI's agenda which will be to  try to grow government, to try to raise taxes, higher, they're not going to  be successful ultimately because the bill would have to be signed by the  President.  But what it does mean is the things that we were going to do  tax cuts 2.0, the work that Chairman Brady and his committee were already  engaged in to try to make those tax cuts permanent.</p><p> To build on the growth we're seeing in our economy.  It's going to be very  difficult to get those things accomplished once Nancy Pelosi is speaker for  at least two-year period.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, do you think -- I was with David Cicilline, Democratic  Congressman who0 wants to get into leadership, the leadership race is  obviously happening this week, and he said he doesn't like the corporate  rate where it is.  Do you think there's any chance that he would be  successful in raising the corporate rate?  </p><p> SCALISE:  Well, I saw that interview and you pressed him I think  appropriately because ultimately he didn't want to say it but you can tell  what he was trying to imply was he wants to raise the corporate rate and  it's OK if he tries to do that which he will not be successful by the way.   But if he tried to, what does he going to do with those millions of jobs  that we're bringing back to America because we lowered the corporate rate  to be competitive.</p><p> America lost its competitive edge and everybody acknowledged that.  It  wasn't a partisan issue.  And so when we made our country competitive  again, we're seeing the benefits of it by millions of new jobs being  created for families who want to get in the work force.  Why would he want  to take that away, we're not going to let it happen but it shows you they  do want to raise those rates even higher.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They want to raise rates and they want to have investigations  around President Trump.  You've got six weeks or seven weeks before the end  of the year.  What can you get done in this next seven weeks?  I know you  have spending bills, appropriation bills that need to be tended to.  Tell  us what you're expecting in terms of success this year.  </p><p> SCALISE:  Maria, there are a few important bills that are right up front  and center that we have to deal with the funding of the Department of  Homeland Security which is critically important to keeping America safe.   And of course the big fight, there is going to be overfunding the wall.  In  the House we've been moving forward to try to give the President the $5  billion that he's requested to start fully building out the wall.</p><p> There is some money he has to start building about 100 miles of wall.  We  want to go a lot further, you know, that's going to be a battle we have.   The other big battle is going to be over the farm bill.  And Maria, Farm  Bill Policy expired a few weeks ago and the big fight has been over work  requirements.  You know, here you've got this great robust economy where  there are more job openings and people looking for work.</p><p> And yet we put a provision in the House that says, if there is a job out  there in your able body, you ought to be able to go and look for work  instead of getting taxpayer funded welfare benefits and the Democrats  oppose that, so we have a big impasse over that.  And imagine, at a time  when people are looking for work, the Federal government is paying people  not to work and we said, look, if there is a job out there for you, you  have to go take it or else stop getting taxpayer money.</p><p> And we'll even pay you to train you to work if there's not -- if you don't  have the proper training and that's what they're opposing right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  All right.  Are there any plans to cut  spending?  The idea of debt and deficits in our face and getting more  expensive just to hold the debt.  This conversation is getting louder.   What are the plans in terms of spending cuts and is it possible that the  Congress and the President make a mistake of looking for something to come  together with the Democrats choosing infrastructure and then creating even  more debt by spending $2 trillion on an infrastructure package.</p><p> SCALISE:  All right.  That is continuing to be a concern.  One of the  reason we didn't get an infrastructure package is because we couldn't get  an agreement over how to pay for it.  We weren't in this Republican-led  House, we weren't going to pass a bill that was just going to add to the  deficit.  One of the things we had in our healthcare bill that passed the  House had protections for people with preexisting conditions.</p><p> But a reforming Medicaid, one of the most broken forms of healthcare by  block granting it to the states, letting the states actually be innovative  and coming up with better ways to run healthcare for lower income people.   It's saved over $800 billion just through the innovation.  You didn't have  a reduction in money, it just actually allowed states to be more flexible  with the money.</p><p> That saved $800 billion.  It failed by one voted in the Senate.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> SCALISE:  Huge disappointments there in a lot of fronts but it would have  made healthcare more affordable, protected people of preexisting conditions  and transformed Medicaid into a much better program at those kind of  savings.  That was what's at stake in this election.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  We all remember the infamous thumbs down on the Senate.   Let me -- let me ask you about the preexisting conditions because that's  another talking point on the left that the Republicans do not want to  protect preexisting conditions.  </p><p> SCALISE:  Yes.  It was a false claim.  In fact they spent millions of  dollars promoting that false claim.  And I talked to members and so many of  these swing districts and they said, look, they're lying about this,  they're spending two, $3 million in T.V. ads lying about it.  And so they  had to go on T.V. and spend -- they didn't have two million, they might had  a million and half to say that it wasn't true.</p><p> And so people got confused, they weren't sure what was the case.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCALISE:  But our bill -- our bill actually protected people with  preexisting conditions.  It's in the bill, they knew it, they didn't care,  they just said it anyway.  Look, you know, they're going to get the  majority.  I think it's going to be a short-lived majority but at the same  time a lot of those candidates who won said they're going to be pro-life  and pro-gun and they're going to vote against Nancy Pelosi.</p><p> Well, their very first vote as a member of Congress in January is going to  be for Nancy Pelosi as speaker.  You know, which side are they going to  choose, the -- you know, the people back home that they promised one thing  to or what's going to happen up in D.C.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you've got your leadership races this week, tomorrow night,  the vote tell us what you're feeling in terms of how things stack up.  Are  you expecting that Kevin McCarthy will be the Minority Leader and you will  tell us about the role that you're expecting.  </p><p> SCALISE:  Yes.  I think Kevin will get the votes and he will be the  minority leader.  I'm running for the minority whip position and feel real  confident and the votes that we have and, you know, we'll go forward but at  the same time it's going to be interesting to see which route they go, the  Democrats do when they're in power.  They're going to just be about  harassing the President, subpoenas and even impeachment.</p><p> That's not what the American people wanted.  You know, ultimately they're  going to have to -- they're going to have to decide which route they go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Just to change the conversation, so that's the  conversation for the next two years as opposed to what you've been able to  do in terms of legislation. </p><p> SCALISE:  And we've got to be I think a lot better at articulating the  things we stand for as conservatives.  That's one thing that I think we  didn't do well.  We've got to do a lot better at and we're going to get  there but I think there's going to be a sharp contrast now because you're  going to see the approach that Nancy Pelosi would take as speaker.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm glad you mentioned -- a lot of people mentioned the  messaging on the Republican side.  Let's talk about your book Back in the  Game, what role did your recovery have in writing this book?  Tell us why  you wrote the book.  </p><p> SCALISE:  Well, you know, as you talked about earlier, there were so many  people that came together to help me, you know, not only to save my life in  those first few hours after the shooting, but to help me get back in the  game and essence to be able to learn how to walk again.  Just to learn how  to do basic things that I couldn't do in those first few weeks after the  shooting.</p><p> And, you know, I had a lot of -- a lot of support and prayers by the people  like you were praying, people all over the country were praying and there  were so many miracles that we chronicle in this book and the book we talked  about.  What my wife Jennifer and I talk about these little miracles that  happened along the way.  And we also talked about the people who did so  many heroic things every step of the way to save not only myself but all  the other people that were out there that day.</p><p> And then ultimately to help me through the recovery process.  And it really  is an inspirational book because it could have been a lot different in how  it ended.  You know, so many cases like this don't end the way it did.   This actually has a happy ending and thanks to god, to miracles, and to the  support and prayers of so many people.  We chronicled it all in the book.   Back in the Game and I'm really happy with how it came out.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We were so worried.  Everybody was worried about you, we -- I  mean, it was so serious.  Did it change the way you look at things?  Did it  change the way you approach your job?  </p><p> SCALISE:  Maria, if anything, it sharpened my focus on the things that  matter in life and I think I removed a lot of clutter in life.  You know,  all of us do things every day that some that we want to do, some that you  just kind of do because it's a routine and you focus on what's really  important, my family, my faith, you know, the work that I do, I love my  job.  You know, and it illuminated the things that aren't as important and  much happier today. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much.  Thank you for your leadership.   So happy you're here.</p><p> SCALISE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Steve Scalise.  Check out the book back in the  game.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeting this on trade.   France makes excellent wine but so does the U.S.  The problem is that  France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France and  charges big tariffs while doing so.  Whereas the U.S. makes it easy for  French wines and charges very small tariffs.  It's not fair.  Must change.   The President obviously touting European leaders on trade this morning.</p><p> Switching gears.  We want to bring you to California and show you this  devastation which is just unreal.  We have two wildfires whipping across  the state. The campfire is the northern part, now it is the deadliest fire  in the state's history.  And the Woolsey fire taking a major toll on  Southern California.  Fox News' Jonathan Hunt is in Malibu this morning.   Jonathan?</p><p> JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.  Thousands of  families remain evacuated from this area of Southern California where the  Woolsey fire has hit so hard.  That likely to be out of Malibu and other  areas for I would say at least another 24 hours.  And take a look at what  hundreds of families are going to come back to find when they are  eventually let in.</p><p> Everything they have built over their lives, everything they've worked for  completely and utterly destroyed.  It is a similar story up north -- the  camp fire near Chico, California.  Now as you mentioned becoming officially  the deadliest in state history.  42 people have been killed in that fire.   More than 100 still remain unaccounted for and the entire town of Paradise  is basically wiped out.  Listen here to the fire chief.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DAVID HAWKS, DIVISION CHIEF, CAL FIRE-BUTTE COUNTY:  It's just absolutely  heartbreaking to drive through Paradise and see the level of destruction.   My family lost their home in the fire, my parents did, my grandmother did.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> HUNT:  President Trump tweeted last night that he has now approved and  expedited major disaster declaration for California.  That tweet coming in  the wake of tweets over the weekend, in which he was critical of  California's forest management.  That sparked a firestorm of criticism.   He's now changing his tune paying tribute to the heroic firefighters who  are still on the frontlines, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Jonathan.  Thanks very much.  We will be watching.   Jonathan Hunt in Malibu this morning.  Coming up.  Concerns in the sky.  A  new report says Boeing withheld information on its 737 plane.  The same  model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash last month.  I'll be speaking  exclusively with the chairman and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg about  that in less than 10 minutes.</p><p> As we take a break, we are watching the price of oil this morning.  And as  you can see, it is down 1-1/4 percent below 60 right now.  We'll be right  back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  President Trump continuing to tweet this morning.  Here's what  he just posted.  The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low  approval rating in France, that's 26 percent.  And an unemployment rate of  almost 10 percent.  He was just trying to get on to another subject, by the  way, there is no country more nationalist than France.  Very proud people  and rightfully so.  Make France Great Again.  The President writes this  morning.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Vive la, France.  Sorry.  I  just want to quickly say we have our pickup trucks, everyone.  We have our  tariffs on pickup truck imports.  They have their protections for one.   Let's move along and get along. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  All right.  Well, stocks getting yesterday on  weakness from technology meanwhile especially Apple.  The NASDAQ was down  almost three percent.  This morning we are looking at a rebound a bit, the  Dow industrials are up 77, the S&amp;P is up 12, and the NASDAQ right now up 39  points after that sharp sell-off yesterday.  Joining us right now Wells  Fargo Investment Institute Head, global market strategists, Paul  Christopher. </p><p> Paul, good to see you.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p> PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD OF GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So when you come in today after since a rough day at the office  yesterday where the markets were down 600 points on the Dow.  What do you  do?  Are you a buyer or a seller here?  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We're a buyer.  Look, it's -- the markets, it's still  worried about growth, it's trying to put in a bottom.  You don't have to  put in all the chips at once here but people have a lot of cash.  Our  clients held a lot of cash and we would like for them to put in a little  bit here at a time.  We think this is the best buying opportunity in U.S.  large caps since the November 2016 election.</p><p> So don't have to put it all in at once.  We're still looking for a bottom  but do start to take some positions especially in those growth-oriented  sectors.  </p><p> BELL:  So Paul, does that mean you take some positions in the tech, maybe  some of the FAANG names that have been beaten up or maybe are in bear  market territory right now off of their highs?  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  It's a good question.  We've been market weight on  information technology.  We still think you should be market weight but  listen if you haven't had a chance to get into some of these stocks and now  you find yourself below market weight.  Again this is an opportunity to  take yourself back up to that waiting.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Paul, it's Dagen McDowell.  It seems like the market gets really  shaken every time that 10-year yield gets to about only 3-1/4 percent.   Realistically how high a yield, a longer term interest rate can stocks  handle given a lot of names that are still -- that still look really  overvalued?  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Yes.  We think that bond yields, the 10-year for instance  will go a little bit higher over the next 12 months and that we think that  stocks will still be OK with that.  The problem is we're just getting this  transition period where we've gone from clearly low growth and low interest  rates to a little bit faster growth and somewhat higher interest rates and  that sort of a move always wrong foots markets until investors can  determine that yes earnings can continue to hit higher levels.</p><p> And it's -- those earnings ultimately over the long run that will be --  that will match the S&amp;P on the way up we think, you know, percentage for  percentage.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Paul, great to see you.   Thank you so much.  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Paul Christopher joining us.  Well Fargo.  New questions for  Boeing.  A new report says that the jet maker withheld information on its  737 model.  This is the same model involved in the deadly Indonesia crash  last week.  We will speak with Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg next,  exclusive coming up right after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, November 13th, your  top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast.  Futures are indicating  a gain at the start of trading this morning.  Dow Industrials expected to  be up 69 points, that is about a quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 is up  almost half a percent, and the NASDAQ with a 39-point gain, up two-thirds  of one percent.  This, after a sharp sell-off yesterday where the Dow lost  two percent and the NASDAQ lost almost three percent.</p><p> European markets were mixed, the FT-100 is down a fraction, as you can see,  but the CAC Quarante and the DAX Index are both positive.  Although off of  the highest levels of the morning, for sure.  Overnight in Asia, mixed  performances, take a look, the worst performer was Japan overnight in Asia.   The Nikkei Average was down on the session about two percent, as you can  see there.  </p><p> Oil is extending its losing streak this morning.  Crude oil under pressure  again now 11 days in a row lower, down 1-1/3 percent, below $60.00 a  barrel.  What is the price of oil selling off tell us about the global  economy?  We want to look at that, coming up.  </p><p> All of those stories coming up this morning, but first, our top story this  half an hour, new questions this morning for Boeing, The Wall Street  journal is reporting that Boeing withheld information on its 737 model,  according to safety experts and others.  That is the same model involved in  the deadly Lion aircrash in Indonesia last month.  And joining me right now  to discuss that and a lot more in this Fox Business exclusive is the  Chairman, President, and CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg.  Dennis, it's  good to see you this morning.</p><p> DENNIS MUILENBURG, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BOEING:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the story in The Journal obviously is very concerning.   What can you tell us in terms of what was told to the pilots and the  airlines about any new equipment in that 737?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Well, Maria, first of all, I think it's important that we all  express our sympathies for the loss of Lion Air Flight 610 and certainly,  our thoughts go with the families that have been affected.  We've been very  engaged with the investigative authorities throughout and providing all of  the information necessary to make sure we do a full assessment of the  situation.  And the bottom line here is the 737 max is safe, and safety is  a core value for us at Boeing, it always has been, and we ensure that our  airplanes are safe.  In fact, this airplane went through thousands of hours  of tests and evaluation, certification, working with the pilots, and we've  been very transparent on providing information and being fully cooperative  on the investigative activity.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what happened?  Apparently, there were 10 computer -- the  computers about the angle of the nose were not accurate and then the plane  went down, all 189 people dead.  Do you have a sense of what went wrong?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes, as the Indonesian authorities have pointed out initially,  there were some indications of inaccurate angle attack signal that was  being sent to the airplane, and of course, our airplane has the ability to  handle that, and we have procedures in place.  And we've already issued a  couple of additional bulletins to our operators and pilots around the world  that point them back to existing flight procedures to handle that kind of  condition.  So again, we're going to continue to support the investigation  as it proceeds.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And was there -- I mean, one of the Boeing officials quoted in  The Journal today, one high-ranking Boeing official said that the company  had decided against disclosing more details to cockpit cruise due to  concerns about inundating average pilots with too much information.  Was  that a decision now that you regret?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Now, again, we ensure that we provide all of information  that's needed to safely fly our airplanes.  Again, this comes as out of  thousands of hours of testing and evaluating and simulating, and providing  the information that our pilots need to operate our airplanes safely, and  we'll continue to do that.  As I said, as part of the process here, we've  already issued a couple of bulletins to pilots and operators that point  them back to existing flight procedures to handle this kind of situation.   So, we're going to continue to fully cooperate in the investigation.  I  think it's really important -- again, the bottomline here, the 737 Max is a  very safe airplane and we're very confident in it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But was there a new -- well, there are new system that wasn't  disclosed to the pilots.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  No, there are new systems on the airplanes that are designed  to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane and to provide  control capability in high-angle of attack conditions, and those systems  operate properly.  And again, in certain failure modes, if there's an  inaccurate angle attack sensors feeding information to the -- to the  airplane, there's a procedure to handle that.  And so, again, as part of  the investigation process, we're going to make sure we fully understand  that.  We're going to make sure that we're providing all of the information  necessary and appropriate training, and go back to the core value here, is  that the airplane safe, we know how to fly it safely, and we're very  confident in that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Was that information in terms of what to do should something  change -- was that information available to the pilots?  Did they know how  to operate it should the nose be in a different position?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes.  In fact, that's part of the training manual, it's an  existing procedure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  So, the bulletin that we put out again last week and over the  weekend, pointed to that existing flight procedure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, obviously, I know that you're answering lots of  questions this morning and this week after this horrific crash, and you're  going to get more information.  What would be the timing on that?  When do  you expect to hear from the FAA on this?  </p><p> MUILENBURG:  Well, this is an ongoing investigation, so it will take  whatever time is necessary to make sure it's done thoroughly.  Again, we  participate fully in these investigations, we've provided technical  assistance, we'll continue to do that until the work is complete.  It's  very important that we do this in a diligent and thorough manner.   Bottomline is we want to ensure safety in the system, and continue to have  confidence in the 737 Max.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the 737 has been a cash cow for your business, this is a  very important business.  There were some headwinds in the supply chain in  terms of the 737, which I want to ask you about.  And I know over the  recent past, you've expanded the business, you've got commercial aerospace,  you've got defense, and then you've got services.  Tell us how business is  right now, because commercial aerospace has been driving the stock  obviously for several years right now?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Well, aerospace is a tremendous growth business.  We look out  over the next 10 years as an $8.1 trillion marketplace.  Passenger traffic  is growing at about six to seven percent per year sustained.  The world  needs about 43,000 new commercial airplanes over the next 20 years.  A part  of that is the 737 as we've ramped up to 52 a month, this year, we're  producing at 57 a month next year.  And we have had some supply chain  challenges as you -- as you pointed out, as we've been growing.  But we are  briskly moving to a recovery.  We just announced delivery numbers for  October earlier this morning, so we delivered 43 737s in October which is  an all-time record for October, and we're continuing to March smartly to  our recovery plan, and expect to meet our year-end targets for deliveries.   This year, for the first time, we'll deliver more than 800 commercial  airplanes.  By the end of the decade here, we'll be delivering more than  900 airplanes a year.  So, you can see the tremendous growth here in  commercial airplanes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible and I know you got an incredible backlog as  well --</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- which will continue that delivery calendar.  One out of four  or five planes go to China in terms of your deliveries.  Tell us about the  importance of the business in China.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes, China is very important to us.  Today, about a third of  our 737s go to China, about one-quarter of our overall deliveries.  So, if  you look at that marketplace around the world, 43,000 new airplanes over  the next 20 years, about 7,000 of those are in China.  It's the fastest  growing market segment right now.  China needs that lift capability to  serve their economic growth needs, so China is very interested in the  healthy aerospace economy.  </p><p> As you know here in the U.S. as well, there's a big advantage to a healthy  aerospace ecosystem.  We have about 90 percent of our manufacturing jobs  here in the U.S. even though we export about 80 percent of what we build.   So when you look at trade deficit versus trade surplus, aerospace is the  biggest trade surplus for the U.S., about $80 billion a year.  And our  business is the biggest piece of that.  So, that a mutually-beneficial  relationship between the U.S. and China as it applies to trade and the  aerospace is very important.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what happens now with this trade spat that we're having  with China then?  I mean, have you seen any backlash from the Chinese in  terms of your business, given the fact that the President is sitting there  waiting to put another 250 billion on exports from China on tariffs and  this fight between China and the U.S. intensifies?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  We've been very engaged in that dialogue, as you know, this is  a very important topic to us.  We've been talking with the President and  the U.S. administration, extensively.  They're very aware of the situation  and the importance of aerospace.  We've also had a very good dialogue with  Chinese leadership and our customers in China.  And we're encouraged by the  dialogue that's going on.  </p><p> I think you've seen some recent reports that President Trump and President  Xi plan to meet around the G20 summit that's coming up.  Some productive  dialogue going on on the trade front, we think both countries are  interested in a mutually successful aerospace ecosystem.  It's good for the  economies of both countries.  And here in the U.S., it's really important  to U.S. manufacturing jobs.  We have about 13,000 companies in our supply  chain here in the U.S. that are supporting that kind of manufacturing  growth.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Has the air supply chain changed in any way because of your  services business?  I mean, you're pursuing this more aggressive strategy,  does that mean that in time -- in terms of selling a plane to somebody or a  business, then you want to maintain that plane as well by using the  services there, but are you taking away business from the suppliers?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  We're actually see this as a grow the pie business.  So,  something we can do jointly with our suppliers.  Services is our biggest  single-growth opportunity.  When you look at that $8-trillion marketplace,  it's the place where we have the biggest opportunity to further grow.  And  we're bringing capabilities like parts distribution, maintenance, and  modifications.  New software, digital solutions, training solutions for our  customers, doing that jointly with our suppliers.  </p><p> To date -- year-to-date, our services business has grown 12 percent in a  market that's growing about three percent a year.  So, it is growing,  growing strongly, and by doing this jointly with our supply chain, we can  provide better light cycle value for our customers.  And that's really the  lens we're looking through here, not only how we design and build  airplanes, but how do we provide value for our customers for post- production support.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This sounds like a natural fit.  I mean, the commercial  aerospace business has been so strong, and walk us through that for a  moment because most people don't understand the number of people who've  never been on an airplane.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The number of people who are perhaps in Asia who are wanting to  travel, this is a big opportunity for you.  So, this is also an economic  growth story.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  It is.  And, Maria, you bring up a really great point.  As I  said earlier, traffic is growing -- passenger traffic at about six to seven  percent a year completely outstripping GDP.  And some of the things that  are driving that is the upcoming middle class that for the first time ever,  is able to travel.  So, we have this unique combination of backlogs, seven  years of backlog.  And every year in Asia alone, 150 million people fly for  the first time.  Less than -- less than 20 percent.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's amazing.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Less than 20 percent of the world's population has ever taken  a single flight.  So, think about the growth opportunity that's still ahead  of us, and we're feeding right into that with our design and productions.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But here we have worries in the market, down 600 points  yesterday, worries from economic worries that things are going to slow  down.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, where are we on that in your view?  You've got interest  rates rising obviously when a company or country buys a plane, or several  planes, they are in many parts doing it by borrowing, their borrowing costs  are going up with interest rates.  How much of a headwind will that be for  you?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  We're not seeing it affect our business.  Again, we have a  much longer term view.  Today, we have a backlog of almost 5800 commercial  airplanes if you think of that in terms of production volume, it's about  seven years of backlog.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  So, this gives us the opportunity to think long term in terms  of capital investment, innovation investment.  And while we pay attention  to things like interest rates and the financial markets, it's not something  that's really affecting near-term buying behavior.  You know, today, we're  selling 737 Maxes, filling our production skyline out in 2023 and beyond.   So, we have a much longer term perspective.  Aerospace is a strong long- term growing business.  It's not -- it's no longer a cyclical business.   This is a long term sustained growth business.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the competition is fierce.  I mean, airbus -- can airbus  sell to European countries and companies with no tariffs?  So, are you  disadvantaged by the tariff situation given the fact that a European  jetmaker Airbus can do it a lot cheaper?</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Well, something we're paying close attention to.  To date, we  haven't been affected materially by the tariffs.  Things that have affected  steel and aluminum pricing.  We source 90 percent of our aluminum here in  the U.S. so it hasn't been a dramatic effect on us, but it's something  we're paying a close attention to.  The bottom line is it's a very  competitive marketplace because it's a very attractive marketplace.  Now,  we have to continue to invest, to compete.  We have to continue to invest  to innovate.  Tax reform, for example, in the U.S. has been something that  has really helped us gain a level-playing field globally so that we can  compete and win.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How can you grow the defense business at this point?  A lot of  worries that defense spending needs to either be capped or cut, given the  trillion-dollar deficits we're talking about every day and the debt of 21  trillion.  </p><p> MUILENBURG:  Yes, we see the defense budget here in the U.S. sustained, and  if you look back a couple of years when we were in the middle of  sequestration.  We feel like we're in a stronger budget position now on  both sides of the aisle.  So, we look to the U.S. defense budget to remain  strong.  But we also see growth around the world.  Today, about a third of  our defense backlog is outside the U.S.  So, again, this is a very global  business, and there's a lot of defense growth opportunities outside of the  U.S., and I think the thing that's unique about Boeing is when we think  about growth, we look across commercial defense and services.  We're really  the only aerospace company that can bring great big critical mass to all  three of those sectors.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Dennis, it's great to have  you on the program.</p><p> MUILENBURG:  Likewise.  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Dennis Muilenburg, ceo at Boeing.  We will  be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  President Trump just tweeting again.  He says this, \"By the  way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France  because of almost zero visibility.  I suggested driving, Secret Service  said no, too far from airport and big Paris shutdown.  Speech next day at  the American cemetery in pouring rain!  Little reported -- Fake News.\"  The  President referring to some criticism that he received from the media on  failing to go the cemetery that dual.</p><p> We want to turn to Amazon, congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  slamming Amazon's plans to partially bring (INAUDIBLE) headquarters to New  York City.  Joining me right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart  Varney.  And Stuart, there was a reason that so many cities across this  country were vying for Amazon to come to their city and set up their new  headlines.  Does she not understand business and economics?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, she does not.  I don't  think she wants to.  There's no pleasing some people, and that's the truth.   There's no pleasing a socialist.  I'll quote you exactly what she said.   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, Amazon is a-billion-dollar company.  The  idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks is  extremely concerning to residents here.  Has the company promised to hire  in the existing community?  What's the quality of jobs?  How many are  promised?  Are these jobs low wage or high wage?  Are there benefits?  Can  people collectively bargain?  There's just no satisfying a socialist.  They  see no benefit to investment, capital infusion and growth.  They don't see  it.  They simply see a big corporation.  Give me the money.  I just want  the money.  That's what it's all about.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> VARNEY:  I'm astonished, actually.  I would have thought that when you  bring 25,000 new jobs, a couple of billion dollars to your city, it would  be universally approved, but apparently not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but the first thing she does, Dagen, is she complains that  Amazon is getting tax breaks (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And she says Queens City councilman, Jimmy Van Bramer and state  Senator Gianaris have also come out against the Amazon deal while Mayor  Bill de Blasio says that this could be the single biggest economic  development deal in the history of New York City.  So, here's a word,  Amazon, find another city, I dare you.</p><p> VARNEY:  For once, I'm on Bill de Blasio's side.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stuart, I know you'll have more in 10 minutes.  We'll see you  at the top of the hour, thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right  after MORNINGS WITH MARIA 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Stay with us.</p><p> But first, driving innovation, we got a behind-the-scenes look at the  journal's technology conference, featuring the CEO of Uber.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The future of technology, the Wall Street  Journal's Tech D.Live conference is underway this morning where big names  and descending on Laguna Beach, California.  Susan Li is there.  Susan,  good morning.</p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you, Maria.   Yes, we'll be talking all things tech here in Laguna beach.  That includes  government regulation, innovation, and future partnerships.  Now, later on,  to the program, will feature a lot of heavyweights, that includes Uber CEO,  Dara Khosrowshahi, one of the headliners.  And then, we have celebrity  attendance as well.  Gwyneth Paltrow will be holding the evening session  along with Kevin Hart, the comedian.  Last night, we heard from AT&amp;T's  Randall Stephenson who has some interesting things to say about President  Trump, about Jim Acosta, Time Warner and CNN, and we also heard from  (INAUDIBLE) of Google.  </p><p> Now, we also caught up with Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's former CEO,  billionaire, owner of the L.A. Clips.  And I think that the overarching  theme her are like going to be so far has been this -- talk about the  relationship between the White House and big tech.  And whether or not  they'll be more regulation in the future of big Silicon Valley names.  I  asked Steve Ballmer this.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT:  I don't think Microsoft has much  risk at all right now.  We certainly had ours in the past.  Amazon will  have their own set of issues.  The most important thing for anybody running  a successful tech company where there's not a clear issue.  It's just to  continue to do their job well, be responsible.  I think Amazon has done a  very good job so far.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LI:  Yes.  It was an -- a great job, Jeff Bezos has done a great job as  Steve Ballmer says.  We'll talk more later on today and we have more  interviews coming to you and coming on Fox Business from Laguna Beach.   Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really good stuff.  Susan, thank you.  Susan Lee joining us  there in Laguna.  Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Back  In a Minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey  Bell.</p><p> BELL:  Look, the markets might be going well, but the bedrock of the  country, the consumer is strong and we saw that in Home Depot's numbers and  we'll here about that from retailers later this week.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Bullish (INAUDIBLE) Mitch?</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And I think the markets just need to calm down.  You know,  sometimes good news is bad news, and bad news is good news.  Right now, the  market just needs to calm down, calm down.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, it's the stability.  Look long term, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And New York City, I'm going to tweet this.  I think the  Governor of the New York -- of New York state and the major of New York  City, maybe need to do a conference call with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to  explain what 25,000 jobs mean in terms of the tax revenue, and how that  actually helps fix the New York City subways.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And there's a reason that every city in the country wanted the  Amazon headquarters.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  They all wanted it.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Most observers rank the Denver area near the top among places that fit Amazon's criteria.</p><p>Tech-startup executives laud metro Denver as a place to hire employees locally as well as for recruiting from out of state. Many of them say Amazon being here could help Denver's talent shortage by bringing thousands of new people here.</p><p>\"Those skilled workers Amazon hires would bring a lot of talented spouses and partners with them,\" said Bryan Leach, founder and CEO of Denver-based Ibotta Inc., the booming maker of a shopping app. \"I see it as a net positive for the business community.\"</p><p>It would also put Denver on the map for having a big, tech-centric employer, something it doesn't have today.</p><p>Tech employees tend to jump to new companies every few years. They think about who their next employer might be when they weigh an offer involving relocation.</p><p>Denver's current lack of a nationally recognizable industry headquarters can dissuade in-demand tech professionals - especially those with families - from leaving larger hubs on the coasts.</p><p>An Amazon HQ2 would change that, local execs say. And it would also throw off a lot of workers as employees there decide to work for other companies or to start their own businesses, benefiting companies hiring in the metro area, executives said.</p><p>\"Big companies draw a massive amount of talent to a community,\" said Jon Shanahan, president and CEO of Des Moines-based Businessolver, maker of insurance benefits software for corporations. \"And not all of them find that being at a big company is right for them.\"</p><p>Businessolver is focusing a lot of the company's national growth in Denver because of its success attracting skilled employees here. Amazon HQ2 landing in the Denver area would likely improve Businessolver's recruiting prospects, Shanahan said.</p><p> 'Jeff Bezos is selling soap'<br/></p><p>But not everyone is convinced HQ2 would be entirely good for Denver tech companies.</p><p>\"Overall I think it would put tremendous strain on the talent pipeline that's already stressed,\" said Chris Glode, CEO and founder of HumanCode, a Denver startup that makes software analyzing genetic testing data. There's little overlap between the skills HumanCode hires for and what Amazon would likely seek, Glode said.</p><p>In his previous job, at MapMyFitness in Denver and Austin, he regularly had to contend with Amazon trying to recruit MapMyFitness employees to Seattle, usually without success, he said.</p><p>Amazon would make worker retention harder for other employers, particularly companies like Arrow Electronics, SendGrid and CenturyLink with a broad range of skills on the payroll locally, Glode predicted.</p><p>Amazon, being mainly a retailer, wouldn't be an automatic draw for many software developers. Many tech workers are drawn to companies working on solving particular problems they're passionate about, said Patrick Quinlan, CEO of Denver-based Convercent, which makes software to help big companies police internal ethics and regulatory compliance.</p><p>Quinlan says landing Amazon HQ2 would be a big win for Denver's scene, and not something that would change Convercent's ability to recruit.</p><p>\"We're solving ethics, and people are reporting child slavery in our system. Jeff Bezos is selling soap,\" he said.<br/></p><p>Did you find this article useful?

It feels like only yesterday when in August 2018 Apple became the world's first company to exceed $1 trillion in value.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the time, it was an achievement that left investors stunned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The figure seemed dizzying, capping a more than 50,000pc share price surge since the moment when Apple first floated on the stock market in 1980. Yet, despite market gyrations, a trade war and an ongoing global pandemic which has ushered in the worst economic crisis for generations, under two years later Apple already stands at $1.68 trillion (\u00a31.3 trillion) - and counting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, three other companies have grappled their way into the club of trillion dollar companies: Microsoft at $1.58 trillion, Amazon at $1.57 trillion and Google-owner Alphabet at $1.06 trillion.</p><p>As Big Tech's biggest beasts prepare to release their results over the coming days, which of them is best placed to cross the $2 trillion threshold first? To be sure, the bloated valuations of these companies still feel unfathomable. Put together, those four alone were worth $5.85 trillion by yesterday afternoon - slightly higher than the $5.7 trillion GDP recorded last year by Japan, the world's third biggest economy after the US and China.</p><p>The figure is nearly treble the combined market valuation of all the companies in the FTSE 100 which stands at \u00a31.7 trillion, while Britain's biggest single company, AstraZeneca, is worth a piffling \u00a3111bn - a mere pimple on Apple's armpit.</p><p>Justified or otherwise, there is no denying the extraordinary success of these companies, which have thrived during a prolonged period of economic dislocation while many others have struggled to survive.</p><p>Apple, which generated sales of $124bn in the six months ending March 28, may be the Goliath of the global technology industry but it may not be the most obvious candidate to hit $2 trillion first.</p><p>That's because despite efforts to reduce its heavy reliance on the iPhone, and a recent focus on services and wearables as the next big growth opportunities, at its heart Apple remains a hardware company which is more exposed to deteriorating relations with China than its peers.</p><p>Apple has enjoyed a recent lift at the expense of Huawei, a key competitor which has been hammered by US sanctions and restrictions on its use of cutting edge US chip designs.</p><p>Nevertheless, the iPhone still generates roughly half of Apple's sales, while other devices - iPads and Macs - take the share of hardware up to 75pc of overall sales.</p><p>Smartphones remain a stagnant market of course. Global sales of smartphones across the industry fell 20pc in the first quarter of 2020, according to Gartner which also predicts global device shipments - including PCs, tablets and phones - to fall 14pc this year.</p><p>Such figures are distorted by the Covid-19 lockdown, but even a potential boost from the launch of Apple's first 5G iPhone, expected in September, is unlikely to significantly move the dial. Apple has struggled to develop its next killer product to supplant the Mac, iPad and iPhone of yesteryear, while services income may come under pressure amid anger over the stiff commissions charged to third party developers using its app store.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tim Cook's colossus, which produces most of its devices in China - the world's biggest smartphone market - faces a serious challenge grappling with deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing.</p><p>A comprehensive reordering of its supply chain is in the offing - which won't be easy or cheap.</p><p>Microsoft has been the tech industry's dark horse in recent years. After a rocky period a few years back, under Satya Nadella, the chief executive, the Seattle-based company has overseen a remarkable comeback through a far-sighted pivot into cloud computing and an overhaul of what many viewed as a toxic culture.</p><p>Once written off as a has-been which famously fumbled the rise of the smartphone through an ill-judged acquisition of Nokia, then another has-been, Microsoft has enjoyed a boost from the pandemic through the surging popularity of services like Microsoft Teams.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is not Microsoft but its cross-town rival, Amazon, which of all of the big tech companies arguably has the greatest shot at hitting the $2 trillion mark first. Without Apple's Chinese headaches, Jeff Bezos's corporate octopus has so many limbs growing at such a phenomenal pace it sometimes seems hard to keep track of them all.</p><p>Amazon also has a clear runway of growth in the years ahead, not only in its core e-commerce business but across several others.</p><p>Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud computing arm, is still growing at over 33pc per year.</p><p>Amazon Prime Video, its streaming business, is likely to have enjoyed a boost from lockdown viewing, while its often overlooked advertising business is emerging as a serious contender to Facebook and Google.</p><p>Amazon is somewhat cagey about the performance of this unit, refusing to break it out.</p><p>But its \"other\" category, which mostly covers the ad division, was up a stunning 44pc in the last quarter to $3.9bn in revenue.</p><p>The company possesses detailed insights into its customers' tastes, their likes and dislikes, and it's increasingly leveraging that information for fresh commercial advantage.</p><p>Then of course there is e-commerce, where Amazon remains hugely dominant and where it has enjoyed a huge advantage during the temporary shutdown of so many bricks and mortar retailers.</p><p>There is also still huge scope for growth, especially in international markets.</p><p>For Jeff Bezos, who will appear before a US Congressional hearing into competition next Monday, the company's biggest threat does not come from its rivals so much as from politicians and regulators.</p><p>From the amount of tax it pays to the impact Amazon is having on the high street and the dominance of its cloud computing arm, as it edges towards $2 trillion in value Bezos's extraordinary creation is facing growing calls to be pruned back.</p><p>Whether or not that pressure yields results, Mr Bezos doesn't have too much to worry about.</p><p>The world's richest man - whose personal stake in the company jumped by $13bn in value on Monday alone to a total of $189bn - is unlikely to feel the pinch any time soon.</p><p/><p>'Apple has struggled to develop its next killer product to supplant the Mac, iPad and iPhone of yesteryear'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Apple was the first to cross the $1 trillion Rubicon but Jeff Bezos's Amazon is favourite to reach $2 trillion firstAFP VIA GETTY IMAGES</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-161766031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DR-YS41-JCBW-N02X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002L6S</classCode><className>ASTRAZENECA PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Undoubtedly, it's the man himself. There could be another Amazon; Bezos is still capable of building a second one from the scratch. But it's highly unlikely the world is going to see another Jeff Bezos. Such is the power and influence the man, his many products and partnerships that we can easily say what Bezos thinks now is what the world will think tomorrow. Whether that's a great thing or not is a matter of debate. In Bezonomics, Fortune journalist Brian Dumaine says the Amazon founder has introduced a new form of business leadership, which is changing the way we live, work and even think. In an email interaction with BusinessLine, Dumaine talks more about the book and how Amazon is delivering a new world order and business culture among us. Edited excerpts:</p><p><br/> Brad Stone's 2013 book, The Everything Store, detailed the Amazon journey. What did you want to add in Bezonomics?<br/> So much as happened with Amazon since Brad Stone wrote his excellent book back in 2013. Amazon was not in the cloud computing business, it had not become a video and music streaming powerhouse, Alexa the voice recognition system didn't exist, it wasn't building its own shipping company and it was a much smaller company with lesser impact on society and the global economy. I wanted to capture the way Jeff Bezos, now the richest man in the world, was bringing change to the way we do business and the way we live.<br/> The world has seen business behemoths ever since the advent of the industrial revolution. What makes Amazon special?<br/>Amazon stands out in history because it is the first company to successfully integrate big data, AI and machine learning into the physical world. Other big tech platforms such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft make their money in cyberspace. Bezos, in a sense, is digitising the world of retail, shipping, vehicles with its self-driving delivery vans, and home electronics - with its smart home security and entertainment systems all running on Alexa.<br/> Take, for example, how Amazon ensures that its customers almost always can find what they want and get it delivered when they want it, no matter where they live in the markets that the retailer serves around the world. Before machine learning came along, Amazon conducted weekly retail reviews with as many as 60 managers - similar to Walmart's famous Saturday-morning meetings. Those who were responsible for the supply and those responsible for demand would sit around a table - some would call in from other regions - and negotiate what to buy, how much to buy, and which warehouses needed what amount.<br/> The company's computer systems provided lots of useful data about sales trends on which to make their decisions, but it was still human beings making those decisions. Amazon has now taken the most recurring conversations discussed around that table - such as what is the error rate in shipping, what are the shifts in consumer demand, what are the changes in the time to get a product from the factory to the warehouse - and designed machines to make decisions based on those factors. \"We were able,\" Amazon's head of global commerce Jeff Wilke told me, \"to close the loop so humans no longer have to decide. We place buy orders for millions of items automatically.\"<br/> What are the historic and economic factors that have gone in favour of Bezos and Amazon, something others missed?  One of the most important historic events that helped Amazon become what it is today was the advent of Moore's Law, which posits that computer processing power and speed doubles every two years. Over the past couple of decades, computing power has become so cheap that crunching the mountains of data necessary for machine learning and forms of AI such as voice and facial recognition became more affordable. Amazon would not have been able to collect and swiftly manipulate information on its hundreds of millions of customers around the world without Moore's Law. Without cheap computing, Amazon would not be able to deliver most of the 600 million different products it offers to its customers in two days or less. That's a game-changer.<br/> Also, Amazon, which was founded in 1995, was early to the e-commerce market which has given it a first-mover advantage. The company now controls 38 per cent of the e-commerce market in the US and about a quarter of the market in Europe. That's a hard barrier to overcome for competitors.<br/> Which leader can Bezos (whom you call an unconventional founder) be compared to, and why?<br/> I think the leader who best matches up to Jeff Bezos is Apple's Steve Jobs, in the sense that they both are master innovators. Both Jobs and Bezos had that rare knack that allowed them to figure out what customers want, even though most don't even know it. What customer focus group would have come up with the idea for an iPod or an iPhone? Jobs knew that digital portability would be popular and made huge bets on those technologies. Bezos did the same with the Prime membership programme, Kindle and Alexa.<br/> You say Bezos has introduced a new form of business leadership, 'Bezonomics'. What are its salient features?<br/>  He designed Amazon to spin like a flywheel - a term Amazonians use religiously. Less a formula and more a high-tech perpetual motion machine for growth, the \"flywheel\" paradigm is deeply embedded in Amazon's culture. Picture a three-tonne stone wheel resting on a suspended axel. Getting it moving is tough. The trick is to apply enough energy day in and day out to get the flywheel spinning faster and faster until it keeps moving on its own. When Amazon offers perks to its Prime members such as free one- or two-day shipping, free Amazon TV shows, or a discount at Whole Foods, it brings more customers to its site.<br/> More customers attract more third-party sellers to Amazon.com because they want to reach this large pool of potential customers. (Today, independent, third-party sellers account for more than half all the products sold on Amazon. The company sells the rest directly to consumers.) Attracting more sellers increases Amazon's revenues and creates more economies of scale that allow it to lower prices on its site and offer more benefits. That attracts more customers to Amazon.com, and that brings more sellers, and the flywheel keeps turning faster and faster and faster.<br/> But Amazon's flywheel has now evolved into an even more formidable machine. What Bezos has done is taken the flywheel concept to a new level, a move that is revolutionising the way we do business and one that has given the company an almost insurmountable competitive advantage over its rivals. He has created the next-generation corporation, the 21st century model for how the world will do business. Bezos is now accelerating his flywheel through the shrewd use of AI, machine learning, and big data. The company has gotten so good at applying computer technology that it has started to learn and get smarter on its own. No corporation has ever done this as successfully as Amazon. A lot of CEOs pay lip service to AI and hire a handful of data scientists in an effort to tack this technology onto their business model. At Amazon, technology is the key driver to everything it does. Consider that for the development and upgrading of its magic genie Alexa, which runs on AI voice software, the company as of 2019 had tasked 10,000 employees, the lion's share of data scientists, engineers and programmers.<br/>Amazon today enjoys immense power and uses that to influence people in ways previously unimaginable. We have examples of the influence going the wrong way in many instances. What's gone wrong?<br/>Amazon has been accused of using its online might to crush the small businesses that sellers that operate on its site. The US Congress and the EU are investigating Amazon's alleged anti-competitive practices. The concern is that the company is using sales data from those third-party sellers to create their own Amazon-branded products and then they harm those sellers by offering a similar product more cheaply. Some regulators want to separate Amazon's retail business from its online platform to stop this abuse. Amazon counters by saying that they can't be harming their third-party sellers because they are now the fastest-growing segment and Amazon.com, accounting for 58 per cent of all sales.<br/> Where do you think Amazon will be in the next decade, given its reach and power?<br/> Today's shoppers want not only fast delivery but also the option either to buy online or browse in a real store. With its $13.7-billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017, Amazon is in a position to become a leader in a new hybrid form of retailing that promises to disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar retail. Whole Foods' 500-plus stores give Amazon's customers the choice of ordering groceries online and having them delivered to the home; ordering online and having them put in their trunk on the way home from work; or going into the store itself. That's hybrid retailing and it's the future.<br/> Now, Amazon is building a national chain of lower-cost grocery stores in the US to compete more directly with Walmart and Kroger. One expert suggested that Amazon converts abandoned Sears locations into their new grocery stores. The company is also striving to operate on a smaller scale, too. As of 2019, Amazon operated 42 of its own physical retail stores, including Amazon Go, Amazon 4-star, and Amazon Books. So far, Amazon has opened only 15 Go stores, where shoppers can buy sandwiches, salads, and drinks without checking out. Ceiling cameras scan purchases and charge them directly to the shoppers' Amazon account. Weights in the shelves determine whether the person has returned the item. The stores have proved popular, and the company says it will keep rolling them out. Wall Street analysts predict that the Go Stores will be a multi-billion business by the middle of this decade.<br/>Amazon continues to build AWS, its cloud computing business, and its online advertising business. And that's just the beginning of the disruption Bezos is causing. The company is moving into finance, healthcare, and shipping. When Bezos applies his AI flywheel to these industries, many competitors are likely to be ground into dust or at best lose significant market share.<br/> You discuss the need for Amazon-proofing your business. Is it really possible? Especially for small businesses in markets like India?<br/> Yes, this is possible. In Chapter 12 of my book Bezonomics, I detail how small businesses, whether in India or elsewhere, can outflank Amazon. If a company can't match Amazon's vast assortment of products, low prices and speedy delivery, it must differentiate itself in other ways. It needs to pursue strategies that Amazon would be hard put to match. The common thread? The retailers of the future will focus their efforts in four major areas: creating an amazing in-store experience that digitally merges with an amazing online one; offering a highly curated selection of exclusive products; investing heavily in technology, including mastering social media; and doubling down on a social mission in a way that makes customers feel good about buying from them.<br/> You note that \"Amazon is many things, but one thing, in particular, it's not known for is its social conscience.\" Why so?<br/> The company has been slow on the social and environment front, mainly because Bezos built Amazon by focussing all its energy and resources on the customer. On the environment, the company's billions of deliveries and its energy-sucking server farms aren't helping the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Its warehouse workers have to do physically stressful repetitive work. On top of all that, in 2017 and 2018, the Wall Street Journal estimated that Amazon legally paid little or no US federal income-a fact that's hard to swallow given that the company posted $10 billion in annual profits in 2018 alone. The company now realises that is can't ignore its social conscience and it has started to change by paying its warehouse workers more and by pledging to a zero-carbon footprint.<br/> Can't regulations and state policies force it to be more \"humane\"? Any suggestions, especially for governments in countries like India where we are based?<br/> The company's culture is fast-paced, aggressive and largely unforgiving for both white and blue-collar workers alike. Amazon employs hundreds of thousands in its vast global warehouse network, and these jobs are hard, demeaning, and non-union. Amazon is trying to change this. This spring, Bezos announced that the company will spend $4 billion trying to make its warehouses safer for workers during the pandemic. As bad as are the working conditions in its warehouses, those workers have to worry that they'll in the next few years be replaced by robots who can do their tasks more quickly and cheaply. And that day is coming sooner than most think.<br/> Do you wish you had written Bezonomics after Covid-19, which made Amazon all the more powerful while exposing its weaknesses as well? Will you bring out an updated edition soon?<br/> Yes, I will add a chapter for the paperback edition that comes out next spring and have already written a new Covid-19 related preface for the Japanese edition that comes out this summer.<br/> If you are asked to explain Amazon in one word, what would that be?<br/> Momentum.<br/> What are you working on now?<br/> I'm looking for the next Jeff Bezos to write about.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-A426707</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6094-XS71-JBYT-H0MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2258\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Last year[3], Vestager confirmed that her team was exploring how Amazon uses the data from third-party sellers. She made clear, however, that the work was at a preliminary stage. Amazon's role as both a seller and a platform for other merchants has become one of the most contentious areas of the business, with the Federal Trade Commission also looking at the practice. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[4] Amazon is reportedly facing an antitrust probe in the EU. According to a report from Bloomberg[5], the EU's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager \u2014 a formidable force when it comes to scrutinizing big tech \u2014 will launch a \"full-blown\" investigation into Amazon withing days. Vestager said last year[6] that her team had started to look into how Amazon was using the data from sales of its third-party sellers on the platform. She made clear at the time, however, that the work was at a preliminary stage. Amazon and the European Commission did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Read more: The EU is now going after Amazon after slapping Google and Apple with giant fines[7]The news comes just months after reports surfaced that the Federal Trade Commission[8] in the US was questioning Amazon's rivals about some of its business practices, including how it competes with its own third-party sellers. Amazon's role as both a seller and a platform for other merchants has become one of the most contentious areas of the business, especially as reports[9] surfaced that it had been using sellers' data to create its own versions of best-selling items. The main concern for both regulators and competitors is that the company is so dominant that it's impossible for others to compete. Vestager is known for her no-nonsense attitude[10]. Since taking on the role of EU Commissioner for Competition in 2014, she has taken action against Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google among others. In July[11] 2018, she fined Google $5 billion[12] for anti-competitive practices related to its Android operating system. In 2016, Apple was forced to pay $16 billion in back taxes to Ireland.[13] Such is the aggression with which Vestager has pursued US tech firms, she has drawn the anger of President Donald Trump. He said last month[14] that she \"hates the United States perhaps worse than any person I've ever met.\"NOW WATCH: Jeff Bezos is worth over $160 billion \u2014 here's how the world's richest man makes

Warren's statements come after both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have announced investigations into potential antitrust behaviour by Big Tech, including Amazon, whose dominance over online retail some see as stifling competition.But Fingold doesn't buy it. </p><p>'Predatory' practices similar to the ones Amazon uses are everywhere 'My suspicion is that on the regulatory concerns within Amazon itself, that is, around how they make money, that it's very similar to how grocery stores make their money, so I don't understand how it would have a regulatory finding against the company that doesn't in fact hurt the grocery store companies more,' says Fingold, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Dynamic Funds, in conversation with BNN Bloomberg on Wednesday.'I'm thinking in particular about their advertising business where they take incentives from manufacturers in order to determine how to position products and merch and how they feature private label products and so forth. Regulators have discussed all of that, and grocery stores do the same thing \u2014 they have loyalty cards and therefore they use client data,' he says.Fingold says that while Amazon's share price has been facing pressure recently, the more long-term picture looks better \u2014 although a forced splintering of the company would be a boon for its cloud segment, AWS.'I think that Amazon is a great company and we owned it for many years,' Fingold says. 'We've been out of it for about 12 months now, mostly because we've been trying to figure out where their operating expenses would be because without that it's hard for us to come up with an earnings estimate. But I do think that it bears observation. It's on our watch list.''I think that the company is having an issue short-term because there could be some regulatory overhang. I have a feeling that if regulators require Amazon Web Services to be separated, for instance, that that would actually be a very beneficial catalyst because it's a very valuable business,' he says.Amazon's share price peaked above $2,000 in early July,[2] the second time it has reached those heights, but a mixed quarterly report in late July started the stock on a downward trend. Amazon posted a strong top line for its second quarter, coming in with revenue of $63.4 billion, a 20-per-cent increase over the same period a year earlier and better than analysts had expected. But earnings came in at $5.22 per share whereas analysts had been expecting $5.57 per share.

Politicians have been itching for greater oversight of big technology. Now the wheels have been set in motion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Post</emphasis>  Friday that the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice divvied up oversight of Amazon.com  and Alphabet  with the FTC overseeing Amazon and the DOJ being responsible for Alphabet. The implication is that investigations are coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors should worry. Alphabet shares were already falling on Monday morning as reports of an  surfaced. </p><p>And although these processes have probably been underway for some time, news of greater oversight comes as Amazon is reportedly looking to enter the wireless market through the  . Shares of Amazon were down 3% to 1,721.75 on Monday morning compared to a decline of 0.7% for the Nasdaq.</p><p>Shares of were dxaafor grabs because T-Mobile  and Sprint  are pledging to divest Boost as part of their $26.5 billion merger plan. Analysts believe the Irvine, Calif. business has 7 million to 8 million subscribers in the U.S. and Australia and might fetch $4.5 billion if radio spectrum is included.</p><p>Some have speculated Amazon is gathering wireless spectrum for future autonomous delivery drones and vans. It's a controversial bet. One analyst at Moffet Nathanson  <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bloomberg</emphasis> such a deal would be \"batsh** crazy\".</p><p>That assessment may be short-sighted. Amazon's best in class e-commerce platform is built around customer service. Its patrons love it so much that 100 million of them are willing to pay a fee just to be members.</p><p>For that fee, about $119 per year in the U.S., Amazon Prime customers get two-day (soon to be one-day) delivery on thousands of items, unfettered access to digital TV shows and movies on Prime Video, music on Prime Music and book exchanges, as well as deals at Whole Foods, the 500-store grocery chain that was folded into the Amazon ecosystem in 2017, following a $13.4 billion  .</p><p>Ultimately, Boost may be about wireless spectrum, drones and driverless cars. But it's even more likely that Amazon managers are thinking about how a prepaid wireless provider, with a thriving business in key markets, could help attract even more members to Amazon Prime.</p><p>Loyalty is what separates the e-commerce giant from the competition. Adding a seemingly discounted wireless business to Prime would make it even stickier.</p><p>Unfortunately, for shareholders, government regulators may being doing the math, too. Putting Amazon.com under the jurisdiction of the FTC means the Feds are now going to take a prolonged, hard look at everything.</p><p>Since the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and CEO, has become a somewhat accidental foe of President Trump. The Seattle billionaire also owns the Washington Post, whose editorial board has been a frequent critic of the president.</p><p>In the past, President Trump has lashed out, calling for investigations into Amazon.com. He suggested in 2018 that Amazon.com was scamming the post office. That assessment is factually incorrect, according to a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis>  , but the damage was done. Bezos, and Amazon made it onto a hit list, of sorts.</p><p>And there is some reason for investors to worry.</p><p>White-label products, goods often manufactured offshore but sold under the Amazon brand, are growing fast. Customers searching Amazon.com for batteries or baby wipes are likely to be directed to an Amazon Basics choice.</p><p>Mary Meeker, the famed internet analyst,  in 2017 that Amazon sold more batteries than Duracell, and almost as many diapers as Procter &amp; Gamble  .</p><p>But that's only half the story. Since inception, Amazon.com software has been cataloging and data mining customer purchases. Software engineers and product managers know what items are trending, which ones are being searched and most importantly, what price customers are willing to pay. It's a wealth of information that the company has been using to successfully develop white label products.</p><p>TKI Research  in October 2018, the company had 120 distinct brands, and another 150 Amazon exclusive brands, including apparel and furniture.</p><p>That business, according to a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CNBC</emphasis>  , is expected to generate $25 billion in sales by 2022, or three times their current revenues of $7.5 billion.</p><p>It's an unfair advantage Amazon has over other sellers at Amazon.com.</p><p>I have been bullish for Amazon shares for a decade. I have repeatedly told investors to use every dip as an opportunity to add to longer term positions. The business is that good. However, I acknowledge that greater oversight from the FTC will be near-term headwind for the stock.</p><p>Amazon's market capitalization has swollen to $870 billion. Shares trade at roughly 45x forward earnings, and 3.5x sales.

That implies a maximum penalty of $23 billion based on 2018 revenue. </p><p>In a statement, Amazon said: \"We will cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\"</p><p>The European Union has emerged as a key battleground for tech because of its tough rules on data protection, hate speech, taxation and competition issues. Apple, Amazon and Facebook have all come under scrutiny.</p><p>In March, the bloc hit Google with a third antitrust penalty, ordering it to pay (EURO)1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) for abusing its dominant position in online search advertising. It's been fined (EURO)8.2 billion ($9.2 billion) in total by Europe since 2017. </p><p>Spotify asked the bloc's antitrust regulators to intervene in a dispute with Apple over its App Store in March. </p><p>Vestager previously examined Apple's purchase of music app Shazam but eventually approved the deal. And in 2016, the European Union ordered Apple to repay (EURO)13 billion ($14.6 billion) in tax breaks to Ireland.</p><p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission is investigating Facebook over data breaches and other issues.</p><p>Meanwhile, pressure on tech companies is building in the United States.</p><p>The US Federal Trade Commission is reportedly preparing to fine Facebook roughly $5 billion for mishandling user data.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said a number of times that the company is ready for a debate about regulation. </p><p>Amazon is a $178 billion disruptor in the retail sector. Its sheer scale has marked it out as a target for US President Donald Trump, who reportedly obsesses[1] over the company's impact on the US Postal Office, the amount of tax it pays, and the potential harm it is causing other retailers. \"Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!\" Trump tweeted in August last year.[2] But don't expect Amazon to start worrying about its impact anytime soon. In an interview with The Sunday Times[3], Russell Grandinetti, Amazon's senior vice president of international consumer, said his job is to focus on growth \u2014 and it's for others to figure out how to deal with the ripples Amazon creates in the marketplace. \"Companies have often invented technologies that have then required us to figure out how to reinvest the productivity improvements in new jobs and new ways,\" he said. \"That's an important societal thing to do, an important governmental thing to do. I don't think it's our job to do anything but try to be really good at what we do.\" The Sunday Times said investors will \"cheer\" his relentless focus on revenue, but critics will worry \"he is turning a blind eye to the disruption Amazon causes.\" Grandinetti did, however, address concerns that Amazon is destroying jobs, by pointing to those it creates. He said: \"We create lots of jobs not only in the company \u2014 100,000 in the US last year alone, 5,000 in Britain \u2014 but also in the suppliers we serve.\" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said a number of times that the company is ready for a debate about regulation. \"If you look at the big tech companies, they have gotten large enough that they are going to be inspected. It's not personal,\" he said at an event in Germany in April.[4] The Amazon CEO said policing the power of online companies is \"one of the great questions of our age\" because as the internet has reached a level of maturity over the past decade \"we haven't learned as a civilization, as a human species, how to operate it yet.\"NOW WATCH: This conveyor belt can move in any direction[5]See Also:

Appetites have curbed a bit amid accusations the JEDI contract wasn't ever up for grabs. Project JEDI is a $10 billion defense contract for a single commercial provider to build a cloud computing platform to support weapons systems and classified data storage.Despite the big tech bidding war, to hear Oracle and IBM[1] tell the story, Amazon[2]'s had it in the bag all along. </p><p>Oracle filed[3] a pre-award bid protest with the Government Accountability Office in August citing, among other concerns, the fact that the Pentagon intends to award the contract to a single vendor. And IBM filed a similar protest[4] this week, just days before the bidding deadline on October 12. The single-vendor that IBM and Oracle appear concerned about is, of course, Amazon. But the protests are about more than just the government being unfair, it's also about the Pentagon handing the keys to the kingdom over to a single vendor - a strategy that would make any security pro's eye twitch. According to Oracle's petition: DoD's single awardee IDIQ contract approach is contrary to statutory and regulatory requirements; contrary to the perspective of numerous industry experts that a multi-vendor IDIQ contract offers the most advantageous approach for DoD's near term and long term technology requirements; contrary to the market trend toward multi-cloud environments; and contrary to DoD's own stated objectives of flexibility, innovation, a broad industrial base, and keeping pace with evolving technology. Basically, Oracle is calling the Pentagon out for putting together a package that doesn't appear to adhere to any of its own guidelines for cloud computing systems. IBM's in total agreement with Oracle. In a strongly-worded official blog post[5] yesterday the company stated: IBM knows what it takes to build a world-class cloud. No business in the world would build a cloud the way JEDI would and then lock in to it for a decade. JEDI turns its back on the preferences of Congress and the administration, is a bad use of taxpayer dollars and was written with just one company in mind. America's warfighters deserve better. Accusations the Pentagon has had a specific company in mind the entire time aren't entirely unwarranted. When specifically asked if the stringent requirements for the contract were designed specifically so that only Amazon's cloud service, AWS[6], would meet them, the government failed[7] to provide a response. If Amazon gets the contract, AWS will potentially have a 10-year reign as the single provider, innovator, and host for the Pentagon's most ambitious cloud project to date. In related news, Google rescinded its bid[8] for the project earlier this week citing ethical concerns. But company leadership also said its decision was influenced by the fact that it didn't have the certifications required, which lends credibility to Oracle and IBM's complaints. We've reached out to the Department of Defense for comment and will update this story as necessary.

Facing greater skepticism about its growing power over retail, including from <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>Amazon is following the well-worn path of oil, pharmaceutical and even other large tech companies, which try to bend policy in their favor by enhancing connections with federal officials.</p><p>Amazon is sweeping the nation's capitol with a branding campaign of jobs creation and support for small businesses, promoting the upsides of its major expansion in media, groceries and transportation. This year, Amazon has increased its lobbying staff to 83 members from 60, making it one of the biggest corporate lobbying shops in town. The company is also on its way to surpassing its previous high for lobbying spending: $11.3 million last year. The $6.2 million Amazon spent in the first two quarters of this year was the 11th most among companies, above Exxon and far above Walmart, which spent $3.6 million in the same period.</p><p>  The company's more aggressive approach, focused on building relationships with leading politicians and improving the company's overall reputation, is a break from its past.

Amazon is hosting events for lawmakers, like the day of events in July, and holding discussions on transportation and labor policies for congressional staff and policy makers at its sleek offices near Capitol Hill. Speaker <person><nameText>Paul D. Ryan </nameText></person>and other political leaders have visited Amazon's fulfillment centers in their home districts, where Amazon talks up the thousands of jobs those warehouses support.</p><p>Amazon's strategic shift has happened as politicians are getting bolder in their criticism about the size and influence of big tech companies. Republicans and Democrats alike have focused on issues including antitrust, privacy and public disclosure.</p><p>  Many of the harshest attacks have been directed at Facebook and Google, which also have robust lobbying arms in Washington. But Amazon has attracted its own set of vocal critics, who say the company's push into groceries, fashion, transportation and other industries threatens competition. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has lashed out at the company and Jeff Bezos, the company's chief executive, multiple times, accusing the company of avoiding taxes among other things. The company has said it follows all tax laws and has supported a bill that would force online commerce sites to collect sales taxes.</p><p>  ''The concentration of power in the hands of a few companies has the potential to hurt the economy and consumers in the long run,'' said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust matters. He raised concerns over Amazon's $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods over the summer, noting that antitrust laws may need an update to account for the power internet companies have over the economy.</p><p>Amazon, which declined to comment for this article, has said that its online retail business makes up a minority of all commerce and that it is producing tens of thousands of jobs in regions that have long been in decline. The company had 180,000 full-time employees in the United States at the end of 2016, nearly double its head count five years earlier. The company has said those gains help make up for the job losses from struggling brick-and-mortar retailers.</p><p>  In the span of a few weeks this summer, Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration, visited Amazon's headquarters in Seattle, where the company had small retailers on hand to talk about how Amazon had helped their businesses. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, attended the opening of a new fulfillment center in Edwardsville, Ill. And Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, visited a new fulfillment center in his home state of Ohio.</p><p>  ''Got to meet some of the 3,000+ Ohioans employed at this plant. #Jobs,'' Mr. Portman wrote on Twitter at the time.</p><p>  ''They are doing all this reputation stuff around how it is creating jobs and that's helped it generate a lot of media attention,'' said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit group that promotes community economic development. Last year, her organization published a paper that argued the company was making it harder for smaller retailers to make money from selling on Amazon.</p><p>Amazon has also decided in recent years to spend more money in the broader influence ecosystem of Washington. In 2016, Amazon gave more than $10,000 each to 66 think tanks, lobbying groups and political organizations. More than a dozen organizations were new to its sponsorship roster, like the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Foundation and the conservative Law &amp; Economic Center at George Mason University.</p><p>  Financing Washington's ecosystem of research and lobbying groups is a common practice for tech companies such as Google and Microsoft, but Amazon had not been as active until recent years. Last month, it donated $50 million to a White House plan to promote computer science in classrooms.</p><p>Amazon is racing to catch up. Yet even with similar lobbying armies, Google and Facebook have not escaped criticism -- in their cases over their platforms' potential to shape public opinion.</p><p>  ''With Amazon, we need more transparency and need to look at longer term factors when it comes to competition,'' Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic Senator from Minnesota said in a recent interview. ''The people at the Justice Department in antitrust need to look at deals in other ways.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Job applicants at an Amazon facility in Chattanooga, Tenn.

However, more expensive oil was bound to affect the conglomerate's refining business, and India sources most of the oil it uses from abroad.</p><p>In financial 2018/2019, Reliance's refining margin averaged US$9.20 per barrel, which was considered relatively strong as it was substantially higher than the benchmark Singapore complex margin of US$4.30 a barrel. Still, persistently higher oil prices have clearly affected margins unfavorably.</p><p>Reliance has refining capacity of a total 68.2 million tons of crude, which makes it India's second-largest refiner behind state-owned Indian Oil Corp.</p><p>In the context of hurt refining margins, a deal with Amazon could probably strengthen one of Reliance's top-performing divisions until refining gets back on its feet. While Amazon refused to comment on the report about deal talks, Reliance told the Economic Times \"Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis. We have made and will continue to make necessary disclosures in compliance with our obligations under Securities Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 and our agreements with the stock exchanges.\"</p><p>Crude Oil</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-150682172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPV-YXP1-JDJN-61F9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"345\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yerepouni Daily News.

Oh, it's nothing. Just the rumblings of CHANGE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon may end a third-party vendor policy that prohibits merchants from selling their wares at lower prices outside of Amazon Marketplace, according to a new report from Axios. The news comes days after senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren unveiled her policy proposal for \"breaking up Big Tech,\" including Amazon.</p><p> The report comes from a single anonymous source \"with direct knowledge of the company's decision.\" Axios claims the decision to change the price policy has been made. However, the outlet has published false reports based on anonymous sourcing before. So the news should be taken with a grain of salt; Mashable has reached out to Amazon to confirm whether it will indeed change this policy.</p><p> However, even a discussion of changes at Amazon show how just the specter of anti-trust regulation could already be having an effect. As Axios points out, Amazon changed this policy in Europe in 2013 in response to antitrust complaints. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Con) also asked the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to investigate the \"price parity provisions\" in December. And perhaps discussions of changing policy just need time to kick around at Amazon \u2014 but it sure looks like Warren's announcement, and subsequent national attention to the issue of monopolies in tech, lit a fire under those Amazon butts.</p><p> Pre-emptive, voluntary measures have historically been a way that companies seek to avoid more onerous future legislation. The idea is that companies demonstrate they're willing to make good faith changes on their own, so they won't be forced by law to make even bigger changes in the future. We will probably see more moves like this from Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple. But if Elizabeth Warren takes her agenda into the White House, or even the halls of Congress, it might not be enough.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Anti-trust legislation: the words that strike fear into the hearts of big tech.
