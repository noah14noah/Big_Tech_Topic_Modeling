While White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany \"said Wednesday she could not get ahead of the president to explain the purpose and intent of the order,\" she \"confirmed it would be coming then.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Politico (5/27, Lima, 4.29M) says the announcement \"revived fears within the online industry that the Trump administration will target a 24-year-old statute that protects the companies from lawsuits - an avenue that a growing number of Republican lawmakers have advocated in their bias allegations about Silicon Valley.\" Politico cites a \"senior administration official familiar with the issue,\" who \"said the order, which will be broad and high level, would address complaints that the online platforms are deceiving people by acting like content moderators - picking and choosing what content to allow or block - instead of politically neutral platforms.\"</p><p>The move comes after Trump on Wednesday threatened social media platforms with regulation or shut-downs if conservative voices are silenced. In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump wrote, \"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that happen again. Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!\" Later in the morning, Trump tweeted, \"Twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them (and their other compatriots) is correct. Big action to follow!\"</p><p>The Washington Times (5/27, Sherfinski, 492K) reports that the threat came after \"Twitter attached fact-checking context to Mr. Trump's tweets for the first time on Tuesday.\" Ben Tracy said on the CBS Evening News (5/27, story 5, 1:55, O'Donnell, 4.93M) that Twitter \"fact-checked two of his tweets that falsely claimed mail-in voting leads to fraud.\" Reuters (5/27, Heavey, Bose) says Trump's threat \"was his strongest yet within a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech.\" Reuters says the biggest tech companies \"have been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating user privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon face antitrust probes\" by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general, and a congressional panel.</p><p>The AP (5/27, Miller) says that while the Administration \"has shelved a proposed executive order empowering the FCC to regulate technology companies, citing concerns it wouldn't pass legal muster,\" that \"didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing strong warnings.\" NBC Nightly News (5/27, story 3, 2:05, Holt, 6.89M) described Trump as \"escalating\" his \"battle with Twitter,\" but added that \"a president has no authority to shut down a private company, and the First Amendment limits the government's ability to regulate free speech.\" Similarly, USA Today (5/27, Tyko, 10.31M) says Trump \"can't unilaterally regulate or close the companies, which would require action by Congress or the Federal Communications Commission.\"</p><p>Court Ruling Suggests Trump's Anti-Twitter Push May Not Be Well Received.</p><p>Politico (5/27, Gerstein, 4.29M) reports that a ruling Wednesday by the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals \"is strong evidence that the courts are unlikely to be receptive to...Trump's claims that he and his political supporters are being silenced by social media platforms like Twitter.\" The court \"resoundingly rejected a lawsuit the conservative legal organization Freedom Watch and right-wing provocateur Laura Loomer filed in 2018 against four major technology companies: Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Apple.\" The decision \"is dismissive of a wide range of legal claims some conservatives and liberals have leveled at social media firms in recent months. The appeals court judges said that despite the companies' power, they cannot violate the First Amendment because it only regulates governments, not the private sector.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg Criticizes Twitter For Fact-Checking Trump.</p><p>Fox News (5/27, Halon, 27.59M) reports on its website that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg criticized Twitter for fact-checking Trump. In an interview set to air today on Fox News' Daily Briefing, Zuckerberg said privately-owned digital platforms should not be the \"arbiter of truth.\" Zuckerberg said, \"We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this. ... I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. ... Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.\"</p><p>Twitter's Top Censor Has Posted Anti-Trump Tweets.</p><p>In a piece for The Federalist (5/27, Reynolds, 126K), Ellen Reynolds cites \"anti-Trump tweets by Yoel Roth, Twitter's Head of Site Integrity since July 2018,\" as \"the latest example of the extreme leftward slant and double standards held by those at the helm of Silicon Valley social media giants.\" On Election Night 2016, Roth tweeted, \"I'm just saying, we fly over those states that voter for a racist tangerine for a reason.\" While Roth \"is free to express his political views,\" says Reynolds, the New York Post's Jon Levine, who resurfaced the tweets, \"points out, Roth's job description means he 'leads the teams responsible for developing and enforcing Twitter's rules.'\"</p><p>Twitter Allows Photo Falsely Linking Minnesota Cop To \"Make Whites Great Again\" Hat.</p><p>Breitbart (5/27, Caplan, 673K) reports that Twitter has not taken action after \"several verified accounts on Wednesday posted a photo falsely linking a Minneapolis police officer - infamous after he was caught on video kneeling on a now-deceased black man's neck - with a man wearing a 'Make Whites Great Again' baseball hat.\" Users upset with the officer, who is believed to be Derek Chauvin, \"began sharing a photo collage which falsely suggests is wearing a red baseball hat that reads 'Make Whites Great Again.'\" However, \"the man on the right\" in the collage \"is not Chauvin but appears to resemble former federal prisoner Jonathan Lee Riches.\"</p><p>Twitter Fact-Checks Chinese Official After Questions About Double Standard For Trump.</p><p>The New York Post (5/27, Nelson, 4.57M) reports that amid \"an apparent double standard in its lack of fact-check warnings on tweets by a Chinese government spokesman versus the hardline it took with...Trump this week, Twitter on Wednesday added notations to the postings, which falsely accused the US government of causing the coronavirus pandemic.\" When the Post \"asked Twitter spokeswoman Liz Kelley whether the company would similarly annotate Zhao Lijian's dubious March tweets, she said they would not add fact-check warnings 'at this time.'\" But Kelly \"later said the company had changed its mind\" and \"after further review, we've added labels to these two tweets.\"</p><p>Twitter Facing Pressure After Trump Pushes Baseless Conspiracy Theory About Scarborough.</p><p>On ABC's Good Morning America (5/27, 3.47M), Cecilia Vega said that Trump has \"repeatedly spread a baseless murder conspiracy to smear MSNBC host Joe Scarborough.\" Paula Reid said on CBS This Morning (5/27, 2.79M) that Twitter \"has been facing pressure\" after Trump \"pushed a baseless conspiracy theory accusing\" Scarborough \"of killing his former staff member, Lori Klausutis.\" According to Reid, Klausutis \"suffered a heart condition that caused her to fall and hit her head in Scarborough's office in 2001. A medical examiner ruled her death an accident.\" Peter Alexander said on NBC's Today (5/27, 3.33M) that Twitter is \"under fire\" for the \"incendiary tweets falsely suggesting...Scarborough may have been personally involved\" the death.</p><p>The New York Times (5/27, Grynbaum, Tracy, Cochrane, 18.61M) reports that \"some of...Trump's most stalwart media defenders broke ranks with him...aghast at his baseless smears against\" Scarborough. The Times says \"the backlash even spread to the senior levels of Mr. Trump's party on Capitol Hill,\" where Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) said the President \"should drop the matter.\" The Times says, \"The vast majority of Republican officials have kept silent...and the most prominent conservative voices on Fox News, like Sean Hannity, let the subject go unmentioned on recent broadcasts.\" The Times adds that Trump's repeated accusations against Scarborough have drawn criticism from right-of-center outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and the Washington Examiner.</p><p>The Washington Post (5/27, Wagner, Kane, 14.2M) reports that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) \"declined to weigh in...on [the] baseless conspiracy theory being promoted by...Trump, saying he did not serve with the former congressman whom the president has falsely linked to the death of a staff member.\" Despite the criticism, Trump raised the issue again on Wednesday, The Hill (5/27, Chalfant, 2.98M) reports. Minutes before Scarborough's morning show concluded, Trump tweeted, \"Psycho Joe Scarborough is rattled, not only by his bad ratings but all of the things and facts that are coming out on the internet about opening a Cold Case. He knows what is happening!\"</p><p>Romney Defends Scarborough, Tells Trump \"Enough Already.\"</p><p>The Washington Times (5/27, Blake, 492K) reports Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) on Wednesday called on Trump to stop pushing the conspiracy theory. Romney \"took to Twitter to defend Mr. Scarborough\" and urge Trump \"to stop spreading the conspiracy theory to spare the aide's widower Timothy J. Klausutis the anguish it brings.\" Romney tweeted, \"I know Joe Scarborough. Joe is a friend of mine. I don't know T.J. Klausutis. Joe can weather vile, baseless accusations but T.J.? His heart is breaking. Enough already.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRNTRN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRNTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600X-1C41-DY7M-1003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160011</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1670\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bulletin News Network, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>The Frontrunner</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The officials, who spoke to reporters traveling with Trump to Washington from Florida aboard Air Force One on Wednesday, gave no further details. Before leaving for Florida earlier in the day to observe a space launch that was postponed because of bad weather, Trump again accused Twitter Inc and other social media of bias without offering evidence. It was unclear how Trump could follow through on the threat of shutting down social media companies. </p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union said the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution limits any action Trump could take to regulate such platforms. Twitter declined comment on news of Trump's plans. Facebook and Google did not immediately comment. Separately, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington on Wednesday upheld the dismissal of a suit brought by a conservative group and right-wing YouTube personality against Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple alleging they conspired to suppress conservative political views. Trump's latest dispute with social media emerged after Twitter on Tuesday for the first time attached a warning to some of his tweets prompting readers to fact check the president's claims. In the tweets tagged by Twitter, Trump made unsubstantiated claims about mail-in voting. Trump falsely claims that mail-in ballots lead to vote fraud and ineligible voters getting ballots. \"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,\" Trump said in a pair of additional posts on Twitter on Wednesday. The president, a heavy user of Twitter with more than 80 million followers, added: \"Clean up your act, NOW!!!!\" STRONGEST THREAT YET Trump's threat to shut down platforms like Twitter and Facebook is his strongest yet within a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech. Shares of both companies fell on Wednesday. Last year the White House circulated drafts of a proposed executive order about anti-conservative bias which never gained traction. The Internet Association, which includes Twitter and Facebook among its members, said online platforms do not have a political bias and they offer \"more people a chance to be heard than at any point in history.\" Asked during Twitter's annual meeting on Wednesday why the company decided to affix the label to Trump's mail-in ballot tweets, General Counsel Sean Edgett said decisions about handling misinformation are made as a group. \"We have a group and committee of folks who take a look at these things and make decisions on what's getting a lot of visibility and traction...,\" he said. In recent years Twitter has tightened its policies amid criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive. Tech companies have been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating user privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon face antitrust probes by federal and state authorities and a U.S. congressional panel. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, along with the U.S. Justice Department, have been considering changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for the material their users post. Such changes could expose tech companies to more lawsuits. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a frequent critic of Big Tech companies, sent a letter to Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey on Wednesday asking why the company should continue to receive legal immunity after \"choosing to editorialize on President Trump's tweets.\" Twitter's rival Facebook left Trump's post on mail-in ballots on Tuesday untouched.

It was unclear how Trump could follow through on the threat of shutting down privately owned companies including Twitter Inc.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dispute erupted after Twitter on Tuesday for the first time tagged Trumps tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact check the posts.</p><p>Separately, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington on Wednesday upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit by a conservative group and right-wing YouTube personality against Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple accusing them of conspiring to suppress conservative political views.</p><p>In an interview with Fox News Channel on Wednesday, Facebooks chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a platform would not be the right reflex for a government worried about censorship.

Facebook and Google did not immediately comment.<br/>Separately, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington on Wednesday upheld the dismissal of a suit brought by a conservative group and right-wing YouTube personality against Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple alleging they conspired to suppress conservative political views.<br/><br/>Trump's latest dispute with social media emerged after Twitter on Tuesday for the first time attached a warning to some of his tweets prompting readers to fact check the president's claims.<br/>In the tweets tagged by Twitter, Trump made unsubstantiated claims about mail-in voting. Trump falsely claims that mail-in ballots lead to vote fraud and ineligible voters getting ballots.<br/>\"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,\" Trump said in a pair of additional posts on Twitter on Wednesday.<br/>The president, a heavy user of Twitter with more than 80 million followers, added: \"Clean up your act, NOW!!!!\"<br/>STRONGEST THREAT YET<br/>Trump's threat to shut down platforms like Twitter and Facebook is his strongest yet within a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech. Shares of both companies fell on Wednesday.<br/>Last year the White House circulated drafts of a proposed executive order about anti-conservative bias which never gained traction.<br/>The Internet Association, which includes Twitter and Facebook among its members, said online platforms do not have a political bias and they offer \"more people a chance to be heard than at any point in history.\"<br/>Asked during Twitter's annual meeting on Wednesday why the company decided to affix the label to Trump's mail-in ballot tweets, General Counsel Sean Edgett said decisions about handling misinformation are made as a group.<br/>\"We have a group and committee of folks who take a look at these things and make decisions on what's getting a lot of visibility and traction...,\" he said.<br/>In recent years Twitter has tightened its policies amid criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.<br/>Tech companies have been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating user privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon face antitrust probes by federal and state authorities and a U.S. congressional panel.<br/>Republican and Democratic lawmakers, along with the U.S. Justice Department, have been considering changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for the material their users post. Such changes could expose tech companies to more lawsuits.<br/>Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a frequent critic of Big Tech companies, sent a letter to Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey on Wednesday asking why the company should continue to receive legal immunity after \"choosing to editorialize on President Trump's tweets.\"<br/>Twitter's rival Facebook left Trump's post on mail-in ballots on Tuesday untouched.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/497/1492/53/159062800146.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/497/1492/53/159062800146.jpeg</url></p><p>US President Donald Trump speaks about negotiations with pharmaceutical companies over the cost of insulin for US seniors on Medicare at an event in the Rose Garden at the White House during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Washington, US May 26, 2020 (photo credit: REUTERS/JONATHAN ERNST)<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JPCOME-175517160</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JPCOME2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600T-JKY1-F11P-X35M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411390</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Jerusalem Post.

It was unclear how Trump could follow through on the threat of shutting down privately owned companies including Twitter Inc. The company declined comment.<br/><br/>The dispute erupted after Twitter on Tuesday for the first time tagged Trump's tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact check the posts.<br/><br/>Separately, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington on Wednesday upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit by a conservative group and right-wing YouTube personality against Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple accusing them of conspiring to suppress conservative political views.  In an interview with Fox News Channel on Wednesday, Facebook's Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said censoring a platform would not be the \"right reflex\" for a government worried about censorship. Fox played a clip of the interview and said it would be aired in full on Thursday.  Facebook left Trump's post on mail-in ballots on Tuesday untouched.  The American Civil Liberties Union said the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution limits any action Trump could take. Facebook and Google declined comment.

Shares of both Twitter and Facebook fell on Wednesday.  Last year the White House circulated drafts of a proposed executive order about anti-conservative bias which never gained traction.  The Internet Association, which includes Twitter and Facebook among its members, said online platforms do not have a political bias and they offer \"more people a chance to be heard than at any point in history.\"  Asked during Twitter's annual meeting on Wednesday why the company decided to affix the label to Trump's mail-in ballot tweets, General Counsel Sean Edgett said decisions about handling misinformation are made as a group.  \"We have a group and committee of folks who take a look at these things and make decisions on what's getting a lot of visibility and traction ...,\" he said.  In recent years Twitter has tightened its policies amid criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.  Tech companies have been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating user privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon face antitrust probes by federal and state authorities and a U.S. congressional panel.  Republican and Democratic lawmakers, along with the U.S. Justice Department, have been considering changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for the material their users post.

The officials, who spoke to reporters travelling with Trump to Washington from Florida aboard Air Force One on Wednesday, gave no further details. Before leaving for Florida earlier in the day to observe a space launch that was postponed because of bad weather, Trump again accused Twitter and other social media of bias without offering evidence. It was unclear how Trump could follow through on the threat of shutting down social media companies. </p><p>READ: Twitter places fact-check notification on Trump tweet about mail-in ballots The American Civil Liberties Union said the First Amendment of the US Constitution limits any action Trump could take to regulate such platforms. Twitter declined comment on news of Trump's plans. Google did not immediately comment. Facebook's chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg, commenting on Trump's threats, said on Wednesday censoring a platform would not be the \"right reflex\" for a government worried about censorship. \"I'll have to understand what they actually would intend to do, but in general I think a government choosing to censor a platform because they're worried about censorship doesn't exactly strike me as the right reflex there,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview with Fox News Channel. Fox played only a brief clip of the interview and said it would be aired in full on Thursday. Trump's latest dispute with social media emerged after Twitter on Tuesday for the first time attached a warning to some of his tweets prompting readers to fact check the president's claims. In the tweets tagged by Twitter, Trump made unsubstantiated claims about mail-in voting. Trump falsely claims that mail-in ballots lead to vote fraud and ineligible voters getting ballots. <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255835124539392?s=20\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255835124539392?s=20</url> \"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,\" Trump said in a pair of additional posts on Twitter on Wednesday.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456?s=20\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456?s=20</url> The president, a heavy user of Twitter with more than 80 million followers, added: \"Clean up your act, NOW!!!!\" STRONGEST THREAT YET Trump's threat to shut down platforms like Twitter and Facebook is his strongest yet within a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech. Shares of both companies fell on Wednesday. Last year the White House circulated drafts of a proposed executive order about anti-conservative bias which never gained traction. The Internet Association, which includes Twitter and Facebook among its members, said online platforms do not have a political bias and they offer \"more people a chance to be heard than at any point in history\". Asked during Twitter's annual meeting on Wednesday why the company decided to affix the label to Trump's mail-in ballot tweets, General Counsel Sean Edgett said decisions about handling misinformation are made as a group. \"We have a group and committee of folks who take a look at these things and make decisions on what's getting a lot of visibility and traction,\" he said. In recent years Twitter has tightened its policies amid criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive. Tech companies have been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating user privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon face antitrust probes by federal and state authorities and a US congressional panel. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, along with the US Justice Department, have been considering changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for the material their users post. Such changes could expose tech companies to more lawsuits. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a frequent critic of Big Tech companies, sent a letter to Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey on Wednesday asking why the company should continue to receive legal immunity after \"choosing to editorialise on President Trump's tweets\". Facebook left Trump's post on mail-in ballots on Tuesday untouched. - Reuters/aa</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12777940</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600V-14D1-JCDN-1508-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><timeReceived>2:09 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Last spring, worried that the United States was not keeping pace with China and other countries, Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/26/technology/pentagon-artificial-intelligence.html\">sent a memo to the White House</url> imploring the president to create a national strategy on A.I.</p><p>Now, Mr. Trump has taken that step, though this \u201cAmerican A.I. Initiative\u201d might not be as bold as some had hoped.</p><p>The executive order aimed to better educate workers in the field, improve access to the cloud computing services and data needed to build A.I. systems, and promote cooperation with foreign powers. But the order did not set aside funds for A.I. research and development, and the administration provided few details on how it planned put its new policies into effect.</p><p>The United States is engaged in an increasingly bitter trade war with China. And while American companies like Google and Amazon are now leaders in A.I., experts in the field are concerned that China could surpass the United States in the development of technologies that will power surveillance systems and autonomous weapons as well as driverless cars and a wide range of internet services.</p><p>In July 2017, Chinese unveiled a plan to become the world leader in A.I., aiming to create an industry worth $150 billion to its economy by 2030, and two Chinese cities promised to invest $7 billion in the effort. Other governments, too, began making large investments, including South Korea, Britain, France and Canada.</p><p>In the United States, the Defense Department has accelerated efforts to embrace A.I., shifting $75 million of its annual budget to a new office that will develop these technologies. Other government agencies also have major projects in the works. But many A.I. experts have worried that the top talent in the United States is moving to companies like Google and Amazon and away from government agencies.</p><p>Last year, these concerns increased when Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html\">pulled out of a project</url> to build A.I for the Pentagon after employees protested that the technology they were working on could be used for lethal purposes. Companies like Google are also expanding their operations in countries like China, France and Canada, as the A.I. talent in those countries continues to expand.</p><p>In a briefing with reporters on Sunday, a senior administration official said the White House would increase efforts to educate American workers in the field. The administration plans to work with the National Council for the American Worker to create educational efforts through industry and academia, and it will call on government agencies to develop fellowships related to A.I.</p><p>The official did not provide specifics on how the United States will track the progress of these efforts.</p><p>PHOTO: Robots powered by artificial intelligence at the World Internet Conference, China\u2019s big tech event, in Wuzhen last fall.

The move comes two days after Twitter, Inc.TWTR[1] took the rare step of fact-checking two of his tweets. The move drew the ire of Trump and his supporters, who blasted the micro-blogging site forengaging in censorship and exhibiting political bias.An executive order could mean a lot for social media companies, which are already under the scrutiny of regulators for the way they handle personal data and their privacy policies. Moreover, Trump's decision to sign an executive order comes at a time when the U.S. economy is battered and bruised by the coronavirus pandemic and tech companies, particularly the FAANG stocks, have been driving the markets.Twitter Draws Trump's IreOn May 27, Trump threatened social media companies with new regulations or even to shutter them after Twitter added fact checks to two of his tweets a day earlier. </p><p>In the tweets, Trump made unsubstantiated claims about vote-by-mail ballots saying that mail-in voting lead to vote fraud and ineligible voters getting ballots.After Twitter fact-checked two of his tweets, Trump immediately fired back tweeting social media platforms 'totally silence conservatives voice.' He also threatened to 'strongly regulate' social media companies or 'close them down' altogether. A day later, White House officials said that Trump could sign an executive order on Thursday. However, they gave no further details.That said, it was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to shut down the companies.Are Social Media Companies Courting Controversy Again?It is quite unlikely because Twitter is not violating the First Amendment by marking up his tweets. Twitter is a private company and can moderate the speeches of its users, without legal penalty.However, things can become difficult for companies like Facebook, Inc. FB[2] and Alphabet, Inc.'s GOOGL[3] Google that have become targets of antitrust scrutiny.Also, Trump can use his spat with Twitter to re-establish his opinion that big tech companies have an anti-conservative bias.Big Tech in Line of FireTech and Internet companies have been under the scrutiny of regulators for quite some time now for the way they handle personal data and their privacy policy. The scrutiny started in early 2018, when Facebook got embroiled in a data breach controversy involving Cambridge Analytics that exposed the personal information of more than 80 million users.Since then, regulators have time and again pulled up tech companies. Moreover, the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter have also been accused for the way they handle political ads and promote fake news.The COVID-19 outbreak has been an opportunity for many of these companies to rebuild their image. The likes of Facebook, Twitter and Google have already been doing their bit to curb fake news related to pandemic. Also, many have come together to develop technologies to fight the pandemic.The Big Tech, particularly the FAANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Google, Apple, Inc AAPL[4], Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN[5], NetflixNFLX[6] \u2014 have been playing a major role in this respect. Moreover, tech players have been one of the few to have not only survived the pandemic but also drive the markets.Apple was the first tech giant to make its presence felt in the fight against the deadly COVID-19. In March, the iPhone maker, in collaboration with the White House Centre for Disease Control (CDS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, launched an app and a website that allows users to do a self-screening for COVID-19.

We may be banning TikTok,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he prepared to leave on a trip to Florida. \"We may be doing some other things, there are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening. So we'll see what happens. We are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.\"    U.S. officials have expressed concerns that TikTok could pass on the data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China's authoritarian government. TikTok has said it would never do so. The New York Times reported earlier that TikTok was in talks with Microsoft.    TikTok officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment. In a statement posted online this week, TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer, who was hired away from Walt Disney Co. earlier this year, said the company was committed to transparency.    \"TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy,\" he said.    U.S. officials have expressed concerns that TikTok could pass on the data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China's authoritarian government. TikTok has said it would never do so.    A person familiar with the matter said earlier that U.S. officials had ordered Bytedance to divest its ownership.    The app known for its catchy dancing and lip-syncing videos has soared in popularity this year amid the pandemic. About 315 million users downloaded TikTok in the first quarter of the year, the most downloads ever for an app in a single quarter, according to research firm Sensor Tower, bringing its total to more than 2.2 billion world-wide.    In addition to concerns that TikTok could collect data on Americans, U.S. officials have been concerned that the app could be used to spread Chinese propaganda and that the platform's moderators could be censoring content to appease Beijing.    The review of TikTok has centered around ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of a similar video-sharing platform called Musical.ly, a Shanghai-based platform that had built a strong U.S. user base. After the acquisition, Musical.ly's platform was discontinued, and users who wanted to share videos could continue to do so on TikTok's platform.    ByteDance, whose secondary shares have valued the firm at $150 billion in recent weeks, counts big-name U.S. investors such as Coatue Management and Sequoia Capital among its backers.    The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. began its probe into TikTok last year, amid concerns from members of Congress and others about the data it might be collecting.    At the time, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called the investigation \"welcome news.\"    \"This new investigation is validation of our concern that apps like TikTok -- that store massive amounts of personal data accessible to foreign governments -- may pose serious risks to millions of Americans and deserve greater scrutiny,\" Mr. Schumer said.    The investigation into TikTok is taking place as the national security review panel has increasingly focused on deals that put U.S. citizens and their privacy at risk, a focus that Congress ordered in a 2018 law.    Under the new law, regulators will investigate deals involving foreign money if that business has access to data on more than one million people, including certain genetic and biometric data, financial data and health data. The rules also apply to investments in U.S. businesses that track users' locations or target U.S. military or national security personnel.    The Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, is a panel of federal agencies that reviews deals involving foreign money to ensure they don't put the country's national security at risk. The panel has the power to review deals that involve U.S. companies, such as the 2017 acquisition.    Earlier this year, Mr. Trump ordered another Chinese company to sell its stake in a Maryland property management software firm, a platform that hotels and casinos use to enable guests to check into rooms using smartphones. That order marked the sixth time a U.S. president has either blocked a deal or ordered a corporate selloff since Congress authorized the power to intervene in 1988.    At a congressional hearing on Big Tech's market power this week, Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg made it clear that he intends to address threats from China -- a not-so-veiled reference to TikTok's rise.    Mr. Mayer, TikTok's CEO, fired back in a blog post Wednesday morning, disparaging Facebook's \"copycat\" efforts to match TikTok and saying many attacks on the company are \"disguised as patriotism.\"    Georgia Wells and Alex Leary contributed to this article.

A sale to Microsoft, likely for tens of billions of dollars, would be a win for both TikTok and Bytedance, where executives had feared that the U.S. government would force device makers to take TikTok out of their app stores, according to another person familiar with the matter.    News of the talks, earlier reported by Fox Business, came as the U.S. was concluding a security review that expected to recommend a divestiture of TikTok by its Chinese owner, Beijing-based Bytedance Ltd.    \"We're looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he prepared to leave on a trip to Florida. \"We may be doing some other things, there are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening. So we'll see what happens. We are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.\"    Microsoft didn't immediately return calls for comment.    U.S. officials have expressed concerns that TikTok could pass on the data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China's authoritarian government. TikTok has said it would never do so.    In a statement posted online this week, TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer, who was hired away from Walt Disney Co. earlier this year, said the company was committed to transparency.    \"TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy,\" he said.    U.S. officials have expressed concerns that TikTok could pass on the data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China's authoritarian government. TikTok has said it would never do so.    A person familiar with the matter said earlier that U.S. officials had ordered Bytedance to divest its ownership.    The app known for its catchy dancing and lip-syncing videos has soared in popularity this year amid the pandemic. About 315 million users downloaded TikTok in the first quarter of the year, the most downloads ever for an app in a single quarter, according to research firm Sensor Tower, bringing its total to more than 2.2 billion world-wide.    In addition to concerns that TikTok could collect data on Americans, U.S. officials have been concerned that the app could be used to spread Chinese propaganda and that the platform's moderators could be censoring content to appease Beijing.    The review of TikTok has centered around ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of a similar video-sharing platform called Musical.ly, a Shanghai-based platform that had built a strong U.S. user base. After the acquisition, Musical.ly's platform was discontinued, and users who wanted to share videos could continue to do so on TikTok's platform.    ByteDance, whose secondary shares have valued the firm at $150 billion in recent weeks, counts big-name U.S. investors such as Coatue Management and Sequoia Capital among its backers.    The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. began its probe into TikTok last year, amid concerns from members of Congress and others about the data it might be collecting.    At the time, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called the investigation \"welcome news.\"    \"This new investigation is validation of our concern that apps like TikTok -- that store massive amounts of personal data accessible to foreign governments -- may pose serious risks to millions of Americans and deserve greater scrutiny,\" Mr. Schumer said.    The investigation into TikTok is taking place as the national security review panel has increasingly focused on deals that put U.S. citizens and their privacy at risk, a focus that Congress ordered in a 2018 law.    Under the new law, regulators will investigate deals involving foreign money if that business has access to data on more than one million people, including certain genetic and biometric data, financial data and health data. The rules also apply to investments in U.S. businesses that track users' locations or target U.S. military or national security personnel.    The Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, is a panel of federal agencies that reviews deals involving foreign money to ensure they don't put the country's national security at risk. The panel has the power to review deals that involve U.S. companies, such as the 2017 acquisition.    Earlier this year, Mr. Trump ordered another Chinese company to sell its stake in a Maryland property management software firm, a platform that hotels and casinos use to enable guests to check into rooms using smartphones. That order marked the sixth time a U.S. president has either blocked a deal or ordered a corporate selloff since Congress authorized the power to intervene in 1988.    At a congressional hearing on Big Tech's market power this week, Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg made it clear that he intends to address threats from China -- a not-so-veiled reference to TikTok's rise.    Mr. Mayer, TikTok's CEO, fired back in a blog post Wednesday morning, disparaging Facebook's \"copycat\" efforts to match TikTok and saying many attacks on the company are \"disguised as patriotism.\"    Alex Leary contributed to this article.

News of the talks, earlier reported by Fox Business, came as the U.S. was concluding a security review that expected to recommend a divestiture of TikTok by its Chinese owner, Beijing-based Bytedance Ltd.    \"We're looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he prepared to leave on a trip to Florida. \"We may be doing some other things, there are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening. So we'll see what happens. We are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.\"    Microsoft didn't immediately return calls for comment.    U.S. officials have expressed concerns that TikTok could pass on the data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China's authoritarian government. TikTok has said it would never do so.    In a statement posted online this week, TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer, who was hired away from Walt Disney Co. earlier this year, said the company was committed to transparency.    \"TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy,\" he said.    U.S. officials have expressed concerns that TikTok could pass on the data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China's authoritarian government. TikTok has said it would never do so.    A person familiar with the matter said earlier that U.S. officials had ordered Bytedance to divest its ownership.    The app known for its catchy dancing and lip-syncing videos has soared in popularity this year amid the pandemic. About 315 million users downloaded TikTok in the first quarter of the year, the most downloads ever for an app in a single quarter, according to research firm Sensor Tower, bringing its total to more than 2.2 billion world-wide.    In addition to concerns that TikTok could collect data on Americans, U.S. officials have been concerned that the app could be used to spread Chinese propaganda and that the platform's moderators could be censoring content to appease Beijing.    The review of TikTok has centered around ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of a similar video-sharing platform called Musical.ly, a Shanghai-based platform that had built a strong U.S. user base. After the acquisition, Musical.ly's platform was discontinued, and users who wanted to share videos could continue to do so on TikTok's platform.    ByteDance, whose secondary shares have valued the firm at $150 billion in recent weeks, counts big-name U.S. investors such as Coatue Management and Sequoia Capital among its backers.    The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. began its probe into TikTok last year, amid concerns from members of Congress and others about the data it might be collecting.    At the time, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called the investigation \"welcome news.\"    \"This new investigation is validation of our concern that apps like TikTok -- that store massive amounts of personal data accessible to foreign governments -- may pose serious risks to millions of Americans and deserve greater scrutiny,\" Mr. Schumer said.    The investigation into TikTok is taking place as the national security review panel has increasingly focused on deals that put U.S. citizens and their privacy at risk, a focus that Congress ordered in a 2018 law.    Under the new law, regulators will investigate deals involving foreign money if that business has access to data on more than one million people, including certain genetic and biometric data, financial data and health data. The rules also apply to investments in U.S. businesses that track users' locations or target U.S. military or national security personnel.    The Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, is a panel of federal agencies that reviews deals involving foreign money to ensure they don't put the country's national security at risk. The panel has the power to review deals that involve U.S. companies, such as the 2017 acquisition.    Earlier this year, Mr. Trump ordered another Chinese company to sell its stake in a Maryland property management software firm, a platform that hotels and casinos use to enable guests to check into rooms using smartphones. That order marked the sixth time a U.S. president has either blocked a deal or ordered a corporate selloff since Congress authorized the power to intervene in 1988.    At a congressional hearing on Big Tech's market power this week, Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg made it clear that he intends to address threats from China -- a not-so-veiled reference to TikTok's rise.    Mr. Mayer, TikTok's CEO, fired back in a blog post Wednesday morning, disparaging Facebook's \"copycat\" efforts to match TikTok and saying many attacks on the company are \"disguised as patriotism.\"    Alex Leary contributed to this article.

News of the talks, earlier reported by Fox Business, came as the U.S. was concluding a security review that was expected to recommend a divestiture of TikTok by its Chinese owner, Beijing-based Bytedance Ltd.    \"We're looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok,\" Mr. Trump told reporters as he prepared to leave on a trip to Florida. \"We may be doing some other things, there are a couple of options. But a lot of things are happening. So we'll see what happens. We are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok.\"    Microsoft didn't immediately return calls for comment.    U.S. officials have expressed concerns that TikTok could pass on the data it collects from Americans streaming videos to China's authoritarian government. TikTok has said it would never do so.    In a statement posted online this week, TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer, who was hired away from Walt Disney Co. earlier this year, said the company was committed to transparency.    \"TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy,\" he said.    A person familiar with the matter said earlier that U.S. officials had ordered Bytedance to divest its ownership.    The app known for its catchy dancing and lip-syncing videos has soared in popularity this year amid the pandemic. About 315 million users downloaded TikTok in the first quarter of the year, the most downloads ever for an app in a single quarter, according to research firm Sensor Tower, bringing its total to more than 2.2 billion world-wide.    In addition to concerns that TikTok could collect data on Americans, U.S. officials have been concerned that the app could be used to spread Chinese propaganda and that the platform's moderators could be censoring content to appease Beijing.    The review of TikTok has centered around ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of a similar video-sharing platform called Musical.ly, a Shanghai-based platform that had built a strong U.S. user base. After the acquisition, Musical.ly's platform was discontinued, and users who wanted to share videos could continue to do so on TikTok's platform.    ByteDance, whose secondary shares have valued the firm at $150 billion in recent weeks, counts big-name U.S. investors such as Coatue Management and Sequoia Capital among its backers.    The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. began its probe into TikTok last year, amid concerns from members of Congress and others about the data it might be collecting.    At the time, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called the investigation \"welcome news.\"    \"This new investigation is validation of our concern that apps like TikTok -- that store massive amounts of personal data accessible to foreign governments -- may pose serious risks to millions of Americans and deserve greater scrutiny,\" Mr. Schumer said.    The investigation into TikTok is taking place as the national security review panel has increasingly focused on deals that put U.S. citizens and their privacy at risk, a focus that Congress ordered in a 2018 law.    Under the new law, regulators will investigate deals involving foreign money if that business has access to data on more than one million people, including certain genetic and biometric data, financial data and health data. The rules also apply to investments in U.S. businesses that track users' locations or target U.S. military or national security personnel.    The Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, is a panel of federal agencies that reviews deals involving foreign money to ensure they don't put the country's national security at risk. The panel has the power to review deals that involve U.S. companies, such as the 2017 acquisition.    Earlier this year, Mr. Trump ordered another Chinese company to sell its stake in a Maryland property management software firm, a platform that hotels and casinos use to enable guests to check into rooms using smartphones. That order marked the sixth time a U.S. president has either blocked a deal or ordered a corporate selloff since Congress authorized the power to intervene in 1988.    At a congressional hearing on Big Tech's market power this week, Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg made it clear that he intends to address threats from China -- a not-so-veiled reference to TikTok's rise.    Mr. Mayer, TikTok's CEO, fired back in a blog post Wednesday morning, disparaging Facebook's \"copycat\" efforts to match TikTok and saying many attacks on the company are \"disguised as patriotism.\"    Alex Leary contributed to this article.

It's out in 30 minutes' time.</p><p>Economists are expecting it to be unchanged month-over-month, similar to the CPI yesterday. We will bring you all the numbers. Of course, yesterday, we had all surprised on the core CPI, so you want to stay tuned for the PPI this morning. Meanwhile, futures are higher on top of another historic close yesterday. Both the Dow and the S&amp;P ended the day at all- time highs. With the Dow cracking 27,000 and staying there, up 227 points on the day. Almost one percent.</p><p>Global markets are taking a cue from Wall Street and also trading up. FT- 100 in London up 12 points, CAC Quarante in Paris up 26, DAX Index in Germany back in positive territory gaining six points right now. In Asia overnight, markets were higher across the board. Fractional moves, nonetheless on the upside. There are signs however that the economy in China is continuing to slow. We had new data out this morning,</p><p>Exports in China down 1.3 percent in the month of June. Year-over-year, imports fell 7.3 percent year-over-year. Border battle. Vice President Mike Pence is headed to the southern border today. He's taking members of the Senate Judiciary Committee but some are actually refusing to go as ICE raids are reportedly starting this weekend. Some local politicians are pushing back on those raids as well.</p><p>Some more trouble for cryptocurrencies. President Trump is now weighing saying he's not a fan of Bitcoin and he is warning Facebook it may need a banking charter to break into the field. Wow. Big comments there. Democrats still divided. Speakers of the House Nancy Pelosi says she's no longer commenting on the feud with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This as other Democrats go after the freshman. More on this very public battle coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the American Conservative Union Chairman, Matt Schlapp, and market strategist, Third Seven Advisers, Michael Block. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And a big rally in stocks on the heels of a week that was Powell, Powell, Powell, and little ECB there as well.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes. So ECB as Dagen pointed out, the top of the show, we had the big news and healthcare yesterday was a catalyst. One thing I want to point out we haven't touched on yet is Daimler who of course makes Mercedes-Benz among other things, guided lower this morning in Europe. That stock was down then it actually went green. It's back down, it's down 1.7 percent this hour. Is that foreboding for U.S. autos and industrials going into earning season? That's what I'm thinking about on the micro side here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you for bringing that up. It's a good point and we'll watch Daimler went down and now it's back up again. All right. Thank you.</p><p>BLOCK: It's back -- down up and now --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Down again.</p><p>BLOCK: -- back down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Our top story this hour. President Trump is traveling to Wisconsin today pushing for the passage of USMCA trade deal. This on the heels of the President announcing he will not put in place an executive order to add a citizen -- citizenship question to the 2020 census. Instead, he said he'll gather citizenship information from the data that the government already has. The President making the comments after the White House social media summit yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I hereby ordering every department and agency in the Federal government to provide the Department of Commerce with all requested records regarding the number of citizens and noncitizens in our country. We have great knowledge in many of our agencies. We will leave no stone unturned. Ultimately this will allow us to have an even more complete count of citizens than through asking the single question alone. It will be -- we think, far more accurate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is the Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway. Kellyanne, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for joining me this morning.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what about -</p><p>CONWAY: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - this new idea to get the information in terms of how many people in this country are illegal versus legal? Do you think the President's going to be able to get that data from the existing data in government?</p><p>CONWAY: Yes, we do. It's just unfortunate that the detractors to that inclusion of that question tied us up in meritless litigation for so long. They're still yet to issue a compelling reason as to why we in this country can't ask, \"Are you a U.S. citizen?\" when the census takers knock on your door.</p><p>The census projects, Maria, that they can gather citizenship information for about 90 percent of the country through other means, and I think what the President did yesterday is important because, again, it takes the obstacles away from data sharing amongst the different departments and agencies, and it compels and encourages those departments and agencies to share the information so that we can get this information.</p><p>This information is important for any number of public policy issues. I take objection to those who are screaming, as they usually do, that you're deterring people from being in the census, from complying with the census. Lots of people already politely decline.</p><p>They - I know people who say, \"You have a right to know how many people are in the house and if they're under 18 or over 18 and nothing else.\" But think of all the invasive, intrusive questions that federal government questionnaires asked already, including the census, that many people don't want to answer, feel uncomfortable answering, but they do that for reasons that this government has said, we spend $20 billion or so the President has remarked that the decennial census is an important, constitutionally prescribed exercise -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: - so why not get it right? Why not make the census responsive to the changing lifestyles or changing demography of a nation?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's another indication of this pushback on whatever the President wants to do from his critics in the Congress, the Dems, let me ask you about the crisis at the border.</p><p>CONWAY: And they're saying he caved, which he didn't. And I want to make very - two things -</p><p>BARTIROMO: You don't think he caved.</p><p>CONWAY: - very clear quickly. The president didn't cave. He's find - he's finding other means to gather the information, seeing that it was tied up in meritless litigation. And number two, too many people who just play lawyers and constitutional experts on TV aren't reading Justice - Chief Justice Robert's opinion very closely from the Supreme Court.</p><p>He didn't raise a legal and constitutional impediment to this exercise, this inclusion of the question. He just didn't like the rationale and basically was saying - leaving an opening, and I think the Department of Justice is trying to walk through that. But time is of the essence -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: - and there are different ways to gather this information and this administration will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll watch that. Meanwhile, you are headed now to the southern border with the Vice President Mike Pence, and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee today. Tell me what you're expecting. We know U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is also planning this round up of thousands of undocumented immigrants across the country on Sunday.</p><p>So first, tell me about the border. What do you think you're going to see, and when are we going to see an end to these loopholes that basically encourage all of these people to come to the southern border?</p><p>CONWAY: All great questions, Maria. I would start the answer by pointing out the CNN poll of all outlets in July 2nd showed that whereas 45 percent of Americans said there was a, quote, \"crisis at the southern border,\" in January, it's now up to 74 percent. So people are seeing the images. You got to witness it firsthand.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: I will do that today. Chairman of the Judiciary Senate Committee, Lindsay Graham, invited all members of the committee. A bipartisan delegation could have been going and should be going, but every Democrat now has pulled out. Some said - declined from going from the beginning. A few said that they would go and are now not in the manifest. I got word early this morning.</p><p>That's really a shame. They're unserious and unseemly about fixing the border crisis. They - it's easier to do that, to scream and cry here in Washington, D.C. than it is to go look for themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: But I think the Vice President and Chairman Graham are leading this delegation, leading this visit so we can see for ourselves. And let me also say that the - that Kevin McAleenan, our Acting Secretary, and others are reporting that some of the crossing are down, but we still - we're on track for a million illegal crossing - a million people presenting themselves at the border this year if we don't get it under control.</p><p>Now, I think the ground has softened a bit. You have more Americans calling it a crisis. You have more people who denied it was a crisis, now saying it is, and most importantly just two weeks ago, you had the Congress starting to do their jobs, Maria, by passing a $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CONWAY: Every Democrat with the exception of those four, the squad that doesn't do squat, if you don't count magazine covers and Twitter all day - they're the ones who I think are incurring the ire of Speaker Pelosi and others, and that started because -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: - they are only - the only four Democrats to deny any kind of aid. They voted against a democratic bill, and only 95 Democrats voted against the aid package that actually passed. Why is that important? Because you're going from manufactured outraged about a, quote, \"manufactured crisis\" to actually committing billions of dollars to it. This will help, but we still have a national security crisis. We have to secure our southern border.</p><p>The president mentioned last night - just last night that people are working on Mexico as a third safe country. They've been helping us a great deal with their southern border and so that we can help with their northern border and our southern border.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CONWAY: So there's so much work to do. We'll be talking to folks at Customs and Border Protection. We'll be talking to people who are on the front lines, what else do they need, and I want to see for myself. I'm happy to join the senators and the Vice President today at the border.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, I think those guys and gals are working so hard, and unfortunately, they are -</p><p>CONWAY: They are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: - being pushed away to leave their post at the border to go take care of children who are sick and bring kids to hospitals. Because what I saw when I went there was incredible - all of the kids being put in these dangerous situations, but when AOC went there, she had all other ideas. Are you going to be able to see the detention centers where AOC said they were drinking water from the toilet bowl? Now, AOC calling Nancy Pelosi a racist, Kellyanne? Real quick.</p><p>CONWAY: Yes. It's getting hot over there. So that's been completely denied and debunked. She has no proof for making such an outrageous claim. Anybody who repeats it without evidence is sharing in her lie, her lying and crying about it.</p><p>But just this week that same member of Congress told The New Yorker Radio Show that we should just eliminate all of DHS. Maria, these are just unserious people who don't have the facts. Eliminating DHS, which was created in response to the 9/11 tragedies in this nation, it also would eliminate FEMA, Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, CPB, you name it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh God.</p><p>CONWAY: So this is just not even serious. Look what - and let me just end with this because the Vice President was there yesterday to witness the offloading of a half a billion dollars worth of cocaine, the largest seizure ever by our brave U.S. Coast Guard. That cocaine that was seized is because this President's policies are getting tough on the border and tough on drugs.</p><p>That half a billion dollars worth of cocaine and some of the marijuana now won't make it into our co-workers, our communities, and our kids, and we got to keep it out and the President is very serious about keeping the drugs out.</p><p>A lot of what I'm doing today at the border has to do with being the point person in the White House for the President's combating the drug crisis, and we're making tremendous strides. We have to keep this out of our community.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: So all the people who denied taking this trip today are just - they're just communicating they're not serious. If I were the Democrats, I'd come to the table on DACA too, because the Supreme Court has committed to take it up in its next term and no other than President Obama said, \"Hey, I'm putting this law in place, but I don't think it's legal.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: It's probably not legal. That's probably the best that the anti- DACA people will say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: So if I were the Democrats, I'd get more serious about immigration reform overall. The public opinion is on the President's side with respect to this being a crisis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, the people understand the issues. I agree with that for sure. You've got the DACA issue, but then you've got USMCA, which we'll see if Nancy Pelosi -</p><p>CONWAY: Very important. The President's -</p><p>BARTIROMO: - brings it to the floor in the fall.</p><p>CONWAY: The President's on the road for that -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: - today. She's getting a lot of pressure, I believe, from those 31 Democrats who are representing districts that Trump and Pence -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: - won in 2016. And the USMCA, the Vice President was out in California talking about that. This is great for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, employers, employees. Let's modernize our trade agreements with Mexico and Canada, and let's get a vote on that. Let's get a vote on drug pricing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CONWAY: Let's do things in a bipartisan fashion. I think the humanitarian aid package was a great step forward in that regard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kellyanne, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>CONWAY: Thank you, Maria. I'll be back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will - we will be waiting to hear your reaction to the border when you come back. Thank you.</p><p>Coming up. Bracing for Barry. We're tracking the tropical storm as it makes its way toward landfall in Louisiana this morning. The very latest developments and a live update when we come back. Then were are waiting for the June producer price index. It's out in 15 minutes. We're expecting it to be unchanged, but you never know what the core looks like.</p><p>We have some surprises with the CPI yesterday. We'll see if it impacts markets, that's next. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tropical Storm Barry barring down in Louisiana. A state of emergency now in effect. Mandatory evacuations taking place as residents brace for what could be the first hurricane of the season. Fox Meteorologist Rick Reichmuth is covering the story. He joins me now from the Fox Weather Center. Hey, Rick, good morning to you.</p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, Maria. Yes. Whether or not a guess, a hurricane strength probably won't really have any big difference on the impacts (INAUDIBLE) impacts are all going to be from the amount of water that's in the area. You can see we have -- do have hurricane warnings in effect along the coast here of Louisiana. That's where we could see winds up to 75 miles an hour.</p><p>But you get the idea, this is the storm and it's a really big disorganized storm at this point. That's good news if it were more organized, it's going over such warm water right now, it would have a chance to strengthen a lot more than I think it will have. But we are starting to see a little bit more action right around the center of the storm that doesn't bode well. What probably is on our side is that we just don't have a lot more time.</p><p>This going to be a very warm water here. We're going to be talking about rainfall totals. our problem here, Maria, with this is rainfall totals, 10 to 20 inches. Somewhere between New Orleans and Baton Rouge and that's going to cause a significant amount of flooding we'll continue to track right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thanks, Rick. Rick Reichmuth with the latest there. Stay with us. We'll back next up with Kevin McCarthy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The divided Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi squashing a potential rebellion with progressive freshman including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who has implied Pelosi is a racist. The Speaker commented on the feud yesterday. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): They took offense because I addressed -- requested my members on offensive tweet that came out of one of the members' offices that referenced -- our blue dogs and our Dems essentially as segregationist. Our members took offense at that, I addressed that. How they're interpreting and carrying it to another place is up to them but I'm not going to be discussing it any further.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: A new poll by insiders shows the Democratic primary voters value Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement more than anyone else except ex- presidents. Joining me right now is House Minority Leader, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy. And Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about that? What about this poll saying that people value AOC's endorsement more than anybody except ex-presidents?</p><p>MCCARTHY: It goes to the core of where this Democrat Party is. They're no longer Democrats. This is a socialist Democratic Party. Think for one moment what is AOC's policies? I mean, they really are and calls herself a socialist Democrat. So it just shows how far left this Democrat Party has moved. That's why I think this 2020 election is really going to be about socialism versus freedom. And then why I think President Trump is going to get reelected.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you see this fight taking place on the floor? I mean, you know, how do you deal with this in terms of reacting to for example AOC suggesting Nancy Pelosi is racist?</p><p>MCCARTHY: This is not a family fight, this is an internal war going on. You see it in every bill that they try to bring to the floor, whatever bill comes out of committee, they have to take it further left. They have to offer more amendments to the socialists in their party because they cannot pass anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me -- let me ask you about USMCA, switching gears here, because we know that that -- those four and others may very well make it real hard for the President to have a victory. You said in the past you think the votes are there but we're all watching this trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, the administration possibly sending a deal to Congress by September 1. Are we going to see this bill brought to the floor?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, see? This is the power of having the speakership and when the Republicans lost it, the power goes to Nancy Pelosi. So, Nancy Pelosi is holding this up. If she would let this bill come to the floor and be voted on, it would pass the floor right now. I'm concerned the longer that she waits the harder that the vote -- the votes become because you're getting closer to the Presidential election.</p><p>This really should be a vote that we take before we leave on the August break. We should deal with this, we should deal with the loopholes at the border. There are things that need to get done but they are not doing anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. So do you -- Marc Short was with me earlier this week, he said he is expecting her to bring it to the floor after the summer recess, probably in the fall. Is that what you're expecting?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I expect that to happen and it will pass but why not do it right now? It only brings another 100,000 jobs, about 170,000 jobs into America. Makes us stronger, our economy even going bigger. You watch the market make a new record yesterday and probably a new record today. We are getting stronger. And think about what power that gives us, with our negotiations with China.</p><p>Wouldn't we want to be in that position? Why hold this back if we know this is going to pass?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You make a lot of good points actually, especially with China. Let me ask you about social media and that summit yesterday. The President hosted the meeting at the White House. Some heated moments between members of the press in the Rose Garden. Leader McCarthy, you were at the summit, you've been very vocal in terms of the social media companies. It was you who said you want to have legislation so that people understand what they're doing with our data. Where are we on that and do you think we're going to see legislation?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think we'll see legislation. I've been working on it, trying to work on a bipartisan manner because think for one moment. If there is something on the internet and they're offering it free, you are not the client, you are actually the product. Facebook's created to get data and you're concerned about what they use that data for. I'm more concerned about what the third party and others.</p><p>Data is kind of like private property. It's my private property. So I should know and we should have a level-playing field whatever data somebody can collect. Well, I should be able to move it, I should be able to delete it? If you're selling it, maybe I should I be able to be given some of those proceeds in the process. I think privacy is a very big concern. And when you look what the Democrats offer here, they just want to break things up.</p><p>Well, you know what, that doesn't do any anything to stop about our privacy and then it harnesses a problem when it comes to innovation or they want to make it a utility which is the worst thing that we can possibly do. So I think there is a real point here of how we protect our privacy and our data and actually go forward that competitiveness. We've got to make sure there's other companies who can rise up.</p><p>Google was not the first search engine but are they allowing other companies to be able to compete? We found in 2013 they were not, they were being non-competitive to a number of companies and they got fined but they were allowed to fix that themselves. 90 percent of all searches go through Google. And if you're not on the first page, about 90 percent of those people drop off.</p><p>They have a great deal amount of power, when they started, don't be evil, that's no longer their motto. You know, I want the internet to be free and open but I don't want people using this power because they dislike somebody's else philosophy to use it to stop them from having a voice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You make a really good point especially since we have this new story today on Google that Google contractors were listening to recordings of people using the virtual assistant. I mean, they're admitting it right there. And it's not just the privacy issue, right? I mean, the President is really hot on the censorship of conservative's voice going into the 2020 election. How important is that to you?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, that is very important but it's important if somebody has a liberal voice that they're trying to stymie that in the process. Remember what happened here, these companies become so powerful but now they're using their own philosophy if you disagree with them, that you can't have a voice. That is not what the internet is about. We've got to allow something to go forward. You have witnessed it yourself.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: When you -- when a conservative voice is out there, do they shadow ban you? Do they make people not able to see it? Do they push you further down? You know, if they push your message down to lower pages and push somebody else up, it makes a difference. We watched inside Google's own headquarters the day after the election and people crying, and people talking about trying to help other people win over others. That's not their place and that's not something that they should be doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I remember that. And it's because they're so powerful that now we're actually noticing it because they've got this influence. OK. We'll be watching that. It's a real important story I know, Congressman. Let me ask you about the new fund-raising numbers. You've been real well showing for the first half of 2019, you broke the Republican fund-raising record in the House taking in over $33 million. Where does that money go? Congrats on the fund-raising that you've been doing.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, it goes to try to win this House back because all these questions you just as asked me, USMCA, it would be done. The loopholes on the border, it would be done. Why is it not? They Democrats control, the Speaker has the power. When we want to curve back spending, we're in a box right now because Nancy Pelosi has power. This goes into combat, we can win this majority.</p><p>There are 31 Democrats who sit in seats the President Trump carried. We simply need 19 seats to win the majority. We have a smaller hill to climb than the Democrats did two years ago. And of those 31, 13 of those the President won with more than six points. We are getting great recruits in here across this country and this is going to be able to get the message up and show. Remember all these Democrats who are running, who said they wouldn't support Nancy Pelosi but then they voted for her for speaker.</p><p>Now they're supporting her on the floor but they're not just supporting her they now become a socialist Democratic Party. They're calling for impeachment. They're not doing what the public really want them to do. Think for one moment what AOC' chief of staff tweeted this week, he challenged the voters to tell them one thing that the Democrats have accomplished for the kitchen table of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Then he went on to question this legislative mastermind which he refers to the Speaker, the only Democrats realize they're failing at their attempt to -- really, take control over this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So you think you can take the House back in 2020? We'll be watching. Kevin McCarthy, good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Kevin McCarthy joining us this morning in Washington. We have breaking news and we are waiting on the June producer price index. It is hitting the tape momentarily. We are looking at a market going into this number rallying. Dow Industrials now at the high of the morning up 94 points. The S&amp;P is up 7-1/2 and the NASDAQ is up 21.</p><p>The estimates on the PPI unchanged for the month of June, although year- over-year, we're expecting the number to be up 1.6 percent. This was a similar situation that we were in yesterday with the CPI, the PPI is just hitting the tape right now. And it is higher than expected, right to Lauren Simonetti we go with the number, up one-tenth of a percent. Lauren, go for it.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: OK. This is for the month of June, Maria. The numbers hotter than expected. This is what we saw yesterday with CPI. For producer prices, what businesses pay to stock their shelves, the number for June from May up one-tenth of one percent. If you ex-out food and energy, that core number up three-tenths of one percent, also hotter than the two-tenths percent that was expected. I do want to point out the month of June is the first full month that the higher tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods was in effect, so we are seeing some of these -- this trade war reflected in the numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting that it's hotter than expected because that was the situation yesterday.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, of course, this is the PPI, whereas producers are paying this. This is not the customer, but the large producers paying a little more than expected. It's still not up to the Fed's two percent target though, Lauren. You're talking about a 1.7 percent move year-over-year.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, exactly. So it's still not at that target, Maria, but it's -- some people are saying -- and this is certainly what they said yesterday, that inflation is saying \"hello\" again, and some market participants are reassessing the aggressiveness or the needed aggressiveness of this rate cut plan. But these are two numbers now back- to-back because obviously -- and you could say producer prices, the inflation would show up first then that gets eventually maybe, maybe not, but could get passed on to consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: So this is the first number that would be impacted, but I got to say, Maria, look, right before this number came out, the Dow Jones Industrial average was up 93 points.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Now we're up 88. S&amp;P, exactly the same, up seven points. So this number is not moving the market, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. Thank you so much.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lauren. Let's get to Gerri Willis. Got to get reaction from this panel, but first, to the floor New York Stock Exchange, Gerri Willis covering stocks this morning. Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. That's right. Lauren called it exactly right, not a big reaction to this number from the markets, but believe me, they were watching it, and why? All they care about is this interest rate right now. Will they get, on July 31st, an interest rate cut? That's what they want from the Federal Reserve. They want 50 basis points, maybe that takes that entirely off the table with today's report, which was stronger than expected.</p><p>If this number had been even stronger, you could have seen a selloff because this is something that the markets carry -- care very much about. I got to tell you, we also have China number on PPI, their wholesale number earlier this week, it was low, low, low, through the floor. So, that economy's seeing lower cost at the wholesale level.</p><p>CPI out yesterday, that was an upside surprise as well. There's sort of momentum building on the idea that maybe prices are starting to step higher here. But with the fed being so strident, so certain about their action, I mean I have never seen a Federal Reserve Chairman be so clear about plans. Not a big impact today, but we will certainly be watching this. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri, and I know healthcare was a big part of the rally yesterday.</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're going to be watching UnitedHealthcare and all those healthcare companies post the president's decision on pricing. We'll check back with you. Thank you, Gerri Willis. Michael, what's your reaction to this PPI number? A little hotter than we wanted.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes. So I'm reading directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics report here, and I quote, \"Most of the June advance is attributable to margins for final demand trade services, which moved up 1.3 percent.\" Now this trade indices measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. So what does this tell us? Yes, we had that news on healthcare yesterday, where the -- where the distributors are getting a little break to preserve their margins, and we also have, you know, as Lauren point -- as you and Lauren pointed, you know, this is where the new tariffs are kicking in.</p><p>So, there's a lot of upward pressure on this. And, again, we could cherry- pick through this and show points of weakness, points of strength, the point is overall net-net, this, you know, number was higher. Let's see what the bond market does, you know. Stocks aren't reacting all that much, let's see what the bond market does so yield's back up a little bit more.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. The stock market is irrelevant. It's the yield on the 10- year, that's what you want to look at, 2.13 percent.</p><p>BLOCK: Here it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that is up from where it closed yesterday at 2.12 percent. So, again, higher longer-term interest rates, which has been a result of Jay Powell talking about, again, he's going to cut rates to preserve the economic growth while that will give you higher long-term rates. But I want to point out the core rate, the Producer Price Index was up 1.7 percent in the last 12 months through June, still the smallest gain since January of 2017 that it actually was slower or lower than the 1.8 in May, so it might have beat expectations but it's still well-contained.</p><p>BLOCK: I'm looking --</p><p>BARTIROMO: All more reasons, though, for him to say let's cut rates.</p><p>BLOCK: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, you don't cut rates though if the economy's as healthy as this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. I know that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What is his -- what is his -- what is the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which I'm scratching my head about a rate cut at the end of this month.</p><p>BLOCK: Inflation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What does the Fed see on the horizon, disinflation? Deflation?</p><p>BLOCK: Look, a lot of this is optics. It's not disinflation or deflation, but inflation is not on fire by any stretch of the imagination, and now someone's going to tweet at me, \"Oh, this was up 12 percent.\" It's like, \"That's nice. I can cherry-pick data, too. That's fine.\" I'm telling you, it's -- welcome to my life here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You already get a tweet on that?</p><p>BLOCK: It's -- oh.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. All right. All right.</p><p>SCHLAPP: It's lightened up like a tree. So.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. So, look, we got a market that is holding on to gains this morning. In the double digits, the yield up two basis points at 2.13 percent. President Trump is taking on cryptocurrencies meanwhile. The president tweeted last night writing in part this, \"I'm not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\"</p><p>The president added that if companies like Facebook want to become a bank, they need to follow banking rules. Interesting that you said earlier this was a hit to Facebook --</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- because they were watching everything and nothing's going to go, you know, we're going to -- we're going to be responding.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes. Shot across the bow. I think what the president is telling these big tech companies is that we don't exactly -- we haven't figured out exactly how we're going to come after you, but we're going to make sure we pick a lane and come after you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well -- and he told me a couple weeks ago, legislation will be needed likely and that will --that will create competition, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, absolutely. This is the president, he does have that tendency to want to weigh in on everything and this would be -- and he -- there is that resentment that -- of -- you kind of saw that at the social media summit yesterday, that -- again, he feels like these companies are out to get him, then I'm going to hit you back. Words are better than actual legislation, put it that way.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Well, they have -- they're having a chance.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jawboning is OK, like, you know, rule-making and regulation, not so much.</p><p>SCHLAPP: But we see this with these tweets, which is the president's rhetoric and what he says, it moves markets and it impacts pricing. You talked about drug pricing earlier, companies realize that the president and regulators are watching what they do and it matters.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to point out something that Mike said. To be clear, the Trump administration wanted to see these rebates. These are -- these are drug-makers give these rebates to the middlemen, the pharmacy benefit managers who negotiate Medicare drug prices. Those rebates go to these companies, what's where a lot --</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- of their --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They have got a (INAUDIBLE) customers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that was what the Trump administration was trying to do.</p><p>BLOCK: They wanted to fix it, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They trying to fix it and then, again, there's so much pushback from the lobbyists and from people.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And they were worried -- and AARP was worried about higher prescription prices for seniors, and politicians worried about higher prescription drug prices for seniors going into an election year, but we should point out, this was the Trump administration trying to fix --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- a problem, but this is a profit center for these companies.</p><p>BLOCK: They ostensibly wanted to make this better for consumers, but unfortunately, it's proven to be a herculean task to fix this. Absolutely.</p><p>SCHLAPP: But the Congress, just -- everyone needs to understand, even with what the President decided, the administration decided, Congress is moving forward on this. So, this issue is not going away.</p><p>BLOCK: No. It's going to -- no.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But as it stands today in terms of the overall government trying to negotiate prescription drug prices for Medicare, it is against the law for the government to do that directly. The president in the past has talked about the government doing it. He talked about it when he was running for the presidency in 2016 even I think as early as 2015, it'll be interesting to see now that they couldn't do this, what happens next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's stop in a quick break. Let me just point out once again, wrapping this story up, the June PPI is out. It was up a little hotter than we expected, up one-tenth of a percent for the core, it was up three-tenths of a percent year-over-year, 1.7 percent and you're not -- well, you saw a little pullback in the market, but you're still looking at a double-digit move on the Dow. We're going to see another record high when the market opens. Stuart Varney is going to be up next. He'll weigh in on all of that.</p><p>And then this, sold, Nike's first ever running shoe now up for grabs in an auction of the world's rarest sneakers, what it will cost you, we will tell you how you can snag a pair of this coveted kicks. Back in a minute. But first, a special update from The Tennis Channel.</p><p>JONATHAN NOVACK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel Court Report. For FOX Business, I'm Jonathan Novack. The ladies' championship match is set at Wimbledon after Thursday's semifinal action in London.</p><p>Serena Williams is just one win away from equaling Margaret Court's all- time record at the slams after she dispatched Barbora Strycova in straight sets. The American could claim her 24th major title at the All-England Club this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERENA WILLIAMS, TENNIS PLAYER: It's really not about 24, 23, 25, it's really just about going out there and giving my best effort. No matter what I do, I will always have a great career.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOVACK: She'll face former world number one Simona Halep for the title after the Romanian swept aside Elina Svitolina in straight sets, 26 winners for Halep on her way to her first Wimbledon Final. And don't forget, Wimbledon Primetime hits the air Friday at 2:00 p.m. Eastern. I'm Jonathan Novack.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Dow cracked the 27,000 mark yesterday and stayed there for the first time ever. Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to take a look at this market that will not quit, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: Who would have thought, Maria? Who would have thought?</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you knew it. You said it yesterday.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, come on. I don't want to take any credit for this here, Maria. I'm going to give you the credit. I remember on Election Night 2016, I remember you saying right after Paul Krugman has said the market's going to crash, I heard Maria Bartiromo say, \"No, it's not. It's going straight up.\" But you were right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: Who would have thought? I mean really, who would have thought you'd go from --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know what --</p><p>VARNEY: -- 18,000 to 27,000?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Policies that are good for business, that are good for an economy, that's going to lead to growth.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean it makes perfect percent sense.</p><p>VARNEY: I think that Trump's critics were so overwhelmed with their contempt for the president, with their emotional response to the election. They were blinded, completely blinded at what's really happening in our economy. That's why I say, who would have thought?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: They couldn't imagine it. But look what we've got. And we got to open higher again this morning. We're going to be well above 27,000 on the Dow, and, by the way, Maria, we are now up exactly, exactly $10 trillion in value since Election Day 2016. $10 trillion, how about that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is incredible.</p><p>VARNEY: It sure is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What a number, Stu. Spot on.</p><p>VARNEY: Love it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. I know you'll have more in 15 minutes. We'll see you top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY: You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour every day, 9:00 a.m. Eastern right here on FOX Business after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, hey, if the shoe fits, 100 of the rarest sneakers ever made now up for grabs. How you can snag a pair of the world's most coveted kicks, that's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Violence breaking out in an Ohio Courtroom. Cheryl Casone with headlines now. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is something else, Maria. This happened when two sons of Elizabeth Pledger tried to jump her killer, Dale Williams. All right. One of those family member was hit with a taser, both of them were arrested. Williams pleaded guilty to that crime back in 2017. His sentencing is rescheduled after that happened.</p><p>Well, Air France plans to swap bordering passes for facial recognition on flights between New York's JFK and George Bush International Airport down in Houston. Air France already using biometric boarding in several major U.S. cities including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Dallas. Company wants to bring facial recognition to all U.S. airports by next year.</p><p>And bidding starting off in the tens of thousands as Sotheby's auctions off 100 pairs of very rare sneakers. Items include Nike Moon Shoes, which Sotheby experts Nike's Co-Founder handmade using a waffle iron, if you can believe it. Also for sale, self-lacing sneakers modeled after ones that were worn in Back to the Future 2. These rare kicks expected to fetch between $30,000 to $160,000. A waffle iron to make shoes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my God. $160,000.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>CASONE: They're going to -- it's going to go for crazy (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what are you supposed to do with those sneakers, wear them or just put them, like, on a shelf?</p><p>CASONE: I'd put them in a really pretty box.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Would you buy that?</p><p>SCHLAPP: If it had Betsy Ross's flag on it, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good one.</p><p>BLOCK: I just made a hundred dollar bet with myself that you're going to bring that up and I won. All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, well, who's going to pay you?</p><p>BLOCK: Myself, yes, here -- yes, what else is new?</p><p>SCHLAPP: I'll pay you.</p><p>BLOCK: OK. Cool.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But seriously, these sneakers. The stuff people bid on at auction. I mean these are old, worn sneakers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They were meant -- they -- the sole was made on a waffle iron, at least they were made here in the USA, right, Cheryl?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BLOCK: Could you use that -- could you use that to make waffles after that?</p><p>CASONE: Yes, right.</p><p>BLOCK: That's -- things I -- things I need to not know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Better made than the current crop of sneaks that they're selling to the people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, look, that was a ridiculous story about the Nike and the Betsy Ross flag (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BLOCK: Totally ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Since one flew behind President Barack Obama during his inauguration. Did you see that photo making its way around the internet? I don't think that was photoshopped.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, you're right. Now, let's take a quick break. When we come back, final thoughts from this all-star panel, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The president just tweeting about tariffs. Here's what he just said. \"When you are the big piggybank that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed, tariffs are a great negotiating tool, a great revenue producer, and more importantly, a powerful way to get companies to come to the USA and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home. We stupidly lost 30 percent of our auto business to Mexico. If the tariffs went on and on at a higher level, they would all come back and fast, but very happy with the deal I made,\" writes the president.</p><p>He goes on, \"If Mexico produces, which I think they will, biggest part of deal with Mexico has not yet been revealed. China is similar, except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen the effect of 25 percent tariffs. So far, little effect to consumers, companies will relocate to the United States. Dagen, you want to respond to the president's tweets? You've been critical of his tariff policy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When he brags about the revenue coming in, he's bragging about taxes. He's bragging about higher taxes. It might not be directly on American consumers, but it is on American businesses importing goods into the United States. And secondly, worry about the debt -- the amount of money we're borrowing just as much if not more than -- because again who are we borrowing it from? China?</p><p>BARTIROMO: But do you -- do you agree that though that given China's behavior, their goal is to overtake the United States in terms of our military, national security? He doesn't have a lot of levers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It -- he has taken on China and he's fighting back for literally decade --</p><p>BARTIROMO: First president to do so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- for people in this country for decades were ignored and lied to by politicians and business leaders. So, kudos on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Your thoughts?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes. Look, I think that the -- if we don't get serious about China, we're in big trouble. This is a national security question as well as an economic question. I just hope we can make the right decisions going forward because it's a lot at stake.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean when you talk about tariffs elsewhere, that's a different conversation. You can't call the China story the same story elsewhere.</p><p>SCHLAPP: No. You got tariffs, you got Huawei, and you've got the critical infrastructure in the country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, as we look at this market rally, Michael Block --</p><p>BLOCK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- we've got a market that is about to take off once again. Record high territory. A little celebration in order. It is time to cut the cake. Last hour. We showed you the technicolor lattes. This is the explosion cake that Cheryl brought. And this is LG.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us about this cake, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: OK. It's an explosion cake and you're going to have to definitely -- the big thing about the cake is when you open it up, it's going to kind of, \"Explode.\" It is filled with all kinds of candy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Awesome.</p><p>CASONE: The trick is to do it in front of the -- well, in front of the cameras. You got to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. All right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: This is not -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Too big of a deal here just in case it's not such a big explosion. I want to do it -- all right. And we're going to do it this way so that it's on camera. Here we go. All right. Explosion cake.</p><p>CASONE: This is like Beyonce, Katy Perry, they have all ordered this cake, because they love it so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>CASONE: -- because the --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're doing a very good job on this, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know. Thank you.</p><p>CASONE: Oh, there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>CASONE: I see what's in the cake. So it's filled with, like, different, like, different colors, obviously. And then it's also filled with candy, it's covered in sprinkles. It is a vanilla cake, in case anybody wants to know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. I don't see much --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't see much, I suppose. All it's filled up for the explosion cake. I mean it's pretty.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Did we plug it in?</p><p>BARTIROMO: So there's --</p><p>BLOCK: This is like Geraldo's vault.</p><p>SCHLAPP: What's going on here?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm glad you said that before I did.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Now, did you pay the electric bill?</p><p>BARTIROMO: We can cut another piece. Maybe we get more explosion. Here we go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: Maker is (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP: Oh, hey.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: There you go. (INAUDIBLE) is the baker. She's famous on Instagram by the way. Like she's got like almost 300,000 followers because of this cake.</p><p>BLOCK: It's beautiful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It is very nice.</p><p>CASONE: Good job cutting the cake, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And does it -- does it taste good?</p><p>CASONE: Well, you tell me. You're sitting right in front of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I ate -- I tasted one of those little -- the little cake --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, the cake balls?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How was it?</p><p>CASONE: You know what, I'm going to try -- this was the --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, take a bite out of that.</p><p>CASONE: All right. This is the cake (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do it. Take a bite.</p><p>CASONE: By the way, again, you can have these in SoHo in Manhattan today through Sunday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By the way, there are certain things we don't eat on T.V. and Oreos would be one because you'd get them in your teeth and your teeth are black.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She's a brave woman.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's not ice cream, is it? That's cake.</p><p>CASONE: It's cake.</p><p>BLOCK: Did it explode?</p><p>SCHLAPP: It's cake.</p><p>CASONE: Here we go. Oh my God. It's so good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes? OK. Cool.</p><p>CASONE: It's so good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bring on the sugar. All right. This is great. We will -- we will enjoy this cake while we say to our audience thank you so much for joining us. It's been a great week here. Have a great day. Seize the day. Dagen McDowell's got you covered on Monday and Tuesday. I'll see you next week. Matt Schlapp, Michael Block, thank you for joining us.</p><p>BLOCK: Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Always a pleasure. Cheryl and Dagen, have a great day, everybody. Let's get to \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart, take it away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019071204cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJJ-7821-DXH2-60CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Firefighters at this hour are trying to contain nearly 100 wildfires raging across the West Coast. Millions of acres have already been scorched and at least 35 people have been killed in those fires, but dozens of people are missing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump is on his way to Phoenix, Arizona for a campaign roundtable with Latino voters. The President leaving California just a few moments ago. There he met with emergency officials for a briefing on the wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During that meeting, the President thanked all of those who are risking their lives to fight the wild fires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In August, I approved a major disaster declaration for California. I've approved, I think, Gavin about 40 Stafford Act declarations. So very quickly, because we want to get this thing taken care of including fire management, assisting grants to help multiple states stop the fires.</p><p>More than 28,000 firefighters and first responders are combating the fires in California, Oregon and Washington; over 230 soldiers are fighting the August Complex Fire, and that's the largest fire in California. That's the big one. That's the biggest.</p><p>And we want to thank all of the brave fighters. We want to thank these incredible people, the first responders, service members who are racing to the extreme peril, really put their lives in extreme danger.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: And the President is now on his way to Phoenix for a campaign roundtable with Latino voters there. It will be his seventh state that the President has visited in his many days, and where is Joe Biden? Well, we'll find out later in the broadcast.</p><p>And red storm rising: the Pentagon today warned that China has developed the capability to threaten the United States with nuclear missiles. Tonight, we'll examine the threat closely. The growing Chinese nuclear arsenal is becoming a true threat.</p><p>We're joined tonight by President Trump's Special Envoy for Arms Control, Ambassador Marshall Billingslea to take up those issues and more.</p><p>As the Pentagon warns about China's growing military strength, this country's attention is drawn to the infernos burning out of control in western states. A combination of heat, drought, lightning, arson, and overgrown forests all contributing to those fires, and well, you probably won't hear this in the left-wing national media this evening, but California's radical Dem Governor Gavin Newsom, who is often well, in opposition to President Trump was profuse in his expression of gratitude today to President Trump for all that he has done for the State of California to fight those fires.</p><p>Gavin Newsom, thanking the President for his support of first responders and giving the state critical aid in their response to the wildfires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): There's over 16,500 firefighters currently out in the lines, and I'm very pleased and I'm very grateful, Mr. President, that you're recognizing some of the other heroes, those National Guardsmen and women that did an extraordinary job saving the lives of hundreds and hundreds of people stranded with some of these most intense fires.</p><p>I want to thank you and acknowledge the work that you've done to the media in terms of your response to our F MAG Request 14. We were just talking -- Mark Ghilarducci is the Head of the Office of Emergency Services -- has made the record that the state's received in the F MAG support, as well as the major disaster declaration, which you reference on August 22, which was profoundly significant not only to help us support our mutual aid system, but also individuals that are in desperate need of support.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it was only last month that the Trump administration and the State of California signed an agreement to thin up to a million acres of forest in California every year using logging and controlled burns. Governor Newsom further thank the President for funding that effort and acknowledged California has decades of negligence in managing their forests.</p><p>California is also the center of the latest violent incidents of Black Lives Matter and in Antifa violence. $100,000.00 reward is being offered tonight for information on the gunman who just brazenly shot two Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputies from ambush. The two Deputies were in their patrol car, Saturday, in Compton, California when the shooter opened fire at point blank range.</p><p>Doctors performing surgery on both Deputies, they are expected to survive. The Sheriff there calls it a double miracle.</p><p>As the two Deputies were fighting for their lives, however, Antifa and Black Lives Matter thugs tried to block the emergency entrance to the hospital. Their antics disgusting, even the left and they turned even uglier as they chanted outside the hospital that they hope the Deputies would die.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: These pigs out here, they are telling us that we cannot come in here and see these individuals who have been shot down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oink, oink, oink, oink. [Bleep] the police. [Bleep] the police. [Bleep] you all.</p><p>You all are going to die one by one. This thing ain't going to stop. [Bleep]. [Bleep].</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We'll be glad to send this video along to every corporation in the country who is spending money and efforts supporting Black Lives Matter. I hope we could have a discussion, any one of you who would like to take this up on this broadcast, any CEO of any corporation doing so is welcome on immediate notice to join us on the broadcast here to take up what you were watching and what you are witnessing and what the whole country is repulsed by and why is Corporate America supporting a Marxist organization, this vile and this violent?</p><p>We'd like to hear why your company is supporting them. Just give us a call. We'll put you on the air.</p><p>And another graphic image capturing the Deputies after they were shot. They were able to find sufficient cover to radio for help themselves after they were attacked so viciously.</p><p>And last night, at a rally in Henderson, Nevada, President Trump condemned those thugs, condemned the vicious effort to assassinate our law enforcement officers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The radical left in America is waging open war on law enforcement. Hundreds of officers nationwide have been injured in left-wing riots and mobs, you see it.</p><p>Biden wants to appease domestic terrorists, and my plan is to arrest domestic terrorists.</p><p>[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]</p><p>TRUMP: And we also believe that if you murder a police officer, you should receive the death penalty and that's something that's --</p><p>[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Los Angeles certainly not the only large Democrat-run city where police officers were attacked. Police officers responding to a domestic violence call in New York yesterday met by a gang member who fired a half dozen shots at them. None of the officers were wounded. The gunman was captured and arrested.</p><p>And violence running rampant in other large Democrat-run cities. Yes, they are Democrat-run cities. In Lori Lightfoot's Chicago, 54 people were shot this weekend, and 12 of them were killed. And still, she is the mayor.</p><p>And police in Lancaster, Pennsylvania forced to use teargas last night to move a violent mob out of the streets. Black Lives Matter activist again, throwing bricks trying to damage vehicles, calling officers the real KKK.</p><p>[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]</p><p>DOBBS: The ignorance, the violence, absolutely incredible, and it's being tolerated by those Democrat-run cities. All of that, by the way by the activist, the thugs, the mob in response to a fatal police shooting of a man by the name of Ricardo Munoz.</p><p>Police shot and killed the 27-year-old man as they responded to a domestic disturbance call yesterday afternoon. Police officer body camera video shows Munoz actually threatening those officers with a knife in his right hand before he was shot and shot dead.</p><p>Police record show Munoz had been arrested just last year for stabbing four people and holding a knife to his own throat when police tried to intervene. Munoz was awaiting trial on four counts of aggravated assault. No one has explained what he was doing on these increasingly evil streets.</p><p>Well, it's stunning to see what America is putting up with in what some celebrities are celebrating in this country. It's pure ignorance. And I have to tell you, it is absolutely intolerable.</p><p>Turning now to Wall Street where the market started this week off well. The Dow Jones Industrials rallied, up 327 points. The S&amp;P up 42 points. The NASDAQ up 203. And my goodness, that's right, 203 points. Technology is back in vogue, at least in today's session.</p><p>And crude oil up slightly to $37.00 a barrel, and a reminder to listen to my reports three times a day on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Up next anti-Trumper Alexander Vindman, you'll remember him. He carries on his lies and of the left in a new interview, and it comes, well, in a very familiar package.</p><p>We take it up with former Director of National Intelligence, Ric Grenell here tonight.</p><p>Also more bad numbers for the NFL, how player protests are being viewed by fans. Radio host Larry Elder joins us on that and much more.</p><p>And please, preorder my new book, \"The Trump Century: How Our President Changed the Course of History Forever.\" It's available now at our new merchandise store at loudobbsshop.com, a place for all American patriots -- Republicans, Democrats, and Independents; and I'll be doing a virtual book signing September 23rd and get your autographed copy of \"The Trump Century.\" Sign up at loudobbsshop.com.</p><p>Stay with us. We are coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news now. Obama Attorney General, Eric Holder is advising China Joe Biden on how to steal the election. Biden beefing up his legal team to prepare for what are anticipated issues with this election, as it's been put by one wag.</p><p>The legal team includes, of course attorneys from Perkins Coie. You'll remember them. They are counsel to the D.N.C., to Hillary Clinton, to the left in this country. And they Biden the legal team is being led by Obama's former personal attorney, Dana Remus, who actually taught a law class last year at Duke's Law School with RINO Senator Mike Lee. Michael Lee, apparently playing, I guess, Lindsey Graham to John McCain, and that relationship.</p><p>Also breaking tonight, the latest FOX News poll finds only 48 percent of Americans say that the violence on our cities including New York, Portland, Kenosha, are riots. Forty percent just don't believe they're lying eyes and say the demonstrations are simply protest. Well, there we are.</p><p>\"The Atlantic\" magazine, by the way, publishing an article this weekend arguing -- if you can imagine this -- that Republicans should permit Joe Biden to win in November. Now, this is \"The Atlantic\" mind you because they reason, if Biden were to lose, there would be more riots. Does this sound like a threat to you? Because it certainly does to me.</p><p>Brookings Institute senior fellow, Shadi Hamid wrote, quote, \"A loss by Joe Biden under these circumstances is the worst case not because Trump will destroy America, (he can't),\" parenthetically said Shaid Hamid, \"... but because it is the outcome most likely to undermine faith in democracy, resulting in more of the social unrest and street battles. For this reason, strictly law and order Republicans who have responded in dismay to scenes of rioting and looting have an interest in Biden winning.\"</p><p>Hamid is saying basically, if President Trump is reelected, the left will give us more riots, more violence, and more ignorance, and he thinks that is somehow going to intimidate voters, so does \"The Atlantic.\" What a strange organization.</p><p>Well, the ratings for the NFL's opening Sunday Night Football game between the Cowboys and Rams down more than 20 percent compared to last year. During the playing of the National Anthem and a black national anthem over the weekend, seven teams stayed in the locker rooms, 10 teams had many of their players taking knees and obviously, some fans really did not like it.</p><p>Despite the extensive protest, former quarterback, Colin Kaepernick complained calling the league's social justice initiatives propaganda. Can you believe this?</p><p>This was never about a protest for him. It looks more like a Marxist drive to overthrow the country. Now, all of that pandering and compliance and accommodation by Roger Goodell and the rest of the NFL going for not Colin Kaepernick just being who he is.</p><p>Well joining us tonight is Larry Elder, host of \"The Larry Elder Show\" on the Salem Radio Network, also executive producer of the documentary, \"Uncle Tom: An Oral History of the American Black Conservative.\"</p><p>Let's start with Kaepernick. I can't believe this guy. He has been treated like a rock star and now he is -- and Roger Goodell has done everything but kneel himself before the great activist, Marxist, whatever you want to call him, Kaepernick. They bowed down every time he says anything. So does Nike. So do too many, in my opinion, corporations in this country, public corporations who are turning over money, airtime and supporting him and the left in this broad side. Your thoughts?</p><p>LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, SALEM RADIO NETWORK: Well, it shows you how well the Trump economy is doing notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic shutdown, because Colin Kaepernick apparently is working.</p><p>Look, I'm keep waiting for just one of these athletes, Lou, just one aside from Herschel Walker to stand up and say, where's the evidence that the police are mowing down black people just because they're black.</p><p>We're in a nation of 350 million Americans, 50 million have police interactions with them every year. Out of that 50 million police-civilian interactions, 11 million people are arrested. Out of that, 60,000 officers are assaulted, 50 are killed. Despite all of that, only a thousand people are killed by the police every year and that's been the same average for the last four or five years. Almost all of them have been resisting with a weapon or resisting violently.</p><p>When you're looking at unarmed white cops killing unarmed blacks. You're talking about less than four percent of the total, and unarmed does not mean not dangerous. Michael Brown was unarmed, but his DNA was found on the cop's gun.</p><p>My point is, it is very, very, very rare for the police to kill anybody, let alone an unarmed black person, let alone an unarmed black person who is not reasonably perceived as a threat.</p><p>The fact is out of all the homicides in this country, unfortunately, half of the victims are blacks, and almost all of them are killed by other black people. It is a fact that a young white man, the number one cause of death for a young white man -- preventable is accidents like car accidents. The number one cause of death, whether preventable or not, for a young black man is homicide, eight to 10 times more likely to be a homicide victim than a young white man. That's why the cops are there.</p><p>And finally rapper Tupac Shakur once said, \"We need the police more than anybody else because of the criminal element that is there.\" So knock it off. The facts do not support the whole premise behind the narrative and of getting people killed because cops pull back. It's called the Ferguson effect.</p><p>And young black men are being indoctrinated with the idea that they're going to be hurt when they're stopped by a police officer, so they are unnecessarily on guard and therefore are not complying with what they ought to be doing, so you are ruining the relationship on both sides of the transaction by this phony narrative. It's getting people killed.</p><p>And I keep waiting for Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Charles Barkley, somebody to stand up with some kind of stature and say, wait a second, let's take a look at the facts before we react. I haven't seen that yet.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, it is to me very interesting that Corporate America won't say, you know, we're really concerned about violence in the black community in our inner cities run by Democratic mayors, these CEOs who are moving money to support these, you know, showboating, you know, spectacles of nonsense that we are forced to watch because it's now part of the NFL. Thank you, Roger Goodell. I mean, it's atrocious.</p><p>If they really cared -- if they gave one damn about the problem, the issue -- and fixing it, they will be sending that money directly into those inner cities, and by the way, all of the athletes standing up and showboating and, you know, putting up \"End Racism\" in their end zones.</p><p>This is just absurd, because they are supporting Black Lives Matter and Antifa and all the thugs who have been demonstrating since George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, and guess what? Dozens, dozens and dozens of people have been killed as a result of the wanton violence on our streets in those Democrat-run cities, and much of it initiated by Black Lives Matter. Not to them, they don't. It is a slogan, and that's where it ends.</p><p>ELDER: And look, I point out that people like Doc Rivers, who, after Jacob Blake was shot had a tearful press conference and said, \"Why do these kinds of things keep happening?\" He lives in Malibu. The end result of his anti- cop rhetoric is going to be the cops pull back, but safety in this neighborhood won't be compromised.</p><p>LeBron James, after the death of Ahmaud Arbery says we are afraid to leave the house. We are afraid to leave the house. I guess he speak for all black people now. He lives in Brentwood, and when the cops pull back, he'll be in a very safe neighborhood full of private security. He will not have to suffer the consequences of his irresponsible rhetoric.</p><p>Will some prominent athlete stand up and say the truth and knock off the nonsense. As Lou pointed out, Chicago 50 people shot last weekend, the last three consecutive weekends, an average of 50 people were shot, an average of seven people killed. That's just in Chicago alone. And St. Louis and Baltimore have three times the homicide rate. Where's Black Lives Matter?</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. And where is Barack Obama? Where is Joe Biden? Where is Eric Holder? And why aren't they speaking up? Three of the political leaders of the left, Biden in particular, he could come out and discuss it perhaps honestly and openly and encourage civility and a peaceful resolution of issues in the black community. Instead, he is hiding.</p><p>And as the entire radical -- the party of hate, the radical Dems have become that and I think, now worse.</p><p>Larry Elder, it is always great to see you. Thanks for being with us. Appreciate it.</p><p>Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi says he got away with it again. He survived a two-week hospital stay. He was being treated for the COVID-19 virus or as it is known here, the China virus. Berlusconi has gotten away with it again.</p><p>He is also responsible for our LDT tonight, word of the day, the word is \"bunga bunga.\" So we get actually a bonus word in there -- named for the 83-year-old's notorious bunga bunga parties at his lavish villa while he was Prime Minister of Italy, and there it is.</p><p>Up next, the Chamber of Horrors wants more foreign workers in the United States for Big Tech. We will take it up with D.H.S. Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli and more, right after these quick messages. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: The Chamber of Horrors complaining again about the Trump administration's restrictions on foreign visas. The Chamber of Commerce are quoted as saying, quote: \"It's not so much just bringing the talent into the country, it is having the talent come here to help start new operations.\" Really? Wow. Who knew?</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security is blocking the import of Chinese products made in China's concentration camps. It's about time.</p><p>The camps make products like hair products, apparel, cotton, computer parts, and lots of other things as well, and so we have decided to do something about it. Let's find out what. Ken Cuccinelli, Acting Deputy Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security joining us tonight.</p><p>Ken, great to have you with us. This is a peculiar, peculiar situation. You're trying to stop this stuff made by Uyghurs primarily in concentration camps, and meanwhile, we are buying nearly everything that China can manufacture across the board.</p><p>It's the same Communist Chinese Party responsible for all of it. How do you -- how do how do you expect us to make discreet judgments about what is appropriate, what is not when it's the same lying bunch of murderers who decided that they wouldn't tell the world that the China virus would kill them, and an unsuspecting world found out just how many could be infected and killed in the wanton disregard by Xi Jinping.</p><p>KEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES: So, Lou, the authority that we have to exercise requires us to have a reasonable suspicion on a company by company basis or entity by entity. So a factory today, one of the entities we sanctioned is -- they refer to it euphemistically as a re-education or vocational school. In fact, it's a concentration camp. And I mean, they provide labor to two other entities that C.B.P., Customs and Border Protection has also sanctioned.</p><p>So we're hitting the Communist Party directly with their vocational school. We've hit some of these companies with direct sanctions and it stops them from importing their products into the United States.</p><p>And this year, C.B.P. has seized tons -- tons -- literally in weight, tons of these products and blocked them from entry into the United States. The Customs and Border Protection under Mark Morgan has issued more withhold release orders, the technical name for these seizure orders than in any other year in its history, directed at China more than any other country. And today, we added five more to the list.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's turn to the Chamber of Commerce. They're very upset about not being able to do as they would, which is compete directly against American workers. They're very upset with your administration, and this President because you just won't let him. They just won't -- this President just won't permit the Chamber of Commerce to replace our workers, our middle class with cheap foreign labor.</p><p>CUCCINELLI: Well, Lou, this President has been a vociferous advocate for American workers, the American worker and right now, we're several months into the President's exclusion of temporary foreign workers from the United States because of the explosion in unemployment we suffered as a result of COVID-19, and that is slated to go until the end of the year.</p><p>And even then the President has, you know, broadcast notice that he may extend it beyond that, so that Americans can get back to work faster, and whether some other people like the Chamber of Commerce would like to get their hands on some cheap labor or not, the President's priority is getting American citizens back to work, and that's what's happening at a record pace.</p><p>We still have a long way show, but this President has prioritized American workers first in the recovery.</p><p>DOBBS: And good for him and extend it, he should. And by the way, we should point out that the Chamber is so upset with President Trump and his policies that they're going to actually be supporting a number of radical Dem candidates on November 3rd. That's beautiful, isn't it?</p><p>Ken Cuccinelli, always good to see you. Thanks so much for being with us. Appreciate it.</p><p>Up next, Senators Rubio and Warner blocking Republicans from accessing Obamagate records. We'll take it up with former Director of National Intelligence, Ric Grenell.</p><p>Preorder my new book, \"The Trump Century: How Our President Changed the Course of History Forever.\" Available now at our new merchandise store, loudobbsshop.com, amazon.com as well, Barnes and Noble.</p><p>Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news. NBC is now reporting the Justice Department's Inspector General is investigating something. He is investigating the Department's sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone.</p><p>When reached by FOX News, the I.G.'s office wouldn't neither confirm nor deny the NBC report.</p><p>Well, anti-Trumper, former National Security Council member, Alexander Vindman talking with \"The Atlantic\" magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg, the chief editor there and regurgitating the Deep State's lies that President Trump is a pawn of Vladimir Putin.</p><p>This comes less than two weeks after at least 20 people disputed Goldberg's article, which claimed President Trump disparaged American soldiers.</p><p>Well, joining us tonight is Ric Grenell. He is former Acting Director of National Intelligence, former U.S. Ambassador to Germany, and in my opinion, one of the greatest public servants in this country's history.</p><p>It is, Ambassador, great to have you with us. I want to start with the Inspector General, taking up a sentencing recommendation of all that we know could be investigated by the Justice Department to decide on Roger Stone's sentencing recommendation, dropping it from nine to seven years, which is almost double the typical sentence of anyone found guilty of lying to Congress. It's an absurd internal matter that to me speaks to the corruption still within the Department of Justice. Your thoughts?</p><p>RICHARD GRENELL, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Look, Lou, we have a real problem in Washington, D.C. with the Washington, D.C. types who control the arms of government and they are weaponizing the tools of government against people that they don't like, the opposition, their enemies, their political opponents, and this is really, I think, a crisis in Washington.</p><p>We need to be able to clean it up. I know that President Trump feels very strongly as the outsider that coming in, there is a whole bunch of insider rules and regulations and views and it's incredibly difficult to take on the entire system because this system is not only the bureaucrats but it's -- you know, politicians, its reporters.</p><p>The Inspector Generals I think are supposed to be above it all. They're supposed to be the individuals who can look at the bigger picture and try to figure out when there are problems, and then deep dive into the specifics.</p><p>What we have is a whole group of Inspector Generals who really have been playing politics, and you can go through every single agency in Washington. And it's these Inspector Generals and the entire system that is weaponizing the tools of government.</p><p>It's a big problem. And I have to say that when you leave Washington, D.C., and you talk to normal people outside of Washington, D.C., they're beginning to dismiss the whole place. They're beginning to dismiss everything in Washington. That's a very dangerous spot that we're in.</p><p>There's a whole group of people in Washington who keep pretending like they matter, and they've lost the American people.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, they've lost the American people, but certainly the political parties are looking awfully badly -- both parties -- in all of this and the reality seems to be that the Justice Department is now an organization unto itself. It's where truth goes to die. Documents are not produced.</p><p>I mean, look what happened. The Senate Intelligence Committee, Senators Rubio and Warner rejecting Senators Johnson and Grassley's request for documents to assist Chairman Johnson's investigation, and not -- I mean, we are watching a division within the parties that is aimed at, in this case, there's only one explanation. They want to assist the radical Dems who have conspired against President Trump to overthrow a sitting President.</p><p>I can't reach any other conclusion logically, can you?</p><p>GRENELL: Yes, here let me just say a couple of things. One, Senator Johnson has been one, very few who has focused the Senate on trying to figure out the truth. He is looking for transparency. He is looking for more information.</p><p>He is not playing a game of hiding the information that doesn't help his narrative or his mean. That is exactly what many in Washington do. They want to classify and push away reports. They want to create new reports that only look at one side of the situation.</p><p>We have very few people, Lou, in Washington who just want to say, let's declassify the information. Let's put it out. The American people are smart enough to look through the information and come to their own conclusion.</p><p>We don't need to be spoon fed. We don't need to be told one thing on cable television, and then another when you're under oath inside a congressional committee. We want the whole truth and transparency.</p><p>Senator Johnson is looking to do that. He is trying to figure out where this all began and uncover it all and declassify it and give this information to the American people. Transparency is not political.</p><p>DOBBS: And transparency is was this President's commitment when he was elected. If indeed we find out that the Justice Department, the F.B.I., all of these investigative agencies and committees produce nothing going into this election, would you recommend -- I'll put the different way -- do you believe the President should declassify every damn document and put it in front of the American -- put them in front of the American people?</p><p>GRENELL: Look, it was my job as Acting Director of Intelligence to really question the system and question the bureaucrats who wanted to declassify documents. We over classify.</p><p>We now have a system in Washington that classifies to protect the public relations aspect of these agencies. What I tried to do is look at every document and to say, is there a source in here that needs to be protected? Or is there a method that points to how we got this information?</p><p>The source and the methods are the only reason why you should protect something. And by the way, you can then just redact that source or that line that talks about how we're getting something.</p><p>I also went so far on methods as to say, if the method was finished, if we were done using something, then we should declassify it and share it. If it's something old and useless because we want to show as much transparency as possible, only redact information that is current and relevant.</p><p>DOBBS: I'm getting the feeling that you might be willing to entertain declassification. I prefer that interpretation. Ric Grenell who has done so many things to create transparency around what we have come to call Obamagate, I appreciate you being with us. We hope you'll come back soon, Ric Grenell.</p><p>Well, up next, the Pentagon says China has the capability to strike America with a nuclear missile. President Trump's Special Envoy for Arms Control joins us with much more on that right after these quick messages. Please stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us tonight is Presidential Envoy for Arms Control, Ambassador Marshall Billingslea. Ambassador, it is great to have you with us and these are perilous times, and your efforts and those of others in the administration to come to some sort of an agreement on limitation of particularly nuclear weapons and delivery systems among the United States, China and Russia, are critically important.</p><p>I want to begin by asking you, how confident you are right now of what can be achieved.</p><p>MARSHALL BILLINGSLEA, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR ARMS CONTROL: Well, it's great to be with you, Lou, and thanks for giving me a chance to talk with you about the vision that President Trump has laid out for the future of nuclear arms control.</p><p>You know, one of the key points that I took from your conversation just now with Ric Grenell is the importance of transparency. And we need to be clear that the same kind of secretive behavior that the Chinese Communist Party adopted when it came to the coronavirus is the kind of stonewalling and great wall of secrecy they are applying to their nuclear buildup.</p><p>That's why the President has called them out. He has made clear that they are surging, and that the next Nuclear Arms Control Treaty must include and must limit China.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, and Ambassador, I want the audience to know that you have declassified video for us to show what was happening in the arms parade in Beijing, and if we could, let's go to first an image from 2009.</p><p>This shows -- well, I'm going to ask you what do you take from this and the size of the parade?</p><p>BILLINGSLEA: Well, so Lou, the image that you're showing your viewers there is actually from a classified briefing that I gave to the North Atlantic Council, to NATO a few weeks ago, and we felt it was important, again on this theme of transparency that the American people and frankly, the international community know what's going on.</p><p>So on top there, you can see in the parade, the Chinese have one big parade every 10 years or so, where they show off their nuclear weapons. In 2009, you can see that the length of that parade stretched about a half a kilometer. Ten years later, that parade stretched 10 times as long.</p><p>So that's what they've done just in the space of 10 years. Can you imagine what it's going to be like 10 years from now, when they continue building all of these different ranges and types of these nuclear capable missiles?</p><p>It's very, very concerning and the American people need to know that the President is looking out for them and he is going to protect us through a variety of mechanisms, both improving our nuclear deterrent, bringing online new capabilities that no other nation has, but also in driving arms control to try to limit and avoid an unnecessary and costly three-way nuclear arms race.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I'd like Ambassador, for you to come back and spend some more time with us. We are actually constrained by time tonight. But I want to get a sense from you, again as to your hopes, your optimism about doing something with either Russia bilaterally, or even if that's in the cards are with China bilaterally?</p><p>BILLINGSLEA: So that's a great question. The bottom line is the ball is now in Russia's court. The President has had the necessary conversations with President Putin. And we view that they have they have sketched out the way ahead, and that we've made a good a good offer to the Russian Federation, and we hope they'll take us up on it.</p><p>What we want to do here is three things. We want to make sure that the next agreement we negotiate and we will start with the Russians first, and we'll include the Chinese in due course, but it's got to cover all nuclear weapons.</p><p>We can't have the Russians building all of these tactical nuclear weapons outside of any treaty focused on NATO. And of course, China is not involved in any of these arms control agreements. So that's thing number two.</p><p>The architecture we lay out has got to include China. And then thing number three is we've got to fix the really dangerous deficiencies contained in the Obama-Biden New START Treaty, real big deficiencies in terms of verification and transparency measures.</p><p>So that's the proposal we've laid out and we're hopeful that Moscow will take us up on it.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, Ambassador, we appreciate you being with us in a very instructive discussion. We appreciate it. Come back soon, Ambassador Marshall Billingslea.</p><p>Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2020091401cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V8-NTX1-JB20-G4FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5847\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 14, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Election</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wildfires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Police</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Law Enforcement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Guns</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Market</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China, Litigation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Roger Stone</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Russiagate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nuclear Weapons</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Military &amp;

And it is Tuesday, October 2nd, your top stories right now, just before 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast, the Art of the Deal, President Trump touting his revised trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's my great honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand-new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA and the NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement called USMCA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're taking a look at the implications for business and the economy this morning. Markets are under some selling pressure today. We are off of the lows of the morning. But, nonetheless, down 69 points on the Dow Industrials right now quarter of a percent lower on the Dow, quarter of a percent lower on the S&amp;P, a third of a percent lower on the NASDAQ with the NASDAQ declining 26 points right now. This after a mixed day yesterday.</p><p>Pretty good actually, Dow Industrials were up almost 200 points at the close yesterday three quarters of one percent. S&amp;P was up 10 points, a third of a percent. But the NASDAQ was down about nine points yesterday. In Europe this morning, declines across the board. Take a look. The FT 100 down 23 points. The CAC quarante in Paris down two-thirds of a percent 33 points lower and the DAX Index in Germany down 74. That's two-thirds of a percent lower as well.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets are mostly lower. Holiday in China. Markets there close. But Hong Kong was down two and a third percent. Hanging in the balance, the country is waiting on the results of the FBI investigation into Supreme Court judge nominee Brett Kavanaugh. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the confirmation vote is on track. It will take place on Friday this week. Scare on the tarmac, a Delta Jet evacuated after a fire broke out onboard.</p><p>We have the very latest coming up. And then the fight for 15 makes its way to big tech, Amazon this morning announcing first on Fox that it will raise the minimum wage for all employees to $15 an hour this comes after the company has come under fire over working conditions. Amazon shares are down this morning a third of a percent. An unbelievable rescue at sea to tell you about how a tugboat crane and crew of 30 saved a humpbacked whale. Look at these pictures.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning. And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, former New York State Senator Michael Balboni, and CFRA Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to be here.</p><p>MICHAEL BALBONI, FORMER NEW YORK STATE SENATOR: A lot of interesting stories so far this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. What's the most interesting from your --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BALBONI: Well, it got to be the horse in the bar. I'm sorry. I know. It's supposed to be so series but then it's incredible video, of course, the nominee and how this continues to go at a pace where reaching so far back in history, and everything that people are saying are now -- you have to really prove what you've said now and that's really the disconnect. But it really is we can talk all morning. This is a fight for raw power. That's what this is about.</p><p>It's not really about Brett Kavanaugh or the Supreme Court. It's about trying to get control of the power structure in Washington.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. I just wish there was some evidence for me to, you know, believe. I mean there's absolutely no evidence so far backing up any of these stories, Dagen, and you watched the Swetnick interview and you were telling that to us earlier that interview was just beyond.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, full of inconsistencies. Full of blatant falsehoods and a woman who had trouble even making eye contact during the interview.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She kept looking down.</p><p>MCDOWELL: With the person interviewing her. NBC could not independently verify what she was claiming of the four individuals that she directed NBC too. One of them is dead. Another one did know who she was essentially and did remember go to any parties but then two of them they couldn't get in touch with or did not comment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Know that incredible story really and then we got the story of the economy, and we got earning season upon us, Lindsey.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Yes. So far so good very, very early in the season. Only 16 companies have reported through last night and things are looking good. Stocks aren't reacting so greatly because guidance has been the concern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. The guidance because we'll see if the tariffs take a hit companies in the fourth quarter. Our top story right now promises kept. President Trump announcing a new crafted trade deal with Canada and Mexico. He spoke about it yesterday during a rally in Tennessee. White House Council of Economic Advisers' Chairman, Kevin Hassett joined me early to respond.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're calling it USMCA. No more NAFTA. It's fair. It's modern and it's balanced. And you know what? We have two wonderful partners now. Now, they're partners Mexico and Canada and that's a good thing. America is winning again and America is being respected again because we are finally putting America first.</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, CHAIRMAN, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: It's great for American workers. It's great for American farmers. It opens up markets to the south and to the north to our products. One of the problems that people in the north of U.S. in Wisconsin and New England had is that they couldn't sell stuff up in Canada because basically it was a completely closed market. You couldn't get into their distribution center and they also high tariffs.</p><p>And so that improved a lot. But again, I think that the thing that's going to be most important from this deal is it's a model for all the other deal. And so now, Europe and Japan, they can look at the deal that we made with Canada and Mexico, and say, oh, so that's what President Trump means about fair and reciprocal. So we're going to copy that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now to talk more about that is the President of Eurasia Group and host of the new WNET program, GZERO World, Ian Bremmer is here. Ian, great to see you.</p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP: Hi. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations on the new show.</p><p>BREMMER: Thank you. Crazy. But it's coming soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's terrific. Your thoughts on the new Canada and Mexico deal.</p><p>BREMMER: Well --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: USMCA.</p><p>BREMMER: You and I were both talking to a group of about 100 Canadian CEOs yesterday and they were seriously relieved were they not? I mean, you know, let's remember that the big concern that everyone has had for the last few months is what happens if we don't come to a deal with Trump had to pull out of NAFTA, would he start the clock ticking six months, it would crush the Mexican peso. It would disrupt supply chains.</p><p>None of that is going to happen and not only have we decided not to get rid of the old NAFTA, but we've actually made some significant improvements, isn't that brand-new deal and NAFTA was never the worst deal in America ever signed. That was exaggerated. But it is meaningful and it's not just about getting a little bit of access to Canada's dairy market. It has improved labor regulations, environment regulations, I.P. regulations, absolutely.</p><p>And now, and pharmaceutical access. I mean people haven't wanted to get into much of the details. But the fact is, pretty much anyone involved in trade in North America is going to see this is more efficiency, more growth, and that's a good thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's big positive for the President, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And The Wall Street Journal editorial page pushes back on this. There it's called their editorial today a new NAFTA relief. The new deal is worse than the status quo, but disaster was avoided. And the kind of the -- and they go through what they don't like about the deal. New deal strips protections against predatory government behavior for most foreign investors. This is one of many things.</p><p>They -- the last line of the editorial is the new trade deal could have been worse given Mr. Trump's protectionist belief, but that's the best that we can say about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. They don't like him.</p><p>BREMMER: Well, look, it's certainly true that there were a lot of people though that are upset that they removed this Chapter 11 for dispute resolution. It provided a lot of multinational corporations a way to buy access to dispute resolutions, so they don't like it. That's the Wall Street Journal issue. But --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Among others.</p><p>BREMMER: You know, that's their main issue. Honestly, people that understand free trade that aren't playing partisan on this, aren't playing ideological, you know, don't have a problem with Trump particularly will all say, yes, Obama did this deal. This should be seen as a better deal. Hillary would be seen as a better deal. Jeb would be seen as better --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- the editorial board is largely positive on the President's economic policy --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREMMER: Well, they beat on him protectionism --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I would say they understand trade. They just don't understand that -- in the way that people who want the union protections which this new NAFTA deal is a huge handout to unions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREMMER: In Mexico. In Mexico, it's going to absolutely increase wages for Mexicans. It's going to unionize labor in Mexico. The American Labor Union --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREMMER: -- absolutely like that. They do. Well, but Trump, well, Trump said when he was running that he actually cared about the American worker. Now so far, you've seen tax benefits for the American worker, but most of those giveaways have been to wealthier people. This is actually a meaningful improvement that will impact the American worker and I mean I can understand why the Wall Street Journal would oppose that. But I don't think Trump necessarily cares.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- but 90 percent of workers got a higher or seeing higher paychecks this year --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BREMMER: Yes, of course --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- even though the journal is reporting that companies are not passing along the benefits of the tax cuts to employees --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREMMER: That was a journal --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: They did a survey at 1500 companies that showed only four percent are redirecting tax savings to budgets for bigger employee paychecks. But there's no doubt, people have more money in their pockets, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's what I meant is because of the tax cut. Their tax burden is lower for individuals --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREMMER: -- when I go and talk to Rand Paul or Marco Rubio, and ask them what they don't like about Trump. The number one thing is the budget. They hate the fact that we're spending a trillion dollars in deficit. They don't like to give away traditionally --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- economic growth.</p><p>BREMMER: Absolutely. They like the growth. They like lower tax for corporations, but they don't like the giveaways for the American workers. That's the problem --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- would say that. That Marco Rubio wants to essentially rob Social Security for family leave benefits and then he tries to sell it like that, oh, well, you're just taking money that we would have in the future. Well, but there's a giant hole in Social Security. Sorry. I don't mean to digress. But Marco Rubio getting religion on the debt and the deficit, and the budget, oh, please, and my name is Dolly Parton.</p><p>BARTIROMO: After this most recent year and a half we came is pushing like you say family leave and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- directing money that way.</p><p>BREMMER: All politics are really illogical and we're much more polarized today than we were five years ago, ten years ago. But the fact is we should all get together and say this is an improvement. The deal is better. It needed to be modernized. And by the way, now, allows the President if he wants to come together with allies more effectively to focus on the real challenge which is China.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BALBONI: That's my question. So what does this signal to China if you're sitting back there, Beijing is watching this, what's their position? Has - - do things change as a result of this deal?</p><p>BREMMER: They are changing a bit, you know, the Chinese strategy initially and you remember when Xi Jinping got up at Davos and say, I support free trade. I want to be a leader. I mean he was hoping that Trump was going to be hated by all the allies with this America first which means that the Chinese become the only ball game in town. Now, if Trump has now had a really good meeting with Shinzo Abe from Japan last week, he's gotten a new NAFTA deal done, he --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREMMER: -- with the Europeans, he's actually put things like on hold. The South Korean deal has not finalized, but its moved in a positive direction. Suddenly, the problem is with China and that -- and the Chinese don't like that at all absolutely believe that they're going to be more willing when Trump sits down with President Xi at the end of November, the G20 in Argentina that they're going to have more to offer the United States. Is it going to be enough?</p><p>Are we going to move to a better place? We'll see. But there's no question if you ask any multinational corporation, do you have a big problem with NAFTA or with the Chinese? They're telling you the Chinese and it's across the board. It's asymmetrical market access. It's stealing I.P., its cyberattacks, its, you know, the fact that they are state capitalist economy and they're about to be the largest economy in the world. We do need to address that. Trump shouldn't want to address that by himself.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And military aggression --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- and their military complex. There's no doubt about it.</p><p>BREMMER: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, and we just saw a little I don't know if you want to call it a fight, but in the South China Sea just yesterday.</p><p>BREMMER: Within 45 yards of American destroyer. That's right. The Chinese and Secretary Mattis canceled the trip because no Chinese officials were prepared to meet with him. They're worried about American --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: In fact, all of this is going to be on your new show. You've got a new show on WNET, GZERO World with Ian Bremmer.</p><p>BREMMER: All over the country. Watch it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good for you. What's going to be is it going to be about?</p><p>BREMMER: Well, the idea it's an international show and it's meant to really be nonpartisan. So I mean, you know, first few weeks we've got people like Governor Kasich, and Senator Coons, Victor Cha is on this week was is going to be Ambassador to South Korea. We also have puppets, international puppets, global leaders. You have to bring puppets to public television. There's a long timeline --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREMMER: -- and it's going to be fun. They're going to travel with me all over the world. I think we'll enjoy it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congrats. We will watch it. Thank you so much, Ian. Great to see you.</p><p>BREMMER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ian Bremmer joining us. Coming up, a scare on the tarmac passengers forced to evacuate after a fire erupts aboard a plane at JFK. We got the latest there. Then it takes a team, a crane, a tugboat, and dozens of volunteers come together to rescue a stranded whale. More on the incredible video. Check out that whale. We're back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A fire breaks out on a plane at New York's JFK Airport. Cheryl Casone with details now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: The video is incredible, Maria. Over 200 passengers on a Delta flight were evacuated after a fire broke out in one of the plane's wheels. Officials say Delta flight 420 to Ghana was already headed back to the gate because of a problem with their speed indicator when the brakes overheated. This video captured by port authority police shows firefighters putting out the blaze on the tarmac at JFK Airport last night.</p><p>Luckily, nobody was injured in this. Well, Amazon is boosting its minimum wage for all U.S. employees. Amazon Senior Vice President for Worldwide Operations Dave Clark announced the plan in a First on Fox business interview earlier today on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVE CLARK, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR WORLDWIDE OPERATIONS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE, AMAZON: We just announced a change to our Amazon minimum wage across the U.S. to $15 for all employees full-time, part-time, seasonal, holiday employees, everyone is going to be starting November 1st making 15 -- at least $15 an hour just in time for the holiday season.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, the wage hike expecting to benefit more than 350,000 Amazon workers. Government filing show that the median pay for an Amazon employee about 28,000 last year. Shares of Amazon stock to watch today was low in the premarket. Now, tiny bit higher just a fraction there up 2.70. And then Dunkin' has a new kind of cold brew on tap. It's an actual beer. It's called the Dunkin' Coffee Porter.</p><p>The company has partnered with Harpoon Brewery to bring customers a malt beer that's made with Dunkin's espresso blend coffee. It is now available across the Eastern part of the United States because the East Coast needs more beer options with coffee. So you're buzz and awake.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not good. Coming up, thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, the Phoenix Suns making a major announcement. I'll talk exclusively with the team's President and CEO, Jason Rowley of the Phoenix Suns is up next. And then attention Facebook users, hackers could be selling your log-in information on the dark web for as little as two dollars. Details coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Playing ball, PayPal and the NBA's Phoenix Suns teaming up in a brand-new jersey partnership that also aims to enhance the fan experience. Joining me now to explain in a Fox Business exclusive is the President and CEO of the Phoenix Suns, Jason Rowley. Jason, great to see you.

Tell us what you're going to be doing.</p><p>ROWLEY: So we are -- we're very excited to be announcing that PayPal is going to be our partner for our jersey patch which I have obviously extremely excited to be announcing today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But what is it going to mean? I mean how are -- how can fans use PayPal and get a better -- get our approach to paying for tickets, etcetera? Tell us how the partnership makes it easier for concessions, merchandise, etcetera.</p><p>ROWLEY: Absolutely. So what we're looking to do is to integrate PayPal and Venmo into our operations and if you think about from a sports teams perspective all the -- all the different touch points you have with a customer and a fan, and so buying merchandise, buying tickets utilizing PayPal credit for example to buy season ticket packages, being able to utilize Venmo for share partners. All of those opportunities are something that we are so excited to be integrating PayPal into our -- into our operations and it's going to be a fully integrated partnership and something that obviously is they're on our patch as our jersey partner.</p><p>That piece of it brings both of our brands together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this is the first -- this is the first sports deal that PayPal has done. You have a jersey with you with, right?</p><p>ROWLEY: I do. So I'd like to show it to you right here. It's the best -- that's what it looks like. Just absolutely a beautiful example of what a patch should be. Obviously, they're such a terrific partner and something that they're so excited to be part of this as well. You know, for us to be able to have a global brand like PayPal, that also has a local strong local commitment here to the Arizona community that something that was very important to us, and something that I know is very important to them as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean it's interesting because it's PayPal and you can do things on line and you can, you know, get concessions and you could get tickets quickly. It sort of increases the Suns' global reach?</p><p>ROWLEY: It really does and there's a couple of different pieces to it. If you really think about it, the NBA, and basketball really has become a global sport and you look at the NBA in terms of the number of players that have come from different countries just on our roster alone. We have a French player, a player from Jamaica, and a player from Croatia, and our head coach is from Serbia. So you look at that global nature and for us being able to expand the brand to a -- with a company like PayPal is really invaluable.</p><p>But really the critical point of this entire partnership is the focus on the fan and you did mentioned that this is the first sport sponsorship that PayPal has done, and really what brought us together was that commitment to making sure that customers have a seamless experience and have the type of experience where they don't even necessarily know that there's -- that they're not thinking about the payment. They're thinking about the game.</p><p>They're thinking about the action on the court, and not really having to worry about some of the frictions that have traditionally existed whether it be buying in an arena or even transacting with their team outside of the arena.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's great. I mean it makes things so much easier and I know it's all about the fans. We got to talk LeBron, come on, what effect is LeBron James' arrival on Los Angeles going to have on the western conference and the Suns specifically?</p><p>ROWLEY: Well, obviously, we've been big rivals with the Lakers for a lot of years and with our proximity to Los Angeles and all those -- all those great matchups and battles we've had over the years, LeBron obviously brings an entirely different element to the western conference which has always been a pretty difficult conference to fight through anyway. We got a lot of young talented guys in our roster and what I'm looking forward to seeing those guys matchup against LeBron when he comes here and some of the other powers in the west.</p><p>It's going to be a great NBA season with a lot of -- a lot of terrific storylines to follow and that just added one more element to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You would think so. What are the Suns saying about this?</p><p>ROWLEY: You know, for us, it's really about having the focus of these young guys, you know, we got number one pick in DeAndre Ayton coming off last season and he has really been phenomenal so far. Last night, we had a preseason game. He scored 24 points, had 10 rebounds, three blocks, and that's just in his first outing before he's just getting warmed up, so to see that kind of talent coming into the -- into the league and coming into our team is something that we're highly excited about and seeing, you know, what these great matchups look like.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. A lot of excitement at the Suns. We're going to be watching, Jason. Thanks so much. Good luck with the PayPal partnership.</p><p>ROWLEY: Thanks so much, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jason Rowley joining us there from the Phoenix Suns. Coming up, Costco among dozens of retailers now closing their doors on Thanksgiving Day. We will tell you who else is joining in coming up. Then the secrets to success, we will speak with the businesswoman who transformed her career from being broke to becoming a self-made success by the age of 30. Got to get this story. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, October 2nd, your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast: President Trump celebrating his trade victory in Washington, D.C. yesterday. The President said that the new deal set to replace NAFTA is good for everyone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: This landmark agreement will send cash and jobs pouring into the United States, and into North America, good for Canada, good for Mexico. Instead of jobs leaving for overseas, they will be returning back home.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President expects this deal with Mexico and Canada to be signed this November. Markets are under some selling pressure this morning, although we are well off of the lows of the morning, down just 50 points now on the Dow Industrials. Fractional loss expected at the start of trading. S&amp;P 500 basically flat, down three points, and the NASDAQ is down 17, a quarter of a percent. In Europe this morning, similar story, fractional losses but across the board, FT-100 down a third of a percent, CAC Quarante in Paris down two-thirds of a percent. Germany's DAX Index down two-thirds of a percent as well, 80 points lower in Germany. Asian markets mixed overnight, a holiday in China, Shanghai closed, but the Nikkei Average squeaked out a gain. Hong Kong was down 2-1/3 percent.</p><p>Well, the hits keep on coming. A new report says hackers are selling Facebook logins on the dark Web for as little as $2.00. Plus, Pepsi popping, the company beat expectations on earnings and revenue as we told you, earlier in the program, the soft drink maker making big bets on noncarbonated drinks in the past year, but the stock is taking a hit after the company cut its full-year guidance. That stock is down 1-1/2 percent. It is a marine miracle. Check this out, 30 volunteers banding together to save a beached humpback whale in Argentina. The incredible details coming up this morning.</p><p>But first this, the very latest on the Kavanaugh investigation, Democrats are now asking the FBI to interview two dozen witnesses as part of the probe. Blake Burman is at the White House with the details, and Blake, I say, \"witnesses\" in quotes.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Maria, good morning to you. A source familiar with the supplemental investigation tells Fox that President Trump over the weekend gave the FBI the green light to interview whoever they deem appropriate. In a sprawling news conference here at the White House yesterday in the Rose Garden, President Trump said that he believe this investigation should be open but also should come to an end soon. He was asked if the FBI should interview all three of Brett Kavanaugh's accusers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I imagine they're going to interview two, the third one I don't know much about, but it wouldn't bother me at all. But I want to interview -- I wanted to be done quickly because it's unfair to the family and to the judge, it's unfair -- it's so unfair to his kids and his wife.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: That third woman is Julie Swetnick who has since been interviewed by NBC News. She claims that Kavanaugh spiked drinks in high school and was present at a party where she was gang raped. Susan Collins one of the undecided Republican Senators is calling for the FBI to look into Swetnick's allegations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIE SWETNICK, BRETT KAVANAUGH ACCUSER: He was very aggressive, very sloppy drunk, very mean drunk. I saw him go up to girls and paw on them, try to, you know, get a little too handsy, touching them in private parts. I saw him try to sheep's clothing --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: In a speech on the Senate floor yesterday, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell compared the Kavanaugh process to McCarthyism, McConnell says that there will be a vote for Kavanaugh this week. But, Maria, this all appears to be subject to Collins, along with Republican Senators Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski, whether or not they are satisfied with this FBI investigation, and then after that, if they are comfortable or not with Kavanaugh. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Blake, thanks very much. Blake Burman at the White House this morning. I want to switch gears from let go to go getter in her newly-released book \"The Execution Factor\" Author Kim Perell shares the keys to success that helped her transform her career from broke at age 23 to self-made at age 30. Joining us right now is the author herself, Amobee CEO Kim Perell. Kim, great to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KIM PERELL, CEO, AMOBEE: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, this is an incredible story. We want to hear your story, let's cut to the chase, the secret to success is what in your view?</p><p>PERELL: Execution. Execution is the secret to success, it separates the dreamers from the doers. And of the last two decades of being an entrepreneur, a CEO, an executive, I found that execution is truly what separates success from failure.</p><p>BELL: But what about patience? Like, I can understand execution. You got to get out there and make things happen, but you don't make a business to $100 million in revenue overnight, right? So, there's got to be some patience along with the hard work and the dedication, right?</p><p>PERELL: It definitely -- there definitely does. There's five key traits of execution, they can all be learned: one, being resilient, because it is -- it is hard to start a company, it's hard to build a company, but in my experience, having that never-give-up attitude and having that resilience to keep going when there's challenges, has really been -- it's instrumental.</p><p>BALBONI: How about you give us an example, specific example during your life in the 23 to 30, where you had to show that resiliency once you hit the knock down.</p><p>PERELL: Yes. So, when I was 23, my company I worked for went bankrupt and I was left broke, unemployed, without a future, someone had to push delete on my entire life, and at that point, I didn't know what I was going to do. And at that -- you know, I thought coming from two entrepreneurial parents, I thought I would take advantage of the digital economy, the worldwide web and start my own company. So, it's really showing that resilience and getting back up after you've really hit rock-bottom and making sure that you can keep going, you know, long after other people would have got -- you know, given up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, you got to tell us more about this. You said you were broke at 23 and now you're a self-made millionaire at 30. How did you do it?</p><p>PERELL: A lot of hard work and a lot of execution. So, what I learned over --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What did you execute?</p><p>PERELL: So, I created a digital marketing company, and right -- you know, I was -- I graduated from college right after Yahoo! had gone public. So, it was a big time for -- you know, to be -- to be able to graduate and have the opportunity. Unfortunately, it was -- it was a -- it was a dot bomb era, so unfortunately a lot of companies had gone under and so did mine, and I found myself just not knowing what is next. And I think a lot of people don't know what's next, what's that blueprint for success, and that's where I wrote the book to help, you know, really define what the blueprint is for other entrepreneurs or other individuals that want to start a company, or have a great idea and how to actually get started, because it's really hard go from dreaming and sitting there and having great ideas to actually doing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, how did you raise the money?</p><p>PERELL: So, I -- well, the first company I raised from BC is my own company. When I started, I actually got it from my grandma, so I called my nanny at that time, and I asked her for $10,000 for -- you know, to make a bet on me, and unfortunately, she had no idea what the internet was at that time, so it's very early, but she did, and she made a bet on me, and that's why I wrote the book and started that -- started a fund, really, to invest in other entrepreneurs and make a bet on them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you started with $10,000 and a fund to invest.</p><p>PERELL: I -- well, actually, $10,000 in a company to invest from my nanny, grew that to $100 million, sold that company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. 100 million.</p><p>PERELL: And then --</p><p>BALBONI: 10,000, 100 million? Wowee.</p><p>PERELL: Yes. It's good return.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You paid your grandma back?</p><p>PERELL: I had definitely paid my grandma back, and I really wrote the book to help, you know, pay it forward, and paid to other entrepreneurs. So, I've invested in over 70 companies now, 14 which have been sold, and one that went public. So, I really feel that execution is the key to success.</p><p>BELL: And proceeds from the book are all going to your -- these ventures?</p><p>PERELL: Yes. Yes, the proceeds from the book are all going to fund other entrepreneurs as well, so it really truly is my passion, and looking to share it with others.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You said your parents were entrepreneurs, though, so you came by that through your upbringing, and that -- but that -- but a lot of people encounter problems with that when, like my parents, ran a wholesale grocery business that was in the family, and I wouldn't call them entrepreneurs. It was like they were just struggling to make ends meet. And to just -- to keep the business afloat. So, how do you -- if for people growing up, coming up just starting out, if their parents didn't instill that spirit in them, where do they go to find it? If not -- if not from inside themselves, if not internally.</p><p>PERELL: Yes, I feel very fortunate to have two parents that were entrepreneurs, but similar to your story, they were always looking to make ends meet. And so, having this blueprint and having the action items of how to create and start that company when you don't have that, every great leader that I know is a great reader. And so, giving them the opportunity to read great books, and that's what I did growing up as well is, you know, I learned through others' mistakes and others' failures and how to -- how to not repeat them. So, looking to really pass it on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great stuff. Congratulations, Kim. Thank you so much for sharing your story.</p><p>PERELL: Thank you so much. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you, Kim Perell. Breaking news right now from Tesla, the company is reporting that new production and delivery numbers, it delivered a total 83,500 vehicles in the third quarter. This is amid the company's production woes as we know. The automaker produced over 50,000 Model 3 cars, which of course, was the goal. Tesla shares this morning are flat up just a fraction.</p><p>Coming up, a warning for Facebook users, hackers could be selling your log- in info on the dark web. Details coming up. Then, a whale of tale. Check this out, a crane, a tugboat, and dozens of volunteers coming together to rescue a stranded whale in Argentina. The incredible video, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news from Tesla, the company reporting new production and delivery numbers this morning. It delivered a total of 83,500 vehicles in the third quarter, amid the company's production woes. The automaker produced over 50,000 Model 3 cars. Michael, your thoughts on this.</p><p>BALBONI: So, I happened to be a trustee in New York Power Authority, which is the largest utility in the United States, and on publicly-owned utility. And we have made tremendous investments in the electronic vehicle sector, but what we're finding ironically is that -- are the brakes on this program is the infrastructure to support an electric vehicle, that if you go talk to car manufactures and folks who actually fix cars, they don't have enough people who are trained, mechanically trained in electronic vehicle technology. So, as much as they're going to produce, there isn't necessarily the infrastructure to fix and keep these cars on the road.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's been -- that's been an issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, in terms of the Tesla numbers, this is right in line -- this is exactly what investors would want to hear given the recent settlement with Elon Musk's separate issue, but Tesla produced 53,239 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter. The company said in August it would produce between 50 and 55,000 Model 3s in the quarter. So, this is right where it needs to be.</p><p>BELL: Right. And it was -- it was pretty expected by Wall Street that this number was going to come out this week and it would be in line. Elon kind of alluded to it and the market was anticipating it, which is why you're not really seeing the stock react pretty significantly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pretty much priced in. Meanwhile, then there's Amazon, Amazon's Senior Vice President for Worldwide Operations, Dave Clark, speaking with me earlier this morning, about the company plans to boost the minimum wage to $15.00 an hour. That was a First on Fox Interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLARK: We just announced a change to our Amazon minimum wage across the U.S. to $15.00 for all employees, full-time, part-time, seasonal, holiday employees, everyone is going to be starting November 1st, making 15 -- at least $15.00 an hour just in time for the holiday season.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us to weigh in, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney. Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. It seems like a pretty smart move, to me, for a variety of reasons. Number one, there's pressure on Amazon for unionization, I think they're responding to that to some degree. Number two, it's a very tight labor market, you don't want to be short of workers for the holiday season, you got to entice them with $15.00 an hour. Number three, there's a great deal of criticism of Jeff Bezos for his wealth. It's now, what, $165 billion, he can't afford $15.00 an hour for the people who work for him? That's a strong argument. Number four, Bernie Sanders is going after Amazon for not paying a living wage, this answers that charge. And number five, isn't that good public relations right before the holiday season, right before we fire up our Amazon accounts and order everything under the sun? It's a very smart move, it's a very big deal from a very interesting company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the pressure was there, but I know that they responded to the pressure, but also, we are seeing wages move up, and it's nice to see them do it on their own.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes. It's a big deal. I mean, hundreds of thousands of people get this raise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. 250,000 people in the U.S.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stuart, great to see you. I'll see you in about 10 minutes. I know you'll have a lot more on it. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, join Stuart at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, T is for team and tugboat, you won't believe the crew it took to save the stranded whale. The incredible story, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Exposed Facebook users may have more to worry about. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines. Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria. So, hackers are selling Facebook log-ins for just $2.60 on the dark Web. We're not worth what we thought we were, I guess. This, according to some new research published by Money Guru. The report came just hours after Facebook revealed a massive data breach that compromised 50 million accounts. The research found that someone's entire online identity could be purchased for about $972. That would include access to online shopping accounts, entertainment services, and social media profile.</p><p>Meanwhile, a long time Facebook executive, Adam Mosseri, is going to become head of Instagram after its two founders abruptly resigned last week. Mosseri started at Facebook as designer back in 2008 before overseeing the newsfeed. He moved to Instagram in May to run the product division there. Shares of Instagram's parent company, of course, that is Facebook is trading lower by almost one percent in the premarket.</p><p>Well, remember when it was a big deal for stores to open on Thanksgiving Day to kick off Black Friday? Well, it seems the trend is now reversing, BestBlackFriday.com says this year's 60 retailers are going to be closed on Thanksgiving. Costco, Ikea, Sam's Club, Home Depot, and Lowe's are among the biggest names on the list. The site expects that list to grow actually. Last year, 57 percent of Americans surveyed, were against stores opening on Thanksgiving Day.</p><p>Well, First Lady Melania Trump is in Ghana this morning as part of her tour of Africa. First stop in her nearly week-long trip, she's also going to visit Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt. The White House says her focus is going to be on maternal and newborn care in hospitals, and children's education.</p><p>And then, finally, check this out, a stranded humpbacked whale sent back to the ocean safely after an intense rescue operation was underway in Argentina. Dozens of people worked for nearly 30 hours to rescue this whale. Now, their first efforts was using that crane to move the whale back into the sea failed, but later, they pulled the animal back from the Atlantic Ocean, Maria, they used a tugboat. And you know, we've seen these reports, some (INAUDIBLE) aren't always successful, but this time, it was, and I think it was well worth it for the people on the ground.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he was put back in the wild?</p><p>CASONE: Yes, he made it safely out. Again, this always isn't the case with these stories, but this time, it worked out for the best.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can I just point out one story in The Wall Street Journal? It is about making it safely out, animals that escaped butcher shops and abattoirs in New York City, wind up at farm sanctuary up in Watkins Glen, New York, and I know they have their annual fundraiser coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Such a nice story.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, this -- like a bull gets -- frankly, the bull gets loose in the streets of Brooklyn, and they lasso him and tranquilized him, he escaped an abattoir in the borough, and they -- he get sent to lead the luxury life up at this farm sanctuary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, awesome for farm sanctuary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, what happens to the horse?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: They put him -- they put him back to work, I think, at the racetrack.</p><p>BALBONI: Back to the racetrack.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Final thoughts from our all-star panel. And we're following three tracks today, we've got the beginning of the fourth-quarter earnings, of course, expected to be strong. We got the Kavanaugh situation, the showdown to the Supreme Court continuing, we understand there is going to be a vote on Friday. And, of course, then we also have NAFTA, a new NAFTA, USMCA. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, the NAFTA news is great for country, Canada, Mexico, the economy and future of trade deals that will be put together. I've been a naysayer on the tariffs and naysayer on the steel and aluminum tariffs. Those don't go away, but this is a win, pure and simple.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see what it does for the economy. Lindsey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Odds are going well.</p><p>BELL: Right. Things are going really well. And on trade, I would just say that Pepsi came out, they did lower guidance, it was because of the dollar not because of trade and input costs going up because they are, but they're also able to take pricing, so that's important to note.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stock is down 1-3/4 percent.</p><p>BALBONI: So, the nation is transfix by the Kavanaugh hearing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BALBONI: And it ought to be reminded -- the entire process should be reminded that it's not just about the judge, just about the Supreme Court, it's about this quest for power, it's about what it means to our constitutional review capabilities, and the politicization of this court. And there's going to be so many different impacts as a result of this, regardless of how it actually winds up. Now, that's the thing that I think people should really recognize. This is a raw, take no prisoners fight for power.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I thought it was really interesting, Dagen, that 86 percent of GOP women back Brett Kavanaugh. 86 percent?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because they see the tactics that the left is using, they're not doing it for -- the Democrats are not doing this for women, they're doing it for their own political power, and to push their own narrative, and to - - ahead of midterm elections, that's very clear why would -- why would Dianne Feinstein and her staff sit on a letter that an accuser against Brett Kavanaugh sent to them and they had since late July, and then they sat on it until it was revealed in mid-September that Dianne Feinstein and her staff had this information.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll go one step further, why did Dianne Feinstein help Ford get a lawyer? Is that customary? The ranking member of the committee helps the accuser get a lawyer?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then -- and then sat in front of Brett Kavanaugh, I think, it was August 20th in their -- in their sit-down and never brought this up?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But to the point, again, the narrative also that the President is trying to stonewall, the FBI looking to these allegations, that is simply not true. There are no restrictions on who the FBI can question and even President Trump said yesterday himself that he's just waiting to find out like everybody else, what the FBI turns up, period.</p><p>BELL: It is definitively going to motivate voters, I think, this midterm election, for sure. It's a hot button for a lot of people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just about 35 days away. Great show, everybody, thank you so much.

Earnings in focus, it will be the busiest week for the second  quarter reporting season.  One-third of the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 set  to post results this week.  We look at what he numbers and guidance about  the state -- the United States economy.  We get the reading -- the first  reading on second quarter on gross domestic product -- economic growth on  Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Look at these futures right here right now.  Three-point gain on the Dow  futures.  Markets searching for direction after the Dow and S&amp;P managed to  eke out small gains last week.  Although that was your Friday close, it was  some small across the board on Friday.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And then moving on, let's check on Europe.  We have declines across the  board.  But contained the biggest loser the CAC Quarante in France down  half about half of one percent right now.  In Asia overnight, it was mixed  markets, the Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng heading higher, the Nikkei  and KOSPI in South Korea suffering losses.</p><p> Tragedy in Toronto, the death toll rising in last night's deadly shooting  rampage.  A gunman killing at least two and injuring a dozen others.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I heard at least 20 shots in intervals, you know,  clipping spent, reloading, clipping spent.  I saw at least four people shot  here by the fountain.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is a street where people walk every day to go to  the groceries to have dinner, to have an ice cream, sit in the square,  enjoy their summer.  And it is absolutely devastating.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The latest as authorities work to find a motive.  War of words.   President Trump threatening Iran with severe consequences if that nation  does not take a cautious tone with the United States.  And unexpected  change at the top of FiatChrysler.  The automaker replacing CEO Sergio  Marchionne after he suffered complications from recent surgery.  What the  change means for the future of the company.  </p><p> Making a private call with a superhero twist.  One company creating a  private cubicle with a Superman theme.  For the first time in decades, oh,  EPA chief Scott Pruitt now gone, could have gotten that phone booths in his  office instead of the one that he's had taxpayer for.  All of that and so  much more coming up this morning.  CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell.</p><p> Look who it is, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.</p><p> SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Good morning.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Lee Carter, the President of Maslansky and Partners.  Sean  Spicer has a new book.  There you go.  We'll talk about it.</p><p> SPICER:  And you've got a copy of it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It's not signed.  I don't know what's wrong (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> SPICER:  It will be.  It will be signed.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It called a briefing.  We're going to talk about to Sean about  it.  Coming up, politics to press and the President.  And maybe the  President will tweet some this hour and we can get your instantaneous  response. </p><p> SPICER:  Probability is high.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  All right.  He's already been tweeting this morning.  So, Mr.  President, let's ramp that up to our top story this hour on trade with  China.  President Trump will host a White House event showcasing American  products from all 50 states today following his threats to impose tariffs  on all exports out of China and to the U.S.  We're talking more than $500  billion worth of annual imports.</p><p> Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin amplifying the threats saying he \"would --  he wouldn't minimize\" the chance of this actually happening.  And adding  that.  If Europe believes in free trade, the U.S. is ready for a deal.   Joining me now is Ohio Congressman, Jim Renacci.  A member of the House  Ways and Means Committee, House Budget Committee.  Congressman, first did I  pronounce your name correctly?  </p><p> REP. JIM RENACCI (R), OHIO:  You did.  Renacci, that's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  All right.  So what is your take on President Trump's trade  threats and have you heard concerns from your constituents?  </p><p> RENACCI:  Well, it's a mixed bag.  As I talk talked to my constituents they  always say to me, look, we're a little concerned but we want you supporting  the President.  And it's interesting I've had everybody from soybeans, you  know, the agriculture industry into my office to manufactures.  Just last  week and I always say to him, what do you want me to tell President because  I have opportunity to sit with him and what would you rather mew saying?  </p><p> They go, well, we're concerned but we want to you support him.  We want you  -- we realize, you know, we have to go through this process.  It's amazing  because you can't get a straight answer even soybean manufacturer, the  growers, I said to them, now seriously, tell me because they come in and  they say they're concerned.  I said, so what -- so what would your -- if  you had a chance to sit down with him what would you say?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But their business is being hurt though because they -- because  the concern but once people start feeling a real world impact on their  livelihoods, it might be different, right? </p><p> RENACCI:  Well, they are feeling it, they told me they're feeling it but  they also understand the need to be able to go through this.  They  understand the President's negotiating.  That's what I tell them.  We're in  a negotiations phase, let's get through these negotiations.  I've had an  opportunity to sit with the President car where he says, look, I'm worried  about children and grandchildren.</p><p> And at some point in time, you know, we need to make sure that we're  working through this and give me some time and that's what I tell them.  </p><p> SPICER:  How much time do you think that will give him?  </p><p> RENACCI:  You know, it's going to be interesting.  I say that I asked that  question too last week and they said -- I said, how much time do you want  to give them?  And they said, well, let's look at, you know, four, five,  six months and we where we're at.  So that's ---</p><p> SPICER:  Because it feels like if you don't do anything, they suffer the  consequences of Chinese economic policies.  But if you do something that's  some short-term pain and I think that's where -- trying to figure out where  that balance is.  </p><p> RENACCI:  Well, I was telling them short-term pain, a long-term gain.  I  mean, that's like --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SPICER:  Right.</p><p> RENACCI:  And that's like anything else.  We have to go be willing to do  that.  </p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  When you were -- we were just  talking to Gordon earlier and he was saying, this isn't going to be short- term pain, this could be 10, 20 years, it's a long game the way that the  Chinese play.  </p><p> RENACCI:  Well, and the truth of it is, we have a long game already because  the Chinese have been doing this to us for so many years.  So now it's time  to go through this process.  And look, the most powerful message I heard  from the President one time was when he said to me, I don't want our  children and grandchildren on their knees begging in the future.  We have  to be willing to work through this.  </p><p> BELL:  Well, I think you saw that in the poll -- the Wall Street Journal  poll that came out that people aren't necessarily happy with how he's  dealing with trade but his overall rating is going up because I think that  the stock market and also, you know, manufacturers, soybean growers and the  like, the whole country thinks that this is a negotiating tactic and it's  going to end well, but the problem is when does it end?  </p><p> CARTER:  Yes.  I think it's also really, really important point though to  say can you can be both be concerned and want to support the President at  the same time.  And I think that a lot of people have missed that because,  you think that if you support a President you support him blindly.  And I  don't think that's the truth.  I think most people -- for a lot of people  somewhere in the middle depending on the issue.  </p><p> SPICER:  Well, I think that people have been told for a long time that  policies going to change and they finally see the President fighting for  them willing and they're willing to give them a little bit of latitude to  see where this thing ends up.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Listen, I have been from breathe one, very concerned about these  tariffs that have been slapped on starting with washing machines but then  particularly steel and aluminum tariffs and the retaliation that we've  gotten from some of our trading but most important trading partners and  allies.  But the messaging, I want to hit on this, because the messaging  from day one when Peter Navarro was on this program quizzing me.</p><p> When I wasn't on set about how much is a cost of six pack of beer going to  go up.  And the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial last week saying  Peter Navarro says the harm is a rounding error and their take was -- well,  he is out of touch because there are a number of -- there is a pipeline  builder down in Texas that wanted a steel -- a waiver from the steel --  wanted a steel tariff exemption in other company -- another pipeline  producer as well.</p><p> They didn't get them.  And it's going to cost -- it's going to hurt because  they're going to delay investment in -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SPICER:  -- construction industry as well in term of the cost of whether  it's a beam or a screw.  Things are starting to go up and that's costing  people money.  The question I think that we're just asking the Congressman  is how long and how long will tolerate.  They want the fight, they've seen  Chinese economic policies, adversely affect our economy, our workers too  long and they're willing to give the President I think some latitude for a  while.</p><p> But the question is going to be how long. </p><p> RENACCI:  Well, I say the same thing but I always tell them let's judge  this President.  You get a chance to a judge the President in a couple more  years in election.  So let's judge him then, let's not judge him today.   Let's let them go through negotiations.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you guys, well, people go to the polls to reelect you or not  come November and on that note let's talk about tax cuts 2.0 which the  House is working on, revitalizing the economy, the second round, a big part  of the GOP's plan to try and retain control of the House.  Here is what  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise told Maria yesterday morning on \"SUNDAY  MORNING FUTURES.\"  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  The plans to continue  focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth,  and then locking it in.  We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes,  we're going to make the tax cuts permanent.  That bill Chairman Brady, his  committee are already working on.  We just did a jobs 3.0 bill.</p><p> A bill to provide more regulatory relief and do some things that will help  create more jobs and rebuild the middle class.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is it enough for you as people head to the polls if the House  passed that?  And the Senate already showing resistance to it.  </p><p> RENACCI:  Well, I can tell you in Ohio, tax 1.0 is working.  Companies are  now reinvesting, I had a company went from 70 to 140 employees already.  I  have companies who are talking about expanding.  They're also giving  bonuses out to their employees, they're raising wages.  So as I travel,  Ohio people are very happy.  Now, if we can lock that in which is important  because the only reason it's not locked in its gimmicks in Washington.</p><p> I mean, I'm a business guy.  I always chuckle at some of these little  gimmicks we have.  We couldn't lock in it because of this rule or that  rule.  So let's lock it in, let's make sure people have certainty and  predictability.  I think that's going to be the second thing.  And also on  2.0, we're going to be talking about savings.  So I think that's another  issue.  These -- a lot of people back in Ohio are now getting more money in  their pockets.</p><p> We need to make sure they can save it and use it for their -- whether it's  education, whatever.  So those -- that's what 2.0 is going to be all about.   I think it's -- can be best explained that way when I travel the state.  </p><p> SPICER:  I think the other thing is -- I mean, look, elections are binary  choice and it's not just what Jim Renacci is for, it's what Sherrod Brown  isn't for.  And that's a thing -- it's a big contrast that Ohio voters are  going to face.  It's not just are you going to keep more, we're going talk  about economic expansion, it's what Sherrod Brown isn't going to do to help  Ohio businesses and families.  I mean, that's pretty much. </p><p> RENACCI:  Well, that's true too.  And I mean, it's polar total opposites  because I'm running against somebody who didn't support the tax cuts bill.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Not one Democrat voted for the tax cut so -- but then they were  upset.  You heard this from Nancy Pelosi but then they're upset that the  individual tax cuts weren't permanent and they keep -- or they're now  worried about the debt and the deficit all of a sudden, so which is it?   And you don't get -- you don't get to say because she didn't vote.  </p><p> RENACCI:  Right.  And, again, here is the issue for me.  I came here as a  businessman and now I look at the numbers, 85 percent of our deficit or  things unrelated to the tax cut and the tax cut actually if it grows the  economy which it's doing and we get sustained growth over three percent,  then it will pay for itself and it will grow the economy and it will pay  the debt down. So that's the key.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Speaking of which, we're going to get the first reading on  second quarter growth.   And the -- it's going to be likely north of four percent.  The Wall Street  Journal estimate is 4.2, the GDP now from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank  is 4-1/2, they're whisperer is coming out of White House, it's going to be  north 4-1/2.  But again, does that stick with people.  Does that -- the  number resonate or are they already feeling that?  </p><p> BELL:  I think they're feeling it.  We've discussed it earlier in the show,  the consumers, the everyday people, working class people are out there  feeling the benefits in their paychecks, they're feeling better but, you  know, we have the most jobs available out there with the lowest jobless  rate that we've seen in almost 20 years.  The consumers feeling good,  confidence remains high so -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And you see that in this Wall Street Journal NBC News poll that  found half of registered voters approve of the President handling of the  economy.  His highest mark on that question in the survey.  That same poll  found that President's approval rating edged higher even during the week,  Lee Carter, when he came under criticism for his handling of that Helsinki  Summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p> The President's approval rating rose to 45 percent.  That is the highest of  his presidency.  </p><p> CARTER:  It is.  And there's two reasons why.  I think number one, we can't  forget the importance of the Supreme Court to voters out there.  I think  Republicans will support the President almost no matter what because that  is so, so, so important to them.  And the other thing is, I think Democrats  really blew it big in the way that they responded to Helsinki and the  President's comments.</p><p> Because well, a lot of people were rightfully upset by what the President  did say.  He later tried to correct himself.  I think that the hysteria  that happened over that actually made people more likely defend the  President that anything else.  So the Democrats really think and the media  really needs to learn how to balance their coverage and say, well, we might  be concerned, we don't have to get hysterical over it if they won't make  any moves here.</p><p> It's also important to know though that even though these are -- these are  pretty high rates, this isn't necessarily significant in that other  presidents have had higher approval ratings at the same point, but I think  it's telling.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Congressman, but we have -- potentially Vladimir  Putin coming to the United States for another summit right before people go  to the polls in November.  Are you concerned about that? </p><p> RENACCI:  Not at all.  I think this is -- again, the President has to be  able to negotiate even with some of the people that are enemies of us and I  think that's the key.  So we will continue to go and as we said, this  confidence is going to continue to build.  I want to go back whether you're  firefighter or police, your 401(k)s and your pensions are going up and  that's positive.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) thank you, Congressman Renacci.  Still to come, an  unexpected leadership shake-up at FiatChrysler.  The details are the  automaker's longtime CEO is stepping down due to health issues.  Plus,  Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings this morning.  We break  down those numbers.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  I'm Nicole Petallides live on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  The Dow futures this morning only slightly to the downside, down  six of the Dow Jones Industrial average.  And it's earning season, the big,  big week here, 170 S &amp; 500 companies coming out with numbers.</p><p> We'll kick it off with two that have reported this morning including  Halliburton and Hasbro. So Halliburton is looking to downside to the tune  of about to 1.1 percent while Hasbro is jumping 10percent.  The Halliburton  in particular, it was in line earnings per share, that's why you're seeing  a little bit of selling, everybody is getting so used to be so far this  season.  The estimates were 20.5 percent growth year-over-year for  earnings.</p><p> And in fact, we've seen most of these companies beating, so we've seen over  21percent but Halliburton did have quarterly revenue on the rise, higher  oil prices and more rigs at work.  Hasbro as I noted up 10-1/2 percent  there, topping and soaring as it handily beat those analysts' estimates for  profit and sales by a wide margin.  </p><p> At then we'll watch for Alphabet, Google after the bell today.  That will  be key, not only will they watch for consistent revenue gains but also some  of those other areas, apps, pixel smartphones, licensing also cloud  computing stock just down a quarter of one percent right now.  So keep it  right here because coming up, former FBI Director James Comey is getting  political once again.</p><p> Why he is urging Democrats to not lose their minds and rush to the  socialist left.  It's all ahead.  Plus, spice up your office space.   Details on the new cubicle inspired by Superman that costs over $8,000.   That is all later this hour.  Keep it right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Let's kick off this new week with slightly lower  futures, five -- four-point loss on the Dow futures right now.  But again,  the direction this week will be decided by earnings.  Alphabet, the parent  of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter all set to report quarterly  results this week.  Alphabet kicks things off after the close today.  The  Google parent company reporting after the bell.</p><p> Joining is now beyond sport global ambassador, Fox News contributor, my  dear friend, John Layfield.  John, your expectation for earnings going into  this week?  </p><p> JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think we have another great earning  season.  The last earnings season that we had was the best earnings beat in  25 years since the early 1990s.  We're seeing so far a third of S&amp;P 500  companies reported, 87 percent have had earnings expectations that had an  upside on those earnings, the estimates that they've had.  So it's going to  be interesting to see what we're going to see these earnings.</p><p> Especially when you have automakers reporting this week.  We have G.M. and  Ford which I own both reporting.  They've already have commodity inflation  problems.  So interesting to see how whether hedge for these tariffs going  forward and how these tariffs are going to affect projections going  forward.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, some other companies to watch are these industrial  companies.  I think Whirlpool, Harley-Davidson or two of the names out with  earnings this week.  We will be listening for those even 3M listening for  the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs.  And any kind of supply chain  disruption these companies are experiencing.  </p><p> BELL:  Absolutely.  We're seeing these companies, 94 percent of the  industrial companies that have reported have beat on both the top and the  bottom line.  The stocks are reacting really well, the question, John, is I  don't know if you have a thought on this, it feels like the question is, is  -- are orders being pulled forward?  Is the second quarter coming in  significantly better than expected?</p><p> Because people are trying to get ahead of tariffs and that's what's causing  raised guidance for full year or are we just doing better than we thought?  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  That's a great question, Lindsey.  And it's a little bit of  both.  We are seeing earnings pulled forward, people getting around these  tariffs.  So you're seeing lot of stuff shift early because of this, but  you are seeing better-than-expected.  We're going to have a -- look like a  four percent GDP.  That's going to be a little inflated because people are  getting these orders out there ahead of these tariffs.  </p><p> The earnings season this year, I mean, this is the dichotomy of this  administration.  We're going to have 20 percent earnings a gain this  quarter.  About 35 to 40 percent of that comes from these tax cuts.  So the  administration has done a great job in spurring this economy that is  already long in the tooth in this bull market to revitalization.  The  problem is all 100 percent.  Now black cloud is these tariffs. </p><p> And what can happen if the potential trade war happens.  It could negate  everything that happens with these tax cuts.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But so far, John, it looks like the markets are giving the White  House, giving administration some breathing room on how long do you think  that can last?  I mean to your point, we're going to get guidance this week  from some major industrial companies, the automakers about any potential  fallout?  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  I think it starts until it starts significantly hurting, you  know, it's easy when you talk about a potential trade war.  We're actually  in a trade war right now no matter what level of that trade war we're in,  we're actually in one right now.  You look at Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh, Salt  Lake, they're all reducing headcount right now in their newspaper business  because of the tariffs that we have on Canadian paper.</p><p> So you're starting to see problems right now, you see soybeans, you see  livestock right now, you see a glut of that going on because we have two  problems.  We had a huge amount of livestock produced this year and we also  have these tariffs that are coming also.  We have a glut.  Until you start  seeing these -- Americans start being hurt which I think we're going to  start seeing, I think you give the President a pass on this, this is  negotiations.</p><p> But this is sticking and matched next to (INAUDIBLE) and say, hey, I'm  going to blow up everything if you don't agree.  It is a dangerous,  dangerous game we're playing right now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  John, how do you structure portfolio around that?  Because again  you're not getting paid that much to own fixed income here.  How do you  allocate money?  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  I think dividend stocks become to de facto bonds like they had  been for the past several years.  I know interest rates are rising but  that's still a play.  Look, you have problems in the E.U.  If Englands are  upset of the E.U., which it looks like they're probably going to do with  probably a hard Brexit, that takes out a huge amount of fees going to E.U.   The E.U. looks like it could break up especially we started losing smaller  parts like Italy and somebody else follows.</p><p> You look at the problems in China right now, the U.S. stock market is still  the place to be and I think dividend stocks are going to be the safe play  going forward because I don't think people know what's going to happen with  this market.  This market should be significantly higher.  This economy is  absolutely on fire.  The only black cloud right now is the trade tariffs  and that's why I will stay with dividend stocks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll say this ahead of the head of the European  Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker is going to be at the White House on  Wednesday, maybe you get some positive developments out of that meeting?   You never know.  </p><p> LAYFIELD:  He doesn't have high expectations according to people around him  but you're right, we could have something, a big upside surprise come out  of that.  I wouldn't be surprised if the E.U. says, you know, we're just  going to drop the 10 percent tariffs on cars and then see what the  President does because it's really about those tariffs then the President  will drop it and this trade war could end at least with our friends here.</p><p> The problem we have with Europe right now is they're now negotiations deals  with our trading partners that are our neighbors in Canada and Mexico.   This could be long-term structural damage if we don't get in front of this  right now and try to work out something with Mr. Juncker when he visits  this week.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  That tariff that we have on light trucks that are  imported, it's a 25 percent tariff, it's called the chicken tax among  people I grew up with because it was retaliation to this fight we had with  Europe over poultry in 1964 I think.  So, you think tariffs can't hang  around?  That one has been around since before I was born.  Thank you,  John.  And before you were born too, I should point out.  John Layfield.</p><p> LAYFIELD:  Correct.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Always great to see you, my friend.  Coming up.  Escalating  tensions with Iran.  The new warning from President Trump after Iran's  leader says any conflict with the country would lead to the mother of all  wars.  Plus, a surprise shake-up at FiatChrysler.  Details on the  unexpected changes after the automaker's long-time CEO steps down ahead.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It  is Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  One big week  for earnings, one-third of the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 reporting, this  week, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, all on deck.  </p><p> This afternoon's big reveal will be from Alphabet, the parent company of  Google.  Take a look at how the stock is premarket.  Let's take a look at  the Futures across the board, the Dow and S&amp;P did manage to eke out small  gains last week, and they're up to -- they are in the green right now.</p><p> The NASDAQ, 100, the Futures there are lower as the NASDAQ was, last week,  slipping.  In Europe, markets are headed lower this morning as well, losses  across the board.  The CAC Quarante in France, the biggest loser down half  of one percent.</p><p> The Asian markets finishing mixed, the Nikkei ending down more than one  percent, one and a third percent, to be exact, the KOSPI in South Korea  also losing almost nine-tenth of one percent.  </p><p> President Trump tweeting out to the president of Iran last night, with a  firm warning, saying not to threaten the U.S. or else, and former FBI  Director James Comey, cautioning the Dems on twitter.  He says, don't vote  for whatever socialist -- Democratic socialist, whatever they are calling  today.</p><p>FiatChrysler stock almost three percent in the red in premarket trading on  the sudden replacement of the company's well-known CEO, Sergio Marchionne,  over the weekend.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SUPERMAN:  This is a job for Superman.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And in celebration of Superman's 88th birthday, one company's  got a box for you.  Now, all is a Superman themed cubicle, modelled after  the same telephone booth that the Man of Steel used to get changed in, with  a few modern perks, red cape, not included.</p><p> To our top story this half hour, President Trump giving a stern warning to  Iran, escalating a war of words with the country's leader, Kristina  Partsinevelos is live at the White House with the very latest.  Good  morning, Kristina.</p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   And you are right, the escalation has continued, the rhetoric between both  countries Iran and United States, why is this happening, why is the  President tweeting in all caps?  </p><p> This comes after the president of Iran gave a speech on Sunday to his  population, and he said, that if any conflict bn between the United States  and Iran, occurs, then it would be the mother of all wars.  </p><p> President Trump took to twitter yesterday, in all capitals, when in the  online world, essentially means yelling, he wrote, never, ever threaten  United States again, or you will suffer consequences the likes of when few  throughout history have ever suffered before.  We are no longer a country  that will stand for your demented words or violence and death.  Be  cautious.</p><p> And when I say the rhetoric has continued to escalate, you know that the  United States has pulled out of Iran nuclear deal in 20 -- or 2015 Iran  nuclear deal in May.  Just last month, the United States said that they  were going to impose sanctions against any exports leaving Iran.  </p><p> This comes at a time when the country in Iran is suffering.  The economy is  not doing so well and that had a huge effect on the price of oil.  Today,  we're seeing a trade just around $68.92.  But over the past two months,  you've seen it fluctuate quite a bit and climb higher because of the lack  of supply around  the globe, especially coming from Iran.</p><p> Iran has retaliated saying that they too will block any type of shipments  coming out of there.  But so far, it's just back and forth rhetoric between  the two countries.  And it's only Monday morning, 8:00 a.m. and we're  getting all this news.  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kristina, thank you for delivering it to us, Kristina  Partsinevelos, at the White House for us.  Sean, I want to get your  reaction to the President's tweet, especially since it seems to be one of  the --you know, message control is the most impossible thing to do.  </p><p> They're in the White House, because again, that's the President, tweeting  out.</p><p> SPICER:  I mean, the beauty is everyone knows talks about transparency.  I  mean, you are hearing directly from him what he thinks, when he tweets like  this.  </p><p> And if I were President Rouhani, I would take caution in making some of  those outlandish statements, threatening United States, because I think  this president doesn't like to be looked at like that and he will take  swift indecisive action.  </p><p> So, Rouhani may forget that we can all hear what he says, when he does it  in the modern world, but that was a mistake on his part. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Iran was still firing, firing missiles after the Iran nuclear  deal was done with death to America, death to Israel.</p><p> SPICER:  And I don't think this President -- this President-- you know,  Kristina mentioned it, but he -- this -- the Iran nuclear deal is something  that is he is consistently talked about being a bad deal, and if Iran ups  the game, he is going to do something. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And now, Europe has to come to us to get -- basically  get waivers from sanctions that we are preparing to impose on Iran.  </p><p> The President tweeted again, this morning, on Russia, when you hear the  fake news talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all  that I gave up, remember, I gave up nothing, we merely talked about future  benefits for both countries.  Also, we got along very well, which is a good  thing, except for the corrupt media.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sean, your take on that?  Again, the fact that it was discussed  that the likes of Michael McFaul, the former ambassador to Russia, that  Putin says to our President, why I want to interview these Americans.  The  fact that that even came up was bothersome to many.</p><p> SPICER:  Well, but, again, I don't -- part of what we don't know is what  exactly was said, the context it was said, and what Trump did or did not  respond.  I think the White House has made it very clear that the idea that  Russia would interrogate any United States citizen, never mind the former  ambassador, is fairly laughable.</p><p> And I think it's good that they clarified these kinds of things because  it's not -- I mean, the idea that a former government official would be  interrogated by any country, never mind Russia in Putin, is something that  we should be very clear about what our nation's position is. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If Putin -- assuming that Putin does come to the United States  right before the midterm elections and there was a second summit on U.S.  soil, be sure that there will be people in that tete-a-tete.</p><p> SPICER:  Well, I think the President is seeing the reaction that he saw  walking out of that summit.  I think they're going to come in to any kind  of future summit with their A game.</p><p> CARTER:  Do you think that --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, you are saying that wasn't the President's A game?</p><p> SPICER:  No, I think that they -- after meeting with Kim, I think they  looked at the model and they were -- there was largely a lot of praise  coming from that, how the President had handled that meeting, how the  reaction had been in terms of him engaging with Kim, talking about  denuclearization in the peninsula.</p><p> And I think that this Helsinki summit seemed to follow a very similar  pattern.  I don't think that they fully appreciated the reaction that Putin  would get, versus Kim.</p><p> CARTER:  I also think the President didn't help himself with some of the  statements that he made, following, right?  Where he was almost -- seemed  like he was (INAUDIBLE) more with Russia than --</p><p> SPICER:  Sure.  And I think it's a good thing that they went out and  clarified.</p><p> CARTER:  Now, how do you think -- what do you think about his  clarification?  Do you think that was enough?  Do you think people buy it?</p><p> SPICER:  You know, so far, it seems like they do, I think it's important.   I mean, look, he has been -- it's good that he clarified it.  And, you  know, I -- talk -- there is an intensity to this White House of how they  cover it -- how they cover this president unlike ever before.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The (INAUDIBLE) and the media.</p><p> SPICER:  The media.  And that's why I wrote a book that literally goes  through a lot of these big moments and how -- thank you, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm holding - I was going to ask you about this.</p><p> SPICER:  OK.  What I mean, I think that there is a level of intensity in  scrutiny that in past administrations, they haven't had to face.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  True.  But it's called the briefing politics, the press and the  President.  I would say, you put the words, the press, on the front cover  of a book, that doesn't really help sales, my friend.</p><p> SPICER:  Well, I will -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  People hate the --</p><p> SPICER:  But I think part of what people want to know is, what is it really  like inside?  And that's the thing.  You see one thing on television.  You  get to see us sitting here at the table.  What's going on behind-the- scenes?  </p><p> And part of the reason that I wrote the book is that the press gets to have  their say.  They get to put in paper, or put on television what they want  you to see, what they want you to read.  What I wanted to do is take  readers behind-the-scenes and say, this is what's actually happening when - - that you don't see.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But -- is it safe to say that this is a President, this is a  man, the leader of the country who if you are trying to craft a message,  you can't control the message, because he is going to say what he wants to  say, and you are more crisis response or just a respond --</p><p> SPICER:  I was going to say -- I wouldn't say no, because -- I mean, right,  I think you are clearly in response, he is the leader.  </p><p> And that is a very different role than I normally played many -- most press  people where your job is to craft and execute a message and a plan.  This  president leads the way in every one of those fronts.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There hasn't been any lasting fallout for the President or even  the White House.  I would argue for anything that on Twitter.  And even --</p><p> SPICER:  No, in fact, I wouldn't.  But that's probably why one of the  reasons he won.  I mean, he has been -- and I write about all of these  instances were any other political candidate would have been left for dead.   I mean, I guarantee you, if a candidate for office went to Lee and said,  poll what I just did.  </p><p> It would come back and say, you're dead.  Get out of the race.  And what  this President, every time, not only picked himself up, but in most cases,  came up stronger.</p><p> CARTER:  And it's part of -- I mean, it is part of who he is, right?  I  think people wanted somebody who is going to go down, shape things up and  do things differently than it's ever been before.  And so the fact that he  does this and continues to do it, I think, just reinforces that message.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get to Jim Comey, yes, Jim Comey, the midterm  elections, three months away, Former FBI Director, Comey, issuing a warning  to Democrats.  </p><p> He tweeted this, yesterday, Democrats, please, please don't lose your minds  and rush to the socialist left.  This president and his Republican Party  are counting on you to do exactly that.  America's great middle wants  sensible, balanced, ethical leadership.</p><p> But where is the sensible balanced ethical candidate who's running for the  Democrat?</p><p> SPICER:  Well, his tweet's a little too late.  I mean, that run to the  left, already happened.  So, he's a little late on his tweet.  I mean,  that's the problem.  They are now having a -- they're tripping over  themselves, to go further and further to the left.</p><p> They are not progressives.  I mean, they are now like Bernie Sanders, was a  socialist running for president and was -- at one point, viewed as the  extreme.  He's now become the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and you  have to go further and further to the left, to get traction.</p><p> CARTER:  You know, I just wonder, though, I can't -- I look at all of this  and I think I don't necessarily believe that it's a whole of the Democrats  that are going left.  I think that it's a socialists, the far left, it's  the only part of the party that has a message that resonates to people  because they are talking about things that matter most.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're lying to the American people.</p><p> CARTER:  Whether or not --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know that they're absolutely lying.  </p><p> CARTER:  They're saying something besides resist.</p><p> SPICER:  To your point, I mean, you can talk about all of these things at  some point.  They never tell you about the price tag.  They never talk  about the economic consequences that these policies would have on our  economy.  </p><p> Walking around and telling everyone that everything is going to be free, is  a great message.  But the reality is, it's unsustainable, and it is not  something that is a direction in our country that we have been against for  a long time.  We have been against socialism and against a lot of this  stuff.</p><p> And now, we're talking about -- in the other day, they talked about the  minimum income -- you know, were people will be given a -- like, that's  insane.  The idea we should be talking about is how do we create an economy  that allows people to have the opportunities that they need, how do we  provide a social safety net.</p><p> But the idea that we're talking about guaranteeing everybody all of this  free stuff, is unbelievable.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick, in your book, you don't believe, as the President  suggested that most media is the enemy of the state.</p><p> SPICER:  No.  I wrote about it.  I actually write that there are a lot of  good reporters, and that we need in a democracy a robust and active press  corps, that's essential to our democracy.  But what we need to do is know  where the line is.  Call out bad reporters and bad stories and also praise  good reports and good stories.</p><p> And it is not about being tough that reporters should be in pursuit of the  truth.  They should write tough, tough stories.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> SPICER:  But they should be called out when they are wrong. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And cut out the rehearsed hysteria, right, the rehearsed  sneering.  Coming up, legend in the auto industry, stepping down.  The  surprise leadership shake-up after FiatChrysler CEO resigned.  Plus,  earning season in full swing, Stuart Varney weighs in, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A busy week in the world of Wall Street.  No, America!  Tech --  big tech companies: Alphabet, that's parent of Google, Facebook, reporting  earnings this week.  Also, we get the first reading on how fast the economy  was growing during the second quarter.  Everybody is watching it,  especially, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  I love it when  you talk earnings and economic numbers because I know that that's --</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, you don't.  You don't.   You hate it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I do.  Actually, I love it because --</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to earnings --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's not true.  Again, who held onto his Microsoft stock?   You.  What stock hit an all-time high on Friday?  Microsoft.  There you go.</p><p>VARNEY:  I had nothing to do with earnings per share.  I couldn't tell you.   Or, QE3 or anything else, and believe me, it didn't.  Look, I think this is  a pivotal week.  The stuff going on this week which would make an enormous  difference to your money.  As you said, Dagen, first of all, you got the  earnings from big tech, it's a big week for big tech.  Here they come,  we're going to find out how much money they've made and how much they  expect to make in the future.  That will have a significant impact on those  stocks, big tech stocks, which have been leading this market for at least a  couple of years.  Then, we've got the GDP numbers, that's Friday morning,  8:30 Eastern Time.  I know you will be covering it and so will we.  I'm  expecting around four percent growth per year, annualized growth, four  percent.  </p><p> Now, that would be a blockbuster news item because we've never achieved  that rate of growth in the last four -- I think it's been four years since  we had a four percent quarter.  And then, don't forget, Wednesday, we have  the Europeans coming over here, top-level delegation coming over to the  White House.  They're talking trade.  There's the possibility of a  breakthrough right there.  Either that or a breakdown, one of the two, and  that again makes this a very pivotal week.  So, I'm glad everybody is  tuning in, it's worthwhile.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What if we get -- and so much -- I've talked till I'm blue in  the face about these potential tariffs on automobile imports and how that  would hurt U.S. carmakers and any carmaker abroad or here at home, so many  of the foreign automakers have plants here, produce most of the cars that  they sell here, in fact.  But Stuart, what if we do get a breakthrough,  what if we do have, hey, we're just going to get rid of all of the auto  tariffs between Europe and the United States?  We're safe in the next three  years.  What if that happens, it would be incredible?</p><p>VARNEY:  Huge for the markets.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think the summer rally has been held back by all those negative  trade headlines.  It's not being pushed down so much as held back I would  say.  But if you get a breakthrough Wednesday, and they come out with at  least a lessening of the tension, an agreement in some form or other to  just maybe get rid of some tariffs, that I think would be absolutely huge,  that would really set the stage for a big rally.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think about this every morning when I get up.  That is the  danger of always being negative and --</p><p>VARNEY:  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  The first thing you think of when  you wake up in the morning, is, oh, the Europeans are coming to a trade  deal.  I don't believe it, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, being positive and making sure that you don't look at  everything through a negative lens because again, then you miss all the  good stuff.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's the whole point about the Trump presidency, isn't it?   Think positive.  He's winning, the economy is expanding, we've got  prosperity coming at us.  You know, think positive, that's why the market  is up so much.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And even with some mean tweets, that's why his approval ratings  are up, too.  Stuart, great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY:  True.  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart Varney, he starts in 10 minutes every day, 9:00 a.m. to  noon.  Coming up, a phone booth worthy of Superman.  Details on the new  office cubicle that will cost you over $8,000, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The death toll rising in last night's mass shooting in Toronto.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Dagen, we just got an  update from police.  A second victim has died from the rampage, a gunman  shot 14 people including a young girl in Toronto.  The 29-year-old  suspect's body was later found at the scene, but it's not clear at this  point whether the man actually killed himself or he was shot by police.   All of this happened in the Toronto neighborhood known as Greektown.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would say I heard at least 20 shots in intervals.   You know, clippings spent, reloading, clipping spent, reloading, clipping  spent, that's what I heard.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Well, investigators are trying to find a motive.  Police say they  would not rule out, at this point, terrorism.</p><p> Well, tragedy in Maryland overnight after a firefighter died while battling  a massive seven alarm blaze.  The unidentified firefighter, a 13-year  veteran fell through the floor.  Three people who were inside the house  were able to get out, though, in time.  The cause of the fire under  investigation, but lightning could be the cause.</p><p> Well, some stunning news over the weekend at a change at the top for FiatChrysler.  Long-time CEO Sergio Marchionne has been replaced.  Marchionne  underwent shoulder surgery three weeks ago but in those three weeks, his  condition has somehow worsened.  We're looking for more details.  Now, Mike  Manley, who runs the Jeep, SUV, and Ram truck division is the new CEO.   While the stock is something to watch today, shares are actually lower in  the premarket, it's down more than three percent right now.  Again,  stunning news over the weekend for this company.</p><p> Well, a Superman solution for workers who want more privacy, for the first  time in 80 years, the Superman cubicle booth is available for purchase.  It  fits two people inside -- if that makes sense -- it comes with modern  necessities like USB outlets and an Ethernet connection, LED lights.   You're going to have to make more money than Clark Kent, though, it's  actually running about $8500 per booth.  And by the way, in the description  it doesn't mention to actually having a phone.  I don't think people use  those anymore, all right.</p><p> And then, finally, there is this, we've been watching this clip over and  over again this morning on the show.  It appears to show a grown man  stealing a foul ball from a child.  Well, the Chicago Cubs saw the  situation play out in real-time.  They ended up giving the young boy an  autographed baseball instead.  But it turns out the man that everybody is  criticizing had helped that boy get a foul ball earlier in the game.  You  can see him holding a game-used baseball next to his new autographed one,  obviously.  Yes.  So, maybe the guy in the clip isn't as mean as we all  think, and we're all beating up on him this morning.  So, I wanted to, you  know, give you some new details on this developing story in baseball.   Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Glad I didn't call him a lot of mean -- maybe.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, I think he's -- I think he's a little on a defensive.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The child deserves all the foul balls.  How about that, though?</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, some final thoughts from our all-stars.  We'll be  right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey Bell, Lee Carter, quick final thoughts.  Five seconds.</p><p> SPICER:  I'm glad to be here to kick off the briefing.  Thanks for having  me.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart Varney, take it away, Sir.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm surprised at Sean Spicer.  I thought he got more to him than  that one.  He had at least five seconds to spare there.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SPICER:  I yield it to you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, you're a good man. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Earnings in focus, it will be the busiest week for the second  quarter reporting season.  One-third of the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 set  to post results this week.  We look at what he numbers and guidance about  the state -- the United States economy.  We get the reading -- the first  reading on second quarter on gross domestic product -- economic growth on  Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Look at these futures right here right now.  Three-point gain on the Dow  futures.  Markets searching for direction after the Dow and S&amp;P managed to  eke out small gains last week.  Although that was your Friday close, it was  some small across the board on Friday.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then moving on, let's check on Europe.  We have declines across the  board.  But contained the biggest loser the CAC Quarante in France down  half about half of one percent right now.  In Asia overnight, it was mixed  markets, the Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng heading higher, the Nikkei  and KOSPI in South Korea suffering losses.</p><p>Tragedy in Toronto, the death toll rising in last night's deadly shooting  rampage.  A gunman killing at least two and injuring a dozen others.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I heard at least 20 shots in intervals, you know,  clipping spent, reloading, clipping spent.  I saw at least four people shot  here by the fountain.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  This is a street where people walk every day to go to  the groceries to have dinner, to have an ice cream, sit in the square,  enjoy their summer.  And it is absolutely devastating.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest as authorities work to find a motive.  War of words.   President Trump threatening Iran with severe consequences if that nation  does not take a cautious tone with the United States.  And unexpected  change at the top of FiatChrysler.  The automaker replacing CEO Sergio  Marchionne after he suffered complications from recent surgery.  What the  change means for the future of the company.  </p><p>Making a private call with a superhero twist.  One company creating a  private cubicle with a Superman theme.  For the first time in decades, oh,  EPA chief Scott Pruitt now gone, could have gotten that phone booths in his  office instead of the one that he's had taxpayer for.  All of that and so  much more coming up this morning.  CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell.</p><p>Look who it is, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Lee Carter, the President of Maslansky and Partners.  Sean  Spicer has a new book.  There you go.  We'll talk about it.</p><p>SPICER:  And you've got a copy of it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It's not signed.  I don't know what's wrong (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SPICER:  It will be.  It will be signed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It called a briefing.  We're going to talk about to Sean about  it.  Coming up, politics to press and the President.  And maybe the  President will tweet some this hour and we can get your instantaneous  response. </p><p>SPICER:  Probability is high.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  He's already been tweeting this morning.  So, Mr.  President, let's ramp that up to our top story this hour on trade with  China.  President Trump will host a White House event showcasing American  products from all 50 states today following his threats to impose tariffs  on all exports out of China and to the U.S.  We're talking more than $500  billion worth of annual imports.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin amplifying the threats saying he \"would --  he wouldn't minimize\" the chance of this actually happening.  And adding  that.  If Europe believes in free trade, the U.S. is ready for a deal.   Joining me now is Ohio Congressman, Jim Renacci.  A member of the House  Ways and Means Committee, House Budget Committee.  Congressman, first did I  pronounce your name correctly?  </p><p>REP. JIM RENACCI (R), OHIO:  You did.  Renacci, that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  So what is your take on President Trump's trade  threats and have you heard concerns from your constituents?  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, it's a mixed bag.  As I talk talked to my constituents they  always say to me, look, we're a little concerned but we want you supporting  the President.  And it's interesting I've had everybody from soybeans, you  know, the agriculture industry into my office to manufactures.  Just last  week and I always say to him, what do you want me to tell President because  I have opportunity to sit with him and what would you rather mew saying?  </p><p>They go, well, we're concerned but we want to you support him.  We want you  -- we realize, you know, we have to go through this process.  It's amazing  because you can't get a straight answer even soybean manufacturer, the  growers, I said to them, now seriously, tell me because they come in and  they say they're concerned.  I said, so what -- so what would your -- if  you had a chance to sit down with him what would you say?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But their business is being hurt though because they -- because  the concern but once people start feeling a real world impact on their  livelihoods, it might be different, right? </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, they are feeling it, they told me they're feeling it but  they also understand the need to be able to go through this.  They  understand the President's negotiating.  That's what I tell them.  We're in  a negotiations phase, let's get through these negotiations.  I've had an  opportunity to sit with the President car where he says, look, I'm worried  about children and grandchildren.</p><p>And at some point in time, you know, we need to make sure that we're  working through this and give me some time and that's what I tell them.  </p><p>SPICER:  How much time do you think that will give him?  </p><p>RENACCI:  You know, it's going to be interesting.  I say that I asked that  question too last week and they said -- I said, how much time do you want  to give them?  And they said, well, let's look at, you know, four, five,  six months and we where we're at.  So that's ---</p><p>SPICER:  Because it feels like if you don't do anything, they suffer the  consequences of Chinese economic policies.  But if you do something that's  some short-term pain and I think that's where -- trying to figure out where  that balance is.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, I was telling them short-term pain, a long-term gain.  I  mean, that's like --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SPICER:  Right.</p><p>RENACCI:  And that's like anything else.  We have to go be willing to do  that.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  When you were -- we were just  talking to Gordon earlier and he was saying, this isn't going to be short- term pain, this could be 10, 20 years, it's a long game the way that the  Chinese play.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, and the truth of it is, we have a long game already because  the Chinese have been doing this to us for so many years.  So now it's time  to go through this process.  And look, the most powerful message I heard  from the President one time was when he said to me, I don't want our  children and grandchildren on their knees begging in the future.  We have  to be willing to work through this.  </p><p>BELL:  Well, I think you saw that in the poll -- the Wall Street Journal  poll that came out that people aren't necessarily happy with how he's  dealing with trade but his overall rating is going up because I think that  the stock market and also, you know, manufacturers, soybean growers and the  like, the whole country thinks that this is a negotiating tactic and it's  going to end well, but the problem is when does it end?  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I think it's also really, really important point though to  say can you can be both be concerned and want to support the President at  the same time.  And I think that a lot of people have missed that because,  you think that if you support a President you support him blindly.  And I  don't think that's the truth.  I think most people -- for a lot of people  somewhere in the middle depending on the issue.  </p><p>SPICER:  Well, I think that people have been told for a long time that  policies going to change and they finally see the President fighting for  them willing and they're willing to give them a little bit of latitude to  see where this thing ends up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Listen, I have been from breathe one, very concerned about these  tariffs that have been slapped on starting with washing machines but then  particularly steel and aluminum tariffs and the retaliation that we've  gotten from some of our trading but most important trading partners and  allies.  But the messaging, I want to hit on this, because the messaging  from day one when Peter Navarro was on this program quizzing me.</p><p>When I wasn't on set about how much is a cost of six pack of beer going to  go up.  And the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial last week saying  Peter Navarro says the harm is a rounding error and their take was -- well,  he is out of touch because there are a number of -- there is a pipeline  builder down in Texas that wanted a steel -- a waiver from the steel --  wanted a steel tariff exemption in other company -- another pipeline  producer as well.</p><p>They didn't get them.  And it's going to cost -- it's going to hurt because  they're going to delay investment in -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SPICER:  -- construction industry as well in term of the cost of whether  it's a beam or a screw.  Things are starting to go up and that's costing  people money.  The question I think that we're just asking the Congressman  is how long and how long will tolerate.  They want the fight, they've seen  Chinese economic policies, adversely affect our economy, our workers too  long and they're willing to give the President I think some latitude for a  while.</p><p>But the question is going to be how long. </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, I say the same thing but I always tell them let's judge  this President.  You get a chance to a judge the President in a couple more  years in election.  So let's judge him then, let's not judge him today.   Let's let them go through negotiations.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you guys, well, people go to the polls to reelect you or not  come November and on that note let's talk about tax cuts 2.0 which the  House is working on, revitalizing the economy, the second round, a big part  of the GOP's plan to try and retain control of the House.  Here is what  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise told Maria yesterday morning on \"SUNDAY  MORNING FUTURES.\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  The plans to continue  focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth,  and then locking it in.  We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes,  we're going to make the tax cuts permanent.  That bill Chairman Brady, his  committee are already working on.  We just did a jobs 3.0 bill.</p><p>A bill to provide more regulatory relief and do some things that will help  create more jobs and rebuild the middle class.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is it enough for you as people head to the polls if the House  passed that?  And the Senate already showing resistance to it.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, I can tell you in Ohio, tax 1.0 is working.  Companies are  now reinvesting, I had a company went from 70 to 140 employees already.  I  have companies who are talking about expanding.  They're also giving  bonuses out to their employees, they're raising wages.  So as I travel,  Ohio people are very happy.  Now, if we can lock that in which is important  because the only reason it's not locked in its gimmicks in Washington.</p><p>I mean, I'm a business guy.  I always chuckle at some of these little  gimmicks we have.  We couldn't lock in it because of this rule or that  rule.  So let's lock it in, let's make sure people have certainty and  predictability.  I think that's going to be the second thing.  And also on  2.0, we're going to be talking about savings.  So I think that's another  issue.  These -- a lot of people back in Ohio are now getting more money in  their pockets.</p><p>We need to make sure they can save it and use it for their -- whether it's  education, whatever.  So those -- that's what 2.0 is going to be all about.   I think it's -- can be best explained that way when I travel the state.  </p><p>SPICER:  I think the other thing is -- I mean, look, elections are binary  choice and it's not just what Jim Renacci is for, it's what Sherrod Brown  isn't for.  And that's a thing -- it's a big contrast that Ohio voters are  going to face.  It's not just are you going to keep more, we're going talk  about economic expansion, it's what Sherrod Brown isn't going to do to help  Ohio businesses and families.  I mean, that's pretty much. </p><p>RENACCI:  Well, that's true too.  And I mean, it's polar total opposites  because I'm running against somebody who didn't support the tax cuts bill.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not one Democrat voted for the tax cut so -- but then they were  upset.  You heard this from Nancy Pelosi but then they're upset that the  individual tax cuts weren't permanent and they keep -- or they're now  worried about the debt and the deficit all of a sudden, so which is it?   And you don't get -- you don't get to say because she didn't vote.  </p><p>RENACCI:  Right.  And, again, here is the issue for me.  I came here as a  businessman and now I look at the numbers, 85 percent of our deficit or  things unrelated to the tax cut and the tax cut actually if it grows the  economy which it's doing and we get sustained growth over three percent,  then it will pay for itself and it will grow the economy and it will pay  the debt down. So that's the key.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speaking of which, we're going to get the first reading on  second quarter growth.   And the -- it's going to be likely north of four percent.  The Wall Street  Journal estimate is 4.2, the GDP now from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank  is 4-1/2, they're whisperer is coming out of White House, it's going to be  north 4-1/2.  But again, does that stick with people.  Does that -- the  number resonate or are they already feeling that?  </p><p>BELL:  I think they're feeling it.  We've discussed it earlier in the show,  the consumers, the everyday people, working class people are out there  feeling the benefits in their paychecks, they're feeling better but, you  know, we have the most jobs available out there with the lowest jobless  rate that we've seen in almost 20 years.  The consumers feeling good,  confidence remains high so -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you see that in this Wall Street Journal NBC News poll that  found half of registered voters approve of the President handling of the  economy.  His highest mark on that question in the survey.  That same poll  found that President's approval rating edged higher even during the week,  Lee Carter, when he came under criticism for his handling of that Helsinki  Summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>The President's approval rating rose to 45 percent.  That is the highest of  his presidency.  </p><p>CARTER:  It is.  And there's two reasons why.  I think number one, we can't  forget the importance of the Supreme Court to voters out there.  I think  Republicans will support the President almost no matter what because that  is so, so, so important to them.  And the other thing is, I think Democrats  really blew it big in the way that they responded to Helsinki and the  President's comments.</p><p>Because well, a lot of people were rightfully upset by what the President  did say.  He later tried to correct himself.  I think that the hysteria  that happened over that actually made people more likely defend the  President that anything else.  So the Democrats really think and the media  really needs to learn how to balance their coverage and say, well, we might  be concerned, we don't have to get hysterical over it if they won't make  any moves here.</p><p>It's also important to know though that even though these are -- these are  pretty high rates, this isn't necessarily significant in that other  presidents have had higher approval ratings at the same point, but I think  it's telling.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Congressman, but we have -- potentially Vladimir  Putin coming to the United States for another summit right before people go  to the polls in November.  Are you concerned about that? </p><p>RENACCI:  Not at all.  I think this is -- again, the President has to be  able to negotiate even with some of the people that are enemies of us and I  think that's the key.  So we will continue to go and as we said, this  confidence is going to continue to build.  I want to go back whether you're  firefighter or police, your 401(k)s and your pensions are going up and  that's positive.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) thank you, Congressman Renacci.  Still to come, an  unexpected leadership shake-up at FiatChrysler.  The details are the  automaker's longtime CEO is stepping down due to health issues.  Plus,  Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings this morning.  We break  down those numbers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  I'm Nicole Petallides live on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange.  The Dow futures this morning only slightly to the downside, down  six of the Dow Jones Industrial average.  And it's earning season, the big,  big week here, 170 S &amp; 500 companies coming out with numbers.</p><p>We'll kick it off with two that have reported this morning including  Halliburton and Hasbro. So Halliburton is looking to downside to the tune  of about to 1.1 percent while Hasbro is jumping 10percent.  The Halliburton  in particular, it was in line earnings per share, that's why you're seeing  a little bit of selling, everybody is getting so used to be so far this  season.  The estimates were 20.5 percent growth year-over-year for  earnings.</p><p>And in fact, we've seen most of these companies beating, so we've seen over  21percent but Halliburton did have quarterly revenue on the rise, higher  oil prices and more rigs at work.  Hasbro as I noted up 10-1/2 percent  there, topping and soaring as it handily beat those analysts' estimates for  profit and sales by a wide margin.  </p><p>At then we'll watch for Alphabet, Google after the bell today.  That will  be key, not only will they watch for consistent revenue gains but also some  of those other areas, apps, pixel smartphones, licensing also cloud  computing stock just down a quarter of one percent right now.  So keep it  right here because coming up, former FBI Director James Comey is getting  political once again.</p><p>Why he is urging Democrats to not lose their minds and rush to the  socialist left.  It's all ahead.  Plus, spice up your office space.   Details on the new cubicle inspired by Superman that costs over $8,000.   That is all later this hour.  Keep it right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Let's kick off this new week with slightly lower  futures, five -- four-point loss on the Dow futures right now.  But again,  the direction this week will be decided by earnings.  Alphabet, the parent  of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter all set to report quarterly  results this week.  Alphabet kicks things off after the close today.  The  Google parent company reporting after the bell.</p><p>Joining is now beyond sport global ambassador, Fox News contributor, my  dear friend, John Layfield.  John, your expectation for earnings going into  this week?  </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think we have another great earning  season.  The last earnings season that we had was the best earnings beat in  25 years since the early 1990s.  We're seeing so far a third of S&amp;P 500  companies reported, 87 percent have had earnings expectations that had an  upside on those earnings, the estimates that they've had.  So it's going to  be interesting to see what we're going to see these earnings.</p><p>Especially when you have automakers reporting this week.  We have G.M. and  Ford which I own both reporting.  They've already have commodity inflation  problems.  So interesting to see how whether hedge for these tariffs going  forward and how these tariffs are going to affect projections going  forward.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, some other companies to watch are these industrial  companies.  I think Whirlpool, Harley-Davidson or two of the names out with  earnings this week.  We will be listening for those even 3M listening for  the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs.  And any kind of supply chain  disruption these companies are experiencing.  </p><p>BELL:  Absolutely.  We're seeing these companies, 94 percent of the  industrial companies that have reported have beat on both the top and the  bottom line.  The stocks are reacting really well, the question, John, is I  don't know if you have a thought on this, it feels like the question is, is  -- are orders being pulled forward?  Is the second quarter coming in  significantly better than expected?</p><p>Because people are trying to get ahead of tariffs and that's what's causing  raised guidance for full year or are we just doing better than we thought?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's a great question, Lindsey.  And it's a little bit of  both.  We are seeing earnings pulled forward, people getting around these  tariffs.  So you're seeing lot of stuff shift early because of this, but  you are seeing better-than-expected.  We're going to have a -- look like a  four percent GDP.  That's going to be a little inflated because people are  getting these orders out there ahead of these tariffs.  </p><p>The earnings season this year, I mean, this is the dichotomy of this  administration.  We're going to have 20 percent earnings a gain this  quarter.  About 35 to 40 percent of that comes from these tax cuts.  So the  administration has done a great job in spurring this economy that is  already long in the tooth in this bull market to revitalization.  The  problem is all 100 percent.  Now black cloud is these tariffs. </p><p>And what can happen if the potential trade war happens.  It could negate  everything that happens with these tax cuts.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But so far, John, it looks like the markets are giving the White  House, giving administration some breathing room on how long do you think  that can last?  I mean to your point, we're going to get guidance this week  from some major industrial companies, the automakers about any potential  fallout?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think it starts until it starts significantly hurting, you  know, it's easy when you talk about a potential trade war.  We're actually  in a trade war right now no matter what level of that trade war we're in,  we're actually in one right now.  You look at Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh, Salt  Lake, they're all reducing headcount right now in their newspaper business  because of the tariffs that we have on Canadian paper.</p><p>So you're starting to see problems right now, you see soybeans, you see  livestock right now, you see a glut of that going on because we have two  problems.  We had a huge amount of livestock produced this year and we also  have these tariffs that are coming also.  We have a glut.  Until you start  seeing these -- Americans start being hurt which I think we're going to  start seeing, I think you give the President a pass on this, this is  negotiations.</p><p>But this is sticking and matched next to (INAUDIBLE) and say, hey, I'm  going to blow up everything if you don't agree.  It is a dangerous,  dangerous game we're playing right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  John, how do you structure portfolio around that?  Because again  you're not getting paid that much to own fixed income here.  How do you  allocate money?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think dividend stocks become to de facto bonds like they had  been for the past several years.  I know interest rates are rising but  that's still a play.  Look, you have problems in the E.U.  If Englands are  upset of the E.U., which it looks like they're probably going to do with  probably a hard Brexit, that takes out a huge amount of fees going to E.U.   The E.U. looks like it could break up especially we started losing smaller  parts like Italy and somebody else follows.</p><p>You look at the problems in China right now, the U.S. stock market is still  the place to be and I think dividend stocks are going to be the safe play  going forward because I don't think people know what's going to happen with  this market.  This market should be significantly higher.  This economy is  absolutely on fire.  The only black cloud right now is the trade tariffs  and that's why I will stay with dividend stocks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll say this ahead of the head of the European  Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker is going to be at the White House on  Wednesday, maybe you get some positive developments out of that meeting?   You never know.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  He doesn't have high expectations according to people around him  but you're right, we could have something, a big upside surprise come out  of that.  I wouldn't be surprised if the E.U. says, you know, we're just  going to drop the 10 percent tariffs on cars and then see what the  President does because it's really about those tariffs then the President  will drop it and this trade war could end at least with our friends here.</p><p>The problem we have with Europe right now is they're now negotiations deals  with our trading partners that are our neighbors in Canada and Mexico.   This could be long-term structural damage if we don't get in front of this  right now and try to work out something with Mr. Juncker when he visits  this week.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  That tariff that we have on light trucks that are  imported, it's a 25 percent tariff, it's called the chicken tax among  people I grew up with because it was retaliation to this fight we had with  Europe over poultry in 1964 I think.  So, you think tariffs can't hang  around?  That one has been around since before I was born.  Thank you,  John.  And before you were born too, I should point out.  John Layfield.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Correct.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Always great to see you, my friend.  Coming up.  Escalating  tensions with Iran.  The new warning from President Trump after Iran's  leader says any conflict with the country would lead to the mother of all  wars.  Plus, a surprise shake-up at FiatChrysler.  Details on the  unexpected changes after the automaker's long-time CEO steps down ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It  is Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  One big week  for earnings, one-third of the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 reporting, this  week, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, all on deck.  </p><p>This afternoon's big reveal will be from Alphabet, the parent company of  Google.  Take a look at how the stock is premarket.  Let's take a look at  the Futures across the board, the Dow and S&amp;P did manage to eke out small  gains last week, and they're up to -- they are in the green right now.</p><p>The NASDAQ, 100, the Futures there are lower as the NASDAQ was, last week,  slipping.  In Europe, markets are headed lower this morning as well, losses  across the board.  The CAC Quarante in France, the biggest loser down half  of one percent.</p><p>The Asian markets finishing mixed, the Nikkei ending down more than one  percent, one and a third percent, to be exact, the KOSPI in South Korea  also losing almost nine-tenth of one percent.  </p><p>President Trump tweeting out to the president of Iran last night, with a  firm warning, saying not to threaten the U.S. or else, and former FBI  Director James Comey, cautioning the Dems on twitter.  He says, don't vote  for whatever socialist -- Democratic socialist, whatever they are calling  today.</p><p>FiatChrysler stock almost three percent in the red in premarket trading on  the sudden replacement of the company's well-known CEO, Sergio Marchionne,  over the weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUPERMAN:  This is a job for Superman.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And in celebration of Superman's 88th birthday, one company's  got a box for you.  Now, all is a Superman themed cubicle, modelled after  the same telephone booth that the Man of Steel used to get changed in, with  a few modern perks, red cape, not included.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, President Trump giving a stern warning to  Iran, escalating a war of words with the country's leader, Kristina  Partsinevelos is live at the White House with the very latest.  Good  morning, Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   And you are right, the escalation has continued, the rhetoric between both  countries Iran and United States, why is this happening, why is the  President tweeting in all caps?  </p><p>This comes after the president of Iran gave a speech on Sunday to his  population, and he said, that if any conflict bn between the United States  and Iran, occurs, then it would be the mother of all wars.  </p><p>President Trump took to twitter yesterday, in all capitals, when in the  online world, essentially means yelling, he wrote, never, ever threaten  United States again, or you will suffer consequences the likes of when few  throughout history have ever suffered before.  We are no longer a country  that will stand for your demented words or violence and death.  Be  cautious.</p><p>And when I say the rhetoric has continued to escalate, you know that the  United States has pulled out of Iran nuclear deal in 20 -- or 2015 Iran  nuclear deal in May.  Just last month, the United States said that they  were going to impose sanctions against any exports leaving Iran.  </p><p>This comes at a time when the country in Iran is suffering.  The economy is  not doing so well and that had a huge effect on the price of oil.  Today,  we're seeing a trade just around $68.92.  But over the past two months,  you've seen it fluctuate quite a bit and climb higher because of the lack  of supply around  the globe, especially coming from Iran.</p><p>Iran has retaliated saying that they too will block any type of shipments  coming out of there.  But so far, it's just back and forth rhetoric between  the two countries.  And it's only Monday morning, 8:00 a.m. and we're  getting all this news.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kristina, thank you for delivering it to us, Kristina  Partsinevelos, at the White House for us.  Sean, I want to get your  reaction to the President's tweet, especially since it seems to be one of  the --you know, message control is the most impossible thing to do.  </p><p>They're in the White House, because again, that's the President, tweeting  out.</p><p>SPICER:  I mean, the beauty is everyone knows talks about transparency.  I  mean, you are hearing directly from him what he thinks, when he tweets like  this.  </p><p>And if I were President Rouhani, I would take caution in making some of  those outlandish statements, threatening United States, because I think  this president doesn't like to be looked at like that and he will take  swift indecisive action.  </p><p>So, Rouhani may forget that we can all hear what he says, when he does it  in the modern world, but that was a mistake on his part. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Iran was still firing, firing missiles after the Iran nuclear  deal was done with death to America, death to Israel.</p><p>SPICER:  And I don't think this President -- this President-- you know,  Kristina mentioned it, but he -- this -- the Iran nuclear deal is something  that is he is consistently talked about being a bad deal, and if Iran ups  the game, he is going to do something. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And now, Europe has to come to us to get -- basically  get waivers from sanctions that we are preparing to impose on Iran.  </p><p>The President tweeted again, this morning, on Russia, when you hear the  fake news talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all  that I gave up, remember, I gave up nothing, we merely talked about future  benefits for both countries.  Also, we got along very well, which is a good  thing, except for the corrupt media.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sean, your take on that?  Again, the fact that it was discussed  that the likes of Michael McFaul, the former ambassador to Russia, that  Putin says to our President, why I want to interview these Americans.  The  fact that that even came up was bothersome to many.</p><p>SPICER:  Well, but, again, I don't -- part of what we don't know is what  exactly was said, the context it was said, and what Trump did or did not  respond.  I think the White House has made it very clear that the idea that  Russia would interrogate any United States citizen, never mind the former  ambassador, is fairly laughable.</p><p>And I think it's good that they clarified these kinds of things because  it's not -- I mean, the idea that a former government official would be  interrogated by any country, never mind Russia in Putin, is something that  we should be very clear about what our nation's position is. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If Putin -- assuming that Putin does come to the United States  right before the midterm elections and there was a second summit on U.S.  soil, be sure that there will be people in that tete-a-tete.</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I think the President is seeing the reaction that he saw  walking out of that summit.  I think they're going to come in to any kind  of future summit with their A game.</p><p>CARTER:  Do you think that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, you are saying that wasn't the President's A game?</p><p>SPICER:  No, I think that they -- after meeting with Kim, I think they  looked at the model and they were -- there was largely a lot of praise  coming from that, how the President had handled that meeting, how the  reaction had been in terms of him engaging with Kim, talking about  denuclearization in the peninsula.</p><p>And I think that this Helsinki summit seemed to follow a very similar  pattern.  I don't think that they fully appreciated the reaction that Putin  would get, versus Kim.</p><p>CARTER:  I also think the President didn't help himself with some of the  statements that he made, following, right?  Where he was almost -- seemed  like he was (INAUDIBLE) more with Russia than --</p><p>SPICER:  Sure.  And I think it's a good thing that they went out and  clarified.</p><p>CARTER:  Now, how do you think -- what do you think about his  clarification?  Do you think that was enough?  Do you think people buy it?</p><p>SPICER:  You know, so far, it seems like they do, I think it's important.   I mean, look, he has been -- it's good that he clarified it.  And, you  know, I -- talk -- there is an intensity to this White House of how they  cover it -- how they cover this president unlike ever before.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The (INAUDIBLE) and the media.</p><p>SPICER:  The media.  And that's why I wrote a book that literally goes  through a lot of these big moments and how -- thank you, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm holding - I was going to ask you about this.</p><p>SPICER:  OK.  What I mean, I think that there is a level of intensity in  scrutiny that in past administrations, they haven't had to face.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  True.  But it's called the briefing politics, the press and the  President.  I would say, you put the words, the press, on the front cover  of a book, that doesn't really help sales, my friend.</p><p>SPICER:  Well, I will -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People hate the --</p><p>SPICER:  But I think part of what people want to know is, what is it really  like inside?  And that's the thing.  You see one thing on television.  You  get to see us sitting here at the table.  What's going on behind-the- scenes?  </p><p>And part of the reason that I wrote the book is that the press gets to have  their say.  They get to put in paper, or put on television what they want  you to see, what they want you to read.  What I wanted to do is take  readers behind-the-scenes and say, this is what's actually happening when - - that you don't see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- is it safe to say that this is a President, this is a  man, the leader of the country who if you are trying to craft a message,  you can't control the message, because he is going to say what he wants to  say, and you are more crisis response or just a respond --</p><p>SPICER:  I was going to say -- I wouldn't say no, because -- I mean, right,  I think you are clearly in response, he is the leader.  </p><p>And that is a very different role than I normally played many -- most press  people where your job is to craft and execute a message and a plan.  This  president leads the way in every one of those fronts.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There hasn't been any lasting fallout for the President or even  the White House.  I would argue for anything that on Twitter.  And even --</p><p>SPICER:  No, in fact, I wouldn't.  But that's probably why one of the  reasons he won.  I mean, he has been -- and I write about all of these  instances were any other political candidate would have been left for dead.   I mean, I guarantee you, if a candidate for office went to Lee and said,  poll what I just did.  </p><p>It would come back and say, you're dead.  Get out of the race.  And what  this President, every time, not only picked himself up, but in most cases,  came up stronger.</p><p>CARTER:  And it's part of -- I mean, it is part of who he is, right?  I  think people wanted somebody who is going to go down, shape things up and  do things differently than it's ever been before.  And so the fact that he  does this and continues to do it, I think, just reinforces that message.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get to Jim Comey, yes, Jim Comey, the midterm  elections, three months away, Former FBI Director, Comey, issuing a warning  to Democrats.  </p><p>He tweeted this, yesterday, Democrats, please, please don't lose your minds  and rush to the socialist left.  This president and his Republican Party  are counting on you to do exactly that.  America's great middle wants  sensible, balanced, ethical leadership.</p><p>But where is the sensible balanced ethical candidate who's running for the  Democrat?</p><p>SPICER:  Well, his tweet's a little too late.  I mean, that run to the  left, already happened.  So, he's a little late on his tweet.  I mean,  that's the problem.  They are now having a -- they're tripping over  themselves, to go further and further to the left.</p><p>They are not progressives.  I mean, they are now like Bernie Sanders, was a  socialist running for president and was -- at one point, viewed as the  extreme.  He's now become the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and you  have to go further and further to the left, to get traction.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, I just wonder, though, I can't -- I look at all of this  and I think I don't necessarily believe that it's a whole of the Democrats  that are going left.  I think that it's a socialists, the far left, it's  the only part of the party that has a message that resonates to people  because they are talking about things that matter most.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're lying to the American people.</p><p>CARTER:  Whether or not --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know that they're absolutely lying.  </p><p>CARTER:  They're saying something besides resist.</p><p>SPICER:  To your point, I mean, you can talk about all of these things at  some point.  They never tell you about the price tag.  They never talk  about the economic consequences that these policies would have on our  economy.  </p><p>Walking around and telling everyone that everything is going to be free, is  a great message.  But the reality is, it's unsustainable, and it is not  something that is a direction in our country that we have been against for  a long time.  We have been against socialism and against a lot of this  stuff.</p><p>And now, we're talking about -- in the other day, they talked about the  minimum income -- you know, were people will be given a -- like, that's  insane.  The idea we should be talking about is how do we create an economy  that allows people to have the opportunities that they need, how do we  provide a social safety net.</p><p>But the idea that we're talking about guaranteeing everybody all of this  free stuff, is unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, in your book, you don't believe, as the President  suggested that most media is the enemy of the state.</p><p>SPICER:  No.  I wrote about it.  I actually write that there are a lot of  good reporters, and that we need in a democracy a robust and active press  corps, that's essential to our democracy.  But what we need to do is know  where the line is.  Call out bad reporters and bad stories and also praise  good reports and good stories.</p><p>And it is not about being tough that reporters should be in pursuit of the  truth.  They should write tough, tough stories.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>SPICER:  But they should be called out when they are wrong. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And cut out the rehearsed hysteria, right, the rehearsed  sneering.  Coming up, legend in the auto industry, stepping down.  The  surprise leadership shake-up after FiatChrysler CEO resigned.  Plus,  earning season in full swing, Stuart Varney weighs in, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A busy week in the world of Wall Street.  No, America!  Tech --  big tech companies: Alphabet, that's parent of Google, Facebook, reporting  earnings this week.  Also, we get the first reading on how fast the economy  was growing during the second quarter.  Everybody is watching it,  especially, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  I love it when  you talk earnings and economic numbers because I know that that's --</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No, you don't.  You don't.   You hate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I do.  Actually, I love it because --</p><p>VARNEY:  I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to earnings --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's not true.  Again, who held onto his Microsoft stock?   You.  What stock hit an all-time high on Friday?  Microsoft.  There you go.</p><p>VARNEY:  I had nothing to do with earnings per share.  I couldn't tell you.   Or, QE3 or anything else, and believe me, it didn't.  Look, I think this is  a pivotal week.  The stuff going on this week which would make an enormous  difference to your money.  As you said, Dagen, first of all, you got the  earnings from big tech, it's a big week for big tech.  Here they come,  we're going to find out how much money they've made and how much they  expect to make in the future.  That will have a significant impact on those  stocks, big tech stocks, which have been leading this market for at least a  couple of years.  Then, we've got the GDP numbers, that's Friday morning,  8:30 Eastern Time.  I know you will be covering it and so will we.  I'm  expecting around four percent growth per year, annualized growth, four  percent.  </p><p>Now, that would be a blockbuster news item because we've never achieved  that rate of growth in the last four -- I think it's been four years since  we had a four percent quarter.  And then, don't forget, Wednesday, we have  the Europeans coming over here, top-level delegation coming over to the  White House.  They're talking trade.  There's the possibility of a  breakthrough right there.  Either that or a breakdown, one of the two, and  that again makes this a very pivotal week.  So, I'm glad everybody is  tuning in, it's worthwhile.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What if we get -- and so much -- I've talked till I'm blue in  the face about these potential tariffs on automobile imports and how that  would hurt U.S. carmakers and any carmaker abroad or here at home, so many  of the foreign automakers have plants here, produce most of the cars that  they sell here, in fact.  But Stuart, what if we do get a breakthrough,  what if we do have, hey, we're just going to get rid of all of the auto  tariffs between Europe and the United States?  We're safe in the next three  years.  What if that happens, it would be incredible?</p><p>VARNEY:  Huge for the markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think the summer rally has been held back by all those negative  trade headlines.  It's not being pushed down so much as held back I would  say.  But if you get a breakthrough Wednesday, and they come out with at  least a lessening of the tension, an agreement in some form or other to  just maybe get rid of some tariffs, that I think would be absolutely huge,  that would really set the stage for a big rally.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think about this every morning when I get up.  That is the  danger of always being negative and --</p><p>VARNEY:  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  The first thing you think of when  you wake up in the morning, is, oh, the Europeans are coming to a trade  deal.  I don't believe it, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, being positive and making sure that you don't look at  everything through a negative lens because again, then you miss all the  good stuff.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's the whole point about the Trump presidency, isn't it?   Think positive.  He's winning, the economy is expanding, we've got  prosperity coming at us.  You know, think positive, that's why the market  is up so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And even with some mean tweets, that's why his approval ratings  are up, too.  Stuart, great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY:  True.  Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart Varney, he starts in 10 minutes every day, 9:00 a.m. to  noon.  Coming up, a phone booth worthy of Superman.  Details on the new  office cubicle that will cost you over $8,000, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The death toll rising in last night's mass shooting in Toronto.   Cheryl Casone has the details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Dagen, we just got an  update from police.  A second victim has died from the rampage, a gunman  shot 14 people including a young girl in Toronto.  The 29-year-old  suspect's body was later found at the scene, but it's not clear at this  point whether the man actually killed himself or he was shot by police.   All of this happened in the Toronto neighborhood known as Greektown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I would say I heard at least 20 shots in intervals.   You know, clippings spent, reloading, clipping spent, reloading, clipping  spent, that's what I heard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, investigators are trying to find a motive.  Police say they  would not rule out, at this point, terrorism.</p><p>Well, tragedy in Maryland overnight after a firefighter died while battling  a massive seven alarm blaze.  The unidentified firefighter, a 13-year  veteran fell through the floor.  Three people who were inside the house  were able to get out, though, in time.  The cause of the fire under  investigation, but lightning could be the cause.</p><p>Well, some stunning news over the weekend at a change at the top for FiatChrysler.  Long-time CEO Sergio Marchionne has been replaced.  Marchionne  underwent shoulder surgery three weeks ago but in those three weeks, his  condition has somehow worsened.  We're looking for more details.  Now, Mike  Manley, who runs the Jeep, SUV, and Ram truck division is the new CEO.   While the stock is something to watch today, shares are actually lower in  the premarket, it's down more than three percent right now.  Again,  stunning news over the weekend for this company.</p><p>Well, a Superman solution for workers who want more privacy, for the first  time in 80 years, the Superman cubicle booth is available for purchase.  It  fits two people inside -- if that makes sense -- it comes with modern  necessities like USB outlets and an Ethernet connection, LED lights.   You're going to have to make more money than Clark Kent, though, it's  actually running about $8500 per booth.  And by the way, in the description  it doesn't mention to actually having a phone.  I don't think people use  those anymore, all right.</p><p>And then, finally, there is this, we've been watching this clip over and  over again this morning on the show.  It appears to show a grown man  stealing a foul ball from a child.  Well, the Chicago Cubs saw the  situation play out in real-time.  They ended up giving the young boy an  autographed baseball instead.  But it turns out the man that everybody is  criticizing had helped that boy get a foul ball earlier in the game.  You  can see him holding a game-used baseball next to his new autographed one,  obviously.  Yes.  So, maybe the guy in the clip isn't as mean as we all  think, and we're all beating up on him this morning.  So, I wanted to, you  know, give you some new details on this developing story in baseball.   Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Glad I didn't call him a lot of mean -- maybe.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, I think he's -- I think he's a little on a defensive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The child deserves all the foul balls.  How about that, though?</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, some final thoughts from our all-stars.  We'll be  right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey Bell, Lee Carter, quick final thoughts.  Five seconds.</p><p>SPICER:  I'm glad to be here to kick off the briefing.  Thanks for having  me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart Varney, take it away, Sir.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm surprised at Sean Spicer.  I thought he got more to him than  that one.  He had at least five seconds to spare there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SPICER:  I yield it to you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, you're a good man. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Earnings in focus, it will be the busiest week for the second quarter reporting season. One-third of the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 set to post results this week. We look at what he numbers and guidance about the state -- the United States economy. We get the reading -- the first reading on second quarter on gross domestic product -- economic growth on Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Look at these futures right here right now. Three-point gain on the Dow futures. Markets searching for direction after the Dow and S&amp;P managed to eke out small gains last week. Although that was your Friday close, it was some small across the board on Friday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then moving on, let's check on Europe. We have declines across the board. But contained the biggest loser the CAC Quarante in France down half about half of one percent right now. In Asia overnight, it was mixed markets, the Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng heading higher, the Nikkei and KOSPI in South Korea suffering losses.</p><p>Tragedy in Toronto, the death toll rising in last night's deadly shooting rampage. A gunman killing at least two and injuring a dozen others.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I heard at least 20 shots in intervals, you know, clipping spent, reloading, clipping spent. I saw at least four people shot here by the fountain.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a street where people walk every day to go to the groceries to have dinner, to have an ice cream, sit in the square, enjoy their summer. And it is absolutely devastating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The latest as authorities work to find a motive. War of words. President Trump threatening Iran with severe consequences if that nation does not take a cautious tone with the United States. And unexpected change at the top of FiatChrysler. The automaker replacing CEO Sergio Marchionne after he suffered complications from recent surgery. What the change means for the future of the company.</p><p>Making a private call with a superhero twist. One company creating a private cubicle with a Superman theme. For the first time in decades, oh, EPA chief Scott Pruitt now gone, could have gotten that phone booths in his office instead of the one that he's had taxpayer for. All of that and so much more coming up this morning. CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell.</p><p>Look who it is, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Lee Carter, the President of Maslansky and Partners. Sean Spicer has a new book. There you go. We'll talk about it.</p><p>SPICER: And you've got a copy of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. It's not signed. I don't know what's wrong (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SPICER: It will be. It will be signed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It called a briefing. We're going to talk about to Sean about it. Coming up, politics to press and the President. And maybe the President will tweet some this hour and we can get your instantaneous response.</p><p>SPICER: Probability is high.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. He's already been tweeting this morning. So, Mr. President, let's ramp that up to our top story this hour on trade with China. President Trump will host a White House event showcasing American products from all 50 states today following his threats to impose tariffs on all exports out of China and to the U.S. We're talking more than $500 billion worth of annual imports.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin amplifying the threats saying he \"would -- he wouldn't minimize\" the chance of this actually happening. And adding that. If Europe believes in free trade, the U.S. is ready for a deal. Joining me now is Ohio Congressman, Jim Renacci. A member of the House Ways and Means Committee, House Budget Committee. Congressman, first did I pronounce your name correctly?</p><p>REP. JIM RENACCI (R), OHIO: You did. Renacci, that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. So what is your take on President Trump's trade threats and have you heard concerns from your constituents?</p><p>RENACCI: Well, it's a mixed bag. As I talk talked to my constituents they always say to me, look, we're a little concerned but we want you supporting the President. And it's interesting I've had everybody from soybeans, you know, the agriculture industry into my office to manufactures. Just last week and I always say to him, what do you want me to tell President because I have opportunity to sit with him and what would you rather mew saying?</p><p>They go, well, we're concerned but we want to you support him. We want you -- we realize, you know, we have to go through this process. It's amazing because you can't get a straight answer even soybean manufacturer, the growers, I said to them, now seriously, tell me because they come in and they say they're concerned. I said, so what -- so what would your -- if you had a chance to sit down with him what would you say?</p><p>MCDOWELL: But their business is being hurt though because they -- because the concern but once people start feeling a real world impact on their livelihoods, it might be different, right?</p><p>RENACCI: Well, they are feeling it, they told me they're feeling it but they also understand the need to be able to go through this. They understand the President's negotiating. That's what I tell them. We're in a negotiations phase, let's get through these negotiations. I've had an opportunity to sit with the President car where he says, look, I'm worried about children and grandchildren.</p><p>And at some point in time, you know, we need to make sure that we're working through this and give me some time and that's what I tell them.</p><p>SPICER: How much time do you think that will give him?</p><p>RENACCI: You know, it's going to be interesting. I say that I asked that question too last week and they said -- I said, how much time do you want to give them? And they said, well, let's look at, you know, four, five, six months and we where we're at. So that's ---</p><p>SPICER: Because it feels like if you don't do anything, they suffer the consequences of Chinese economic policies. But if you do something that's some short-term pain and I think that's where -- trying to figure out where that balance is.</p><p>RENACCI: Well, I was telling them short-term pain, a long-term gain. I mean, that's like --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SPICER: Right.</p><p>RENACCI: And that's like anything else. We have to go be willing to do that.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: When you were -- we were just talking to Gordon earlier and he was saying, this isn't going to be short- term pain, this could be 10, 20 years, it's a long game the way that the Chinese play.</p><p>RENACCI: Well, and the truth of it is, we have a long game already because the Chinese have been doing this to us for so many years. So now it's time to go through this process. And look, the most powerful message I heard from the President one time was when he said to me, I don't want our children and grandchildren on their knees begging in the future. We have to be willing to work through this.</p><p>BELL: Well, I think you saw that in the poll -- the Wall Street Journal poll that came out that people aren't necessarily happy with how he's dealing with trade but his overall rating is going up because I think that the stock market and also, you know, manufacturers, soybean growers and the like, the whole country thinks that this is a negotiating tactic and it's going to end well, but the problem is when does it end?</p><p>CARTER: Yes. I think it's also really, really important point though to say can you can be both be concerned and want to support the President at the same time. And I think that a lot of people have missed that because, you think that if you support a President you support him blindly. And I don't think that's the truth. I think most people -- for a lot of people somewhere in the middle depending on the issue.</p><p>SPICER: Well, I think that people have been told for a long time that policies going to change and they finally see the President fighting for them willing and they're willing to give them a little bit of latitude to see where this thing ends up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Listen, I have been from breathe one, very concerned about these tariffs that have been slapped on starting with washing machines but then particularly steel and aluminum tariffs and the retaliation that we've gotten from some of our trading but most important trading partners and allies. But the messaging, I want to hit on this, because the messaging from day one when Peter Navarro was on this program quizzing me.</p><p>When I wasn't on set about how much is a cost of six pack of beer going to go up. And the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial last week saying Peter Navarro says the harm is a rounding error and their take was -- well, he is out of touch because there are a number of -- there is a pipeline builder down in Texas that wanted a steel -- a waiver from the steel -- wanted a steel tariff exemption in other company -- another pipeline producer as well.</p><p>They didn't get them. And it's going to cost -- it's going to hurt because they're going to delay investment in --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SPICER: -- construction industry as well in term of the cost of whether it's a beam or a screw. Things are starting to go up and that's costing people money. The question I think that we're just asking the Congressman is how long and how long will tolerate. They want the fight, they've seen Chinese economic policies, adversely affect our economy, our workers too long and they're willing to give the President I think some latitude for a while.</p><p>But the question is going to be how long.</p><p>RENACCI: Well, I say the same thing but I always tell them let's judge this President. You get a chance to a judge the President in a couple more years in election. So let's judge him then, let's not judge him today. Let's let them go through negotiations.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you guys, well, people go to the polls to reelect you or not come November and on that note let's talk about tax cuts 2.0 which the House is working on, revitalizing the economy, the second round, a big part of the GOP's plan to try and retain control of the House. Here is what House Majority Whip Steve Scalise told Maria yesterday morning on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: The plans to continue focusing on getting the economy moving, seeing this great economic growth, and then locking it in. We're going to bring some more bills to cut taxes, we're going to make the tax cuts permanent. That bill Chairman Brady, his committee are already working on. We just did a jobs 3.0 bill.</p><p>A bill to provide more regulatory relief and do some things that will help create more jobs and rebuild the middle class.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is it enough for you as people head to the polls if the House passed that? And the Senate already showing resistance to it.</p><p>RENACCI: Well, I can tell you in Ohio, tax 1.0 is working. Companies are now reinvesting, I had a company went from 70 to 140 employees already. I have companies who are talking about expanding. They're also giving bonuses out to their employees, they're raising wages. So as I travel, Ohio people are very happy. Now, if we can lock that in which is important because the only reason it's not locked in its gimmicks in Washington.</p><p>I mean, I'm a business guy. I always chuckle at some of these little gimmicks we have. We couldn't lock in it because of this rule or that rule. So let's lock it in, let's make sure people have certainty and predictability. I think that's going to be the second thing. And also on 2.0, we're going to be talking about savings. So I think that's another issue. These -- a lot of people back in Ohio are now getting more money in their pockets.</p><p>We need to make sure they can save it and use it for their -- whether it's education, whatever. So those -- that's what 2.0 is going to be all about. I think it's -- can be best explained that way when I travel the state.</p><p>SPICER: I think the other thing is -- I mean, look, elections are binary choice and it's not just what Jim Renacci is for, it's what Sherrod Brown isn't for. And that's a thing -- it's a big contrast that Ohio voters are going to face. It's not just are you going to keep more, we're going talk about economic expansion, it's what Sherrod Brown isn't going to do to help Ohio businesses and families. I mean, that's pretty much.</p><p>RENACCI: Well, that's true too. And I mean, it's polar total opposites because I'm running against somebody who didn't support the tax cuts bill.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not one Democrat voted for the tax cut so -- but then they were upset. You heard this from Nancy Pelosi but then they're upset that the individual tax cuts weren't permanent and they keep -- or they're now worried about the debt and the deficit all of a sudden, so which is it? And you don't get -- you don't get to say because she didn't vote.</p><p>RENACCI: Right. And, again, here is the issue for me. I came here as a businessman and now I look at the numbers, 85 percent of our deficit or things unrelated to the tax cut and the tax cut actually if it grows the economy which it's doing and we get sustained growth over three percent, then it will pay for itself and it will grow the economy and it will pay the debt down. So that's the key.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Speaking of which, we're going to get the first reading on second quarter growth. And the -- it's going to be likely north of four percent. The Wall Street Journal estimate is 4.2, the GDP now from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank is 4-1/2, they're whisperer is coming out of White House, it's going to be north 4-1/2. But again, does that stick with people. Does that -- the number resonate or are they already feeling that?</p><p>BELL: I think they're feeling it. We've discussed it earlier in the show, the consumers, the everyday people, working class people are out there feeling the benefits in their paychecks, they're feeling better but, you know, we have the most jobs available out there with the lowest jobless rate that we've seen in almost 20 years. The consumers feeling good, confidence remains high so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you see that in this Wall Street Journal NBC News poll that found half of registered voters approve of the President handling of the economy. His highest mark on that question in the survey. That same poll found that President's approval rating edged higher even during the week, Lee Carter, when he came under criticism for his handling of that Helsinki Summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>The President's approval rating rose to 45 percent. That is the highest of his presidency.</p><p>CARTER: It is. And there's two reasons why. I think number one, we can't forget the importance of the Supreme Court to voters out there. I think Republicans will support the President almost no matter what because that is so, so, so important to them. And the other thing is, I think Democrats really blew it big in the way that they responded to Helsinki and the President's comments.</p><p>Because well, a lot of people were rightfully upset by what the President did say. He later tried to correct himself. I think that the hysteria that happened over that actually made people more likely defend the President that anything else. So the Democrats really think and the media really needs to learn how to balance their coverage and say, well, we might be concerned, we don't have to get hysterical over it if they won't make any moves here.</p><p>It's also important to know though that even though these are -- these are pretty high rates, this isn't necessarily significant in that other presidents have had higher approval ratings at the same point, but I think it's telling.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real quick, Congressman, but we have -- potentially Vladimir Putin coming to the United States for another summit right before people go to the polls in November. Are you concerned about that?</p><p>RENACCI: Not at all. I think this is -- again, the President has to be able to negotiate even with some of the people that are enemies of us and I think that's the key. So we will continue to go and as we said, this confidence is going to continue to build. I want to go back whether you're firefighter or police, your 401(k)s and your pensions are going up and that's positive.</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) thank you, Congressman Renacci. Still to come, an unexpected leadership shake-up at FiatChrysler. The details are the automaker's longtime CEO is stepping down due to health issues. Plus, Hasbro and Halliburton reporting quarterly earnings this morning. We break down those numbers.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA. I'm Nicole Petallides live on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow futures this morning only slightly to the downside, down six of the Dow Jones Industrial average. And it's earning season, the big, big week here, 170 S&amp; 500 companies coming out with numbers.</p><p>We'll kick it off with two that have reported this morning including Halliburton and Hasbro. So Halliburton is looking to downside to the tune of about to 1.1 percent while Hasbro is jumping 10percent. The Halliburton in particular, it was in line earnings per share, that's why you're seeing a little bit of selling, everybody is getting so used to be so far this season. The estimates were 20.5 percent growth year-over-year for earnings.</p><p>And in fact, we've seen most of these companies beating, so we've seen over 21percent but Halliburton did have quarterly revenue on the rise, higher oil prices and more rigs at work. Hasbro as I noted up 10-1/2 percent there, topping and soaring as it handily beat those analysts' estimates for profit and sales by a wide margin.</p><p>At then we'll watch for Alphabet, Google after the bell today. That will be key, not only will they watch for consistent revenue gains but also some of those other areas, apps, pixel smartphones, licensing also cloud computing stock just down a quarter of one percent right now. So keep it right here because coming up, former FBI Director James Comey is getting political once again.</p><p>Why he is urging Democrats to not lose their minds and rush to the socialist left. It's all ahead. Plus, spice up your office space. Details on the new cubicle inspired by Superman that costs over $8,000. That is all later this hour. Keep it right here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. Let's kick off this new week with slightly lower futures, five -- four-point loss on the Dow futures right now. But again, the direction this week will be decided by earnings. Alphabet, the parent of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter all set to report quarterly results this week. Alphabet kicks things off after the close today. The Google parent company reporting after the bell.</p><p>Joining is now beyond sport global ambassador, Fox News contributor, my dear friend, John Layfield. John, your expectation for earnings going into this week?</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think we have another great earning season. The last earnings season that we had was the best earnings beat in 25 years since the early 1990s. We're seeing so far a third of S&amp;P 500 companies reported, 87 percent have had earnings expectations that had an upside on those earnings, the estimates that they've had. So it's going to be interesting to see what we're going to see these earnings.</p><p>Especially when you have automakers reporting this week. We have G.M. and Ford which I own both reporting. They've already have commodity inflation problems. So interesting to see how whether hedge for these tariffs going forward and how these tariffs are going to affect projections going forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lindsey, some other companies to watch are these industrial companies. I think Whirlpool, Harley-Davidson or two of the names out with earnings this week. We will be listening for those even 3M listening for the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs. And any kind of supply chain disruption these companies are experiencing.</p><p>BELL: Absolutely. We're seeing these companies, 94 percent of the industrial companies that have reported have beat on both the top and the bottom line. The stocks are reacting really well, the question, John, is I don't know if you have a thought on this, it feels like the question is, is -- are orders being pulled forward? Is the second quarter coming in significantly better than expected?</p><p>Because people are trying to get ahead of tariffs and that's what's causing raised guidance for full year or are we just doing better than we thought?</p><p>LAYFIELD: That's a great question, Lindsey. And it's a little bit of both. We are seeing earnings pulled forward, people getting around these tariffs. So you're seeing lot of stuff shift early because of this, but you are seeing better-than-expected. We're going to have a -- look like a four percent GDP. That's going to be a little inflated because people are getting these orders out there ahead of these tariffs.</p><p>The earnings season this year, I mean, this is the dichotomy of this administration. We're going to have 20 percent earnings a gain this quarter. About 35 to 40 percent of that comes from these tax cuts. So the administration has done a great job in spurring this economy that is already long in the tooth in this bull market to revitalization. The problem is all 100 percent. Now black cloud is these tariffs.</p><p>And what can happen if the potential trade war happens. It could negate everything that happens with these tax cuts.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But so far, John, it looks like the markets are giving the White House, giving administration some breathing room on how long do you think that can last? I mean to your point, we're going to get guidance this week from some major industrial companies, the automakers about any potential fallout?</p><p>LAYFIELD: I think it starts until it starts significantly hurting, you know, it's easy when you talk about a potential trade war. We're actually in a trade war right now no matter what level of that trade war we're in, we're actually in one right now. You look at Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake, they're all reducing headcount right now in their newspaper business because of the tariffs that we have on Canadian paper.</p><p>So you're starting to see problems right now, you see soybeans, you see livestock right now, you see a glut of that going on because we have two problems. We had a huge amount of livestock produced this year and we also have these tariffs that are coming also. We have a glut. Until you start seeing these -- Americans start being hurt which I think we're going to start seeing, I think you give the President a pass on this, this is negotiations.</p><p>But this is sticking and matched next to (INAUDIBLE) and say, hey, I'm going to blow up everything if you don't agree. It is a dangerous, dangerous game we're playing right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John, how do you structure portfolio around that? Because again you're not getting paid that much to own fixed income here. How do you allocate money?</p><p>LAYFIELD: I think dividend stocks become to de facto bonds like they had been for the past several years. I know interest rates are rising but that's still a play. Look, you have problems in the E.U. If Englands are upset of the E.U., which it looks like they're probably going to do with probably a hard Brexit, that takes out a huge amount of fees going to E.U. The E.U. looks like it could break up especially we started losing smaller parts like Italy and somebody else follows.</p><p>You look at the problems in China right now, the U.S. stock market is still the place to be and I think dividend stocks are going to be the safe play going forward because I don't think people know what's going to happen with this market. This market should be significantly higher. This economy is absolutely on fire. The only black cloud right now is the trade tariffs and that's why I will stay with dividend stocks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I'll say this ahead of the head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker is going to be at the White House on Wednesday, maybe you get some positive developments out of that meeting? You never know.</p><p>LAYFIELD: He doesn't have high expectations according to people around him but you're right, we could have something, a big upside surprise come out of that. I wouldn't be surprised if the E.U. says, you know, we're just going to drop the 10 percent tariffs on cars and then see what the President does because it's really about those tariffs then the President will drop it and this trade war could end at least with our friends here.</p><p>The problem we have with Europe right now is they're now negotiations deals with our trading partners that are our neighbors in Canada and Mexico. This could be long-term structural damage if we don't get in front of this right now and try to work out something with Mr. Juncker when he visits this week.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. That tariff that we have on light trucks that are imported, it's a 25 percent tariff, it's called the chicken tax among people I grew up with because it was retaliation to this fight we had with Europe over poultry in 1964 I think. So, you think tariffs can't hang around? That one has been around since before I was born. Thank you, John. And before you were born too, I should point out. John Layfield.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Always great to see you, my friend. Coming up. Escalating tensions with Iran. The new warning from President Trump after Iran's leader says any conflict with the country would lead to the mother of all wars. Plus, a surprise shake-up at FiatChrysler. Details on the unexpected changes after the automaker's long-time CEO steps down ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Monday, July 23rd, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. One big week for earnings, one-third of the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 reporting, this week, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, all on deck.</p><p>This afternoon's big reveal will be from Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Take a look at how the stock is premarket. Let's take a look at the Futures across the board, the Dow and S&amp;P did manage to eke out small gains last week, and they're up to -- they are in the green right now.</p><p>The NASDAQ, 100, the Futures there are lower as the NASDAQ was, last week, slipping. In Europe, markets are headed lower this morning as well, losses across the board. The CAC Quarante in France, the biggest loser down half of one percent.</p><p>The Asian markets finishing mixed, the Nikkei ending down more than one percent, one and a third percent, to be exact, the KOSPI in South Korea also losing almost nine-tenth of one percent.</p><p>President Trump tweeting out to the president of Iran last night, with a firm warning, saying not to threaten the U.S. or else, and former FBI Director James Comey, cautioning the Dems on twitter. He says, don't vote for whatever socialist -- Democratic socialist, whatever they are calling today.</p><p>FiatChrysler stock almost three percent in the red in premarket trading on the sudden replacement of the company's well-known CEO, Sergio Marchionne, over the weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUPERMAN: This is a job for Superman.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And in celebration of Superman's 88th birthday, one company's got a box for you. Now, all is a Superman themed cubicle, modelled after the same telephone booth that the Man of Steel used to get changed in, with a few modern perks, red cape, not included.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, President Trump giving a stern warning to Iran, escalating a war of words with the country's leader, Kristina Partsinevelos is live at the White House with the very latest. Good morning, Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. And you are right, the escalation has continued, the rhetoric between both countries Iran and United States, why is this happening, why is the President tweeting in all caps?</p><p>This comes after the president of Iran gave a speech on Sunday to his population, and he said, that if any conflict bn between the United States and Iran, occurs, then it would be the mother of all wars.</p><p>President Trump took to twitter yesterday, in all capitals, when in the online world, essentially means yelling, he wrote, never, ever threaten United States again, or you will suffer consequences the likes of when few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words or violence and death. Be cautious.</p><p>And when I say the rhetoric has continued to escalate, you know that the United States has pulled out of Iran nuclear deal in 20 -- or 2015 Iran nuclear deal in May. Just last month, the United States said that they were going to impose sanctions against any exports leaving Iran.</p><p>This comes at a time when the country in Iran is suffering. The economy is not doing so well and that had a huge effect on the price of oil. Today, we're seeing a trade just around $68.92. But over the past two months, you've seen it fluctuate quite a bit and climb higher because of the lack of supply around the globe, especially coming from Iran.</p><p>Iran has retaliated saying that they too will block any type of shipments coming out of there. But so far, it's just back and forth rhetoric between the two countries. And it's only Monday morning, 8:00 a.m. and we're getting all this news. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kristina, thank you for delivering it to us, Kristina Partsinevelos, at the White House for us. Sean, I want to get your reaction to the President's tweet, especially since it seems to be one of the --you know, message control is the most impossible thing to do.</p><p>They're in the White House, because again, that's the President, tweeting out.</p><p>SPICER: I mean, the beauty is everyone knows talks about transparency. I mean, you are hearing directly from him what he thinks, when he tweets like this.</p><p>And if I were President Rouhani, I would take caution in making some of those outlandish statements, threatening United States, because I think this president doesn't like to be looked at like that and he will take swift indecisive action.</p><p>So, Rouhani may forget that we can all hear what he says, when he does it in the modern world, but that was a mistake on his part.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Iran was still firing, firing missiles after the Iran nuclear deal was done with death to America, death to Israel.</p><p>SPICER: And I don't think this President -- this President-- you know, Kristina mentioned it, but he -- this -- the Iran nuclear deal is something that is he is consistently talked about being a bad deal, and if Iran ups the game, he is going to do something.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And now, Europe has to come to us to get -- basically get waivers from sanctions that we are preparing to impose on Iran.</p><p>The President tweeted again, this morning, on Russia, when you hear the fake news talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all that I gave up, remember, I gave up nothing, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the corrupt media.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sean, your take on that? Again, the fact that it was discussed that the likes of Michael McFaul, the former ambassador to Russia, that Putin says to our President, why I want to interview these Americans. The fact that that even came up was bothersome to many.</p><p>SPICER: Well, but, again, I don't -- part of what we don't know is what exactly was said, the context it was said, and what Trump did or did not respond. I think the White House has made it very clear that the idea that Russia would interrogate any United States citizen, never mind the former ambassador, is fairly laughable.</p><p>And I think it's good that they clarified these kinds of things because it's not -- I mean, the idea that a former government official would be interrogated by any country, never mind Russia in Putin, is something that we should be very clear about what our nation's position is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If Putin -- assuming that Putin does come to the United States right before the midterm elections and there was a second summit on U.S. soil, be sure that there will be people in that tete-a-tete.</p><p>SPICER: Well, I think the President is seeing the reaction that he saw walking out of that summit. I think they're going to come in to any kind of future summit with their A game.</p><p>CARTER: Do you think that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, you are saying that wasn't the President's A game?</p><p>SPICER: No, I think that they -- after meeting with Kim, I think they looked at the model and they were -- there was largely a lot of praise coming from that, how the President had handled that meeting, how the reaction had been in terms of him engaging with Kim, talking about denuclearization in the peninsula.</p><p>And I think that this Helsinki summit seemed to follow a very similar pattern. I don't think that they fully appreciated the reaction that Putin would get, versus Kim.</p><p>CARTER: I also think the President didn't help himself with some of the statements that he made, following, right? Where he was almost -- seemed like he was (INAUDIBLE) more with Russia than --</p><p>SPICER: Sure. And I think it's a good thing that they went out and clarified.</p><p>CARTER: Now, how do you think -- what do you think about his clarification? Do you think that was enough? Do you think people buy it?</p><p>SPICER: You know, so far, it seems like they do, I think it's important. I mean, look, he has been -- it's good that he clarified it. And, you know, I -- talk -- there is an intensity to this White House of how they cover it -- how they cover this president unlike ever before.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The (INAUDIBLE) and the media.</p><p>SPICER: The media. And that's why I wrote a book that literally goes through a lot of these big moments and how -- thank you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm holding - I was going to ask you about this.</p><p>SPICER: OK. What I mean, I think that there is a level of intensity in scrutiny that in past administrations, they haven't had to face.</p><p>MCDOWELL: True. But it's called the briefing politics, the press and the President. I would say, you put the words, the press, on the front cover of a book, that doesn't really help sales, my friend.</p><p>SPICER: Well, I will --</p><p>MCDOWELL: People hate the --</p><p>SPICER: But I think part of what people want to know is, what is it really like inside? And that's the thing. You see one thing on television. You get to see us sitting here at the table. What's going on behind-the- scenes?</p><p>And part of the reason that I wrote the book is that the press gets to have their say. They get to put in paper, or put on television what they want you to see, what they want you to read. What I wanted to do is take readers behind-the-scenes and say, this is what's actually happening when - - that you don't see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But -- is it safe to say that this is a President, this is a man, the leader of the country who if you are trying to craft a message, you can't control the message, because he is going to say what he wants to say, and you are more crisis response or just a respond --</p><p>SPICER: I was going to say -- I wouldn't say no, because -- I mean, right, I think you are clearly in response, he is the leader.</p><p>And that is a very different role than I normally played many -- most press people where your job is to craft and execute a message and a plan. This president leads the way in every one of those fronts.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There hasn't been any lasting fallout for the President or even the White House. I would argue for anything that on Twitter. And even --</p><p>SPICER: No, in fact, I wouldn't. But that's probably why one of the reasons he won. I mean, he has been -- and I write about all of these instances were any other political candidate would have been left for dead. I mean, I guarantee you, if a candidate for office went to Lee and said, poll what I just did.</p><p>It would come back and say, you're dead. Get out of the race. And what this President, every time, not only picked himself up, but in most cases, came up stronger.</p><p>CARTER: And it's part of -- I mean, it is part of who he is, right? I think people wanted somebody who is going to go down, shape things up and do things differently than it's ever been before. And so the fact that he does this and continues to do it, I think, just reinforces that message.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to get to Jim Comey, yes, Jim Comey, the midterm elections, three months away, Former FBI Director, Comey, issuing a warning to Democrats.</p><p>He tweeted this, yesterday, Democrats, please, please don't lose your minds and rush to the socialist left. This president and his Republican Party are counting on you to do exactly that. America's great middle wants sensible, balanced, ethical leadership.</p><p>But where is the sensible balanced ethical candidate who's running for the Democrat?</p><p>SPICER: Well, his tweet's a little too late. I mean, that run to the left, already happened. So, he's a little late on his tweet. I mean, that's the problem. They are now having a -- they're tripping over themselves, to go further and further to the left.</p><p>They are not progressives. I mean, they are now like Bernie Sanders, was a socialist running for president and was -- at one point, viewed as the extreme. He's now become the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and you have to go further and further to the left, to get traction.</p><p>CARTER: You know, I just wonder, though, I can't -- I look at all of this and I think I don't necessarily believe that it's a whole of the Democrats that are going left. I think that it's a socialists, the far left, it's the only part of the party that has a message that resonates to people because they are talking about things that matter most.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're lying to the American people.</p><p>CARTER: Whether or not --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know that they're absolutely lying.</p><p>CARTER: They're saying something besides resist.</p><p>SPICER: To your point, I mean, you can talk about all of these things at some point. They never tell you about the price tag. They never talk about the economic consequences that these policies would have on our economy.</p><p>Walking around and telling everyone that everything is going to be free, is a great message. But the reality is, it's unsustainable, and it is not something that is a direction in our country that we have been against for a long time. We have been against socialism and against a lot of this stuff.</p><p>And now, we're talking about -- in the other day, they talked about the minimum income -- you know, were people will be given a -- like, that's insane. The idea we should be talking about is how do we create an economy that allows people to have the opportunities that they need, how do we provide a social safety net.</p><p>But the idea that we're talking about guaranteeing everybody all of this free stuff, is unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real quick, in your book, you don't believe, as the President suggested that most media is the enemy of the state.</p><p>SPICER: No. I wrote about it. I actually write that there are a lot of good reporters, and that we need in a democracy a robust and active press corps, that's essential to our democracy. But what we need to do is know where the line is. Call out bad reporters and bad stories and also praise good reports and good stories.</p><p>And it is not about being tough that reporters should be in pursuit of the truth. They should write tough, tough stories.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>SPICER: But they should be called out when they are wrong.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And cut out the rehearsed hysteria, right, the rehearsed sneering. Coming up, legend in the auto industry, stepping down. The surprise leadership shake-up after FiatChrysler CEO resigned. Plus, earning season in full swing, Stuart Varney weighs in, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A busy week in the world of Wall Street. No, America! Tech -- big tech companies: Alphabet, that's parent of Google, Facebook, reporting earnings this week. Also, we get the first reading on how fast the economy was growing during the second quarter. Everybody is watching it, especially, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney. I love it when you talk earnings and economic numbers because I know that that's --</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: No, you don't. You don't. You hate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I do. Actually, I love it because --</p><p>VARNEY: I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to earnings --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's not true. Again, who held onto his Microsoft stock? You. What stock hit an all-time high on Friday? Microsoft. There you go.</p><p>VARNEY: I had nothing to do with earnings per share. I couldn't tell you. Or, QE3 or anything else, and believe me, it didn't. Look, I think this is a pivotal week. The stuff going on this week which would make an enormous difference to your money. As you said, Dagen, first of all, you got the earnings from big tech, it's a big week for big tech. Here they come, we're going to find out how much money they've made and how much they expect to make in the future. That will have a significant impact on those stocks, big tech stocks, which have been leading this market for at least a couple of years. Then, we've got the GDP numbers, that's Friday morning, 8:30 Eastern Time. I know you will be covering it and so will we. I'm expecting around four percent growth per year, annualized growth, four percent.</p><p>Now, that would be a blockbuster news item because we've never achieved that rate of growth in the last four -- I think it's been four years since we had a four percent quarter. And then, don't forget, Wednesday, we have the Europeans coming over here, top-level delegation coming over to the White House. They're talking trade. There's the possibility of a breakthrough right there. Either that or a breakdown, one of the two, and that again makes this a very pivotal week. So, I'm glad everybody is tuning in, it's worthwhile.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What if we get -- and so much -- I've talked till I'm blue in the face about these potential tariffs on automobile imports and how that would hurt U.S. carmakers and any carmaker abroad or here at home, so many of the foreign automakers have plants here, produce most of the cars that they sell here, in fact. But Stuart, what if we do get a breakthrough, what if we do have, hey, we're just going to get rid of all of the auto tariffs between Europe and the United States? We're safe in the next three years. What if that happens, it would be incredible?</p><p>VARNEY: Huge for the markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>VARNEY: I think the summer rally has been held back by all those negative trade headlines. It's not being pushed down so much as held back I would say. But if you get a breakthrough Wednesday, and they come out with at least a lessening of the tension, an agreement in some form or other to just maybe get rid of some tariffs, that I think would be absolutely huge, that would really set the stage for a big rally.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think about this every morning when I get up. That is the danger of always being negative and --</p><p>VARNEY: Wait a minute, wait a minute. The first thing you think of when you wake up in the morning, is, oh, the Europeans are coming to a trade deal. I don't believe it, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, being positive and making sure that you don't look at everything through a negative lens because again, then you miss all the good stuff.</p><p>VARNEY: That's the whole point about the Trump presidency, isn't it? Think positive. He's winning, the economy is expanding, we've got prosperity coming at us. You know, think positive, that's why the market is up so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And even with some mean tweets, that's why his approval ratings are up, too. Stuart, great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY: True. Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stuart Varney, he starts in 10 minutes every day, 9:00 a.m. to noon. Coming up, a phone booth worthy of Superman. Details on the new office cubicle that will cost you over $8,000, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The death toll rising in last night's mass shooting in Toronto. Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Dagen, we just got an update from police. A second victim has died from the rampage, a gunman shot 14 people including a young girl in Toronto. The 29-year-old suspect's body was later found at the scene, but it's not clear at this point whether the man actually killed himself or he was shot by police. All of this happened in the Toronto neighborhood known as Greektown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would say I heard at least 20 shots in intervals. You know, clippings spent, reloading, clipping spent, reloading, clipping spent, that's what I heard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, investigators are trying to find a motive. Police say they would not rule out, at this point, terrorism.</p><p>Well, tragedy in Maryland overnight after a firefighter died while battling a massive seven alarm blaze. The unidentified firefighter, a 13-year veteran fell through the floor. Three people who were inside the house were able to get out, though, in time. The cause of the fire under investigation, but lightning could be the cause.</p><p>Well, some stunning news over the weekend at a change at the top for FiatChrysler. Long-time CEO Sergio Marchionne has been replaced. Marchionne underwent shoulder surgery three weeks ago but in those three weeks, his condition has somehow worsened. We're looking for more details. Now, Mike Manley, who runs the Jeep, SUV, and Ram truck division is the new CEO. While the stock is something to watch today, shares are actually lower in the premarket, it's down more than three percent right now. Again, stunning news over the weekend for this company.</p><p>Well, a Superman solution for workers who want more privacy, for the first time in 80 years, the Superman cubicle booth is available for purchase. It fits two people inside -- if that makes sense -- it comes with modern necessities like USB outlets and an Ethernet connection, LED lights. You're going to have to make more money than Clark Kent, though, it's actually running about $8500 per booth. And by the way, in the description it doesn't mention to actually having a phone. I don't think people use those anymore, all right.</p><p>And then, finally, there is this, we've been watching this clip over and over again this morning on the show. It appears to show a grown man stealing a foul ball from a child. Well, the Chicago Cubs saw the situation play out in real-time. They ended up giving the young boy an autographed baseball instead. But it turns out the man that everybody is criticizing had helped that boy get a foul ball earlier in the game. You can see him holding a game-used baseball next to his new autographed one, obviously. Yes. So, maybe the guy in the clip isn't as mean as we all think, and we're all beating up on him this morning. So, I wanted to, you know, give you some new details on this developing story in baseball. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Glad I didn't call him a lot of mean -- maybe.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, I think he's -- I think he's a little on a defensive.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The child deserves all the foul balls. How about that, though?</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, some final thoughts from our all-stars. We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lindsey Bell, Lee Carter, quick final thoughts. Five seconds.</p><p>SPICER: I'm glad to be here to kick off the briefing. Thanks for having me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stuart Varney, take it away, Sir.</p><p>VARNEY: I'm surprised at Sean Spicer. I thought he got more to him than that one. He had at least five seconds to spare there.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SPICER: I yield it to you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, you're a good man.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018072303cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVY-HS41-JB20-G2M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 23, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002R1H</classCode><className>FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES NV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES &amp;

Frank[1] The Telecom Industry can't even say that 5G technology[2] is safe. Insurance companies[3] don't even cover them anymore - it's too risky. [embedded content] The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is also being investigated for COLLUSION[4] with the Telecom Industry regarding already passed federal 5G legislation[5] that eliminated municipal control over the installation of risky and harmful 4G[6] and 5G small cell tower and infrastructure technology.An increasing number of Americans are fighting this legislation[7] - and installation - everywhere including doctors, elected[8] officials, environmentalists[9], scientists[10], and tribal groups. </p><p>Not only that - embarrassingly awful Internet of Things (IoT) technology is part of the 5G game plan[11]. IoT has been lambasted by security experts[12] for the past few years because of its almost 75% failure rate[13]. Almost 75%! By most people's standards -probably even Trump's - IoT would be considered for losers[14]. Even more bizarre - since Trump can't stop insisting we need better national security, why would he support the installation of IoT anywhere? Besides it being a cybersecurity nightmare - incorporating all of this new related technology[15] is part of the Green New Deal[16] which Trump has vehemently claimed is un-American. Regardless - Trump tweeted yesterday in support of harmful 5G and even 6G technology. (See 1[17], 2[18], 3[19]) Has 6G even been tested yet? All of this completely contradicts Trump's campaign promise to 'Give the country back to the people.' So WTF? More details from Jon Rappoport[20]:'Along with the 5G there is another thing coming \u2014 Internet of Things. If you look at itthe radiation level is going to increase tremendously and yet the industry is very excited about it they project 5G/IoT business to be a $7 trillion business.' \u2014 Prof. Girish Kumar, Professor at Electrical Engineering Department at IIT Bombay 5G, the latest and greatest method of faster wireless transmission, is coming on with a storm. I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard. American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind. There is no reason that we should be lagging behind on \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2019[21].something that is so obviously the future. I want the United States to win through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies. We must always be the leader in everything we do, especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology! \u2014 Donald J.

This is a global operation, and many governments are backing the push. And the consumer gets what? The ability to watch the reruns of Law...er he's already watching? His current TV reception isn't good enough? The appliances in his home will all be connected to Internet and talk to each other and spy on him and record his energy use, in conjunction with smart meters, for the Greater Good. Somehow, you really need your toaster connected to the Internet? You want that? You can't get along without that? UNDOUBTEDLY, A KEY PART OF THE 5G PROGRAM IS, EVENTUALLY, MASSIVE NUMBERS OF DRIVERLESS CARS ON ROADS ALL OVER THE WORLD. This is the plan. Cars are connected and talk to each other. Humans play no role in this. The Technocratic Internet of Things decides how, at any given moment, to regulate traffic flows. Humans learn to be passive. AND WITH THE INTERNET OF THINGS[23], THE TECHNOCRATIC ELITE WILL BE ABLE TO INSTALL ENERGY-USE QUOTAS AND CEILINGS FOR EVERY PERSON AND EXERT TOP-DOWN CONTROL ON THE PLANET. 'Mr. Jones, this is the voice of your house speaking. You have reached the assigned limit of your energy use for the month. Try to get along without energy until next month's allotment comes online' From electricsense.com (5/12/17)[24],; '5G and IoT [Internet of Things] promises to connect us in our homes, schools, workplaces, cities, parks and open spaces to over a trillion objects around the world. It promises cars that drive themselves, washing machines that order their own washing powder and softener plus of course super fast downloads and streaming.' '5G will utilize smaller cell stations (and the technology of beamforming) that'll scramble/unscramble and redirect packets of data on a no-interference path back to us. This could mean wireless antennas on every lamp post, utility pole, home and business throughout entire neighborhoods, towns and cities.' 'Thousands of studies link low-level wireless radio frequency radiation exposures to a long list of adverse biological effects, including:DNA single and double strand breaks oxidative damage disruption of cell metabolism increased blood brain barrier permeability melatonin reduction disruption to brain glucose metabolism generation of stress proteins'So how does competing to win the race to be the first to install any of this risky new technology[25] 'Make America Great Again'?

And he conveniently avoided the fact that some of the banned users are extremists who make a living by deceiving their fans.</p><p>His posts were a rallying cry, full of resentment toward Big Tech. He said \"It's getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!\"</p><p>But Facebook executives say this has nothing to do with ideology or political party -- it's about safety.</p><p>\"We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,\" a Facebook spokesperson told CNN Business when the bans were put into effect on Thursday.</p><p>The action affected Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who's notorious for using anti-Semitic language; Paul Nehlen, an anti-Semite who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2016 and 2018; and far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.</p><p>Jones and his media outlet InfoWars had previously been banned from Facebook, but had maintained a presence on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. Jones and InfoWars have now been evicted from Instagram as well, although there are questions about how thoroughly the ban is being applied.</p><p>The other banned individuals are the fringe right-wing media personalities Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer.</p><p>The president is showing particular support for Watson, an InfoWars personality notorious for spreading misinformation. (In the past, Watson has peddled conspiracy theories about the unsolved murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich, the September 11 terrorist attacks, and so-called \"chemtrails.\")</p><p>On Friday night Trump tweeted about Watson's ban, and on Saturday morning he retweeted a video Watson made criticizing Facebook about it.</p><p>He also retweeted a bizarre video about Islam from a user named \"Deep State Exposed.\" And he called out Twitter, on Twitter, for blocking actor and right-wing personality James Woods' account.</p><p>A Twitter spokesman confirmed that Woods' account will be restored if he deletes a flagged tweet that violated the site's rules.</p><p>For the president and his allies, all of this contributes to a familiar storyline. Republican leaders and right-wing media outlets have been loudly accusing social media giants of bias and censorship at the same time that the companies have been taking steps to reduce toxic content on their sites.</p><p>The president has repeatedly cherry-picked examples to make his case against the sites. On Friday night he claimed that \"Diamond and Silk,\" a pro-Trump duo, have been \"treated so horribly by Facebook\" and \"we're looking into\" it.</p><p>\"I am continuing to monitor the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms,\" Trump said in a separate tweet. \"This is the United States of America ? and we have what's known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH! We are monitoring and watching, closely!!\"</p><p/><p>Users do not have government-protected freedom of speech on privately-owned platforms like Facebook.</p><p>The president recently invited Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to the White House for a meeting that touched on Twitter's rules and other topics.</p><p>Hours before the April 23 sit-down, Trump complained (on Twitter) that the site is \"very discriminatory\" and does not \"treat me well as a Republican.\" He accused the company of \"constantly taking people off list\" -- an apparent reference to Twitter's efforts to weed out bots and other fake followers platform-wide that artificially inflate follower counts of users, including the president's.</p><p>Claims of Big Tech censorship have also made their way to Congress. Lawmakers have held various hearings this year on the so-called practice of \"social media filtering.\" At the hearings, Republicans like Steve King of Iowa have cited articles from far-right media outlets like the Gateway Pundit to accuse social media companies of bias against conservatives.

Fiona Hill, formerly Trump s top adviser on Russia and Ukraine, testified for more than nine hours on Monday before members and aides of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And a number of top Trump officials and associates including  Vice President Mike Pence, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani   are facing deadlines this week to comply with Democratic demands for documents related to the president s efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate  former Vice President Joe Biden s  family.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Yet as Democrats enter the fourth week of their impeachment inquiry,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"and other party leaders are wrestling with a number of key decisions, including when and how to take their case to the American public. So far, polls show support rising for Trump s impeachment, yet the public remains ambivalent about actually removing him from office. And the GOP base remains solidly behind Trump, as do Republican lawmakers.</p><p> For Republicans, Trump s behavior is growing more unpredictable even as his reelection campaign moves forward, making it harder to defend the president even as their political futures are increasingly tied to his own. Trump s pullout from Syria, which has left the U.S.-allied Kurds to fend for themselves, has angered Republicans more than any action he s taken since assuming office in January 2017, rattling the GOP national security and foreign policy establishments to the core.

(Another person in the room initially said Mr. Bolton referred to Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mulvaney, but two others said he cited Mr. Sondland.)

Jeb Bush (R) in 2016, Sondland  made a political about-face and backed  Trump,  a candidate he once said was out of touch with his  personal beliefs and values on so many levels.  After the election, Sondland contributed $1 million to Trump s inaugural committee. And he began calling in political favors including from  former White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus   to convince Trump that he could be a team player. </p><p> Now, the lengths to which Sondland would go to impress Trump and to advance the president s agenda in Ukraine as U.S. ambassador to the European Union have made him a central figure in the congressional impeachment inquiry. Sondland is scheduled to testify under subpoena this week before House investigators.

He was domineering and defiant. And he was audacious and cavalier.</p><p>In the three weeks since  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  opened an impeachment inquiry,  Trump  has struck a posture of raw aggression. His visceral defenses of himself at the most vulnerable point of his presidency have shined a spotlight on Trump s state of mind.</p><p> Like an aging rock star, the president is now reprising many of the greatest hits from his hellion days. He has bullied and projected   at times leveling against others the very charges he faces while simultaneously depicting himself as a victim. And he has turned to ominous depictions of America, and in moments sounded an authoritarian tone.

Former administration officials say they ve never been sure if Trump actually believes these theories, or simply sees them an effective political tool to silence critics, batter Democratic rivals and appeal to a slice of his base. His passionate and relentless effort to push the theories suggests the former; his long-running birther lie suggests the latter.  (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/15/trump-conspiracy-impeachment-defense-046284\"> Politico </url>)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SYRIA.</emphasis> Trump s  acquiescence to Turkey s move to send troops deep inside Syrian territory has in only one week s time turned into a bloody carnage, forced the abandonment of a successful five-year-long American project to keep the peace on a volatile border, and given an unanticipated victory to four American adversaries: Russia, Iran, the Syrian government and the Islamic State.</p><p> Rarely has a presidential decision resulted so immediately in what his own party leaders have described as disastrous consequences for American allies and interests. How this decision happened springing from an  off-script moment  with  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan,  in the generous description of a senior American diplomat probably will be debated for years by historians, Middle East experts and conspiracy theorists.</p><p> But this much already is clear: Mr. Trump ignored months of warnings from his advisers about what calamities likely would ensue if he followed his instincts to pull back from Syria and abandon America s longtime allies, the Kurds. He had no Plan B, other than to leave. The only surprise is how swiftly it all collapsed around the president and his depleted, inexperienced foreign policy team.</p><p> Day after day, they have been caught off-guard, offering up differing explanations of what Mr. Trump said to Mr. Erdogan, how the United States and its allies might respond, and even whether Turkey remains an American ally. For a while Mr. Trump said he acted because the Islamic State was already defeated, and because he was committed to terminating  endless wars  by pulling American troops out of the Middle East. By the end of the week he added 2,000 to Saudi Arabia.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC),  who insinuated that Facebook had become a monopoly during a congressional hearing last year; Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has fingered Zuckerberg as contributing to  the death of free speech in America ; and conservative radio talk host Hugh Hewitt, who has cautioned against a DOJ enforcement action but has called for a  new regulatory regime  to minimize  big tech bias  against conservatives.

Trump s  fight to keep his tax returns private is at odds with his own thinking in 2013 and 2014 that releasing them as part of a presidential bid would make him look like a smart businessman who had spent years lowering his taxable income, according to two people with firsthand knowledge of conversations at the time.</p><p> Trump ultimately changed his mind after an adviser says he convinced him not to release his taxes, and he has spent years claiming he can't because he's under audit by the IRS.</p><p>Former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg  tells CNN that during a meeting he had with Trump in the summer of 2013 at Trump Tower, the future president said he was comfortable releasing his tax returns and, even, that he thought it would be a good idea. Nunberg assumed this was because of how little Trump must pay in taxes. </p><p>Nunberg: \"He thought he could defend the return. I inferred from the conversation that he believed that it was a low number and he'd look savvy.\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/14/politics/trump-originally-wanted-to-release-tax-returns/index.html\">CNN</url>)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FARROW.</emphasis>American Media, Inc. and the National Enquirer shredded sensitive Trump-related documents that had been held in a top-secret safe right before  he  was elected in 2016, according to fresh allegations made in a new book by journalist Ronan Farrow.</p><p> During the first week of November 2016, the book alleges that Dylan Howard, who was then editor in chief of the National Enquirer, ordered a staff member to  get everything out of the safe  and that  we need to get a shredder down there. </p><p> His order came the same day a reporter for the Wall Street Journal had called the Enquirer to ask for comment on a story about how AMI, which owns the supermarket tabloid, had paid $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal who said she had had an affair with Trump to keep her quiet right before the election.

He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators.</p><p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference on Thursday would bring together \"digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\"</p><p>But Google, Facebook and Twitter weren't invited, their representatives confirmed. And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications.</p><p>The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren't invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet \"offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.\"</p><p>Its members' platforms \"don't have a political ideology or political bias,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies \"succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.\"</p><p>Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, in a statement, said \"We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.\"</p><p>The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election.</p><p>Trump has played to conservative concerns about bias on other issues. In March, he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding. The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers. But critics called the order unnecessary.</p><p>The president himself was dealt a setback Tuesday in his legal battle against Twitter, his favored means of communicating. A federal appeals court in New York City ruled that the president can't ban critics from his Twitter account, saying the First Amendment calls for more speech, rather than less, on matters of public concern.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter. He has accused Twitter of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\"</p><p>Thursday's conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.</p><p>Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants' market dominance.</p><p>A growing number of lawmakers and some Democratic presidential candidates are talking about tighter regulation of a customarily freewheeling industry or even breaking up the big companies.</p><p>But if Trump is looking for the participating conservative groups to support government action to bring the companies in line on perceived social media bias, he may be disappointed.</p><p>Rob Bluey, vice president for communications at the Heritage Foundation, said that \"if the government were to get involved, it would lead to more problems.\" He said market pressures can produce positive changes.</p><p>Turning Point USA keeps a list of college professors who it says discriminate against students with conservative views. \"I think there will be some form of equilibrium\" between the social media platforms and Americans who hold right-of-center views, Charlie Kirk, the group's executive director, said Tuesday. \"Hopefully these companies can self-correct.\"</p><p>\"Voters will be constructing their choices for 2020\" based largely on information from social media, Kirk said.</p><p>Trump said last week on Fox News that Google, Facebook and Twitter \"are fighting me hard right now, which is incredible because I think the Democrats want to shut them up and, frankly, so do a lot of the Republicans want to shut them up.\"</p><p>Asked whether tech companies may be acting illegally and whether the Justice Department should determine that, Trump replied, \"Well, they could be and I don't want to even say whether or not they're doing something, but I will tell you, there are a lot of people that want us ... to take action against Facebook and against Twitter and, frankly, against Amazon.\"</p><p>Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo last month that he doesn't know if what the companies are doing is illegal but added, \"I tell you what, they should be sued because of what's happening with the bias.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-060f8e089839475da0b31783f810be45</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHX-TJP1-DYN6-W1TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>7:54 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators.</p><p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference on Thursday would bring together \"digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\"</p><p>But Google, Facebook and Twitter weren't invited, their representatives confirmed. And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications.</p><p>The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren't invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet \"offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.\"</p><p>Its members' platforms \"don't have a political ideology or political bias,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies \"succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.\"</p><p>Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, in a statement, said \"We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.\"</p><p>The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election.</p><p>Trump has played to conservative concerns about bias on other issues. In March, he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding. The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers. But critics called the order unnecessary.</p><p>The president himself was dealt a setback Tuesday in his legal battle against Twitter, his favored means of communicating. A federal appeals court in New York City ruled that the president can't ban critics from his Twitter account, saying the First Amendment calls for more speech, rather than less, on matters of public concern.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter. He has accused Twitter of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\"</p><p>Thursday's conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.</p><p>Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants' market dominance.</p><p>A growing number of lawmakers and some Democratic presidential candidates are talking about tighter regulation of a customarily freewheeling industry or even breaking up the big companies.</p><p>But if Trump is looking for the participating conservative groups to support government action to bring the companies in line on perceived social media bias, he may be disappointed.</p><p>Rob Bluey, vice president for communications at the Heritage Foundation, said that \"if the government were to get involved, it would lead to more problems.\" He said market pressures can produce positive changes.</p><p>Turning Point USA keeps a list of college professors who it says discriminate against students with conservative views. \"I think there will be some form of equilibrium\" between the social media platforms and Americans who hold right-of-center views, Charlie Kirk, the group's executive director, said Tuesday. \"Hopefully these companies can self-correct.\"</p><p>\"Voters will be constructing their choices for 2020\" based largely on information from social media, Kirk said.</p><p>Trump said last week on Fox News that Google, Facebook and Twitter \"are fighting me hard right now, which is incredible because I think the Democrats want to shut them up and, frankly, so do a lot of the Republicans want to shut them up.\"</p><p>Asked whether tech companies may be acting illegally and whether the Justice Department should determine that, Trump replied, \"Well, they could be and I don't want to even say whether or not they're doing something, but I will tell you, there are a lot of people that want us ... to take action against Facebook and against Twitter and, frankly, against Amazon.\"</p><p>Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo last month that he doesn't know if what the companies are doing is illegal but added, \"I tell you what, they should be sued because of what's happening with the bias.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-060f8e089839475da0b31783f810be45</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHX-TPP1-JC65-5159-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>7:55 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators.</p><p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference on Thursday would bring together \"digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\"</p><p>But Google, Facebook and Twitter weren't invited, their representatives confirmed. And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications.</p><p>The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren't invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet \"offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.\"</p><p>Its members' platforms \"don't have a political ideology or political bias,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies \"succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.\"</p><p>Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, in a statement, said \"We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.\"</p><p>The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election.</p><p>Trump has played to conservative concerns about bias on other issues. In March, he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding. The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers. But critics called the order unnecessary.</p><p>The president himself was dealt a setback Tuesday in his legal battle against Twitter, his favored means of communicating. A federal appeals court in New York City ruled that the president can't ban critics from his Twitter account, saying the First Amendment calls for more speech, rather than less, on matters of public concern.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter. He has accused Twitter of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\"</p><p>Thursday's conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.</p><p>Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants' market dominance.</p><p>A growing number of lawmakers and some Democratic presidential candidates are talking about tighter regulation of a customarily freewheeling industry or even breaking up the big companies.</p><p>But if Trump is looking for the participating conservative groups to support government action to bring the companies in line on perceived social media bias, he may be disappointed.</p><p>Rob Bluey, vice president for communications at the Heritage Foundation, said that \"if the government were to get involved, it would lead to more problems.\" He said market pressures can produce positive changes.</p><p>Turning Point USA keeps a list of college professors who it says discriminate against students with conservative views. \"I think there will be some form of equilibrium\" between the social media platforms and Americans who hold right-of-center views, Charlie Kirk, the group's executive director, said Tuesday. \"Hopefully these companies can self-correct.\"</p><p>\"Voters will be constructing their choices for 2020\" based largely on information from social media, Kirk said.</p><p>Trump said last week on Fox News that Google, Facebook and Twitter \"are fighting me hard right now, which is incredible because I think the Democrats want to shut them up and, frankly, so do a lot of the Republicans want to shut them up.\"</p><p>Asked whether tech companies may be acting illegally and whether the Justice Department should determine that, Trump replied, \"Well, they could be and I don't want to even say whether or not they're doing something, but I will tell you, there are a lot of people that want us ... to take action against Facebook and against Twitter and, frankly, against Amazon.\"</p><p>Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo last month that he doesn't know if what the companies are doing is illegal but added, \"I tell you what, they should be sued because of what's happening with the bias.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-060f8e089839475da0b31783f810be45</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHX-TK01-DYN6-W1XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>7:55 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators.</p><p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference on Thursday would bring together \"digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\"</p><p>But Google, Facebook and Twitter weren't invited, their representatives confirmed. And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications.</p><p>The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren't invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly leveled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet \"offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.\"</p><p>Its members' platforms \"don't have a political ideology or political bias,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies \"succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.\"</p><p>Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, in a statement, said \"We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.\"</p><p>The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election.</p><p>Trump has played to conservative concerns about bias on other issues. In March, he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding. The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers. But critics called the order unnecessary.</p><p>The president himself was dealt a setback Tuesday in his legal battle against Twitter, his favored means of communicating. A federal appeals court in New York City ruled that the president can't ban critics from his Twitter account, saying the First Amendment calls for more speech, rather than less, on matters of public concern.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter. He has accused Twitter of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\"</p><p>Thursday's conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.</p><p>Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants' market dominance.</p><p>A growing number of lawmakers and some Democratic presidential candidates are talking about tighter regulation of a customarily freewheeling industry or even breaking up the big companies.</p><p>But if Trump is looking for the participating conservative groups to support government action to bring the companies in line on perceived social media bias, he may be disappointed.</p><p>Rob Bluey, vice president for communications at the Heritage Foundation, said that \"if the government were to get involved, it would lead to more problems.\" He said market pressures can produce positive changes.</p><p>Turning Point USA keeps a list of college professors who it says discriminate against students with conservative views. \"I think there will be some form of equilibrium\" between the social media platforms and Americans who hold right-of-center views, Charlie Kirk, the group's executive director, said Tuesday. \"Hopefully these companies can self-correct.\"</p><p>\"Voters will be constructing their choices for 2020\" based largely on information from social media, Kirk said.</p><p>Trump said last week on Fox News that Google, Facebook and Twitter \"are fighting me hard right now, which is incredible because I think the Democrats want to shut them up and, frankly, so do a lot of the Republicans want to shut them up.\"</p><p>Asked whether tech companies may be acting illegally and whether the Justice Department should determine that, Trump replied, \"Well, they could be and I don't want to even say whether or not they're doing something, but I will tell you, there are a lot of people that want us ... to take action against Facebook and against Twitter and, frankly, against Amazon.\"</p><p>Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo last month that he doesn't know if what the companies are doing is illegal but added, \"I tell you what, they should be sued because of what's happening with the bias.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-060f8e089839475da0b31783f810be45</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHX-TMW1-DYN6-W28G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>7:54 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators.</p><p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference on Thursday would bring together \"digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\"</p><p>But Google, Facebook and Twitter weren't invited, their representatives confirmed. And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications.</p><p>The White House had no comment on why top tech officials weren't invited or on whether the conference was deliberately scheduled to overlap with the meeting in Idaho.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations that are expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think-tank Heritage Foundation.</p><p>Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly levelled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet \"offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.\"</p><p>Its members' platforms \"don't have a political ideology or political bias,\" the group's president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies \"succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives.\"</p><p>Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, in a statement, said \"We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.\"</p><p>The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election.</p><p>Trump has played to conservative concerns about bias on other issues. In March, he signed an executive order requiring U.S. colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding. The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers. But critics called the order unnecessary.</p><p>The president himself was dealt a setback Tuesday in his legal battle against Twitter, his favoured means of communicating. A federal appeals court in New York City ruled that the president can't ban critics from his Twitter account, saying the First Amendment calls for more speech, rather than less, on matters of public concern.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter. He has accused Twitter of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\"</p><p>Thursday's conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.</p><p>Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants' market dominance.</p><p>A growing number of lawmakers and some Democratic presidential candidates are talking about tighter regulation of a customarily freewheeling industry or even breaking up the big companies.</p><p>But if Trump is looking for the participating conservative groups to support government action to bring the companies in line on perceived social media bias, he may be disappointed.</p><p>Rob Bluey, vice-president for communications at the Heritage Foundation, said that \"if the government were to get involved, it would lead to more problems.\" He said market pressures can produce positive changes.</p><p>Turning Point USA keeps a list of college professors who it says discriminate against students with conservative views. \"I think there will be some form of equilibrium\" between the social media platforms and Americans who hold right-of-centre views, Charlie Kirk, the group's executive director, said Tuesday. \"Hopefully these companies can self-correct.\"</p><p>\"Voters will be constructing their choices for 2020\" based largely on information from social media, Kirk said.</p><p>Trump said last week on Fox News that Google, Facebook and Twitter \"are fighting me hard right now, which is incredible because I think the Democrats want to shut them up and, frankly, so do a lot of the Republicans want to shut them up.\"</p><p>Asked whether tech companies may be acting illegally and whether the Justice Department should determine that, Trump replied, \"Well, they could be and I don't want to even say whether or not they're doing something, but I will tell you, there are a lot of people that want us ... to take action against Facebook and against Twitter and, frankly, against Amazon.\"</p><p>Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo last month that he doesn't know if what the companies are doing is illegal but added, \"I tell you what, they should be sued because of what's happening with the bias.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-060f8e089839475da0b31783f810be45</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ0-6931-DY9S-T4NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>03:39 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I'm Bret Baier. We're coming to you live tonight from the White House as the battle to see who lives here after next year shifts to the first caucus state tonight.</p><p>Both President Trump and Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden are in Iowa tonight. The President is promoting what he says is a great economy. And a great deal with Mexico on immigration.</p><p>The former vice president is going after the incumbent on just about everything, calling him an existential threat to America.</p><p>We have Fox team coverage. Peter Doocy is on the ground in Iowa for what could be a preview of next year's general election race. But we begin right here with chief White House correspondent John Roberts. Good evening-- John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you, Bret.</p><p>For the very first time President Trump and Joe Biden were in Iowa at the same time making it look a lot more like the fall of 2020 than the spring of 2019.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President --</p><p>ROBERTS: To hear President Trump and Joe Biden going after each other today, you might have thought we were down to a two-candidate general election, not eight months away from the first primary.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, I heard Biden, who is a loser -- I mean look, Joe never got more than 1 percent except Obama took him off the trash heap.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Oh, yes.</p><p>ROBERTS: After Biden's campaign fired the first shot this morning releasing an advanced copy of his speech highly-critical of President Trump, the President, true to form punched back twice as hard.</p><p>TRUMP: I would rather run against -- I think, Biden than anybody. I think he is the weakest mentally. And I like running against people that are weak mentally. When a man has to mention my name 76 times in his speech, that means he is in trouble. Joe Biden is a dummy.</p><p>ROBERTS: While Joe Biden drew most of the President's fire, he also pushed back against reports that there is nothing new in the deal the State Department struck with Mexico on immigration last week.</p><p>TRUMP: R3That's the agreement that everybody says they don't have. I just give you my word inside here and I would love to do it but you will freeze action it, you will stop it, you will analyze it.</p><p>ROBERTS: Administration sources tell Fox News that in negotiations last week, Mexico agreed to adopt \"safe third country\" status, which would mean Central American migrants in Mexico would have to apply for U.S. asylum from Mexico. And that if they made it across the U.S. border, they couldn't make an asylum claim.</p><p>Asked about that by Fox News, President Trump deferred.</p><p>TRUMP: You can just figure it out yourself right here. And the reason is Mexico wants to handle -- that would have to go through their legislative body.</p><p>ROBERTS: Administration sources tell Fox News that for political reasons Mexico would rather focus on other measures it's taking to stem migration. But Mexico's foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said yesterday if there is no significant reduction in migrant flows within 45 days, Mexico may consider becoming a safe third country.</p><p>The President has put on indefinite hold the threat of tariffs against Mexico but the threat of more tariffs against China is still out there. President Trump had threatened to slap tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods if President Xi Jinping doesn't meet with him at the upcoming G-20. Today the President said he has no reason to believe that meeting won't happen.</p><p>TRUMP: We expect to meet with President Xi very shortly. We think we will meet him at the G-20 -- we're talking. But we had a deal with China. And unless they go back to that deal, I have no interest.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump also weighed in this morning on reports that Kim Jong-un's half-brother Kim Jong-nam was working with the CIA as an operative before he was assassinated by two women in Malaysia. President Trump said he didn't know anything about it but that something like that would have never happened on his watch -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: All right. John -- thank you.</p><p>President Trump did have some words of praise today for the latest communication he has received from the North Korean leader.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I just received a beautiful letter from Kim Jong-un. I can't show you the letter, obviously. But it was a very personal, very warm, very nice letter. I appreciate it. And I will say it again. I think that North Korea has tremendous potential.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Well, it's been one year since I last interviewed President Trump, actually one year ago tomorrow, aboard Air Force One in Singapore. President Trump and I spoke in-depth about North Korea.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: North Korea, you know, they have agreed to things before. They have agreed to several things before.</p><p>TRUMP: Yes. But that's with a different president and nobody has taken it this far. Chairman Kim wants to resolve the problem. Because he knew that we weren't playing around, I wasn't playing around, he's not playing around.</p><p>BAIER: You know, you call people sometimes killers -- he is a killer. He's -- executed people and --</p><p>TRUMP: He's a tough guy.</p><p>When you take over a country -- tough country, tough people. And you take it over from your father, I don't care who you are, what you are, how much of an advantage you have. If you can do that at 27 years old, you -- I mean, that's one in 10,000 that could do that.</p><p>So he is a very smart guy. He is a great negotiator. But I think we understand each other.</p><p>BAIER: But he has still done some really bad things.</p><p>TRUMP: Yes. But so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I mean I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: We would love to speak with the President again about a host of issues. We are out here on the north lawn almost every Tuesday. And we have requested another interview every month since our last one.</p><p>Joe Biden is trying to make the case that the vibrant economy is an illusion and points to a president he says has his priorities wrong.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy was with Biden earlier today and is in west Des Moines tonight where the President will be speaking in the next hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden insulted President Trump today the way only somebody who has served in the Senate for several decades could.</p><p>BIDEN: As we used to say in the business -- my friend, Donald Trump. President Trump is in Iowa today.</p><p>DOOCY: But Trump isn't really his friend and Biden isn't bound any longer by senate rules that prevent personal attacks. So about a thousand miles away from the White House he plans to say tonight, quote, \"Donald, it's not about you. It's about America.\" Although more and more it is about President Trump when Biden is on the stump.</p><p>BIDEN: I believe that the President is literally an existential threat.</p><p>DOOCY: The former VP is also folding more recent controversies into his remarks, about the closest thing he has come to reacting in real-time this year.</p><p>BIDEN: The D-Day ceremonies -- it was astounding to me that he was tweeting attacks on everybody, from the mayor of London to Bette Midler.</p><p>DOOCY: Biden hasn't been to Iowa in about a month and influential Democrats have noticed. The former lieutenant governor Patty Judge is quoted by \"Politico\" as saying quote, \"He needs to come out and do some retail politics with us. He comes here with higher name ID but that isn't going to totally carry the day. I don't think he can take anything for granted.\"</p><p>Now Biden is trying to reassure potential caucus goers he will be back.</p><p>BIDEN : The good and bad news for you is that I'm going to be here a lot.</p><p>DOOCY: A lot has changed since the Democratic frontrunner's last visit like his long-held position on China. Because the last time Biden campaigned here he shrugged off the dangers posed by the Chinese.</p><p>BIDEN: China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man.</p><p>They are not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They are not competition for us.</p><p>DOOCY: Today 180-degree change.</p><p>BIDEN: China poses real challenges to the United States, and some ways a real threat to the United States.</p><p>DOOCY: Biden's official campaign slogan is, \"Out best days still lie ahead.\"</p><p>And today came a new catch phrase that had the front runner echoing a former candidate turned accused felon because the first candidate this cycle to say \"Make America America again\" was Michael Avenatti.</p><p>And today.</p><p>BIDEN: Let's make America America again.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY: So, in Biden's first presidential campaign he down played accusation that he plagiarized passages from RFK. Last week the campaign admitted to lifting language about climate change proposals from nonprofits. And today Joe Biden borrowed a line from a man most famous for being an adult film actress' former attorney -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Peter Doocy, live in west Des Moines. Peter -- thanks.</p><p>House Democrats have approved a resolution setting the stage for civil action against President Trump and his administration over refusals to comply with subpoenas.</p><p>Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge has specifics tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS HOST: The House resolution that passed along strict party lines allows Democrats to sue to enforce subpoenas for Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn. While the language does not include contempt, Democrats used it freely, provoking a sharp rebuke from Republicans.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Fundamentally it is an impeachment effort in everything but name.</p><p>Mrs. Speaker -- just look at the unnecessary contempt citation against Attorney General Barr.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: The people's House will continue to fight to make the truth known to the American people and will defend Congress' rule under Article 1.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Leaving for Iowa, the President unloaded on the House Speaker who took a shot at him earlier in the day.</p><p>TRUMP: Nancy is a mess. The Democratic Party is a mess. They are doing everything they can to win the election in 2020. They are guilty of many crimes -- many, many crimes.</p><p>PELOSI: I'm done with him. I don't even want to talk about him.</p><p>HERRIDGE: A recent NPR/Marist poll laid out four options for voters asking what Congress should do with the special counsel findings. 39 percent favored no further action. And just over half supported either impeachment, more investigations or a public reprimand.</p><p>In advance of the House vote, Democrats characterized Monday's deal with the Justice Department as access to new special counsel records including interviews and notes.</p><p>REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE (D), TEXAS: We are willing to try to work with the administration but we are not willing to have a jelly spine. And we are not willing to wreck the Constitution and to undermine the rule of law.</p><p>HERRIDGE: But Republicans said the Democratic chairman Jerry Nadler was unlikely to prevail in court against Barr and McGahn over access to grand jury material and executive privilege issues accusing Nadler of looking for an exit.</p><p>REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R), TEXAS: The key evidence that Jerry Nadler talked about yesterday is the same evidence that the Department of Justice has been offering to Democrats for some time now. He overplayed his hands on these subpoenas against Bill Barr and now is he looking for an offramp and he got one yesterday.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERRIDGE: House Democrats hold another round of Russia hearings tomorrow with witnesses who have expertise in counterintelligence but no direct knowledge of the Mueller investigation. In the Senate Donald Trump Jr. is expected to answer lawmakers outstanding questions behind closed doors -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Catherine -- thank you.</p><p>We are taking some time tonight to look at big tech -- what it is being blamed for and efforts to make some big changes. There is a movement underway to pin the growing demise of local journalism on the major social media and tech firms.</p><p>Tonight correspondent Gillian Turner looks at whether that's justified and what some people want to do about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEVIN RILEY, ATLANTA JOURNAL CONSTITUTION: We should be worried about losing newspapers -- the fountain heads within the local news ecosystem.</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Over the past 15 years about 20 percent of newspapers have shuttered. Experts point to a seismic shift in advertising dollars flowing away from print towards just a handful of dominant digital platforms. Lawmakers say it's time to stem that tide.</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D), NEW YORK: As this platform grows more and more concentrated in the hands of just two major companies, the news media once again face serious threats.</p><p>TURNER: As big American tech companies continue to stack up billions of users worldwide each year, healthy competition for ad revenue is dying out.</p><p>In 2018, Facebook and Google together accounted for 60 percent of the entire world's digital ad haul. Google alone raked in $4.7 billion in revenue -- all by scraping news publisher's content and without paying those publishers for its use. Industry execs say they have been hijacked.</p><p>SALLY HUBBARD, OPEN MARKETS INSTITUTE: These tech giants are gate keepers but also compete against companies that must get through their gates to reach users.</p><p>TURNER: Congress is considering new legislative protection like allowing news outlets a four-year anti-trust exemption so they can bargain with big tech giants and ultimately share in the revenue.</p><p>RILEY: This is the first significant antitrust investigation undertaken by Congress in decades.</p><p>Turner: Capitol Hill may just now be changing into the changing landscape but big tech companies have been in regulators' crosshairs for months.</p><p>SENATOR JOHN THUNE (R), SOUTH DAKOTA: The FCC (ph) and the Department of Justice are also getting involved and just taking a look at these companies and their dominance in the marketplace and making sure that they are not misusing that.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER: The big tech companies say they have done the best they can to navigate this rapidly changing news landscape and insists for the most part they are helping to keep the industry afloat. And it's tough to argue with the numbers. Each month Google reports they drive over 10 billion clicks to publishers' Web sites -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Gillian -- thank you.</p><p>Now to the growing movement to break up the big tech companies. Correspondent Dan Springer reports it represents a major change in philosophy and strategy by some Democrats and could actually become a big campaign issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It is an unconventional campaign billboard planted in the center of Silicon Valley. The candidate behind it is not a surprise.</p><p>SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is time to break up America's tech giants.</p><p>SPRINGER: Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced a whole new campaign issue. One getting play on the campaign trail and inside the Beltway. Warren's plan is to break up Google, Facebook, and Amazon, preventing them from competing on the platforms they own and operate.</p><p>WARREN: They want to be the umpire in the baseball game and they also want to run a bunch of teams in the game.</p><p>SPRINGER: Many of the two dozen Democrats running for president have weighed in.</p><p>SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are, in fact, in not just heading into another gilded age.</p><p>SPRINGER: Kamala Harris is taking a more cautious approach. The California senator has held several fundraiser in her tech heavy backyard but still throws a bone to the Democratic Party base.</p><p>SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's no question in my mind that there needs to be serious regulation and that that has not been happening.</p><p>SPRINGER: Former vice president Joe Biden has largely avoided the topic but there is one candidate who calls it a bad idea.</p><p>SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here.</p><p>SPRINGER: Big tech had been the darlings of Democratic hopefuls, candidate Barack Obama was way ahead in harnessing their power for fund raising and votes. But security breaches and fake election year postings drew anger. Now some Democratic candidates are leading the populist attacks.</p><p>SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The fact that Jeff Bezos wanted our taxpayers to pay for his helicopter landing pad just shows how disingenuous he was from the beginning.</p><p>SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Anybody here happen to know how much Amazon paid in taxes last year?</p><p>CROWD: Zero.</p><p>SANDERS: Zero.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPRINGER: President Trump has also harshly attacked Amazon's leader on his social media of choice Twitter. But what matters most to the industry is that Trump has at times sounded a lot like his Democratic rivals. He has not yet, however, called for a big tech breakup -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Dan Springer in Seattle. Dan -- thanks.</p><p>Up next the emotional hearing about extending health benefits for 9/11 responders. We will bring you there.</p><p>First here is what else is happening on the campaign trail today.</p><p>New York Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand is comparing pro-life beliefs to racism. Her comments came in an interview with the \"Des Moines Register\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GILLIBRAND: Imagine saying that it's ok to appoint a judge who is racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic. And so I believe that for all of these issues, they are not issues that there is a fair other side. There is no moral equivalency when you come to racism. And I do not believe there is a moral equivalency when it comes to changing laws that deny women reproductive freedom.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Meantime Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg wants to stop what he calls endless war. The South Bend, Indiana mayor laid out his foreign policy vision today. He says he wants to rebuild America's relationships with its allies and treat climate change as an existential threat.</p><p>Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has selected a second person for the trial of his universal basic income proposal -- 41-year-old Keil Christianson of Iowa Falls, Iowa will receive a $1,000 a month payment for 12 months starting in July. Yang is paying the cost out of his own pocket. Yang favors a permanent monthly stipend for every American over the age of 18.</p><p>That's tonight's look at what's happening on the campaign trail.</p><p>We'll be right back to the White House.</p><p>BAIER: Welcome back to the White House. Gorgeous night here on the north lawn.</p><p>We move from issues that divide this country to one that has much broader support -- bipartisan support. Lawmakers are planning to vote tomorrow on a measure to extend health benefits to workers sickened after the 9/11 attacks.</p><p>As senior correspondent Rick Leventhal reports it was the subject of a major hearing today on Capitol Hill that had plenty of emotion and star power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON STEWART, TV PERSONALITY: There is not an empty chair on that stage that didn't tweet out \"Never forget the heroes of 9/11. Never forget their bravery. Never forget what they did, what they gave to this country.\" Well, here they are.</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: An emotional Jon Stewart pleading with members of the House Judiciary Committee for an extension of health benefits for 9/11 first responders c Chastising representatives who didn't show up, even though they weren't required to attend the subcommittee hearing.</p><p>STEWART: Sick and dying. They brought themselves down here to speak to no one. It's shameful.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Tens of thousands of firefighters, police officers, EMTs, and construction workers spent countless hours at Ground Zero after the 2001 terror attack on the World Trade Center. At least 2,000 have died from a variety of illnesses. Thousands more are deathly ill including retired NYPD bomb squad detective Luis Alvarez about to undergo his 69th round of chemotherapy.</p><p>Luis ALVAREZ, RETIRED NYPD BOMB SQUAD DETECTIVE: This fund is not a ticket to paradise. It is there to provide for our families when we can't.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: More than $5 billion of the $7 billion allotted to the cover 9/11 related illnesses has already been paid out and there isn't enough left to cover all the claims which is why the House Judiciary Subcommittee heard testimony to refund and extend the program scheduled to end in December 2020.</p><p>REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R), LOUISIANA: If it is any comfort to you all, we know this bill is going to pass with an overwhelming landslide majority of the House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEVENTHAL: No one knows for sure how many more billions the bill would cost and it would still need to pass the Senate and be signed by the President to become law -- Bret.</p><p>BAIER: Rick -- thank you.</p><p>Investigators in New York are still trying to determine what caused a helicopter to crash into the roof of a midtown Manhattan skyscraper yesterday. We brought you that story -- this video taken of the chopper before the accident.</p><p>The crash killed the pilot, Tim McCormick, a former fire chief from Clinton Corners, New York. He was the only person on that helicopter. The aircraft was flying in a driving downpour with low cloud cover in a tightly-controlled airspace.</p><p>We have another breach of big data to talk to you about tonight. It involves Customs and Border Protection which says photos of travelers and license plates collected at a single U.S. border point have been exposed in a malicious cyber attack. A Customs spokesman says initial reports indicate the images involve fewer than 100,000 people -- still a big number. The agency says none of the data has surfaced on the Internet so far.</p><p>The DOW snapping a 6-day winning streak today falling 14. The S&amp;P 500 lost 1. The Nasdaq fell a fraction.</p><p>Up next, the outrage in Hong Kong over legislation many believe sacrifices more of the territory's freedoms to China. We will bring you there.</p><p>First beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>A U.S. permanent resident and Lebanese businessman has been released after years of imprisonment in Iran. Nizar Zakka had been in custody since 2015 on espionage charges. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says the U.S. is thankful but says there are several other Americans who should be released by Iran as well.</p><p>Paris police say a man on an electric scooter has died after being hit by a van. It was the first deadly accident in the French capital since the mayor announced a crackdown on scooters last week.</p><p>And France is hosting the Women's World Cup and defending champion U.S. team got off to a rousing start today overwhelming Thailand 13-0. Next up for the U.S. -- Chile, Sunday in Paris.</p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>We'll be right back to the White House.</p><p>BAIER: The movement to block legislation extraditing criminal suspects from Hong Kong to Mainland China is sparking major outrage again tonight. A second major protest was held today in the Chinese territory ahead of a big vote tomorrow.</p><p>Correspondent Benjamin Hall tells us what's at stake.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The people of Hong Kong are fighting for their autonomy pushing back against the threat of Chinese oversight. Over a million turned out this week to protest a new law that would allow China to demand extraditions from the territory at will. Critics say it would allow the government to target political opponents, shut down criticism, and open the floodgates for Chinese judicial control. Hong Kong's pro-Chinese leader insists the new bill is to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for criminals.</p><p>CARRIE LAM, HONG KONG CHIEF EXECUTIVE: This bill is not about mainland alone. This bill is not initiated by the central people's government. I have not received any instruction from Beijing.</p><p>HALL: The protests are the largest in a decade and show a concern about the growing encroachment by Communist China.</p><p>PHILIP DYKES, HONG KONG BAR ASSOCIATION CHAIRMAN: The government is asking people with decades of mistrust suddenly to trust the system.</p><p>HALL: Despite the outcry, the bill will be presented to the legislative counsel on Wednesday. The teacher's union has said it will suspend all school classes until the bill is revoked. Other strikes are also planned. Since being given back to China by the British 20 years ago, Hong Kong has been allowed judicial independence, its own laws, its economic system. But as violent clashes erupt, many now fear the principle known as One Country, Two Systems, is under assault.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HALL: The people of Hong Kong see this as a critical turning point in the relationship with China, and as yet another example of the increasing expansionism under President Xi Jinping. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Benjamin Hall in London. Benjamin, thank you.</p><p>The U.S. federal government has formally submitted an extradition request to Great Britain for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. That's according to a government official. Assange faces an 18-count indictment accusing him of soliciting and publishing classified information, and of conspiring with former Army Private Chelsea Manning to crack a Defense Department computer password.</p><p>A single strand of good news tonight, however minuscule, for Venezuela's hemorrhaging economy. The opposition run Congress says the country's annual inflation rate has dropped below, get this, 1 million percent, but just barely, for the first time since last year. But Venezuela's chaotic times persist and there is still no resolution about who will be leading the country in the future. State Department Correspondent Rich Edson looks at the situation tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you look around, all you can see is misery.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: More than 4 million have fled Venezuela from what the United Nations calls a catastrophic situation. Venezuelan refugees have overwhelmingly gone to Colombia and throughout the region. President Trump says his administration is considering allowing Venezuelans to seek asylum in the United States.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're looking at that very strongly.</p><p>EDSON: Venezuela's opposition-controlled Congress says consumer prices have risen more than 800,000 percent over the past 12 month. Contested President Nicholas Maduro blames American sanctions. The Trump administration says it's Maduro.</p><p>ELLIOTT ABRAMS, SPECIAL ENVOY FOR VENEZUELA: It's ridiculous. It's the mismanagement of this economy by this regime that caused what is arguably the worst inflation we have ever seen in Latin America.</p><p>EDSON: Despite the crisis, Maduro remains in control after the interim and U.S. recognized president Juan Guaido pushed and failed to seize power April 30th. Norway is trying to mediate between the Maduro and Guaido factions, but Guaido says he is not planning to join another round of negotiations.</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): Who in their right mind would sit down with dictators believing they would negotiate in good faith. No one, right?</p><p>EDSON: Trump administration officials say Maduro's allies, Russia and Cuba, are helping Maduro maintain power. The United States has already sanctioned Cuba and officials say they will continue if Cuba refuses to stop its support of the Maduro regime. Russian state media reports Russia would send more military specialists to Venezuela if needed. The U.S. says there are about 125 Russian specialists already there.</p><p>ABRAMS: We have actually pretty regular conversations with the Russians about Venezuela, and sanctions against Russia, particularly against companies or parts of the governments that are involved in Venezuela are a very live option.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EDSON: Nicholas Maduro has also reopened the Venezuelan border with Colombia after closing it for four months, allowing thousands of Venezuelans to reach American aid in Colombia to get the food, medicine, and clean water unavailable in their home country. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: We'll keep following it. Rich Edson at the State Department. Rich, thank you.</p><p>President Trump versus former Vice President Biden in Iowa. Is it a preview the general election to come? We'll talk about it with the panel when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would rather run against I think Biden than anybody. I think he is the weakest mentally.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is a guy who does everything to separate and frighten people.</p><p>TRUMP: He looks different than he used to. He acts different than he used to. He is even slower than he used to be.</p><p>BIDEN: Four years of Donald Trump will be viewed as an aberration in American history. Eight years will fundamentally change who we are as a nation.</p><p>TRUMP: It looks like his friends from the left are going to overtake him pretty soon.</p><p>BIDEN: I believe that the president is literally an existential threat to America.</p><p>TRUMP: When he mentions my name that many times, I guess I should be complimented.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: President Trump on the south lawn, Vice President Biden in Iowa. The president will be speaking in Iowa in just a short while. If you look at Iowa and the Democratic race there, the Real Clear Politics average of polls has it Joe Biden at 23.8, up about five points over Bernie Sanders. You see Mayor Pete there in third, Elizabeth Warren she polls better in a recent poll in Iowa, surging a little bit, as this early eight months out from voting in Iowa really is a long way away. But it seemed like it was one-on-one today in the back and forth.</p><p>Let's bring in our panel, Kimberley Strassel, member of the editorial board at the \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" and here at the White House, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio. This is what the Biden people want, right? This is what they wanted?</p><p>LIASSON: Absolutely. This is what they want. They want people, Democrats to start imaging the matchup Biden versus Trump. That's what he wanted. He wanted to get into the president's head, and he did.</p><p>BAIER: This is not, however, what the Biden people wanted, and that is Chinese and a walk back on China May to today. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. They are not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They are not competition for us.</p><p>China poses real challenges to the United States and some ways a real threat to the United States. But Donald Trump is only exacerbating the threat and the danger.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Ben, it seemed like a clean-up on aisle four there.</p><p>BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Yes, it was definitely a clean-up act. I think Biden is the candidate really in this race of normalcy and nuances. But he's up against a lot of people on the left of his flank who are more ambitious and more assertive when it comes to their approach to policy. He's going to have to deal with a lot of different issues here, but part of it is when he tries to have nuance on a foreign policy issue such as the China issue, I don't think it plays very well with an audience that has really moved on from that kind of stage of politics, something that does seem kind of pre-2008 in a lot of ways.</p><p>BAIER: Kimberley, the president says sleepy Joe, he calls him one percent Joe for getting one percent when he ran in the last Democratic primary. Your thoughts on that name, whether it is sticking, and whether it echoes back to Jeb Bush and running against him as the heir apparent back in 2015?</p><p>KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, I know when you showed that China clip, it's a reminder, Bret, that Joe Biden has run for the presidency twice before, and we have never had a President Biden. And it's because he in his prior runs has proven himself to be a bit gaffe prone, not proven himself to be a winner with audiences. And he has a third shot now, and the question is, how does he redefine himself this time around?</p><p>Now, it helps that he spent eight years as a vice president. That gives him some standing. You can see that he is very much decided that he is running purely as an anti-Trump message. Is that going to be good enough for his progressive base out there that are going to want a lot more from their candidates than just opposition to Trump? They leave that, but they are going to want more on a policy front.</p><p>BAIER: Mara, it seems like a lot comes down to these debates as they are coming up. The debate in two weeks in Miami and then they'll be one the following month and the following month.</p><p>MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think the debates are really important. They are especially important for all the candidates other than Joe Biden because the ones that need some oxygen are going to get some on that debate stage. But because there is two panels for each debate, we don't know who is going to be standing next to Joe Biden. It might not be Bernie Sanders. It could be Andrew Yang. So that's a big question.</p><p>But every Democrat I talk to says what Joe Biden really needs to do is not so much create excitement in terms of policies. He needs to step up his game and start campaigning. He has missed a lot of the early forums. Now he is in Iowa. He said he is going to be coming back a lot, and that's what he has got to do.</p><p>BAIER: Although the side by side coverage today, every channel had Biden and President Trump.</p><p>LIASSON: And that's what he wanted. And whenever he goes somewhere and bashes Trump, even though it seems like a Trump-centric message for a party that says they also want to talk about the future, it gets him the coverage that he wants, and it deprives everyone else of oxygen.</p><p>BAIER: And looking at this \"Des Moines Register\" poll on issues, the Democrat candidates must support women's right to abortion, 79 percent. This is in Iowa. Climate change is the biggest threat, 75 percent. A ban on assault style weapons, 57 percent. You see the list there, Medicare for all. Breaking up big tech comes in the bottom of the barrel there. Green New Deal doesn't really perform that well.</p><p>DOMENECH: It's one of the things that I think is a problem for Joe Biden in this race is going to be a real challenge. The key aspect of him that I think appeals to Democratic voters is the belief that he is the strongest candidate to put up against Donald Trump. If there's any sort of aspect of him that looks like he has a glass jaw, that he is not looking like a winner, I think they could shift to a lot of people that have far more ready policy agendas and language on a lot of the different issues that you see in those polls.</p><p>A candidate like Elizabeth Warren has put a lot of effort into putting forward policy plans and a very clear agenda of how she wants to use the power of the executive to achieve those aims. If Joe Biden doesn't really look like a winner anymore, if he takes a couple hits on those debate stages, then the theory that he has as a candidate could really evaporate quickly.</p><p>BAIER: Final thing, Kimberley. The issue of impeachment obviously comes up again and again. Speaker Pelosi was asked about it today, said she wasn't talking about it today. But it is an issue that will come up on this campaign trail, and likely at that first debate.</p><p>STRASSEL: Well, and the Democratic presidential aspirants, they have a bit of a bye here, right, because they can come out, they can claim that Donald Trump has been accused of crimes. Maybe he deserves to be impeached. That's probably one place a lot of them are going to go. Much harder for Mrs. Pelosi whose members would have to take a vote on this. And this is why what we are having at the moment is a phony impeachment process where some of the members really want to go there. A lot of her members do not. They know that they will face retribution from voters. And so we are hearing a lot about it without any formal proceedings, which I really this is undercuts the importance of the impeachment process.</p><p>BAIER: All right, panel, stand by. Next up, should big tech be broken up?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have these giant tech companies that think they rule the earth. They think they can come to towns, cities, states, and bully everyone into doing what they want. It is time to break up America's tech giants.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D-NJ) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Breaking up big tech, it's going to be a big issue on the campaign trail no matter what you think about it. Republicans and Democrats really debating that on Capitol Hill today, here on the House Judiciary Committee, about newspapers. If you look at this stat about newspapers from 2004 to 2018, there you see the numbers going down there. There's an argument that social media, big tech, is affecting all of this. And there is a question about regulation and what this is all going to end up being. We are back with the panel. Ben, do you have a sense of where Congress is headed here?</p><p>DOMENECH: I think Congress is headed in a lot of the directions. But a lot of them are still trying to figure out what exactly to say. Elizabeth Warren has obviously been hammering away at this idea to break things up. But the truth is breaking up Facebook and Instagram doesn't really solve a lot of problems that actually matter to people.</p><p>One thing that is interesting is that this conversation has shifted from being esoteric debate to something that's a lot more of a kitchen table issue for a lot of Americans. I think that you see that most specifically in the actions of Missouri Senator Josh Hawley who has taken a number of steps when it comes to not just social media but other areas of Internet regulation that have gotten him a lot of criticism from more libertarian voices on the right. I do think that you are going to see some proposals come forward in the coming months that deal with regulation of tech or that attempt to push them on a number of different fronts, including privacy, including concern about child endangerment, and concerning evidence that we have that they represent a public health issue as it relates to depression, particularly among teenagers.</p><p>BAIER: That's a lot of different areas. Here is Senators Blumenthal and Thune.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D-CT): We need to be doing much more on the Senate side to hold accountable the tech industry, particularly on antitrust grounds. Right now they have been given a free pass.</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE, (R-SD) SENATE MAJORITY WHIP: The FTC, the Department of Justice, they are also getting involved. And just taking a look at these companies and their dominance in the marketplace and making sure that they are not misusing that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Kimberley, the FTC and the DOJ go after the issue of antitrust. Congress is now doing its own investigation on this front.</p><p>STRASSEL: Yes. Well, it's not necessarily a problem that DOJ and the FTC are going to take a look at this. I think one of the problems, though, and you heard it expressed in Senator Warren's comments the number of times she referenced big and giant -- being big and giant is not a problem, per se. That's a fundamental misreading of economic policy and antitrust policy. The question is whether or not being big in any way hurts consumers. And I think the evidence is much less so there that there is antitrust problem here.</p><p>But look, the bottom line is that the worst situation you ever want to be in as a company is when you have given both sides of the aisle a reason to be mad at you. And a lot of these big companies have done so. And so, yes, they are going to be in the targets not just for these regulators but for Congress. And I think it behooves them as a result to address some of these questions proactively before they get saddled with something instead.</p><p>BAIER: It seems, Mara, that Congress sometimes wants the black hat that everybody goes after.</p><p>LIASSON: But what's so interesting is there is a bipartisan consensus that something needs to be done, that these companies are too big, that they are invading our privacy, spreading disinformation, all sorts of things. But, as Kimberley said, it's not traditional antitrust problem in that they are hurting consumers in terms of prices. These products are mostly free. The consumers are the products. They collect data on people and they sell that. That's how it works. So there is a big consensus that something should be done but no consensus about what that should be.</p><p>BAIER: Ten seconds, panel. Are we going to see some big regulation out of Congress?</p><p>DOMENECH: I think that we are going to see a number of proposals that end up getting debated within the context of 2020. But I think that Kim's point is very good, which is that tech companies are now getting it from both sides. This is a pincer action, and in that scenario things can actually happen.</p><p>BAIER: And we'll see if Mark Zuckerberg gets his call returned from Speaker Pelosi. Panel, thank you.</p><p>When we come back, a test. What would you do in this situation? A good deed fully recognized.</p><p>BAIER: As you look at the West Wing there, and we are talking about who will sit in the Oval Office behind those doors after next year, just a reminder -- there are 237 days until the Iowa caucuses and 511 days until Election Day, 2020. We have a long way to go, folks.</p><p>Finally tonight, a random act of kindness, and a big one. When Florida woman Donna Adams was in line getting groceries, she noticed a veteran crying, unable to pay for his own groceries. So Donna, who says she has always had a soft spot in her heart for veterans, paid for that man's groceries. She didn't think she could afford the $546 bill, but she happened to have some extra money, so she did it. When her employer Legoland found out what she had done, Legoland reimbursed her, gave her an extra week of vacation and hotel accommodations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I had the means to do it at that time, yes, which normally doesn't happen. I walked out of there. I had no regret, no second thoughts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BAIER: Know, would you do that? That's pretty incredible. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced, and unafraid. \"THE STORY\", hosted by Martha MacCallum, starts right now. Martha.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by US regulators.  </p><p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference would bring together ?(EURO)oedigital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today?(EURO)(TM)s online environment?(EURO).  </p><p>But Google, Facebook and Twitter weren?(EURO)(TM)t invited, their representatives confirmed.  </p><p>Among the conservative organisations expected to participate in the White House meeting: Turning Point USA; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics; and the Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.  </p><p>Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly levelled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views.  </p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on the meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry?(EURO)(TM)s major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet ?(EURO)oeoffers the most open and accessible form of communication available today?(EURO).  </p><p>Its members?(EURO)(TM) platforms ?(EURO)oedon?(EURO)(TM)t have a political ideology or political bias,?(EURO) the group?(EURO)(TM)s president and CEO Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added that the companies ?(EURO)oesucceed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives?(EURO).  </p><p>The White House conference offers Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election.  </p><p>Trump has played to conservative concerns about bias on other issues. In March, he signed an executive order requiring US colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding. The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers. But critics called the order unnecessary.  </p><p>The conference raised questions about whether Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.  </p><p>Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump?(EURO)(TM)s 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants?(EURO)(TM) market dominance.  </p><p>Trump said last week on Fox News that Google, Facebook and Twitter ?(EURO)oeare fighting me hard right now?(EURO).  </p><p>Asked whether tech companies are acting illegally and if the Justice Department should determine that, Trump replied, ?(EURO)oeWell, they could be and I don?(EURO)(TM)t want to even say whether or not they?(EURO)(TM)re doing something, but I will tell you, there are a lot of people that want us ... to take action against Facebook and against Twitter and, frankly, against Amazon.?(EURO)  </p><p>Trump told Fox Business Network last month that he doesn?(EURO)(TM)t know if what the companies are doing is illegal but added: ?(EURO)oeI tell you what, they should be sued because of what?(EURO)(TM)s happening with the bias.?(EURO) ?(EURO)\"AP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NRTHAD-NRADDwtrumptech</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NRTHAD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ0-VX31-F12B-J4J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NZME Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Northern Advocate(New Zealand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>HERITAGE FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is 4:00 a.m. here in New York, 9:00 a.m. in London, 11:00 a.m. in Istanbul.</p><p>We begin this morning with President Trump escalating the ugliest of ugly politics.

He was at an event on the South Lawn of the White House when he came prepared with pieces of paper with bullet points to make the case where he said he felt he was in the right.</p><p>TRUMP: As far as I'm concerned, if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave. And that's what I say all the time. That's what I said in a tweet, which I guess some people think is controversial. A lot of people love it, by the way.</p><p>COLLINS: Now, the women that the president has accused and made these attacks on held a press conference yesterday where the four of them appeared on Capitol Hill to confront what the president said, statements they said they were not surprised by to come out of the president's mouth.</p><p>REP.

This is the first real test of the company's new labeling system that down ranks the tweets of the president and other world leaders that violate Twitter's guidelines. Twitter will not be participating in today's House hearing on the market power of online platforms. Representatives of Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google will be testifying.</p><p>DEAN: A fight over health care now front and center in the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The issue is increasing the friction between front-runner Joe Biden and challenger Bernie Sanders. The former vice president releasing a 10 year, $750 billion proposal on Monday, a plan Sanders close too wasteful and complicated.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: The system that Joe and others are trying to prop up is the most wasteful, bureaucratic and expensive system on earth. And when you talk about subsidies, what you're talking about is spending even more money, in this case taxpayer money, on a dysfunctional, wasteful and bureaucratic system. We need a simple system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: Arlette Saenz is traveling with the Biden campaign in Iowa.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: Dave and Jessica, Joe Biden kicked off a three-day swing through Iowa here in Des Moines by touting his newly released health care plan which he says will build on the Affordable Care Act. Now, Biden's plan would provide a public option to allow Americans to buy into a Medicare type of program. It also provides massive subsidies to make purchasing insurance through the exchanges cheaper for all-Americans regardless of income.</p><p>Biden also insisting that Medicare for All isn't the answer when it comes to health care worrying that programs like that will be difficult to implement and also are, quote, kind of a little bit risky.</p><p>REPORTER: You're talking now about a public option as part of your health care plan?</p><p>BIDEN: Yes.</p><p>REPORTER: That was very tough the last time.</p><p>BIDEN: Sure it was.</p><p>REPORTER: When Obamacare was first coming around.</p><p>BIDEN: Sure it was.</p><p>REPORTER: And it didn't happen.</p><p>BIDEN: Can you imagine what Medicare for All, if you think that's tough? Come on. Look, here's the deal, guys. One of the things that's happening is, all of a sudden, the American public has figured out what Obamacare was about.</p><p>It's solid, it's real, it's consequential. And we can in fact for a significant portion of the price, we can in fact insure 97, 98 percent of all the American people who want to be insured, and they can keep their policy if they want.</p><p>SAENZ: Now, Biden was really focused in the past week and a half on establishing clear lines of differences between himself and his Democratic opponents who are supporting a plan like Medicare for All. Now, Biden will continue promoting his health care plan over the next two days in Iowa, including making some stops in rural Iowa to talk about healthcare. We're also going to be hearing more about health care from Kamala Harris who has promised a policy proposal coming today. And Bernie Sanders will once again be making his case on Medicare for all on Wednesday.</p><p>These candidates clearly trying to draw their battle lines on health care heading into that next debate just over two weeks away -- Jessica and Dave.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIGGS: Arlette Saenz, thanks.</p><p>A check on CNN business now. Facebook wants to get into the cryptocurrency game but it's facing bipartisan resistance. Facebook unveiled its digital currency Libra last month. Since then, lawmakers have expressed skepticism that Facebook, already under attack by regulators over privacy concerns, can be trusted with a digital currency.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: To the extent that Facebook can do this correctly and can have a payment system, you know, correctly with proper AML, that's fine. They've got a lot of work to do to convince us to get to that place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Mnuchin's comments came as Facebook executive David Marcus prepares for a pair of hearings on Capitol Hill. In remarks released ahead of his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, Marcus will say, quote, Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals. Libra also faces resistance in the House Financial Services committee on Wednesday. Congresswoman Maxine Waters who chairs the committee has drafted legislation that could block Facebook from operating Libra.</p><p>The key big tech out of Finance Act would prohibit all large Internet companies from affiliating with or becoming financial institutions. Libra is expected to launch in early 2020.</p><p>DEAN: One person was killed, 15 others injured when a House exploded Monday afternoon in Marietta, Florida, about 70 miles north of San Diego.

Creator Brian Yorkey says: No one scene is more important than the life of the show.

Good move there.</p><p>Ahead, European leaders scrambling to save the Iran deal are downplaying recent violations of the agreement. A live report, straight ahead.</p><p>[04:16:30] BRIGGS: Four-sixteen a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And European leaders say Iran's breach of the nuclear deal is not significant as they scrambled to save the deal from collapse. But Iran's former minister says Tehran is not prepared to renegotiate.</p><p>CNN's Arwa Damon is live in Istanbul with the latest.</p><p>Arwa, good morning.</p><p>It almost thinks like Iran thinks they can intimidate European leaders into staying in this deal. How's it working out?</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's not necessarily just an issue of Iran wanting to intimidate European leaders, Iran really is willing to go back to the original agreement. Iran's foreign minister said that they spent 12 years negotiating that agreement and Iran's position has been that they only began violating it because the U.S. withdrew and then slapped on unilateral sanctions. Iran's foreign minister said that America has declared an economic war in their country.</p><p>European nations are trying to salvage this original agreement. No one wants to see the situation escalate any further, and at this point, European parties to the agreement are not willing to invoke the mechanism that would see the agreement entirely fall apart.</p><p>Here's what the E.U.'s foreign policy chief had to say.</p><p>FEDERICA MOGHERINI, EUROPEAN UNION FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF: For the time being, none of the parties to the agreement signaled their intention to invoke this article, which means that none of them is for the moment, for the time being with the current data we have had, in particular from the IEA, that noncompliance is considered to be significant noncompliance.</p><p>DAMON: And Iran though for its part is saying that it will continue to increase its production of low grade uranium keeping in mind it is far, far, far away from reaching a nuclear weapon, but it is hoping that by threatening to increase production that will perhaps somehow put more pressure on European countries that will lead to some sort of pressure on the U.S. to back off of those brutal sanctions that the Trump administration has been posing.</p><p>But, of course, all of this comes at a time of significantly increased tensions in the region. And any sort of misstep, any sort of accident could lead to a devastating escalation, Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: Indeed, it could. Arwa Damon, 11:18 there in Istanbul, thank you.</p><p>DEAN: A 27-year-old man has confessed to killing American scientist Suzanne Eaton on the Greek island of Crete.

The police union says Sergeant Ryan O'Neill is stepping down due to job-related stress, and media attention on the case and hateful social media responses.

Sheriff's deputies and Michigan state police have canine teams searching the area.</p><p>DEAN: In Colorado, more than 100 messages about child abuse and neglect went unchecked for four years because an email account was set up and then forgotten.

The state department of human services says it's a great concern these cases did not get the attention they needed in a timely way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIMBRO: There we go, there we go.

They've got a lot of work to do to convince us to get to that place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Mnuchin's comments came as Facebook executive David Marcus prepares for a pair of hearings on Capitol Hill.

Pernell Whitaker was the best fighter that I ever fought.</p><p>DEAN: In Colorado, more than 100 messages about child abuse and neglect went unchecked for four years because an email account was set up and then forgotten. At least five child abuse cases that needed follow-up were not investigated. That email account was established in 2015 to support a phone hotline for abuse cases. It was part of a campaign to raise public awareness of the state's resources for reporting child abuse. State department of human services says it's of great concern these cases did not get attention they needed in a timely way.</p><p>BRIGGS: Over 1 million people have signed up for a fake Facebook event, calling for a mass raid on Area 51 in September.

President Trump today bringing his America First agenda to the United Nations, to the general assembly. The president asserting America's leadership on the world stage the leader of the, well, free world at least, delivered a speech on religious freedom before meeting with six different world leaders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president took up everything from global extremism to the potential of the new fair and reciprocal trade deal with China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If my opponent had won the election, China's economy would have surpassed the United States by now. And with me there's a tremendous difference. We're talking to China we have very serious conversations coming up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We'll have the very latest on those conversations as we talk with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Also tonight, more questions being asked about the credible claims of corruption in the Ukraine, surrounding former Vice-President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.</p><p>The 2020 Dem hopefully desperate to stick to the left's narrative, but President Trump some somehow committed an impeachable offense during a phone call with the leader of Ukraine.</p><p>The president today denied any abuse of power for political gain as we learn more about the so-called whistleblower at the blower at center of this latest contrive left-wing inspired political firestorm directed at president of United States.</p><p>Chief White House Correspondent, John Roberts with us right here in the studio tonight. Great to have you here, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Lou, good to see you. Of course, this whole controversy surrounds a complaint that was delivered to the intelligence community inspector general by this whistleblower, and sources tell Fox News that this whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of telephone conversation July 25th between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p>What's more, the complaint that was delivered to the inspector general makes it clear that this whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge.</p><p>We're also learning more about why this complaint was not delivered to Congress, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in a statement saying, quote, \"The complaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the intelligence community, therefore the DNI lacks unilateral authority to transmit such materials to intelligence committees.\"</p><p>Now the general counsel's also consulted with inspector general about all of this, and here's what general counsel said about those consultations, quote, \"Based on those consultations we determine that the allegations did not fall within the statutory definition of an urgent concern, and that the statute did not require the complaint that be transmitted to the intelligence committees on Capitol Hill.\"</p><p>The president today denying any wrongdoing in that telephone call that he had with the Ukrainian and the Ukrainian foreign minister, saying he knows what was talked about in that phone call and that there was quote, \"No pressure put on President Zelensky by president Trump.</p><p>Now to prove his point, President Trump and the White House are considering releasing at least the partial transcript of that telephone call. Here's what the president said about that at the U.N. today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Perhaps you'll see it, perhaps you won't see that it depends on what we want to do. I can do it very easily but I'd rather not do it from the standpoint of all of other conversations I have.</p><p>I may do it because it was a very innocent call on both his part and mine. We had a very nice call. I hope you get to see it and I hope you get to see it soon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CALL)</p><p>ROBERTS: So that was the president talking about it, Lou, multiple times during his meeting with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda. But there are reasons to not do it, first of all, precedent, I don't remember any time when a telephone conversation, a private conversation between the president of the United States and a foreign leader last been released.</p><p>Second, slippery slope, if the president releases the transcript of this phone call, do Democrats on Capitol Hill say, well we want to see your calls with Putin as well. And then do Republicans reciprocate by saying, we want to see all of President Obama's calls with world leaders.</p><p>And then third, there's the issue of would you have to redact sections of it for national security measures of classification? If there is one redaction in a transcript of a phone call that the Democrats are so hungry to get their hands on, they got to say, that invalidates the whole thing. You really got to take all of these into consideration.</p><p>DOBBS: The only part that catalogue that you've thrown out first to consider that I find attractive is listening to the conversations and reading the conservations transcripts of President Obama and the world leaders.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But I suspect that would be no more persuasive than to the Democrats looking at the transcript of that call. You know the president, his detractors are not going to be satisfied by facts, by truths, we know right now that this whole thing is built on hearsay, and a person without standing in the intelligence community.</p><p>We know that intelligence community itself has been hostile to this president to point of number of the agency --</p><p>ROBERTS: But I -- I think unless you release --</p><p>DOBBS: Well John, lets me finish.</p><p>ROBERTS: Sorry, go ahead. It's your show.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, it's also good manners.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>The fact to the matter is that the agency chiefs had some role, we don't know yet quite what, in effort to subvert the president of the United States. Now, your turn.</p><p>ROBERTS: I was just going to say that unless the full and complete transcript of that phone call is released, Democrats will not buy it.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, they're not going to buy anything, truth, or anything approaching it. At least that's been our experience so far to with we might consider the special counsel report after almost two years of investigation. Great to see you.</p><p>ROBERTS: You too.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks so much, John.</p><p>ROBERTS: All right, thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking tonight, a newly obtained memo finds former deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told Andrew McCabe as he was serving as acting director of the FBI, that he would wear a wire to capture President Trump's quote, \"True intentions over the firing of James Comey.\"</p><p>The memo released today by Judicial Watch is dated May 16, 2017, the day before Robert Mueller was appointed special council. Rosenstein insists the comments were sarcastic when he offered to wear that wire. But memo however shows McCabe thought Rosenstein was serious.</p><p>Joining me now, Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch. And Tom, good to have you with us.</p><p>Let's start with first of all, Rosenstein's role in this, and what we know of his intentions, and how it is he survived this long if indeed those intentions were nefarious as some would claim?</p><p>TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT: Well, it's no longer in the Justice Department, so, he was slowly rolled out the door, I guess. Because his explanations, I don't think were persuasive.</p><p>Certainly, Mr. McCabe his credibility is lacking what this memo is written the day of the meeting, and McCabe says, look he offered - this is the extraordinary thing, McCabe goes over the Rosentein's office says, I'm investigating the president.</p><p>And he says, you're a witness and Rosentein starts confessing and says, well we'll wire on the president. And McCabe says, well we'll get back to you, we'll ask our team about it.</p><p>Now, why would he pursue that if it was a sarcastic remark or evidently a sarcastic remark? But here you have McCabe and Rosenstein, both abusing their powers to target President Trump and seriously discussing, it looks like wearing a we're on the president, you've got McCabe on his own initiating a spy operation on the president, calling it a counter intelligence operation on the president.</p><p>All of this is documented in two pages. We had to wait over a year for it, for the FBI to finally cough it up. And this is exactly the sort of thing that the media doesn't want you looking at, as it plays its Ukraine gambit in latest iteration of their coup argument against President Trump.</p><p>This was the coup, the heart if it is here in this document and now we're talking about phone calls over Ukraine, unbelievable.</p><p>DOBBS: It is unbelievable particularly when you consider that now in a phased revelation if you will, following the onset of this manufactured nonsense, but again directed at president of United States to find that the whistleblower whoever he or she is, did not have firsthand knowledge, was operating purely on hearsay.</p><p>And furthermore, is not a person of the intelligence community and therefore could not hold whistleblower status. And what difference does that make? The Democrats continue their nonsense, braying in the dark with their usual ignorance and venality.</p><p>FITTON: Yeah, you know as I said on Twitter, Lou, and the president highlighted it. A malicious seditious conspiracy against the president.</p><p>Look, the idea that anyone that hears anything about what president says to foreign leader automatically has whistleblower status, you know what? I'm blowing whistleblower on Joe Biden. I want them Democrats to investigate Joe Biden now.</p><p>I'm blowing the whistle on Barack Obama, on Hilary Clinton, because I've got documentary evidence that all of them were involved in this coup conspiracy against President Trump.</p><p>Obviously, they're not going to follow-up on that as a matter of law, and nor should anyone else take seriously this obvious attempt to try to derail the president's ability to conduct foreign policy.</p><p>And let's be clear here, they want to freeze the president, he's not allowed to fire FBI director, he's not allowed to talk to foreign leaders, he's not allowed to exercise oversight over the corrupt FBI or DOJ, they want to make it impossible for him to do his job.</p><p>And when they do that, they're attacking our constitutional respect republic because we hired him to do the job and these folks need to get out of the way in terms of trying to improperly impair the functioning of this office.</p><p>DOBBS: I couldn't agree with you more, they should get out of the way but I would hope also at same time confess and turned themselves in for further, if you will, constructive rehabilitation should they decide to rejoin society.</p><p>Tom Fitton, great to have you with us. Thanks so much.</p><p>FITTON: You're welcome. Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: The Department of Homeland Security is ending its so-called catch and release policy beginning next week. Acting Director Kevin McAleenan today said, ending the policy for Central American families is a vital step to restore rule of law and integrity to our immigration system.</p><p>Family apprehensions have risen 400 percent so far this year compared to same time a year ago.</p><p>Up next, President Trump calls out world leaders for shunning and worse, people of faith.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Too often people in positions of power preach diversity well, silencing, shunning or censoring the faithful, true tolerance means respecting the right of all people to express their deeply held religious beliefs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: We take all of that and much more up with Pastor Robert Jeffers here later tonight.</p><p>Also, why is Wall Street trying turn cut the president's negotiating position with China? We'll take that up and much more with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin right after the quick messages.</p><p>DOBBS: Not a lot to report on Wall Street, so we won't. Stocks mixed, the Dow 15, the S&amp;P flat, the Nasdaq down 5, volume on the big board dropping to 3.2 billion shares, crude oil up a percent, $58 a barrel, plus go about a percent, silver up nearly 5 percent.</p><p>WeWork CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann launching talks with investors in the board of directors talking about his future role with the company. Those for mentioned folks are not pleased with his performance.</p><p>According to Reuters, he may give up his title as CEO Softbank, WeWorks chief investor reportedly wants him to resign. WeWork, the latest IPO last week and it does appear that it will be going to market very soon.</p><p>A reminder, listen to my reports three times a day, coast-to-coast on The Salem Radio Network.</p><p>President Trump's tough stance with China rattling Wall Street, the business round table and the Chamber of Commerce from time to time. The Wall Street Journal reporting billionaire owner Sheldon Adelson warned the president about how tariffs might affect the economy, but the warning may have been somewhat personal to Adelson, his Las Vegas sands company makes just about 63 percent of its revenue from casinos in China. His company is licensed to operate is also set to expire in 2022.</p><p>Well, St. Louis Fed President, James Bullard today saying, it's inevitable that the United States and China would clash on trade. Bullard cited China's failure to live up to its WTO commitment when it joined the organization back in 2001.</p><p>In a statement Bullard said this, quote, \"The Chinese were allowed into the WTO on an implicit promise that they would abide not just with the letter but the spirit of the World Trade Organization and that they would transition toward democracy. Neither of these things have happened.\"</p><p>Our next guest will be meeting with the vice premier of China in early October to resume trade talks. And joining us tonight, we're pleased to see the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Great to have you with us --</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: Great to be here, thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with China and United States and where we are in the negotiations, if they could still be called that?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, I think you know Ambassador Lighthizer and I have been at this now for a while under the president's direction. And the president has been very clear, we get the right deal.</p><p>He wants to do a deal, if we can't get the right deal, he's happy with the tariffs.</p><p>DOBBS: And the Chinese position does not seem to have migrated toward anything approaching an end of threat of hundreds of billions of dollars in intellectual property and technology to balance trade is a preset of any agreement?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, from our first meeting with President Trump and President Xi, President Xi agreed that rebalancing the trade deficit was a priority. We've been working two years for that, and you're right it's gone in the other direction, so the president is determined that we have to have a fair and reciprocal relationship with trade, and it's been a one-way street.</p><p>DOBBS: It has been a one-way street since the beginning of the Chinese adventure, if you will, has it not? And to think that right now, agriculture is going to be the number one export of the United States.</p><p>It was only superpower, the most advanced economy and my god, we're locked up around soybeans and agriculture. It's just extraordinary to me as an outsider looking in, it's extraordinary that that would be our first move forward.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, it's not that agriculture is the most important issue. And the most important issue as you said is the intellectual property. But the farmers and the fisherman are very important to the president.</p><p>DOBBS: You think it ought to be important --</p><p>MNUCHIN: And I would say that you know, we take it as a personal offense that they stopped buying agriculture. Now, the good news that the Chinese have agreed, and they've started buying again.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>MNUCHIN: So that's the good news, it's a sign of good gesture that they're back at table buying agriculture and those are important people who have supported president. So I'm a soybean's salesman.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, you know, I'm a soybean consumer like nearly everyone in this country and I appreciate that. I do find it a little difficult to understand why China is so reticent to acknowledge at least the fundamental precepts and I know that you and Trade Representative Lighthizer have been absolutely fantastic in your negotiations.</p><p>The president has I think been brilliant for example talking about Agriculture. He's moved back significant billions of dollars, what is it? About $26 billion to the farmers out of that almost now more than $70 billion in tariffs.</p><p>I mean that's an extraordinary to me an innovative way in which to deal with the problems at agriculture.</p><p>MNUCHIN: I agree, and the president was determined to make sure that the farmers were not collateral damage --</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>MNUCHIN: -- in these discussions. But the good news is I think there is a desire for China to move forward with these reforms. They have their own issues internally, I think they're focused on, and we have a good framework of an agreement. We'll see if we can move forward with that.</p><p>DOBBS: And we mentioned this Sheldon Adelson, was telling apparently according to the report in the Wall Street Journal that you know that he didn't think it was such a great idea to proceed with tariffs and to disrupt the relationship.</p><p>But understandably, his most of his revenue comes from Macau, it is a hotbed of gambling enterprise. But again it's not - just would expect there to be less vested interested in the counsel given the president.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, I've known Sheldon for over 20 years and he's really a great businessperson and he's -</p><p>DOBBS: No doubt.</p><p>MNUCHIN: -- he's been a great supporter of the president during the campaign when other people weren't stepping up, Sheldon was stepping up. So, I do think he has the right intentions.</p><p>I mean as you said, he does have interest there, but I think one of the issues, he has a pretty good perception from having done business in China. And that's really his counsel but Sheldon wants to see the right outcome here, he understands issues of intellectual property, and this is the first president that's confronted these issues.</p><p>DOBBS: It is stunning when we think about the chronic year after year trade deficits with China and Wall Street arguing that it is not a zero-sum game, that there is no effect on economic growth even though we know it does affect national savings and it does in fact reduce the rate of economic growth in this country.</p><p>This president and you, and the Lighthizer have stood up against the Chinese, and I have to say probably they spent the first year just trying to get over their shock that an of American government would say no, you can't loot diligent plunderers any longer.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well as you know, the president not only like tariffs but he uses them strategically.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely.</p><p>MNUCHIN: And he's right, if it weren't for the tariffs nobody would be at the table negotiating. So, this is really an important tool in rebalancing this relationship.</p><p>DOBBS: And talks will be underway shortly to do just that, we're going to continue our conversation with the Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin right after these very quick words, please stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: We're back with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Secretary, where are we in terms of talks with vice premier, you referred to him today at United Nations. When will you resume these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN: It's actually, I think not next week, it's the following week we'll be having those talks. We have deputy level talks last week. And made a little bit of progress on that front and we look forward to meeting with the vice premier.</p><p>DOBBS: And at the U.N. today, there was just a moment, it seemed uncertainty at least on the part of the media, as to whether or not the Chinese delegation had chosen to skip the agriculture talks in Montana and Nebraska or whether or not treasury and trade representative had suggested to them that they skip it. Can you clear that?</p><p>MNUCHIN: I just wanted to clarify because I didn't --</p><p>DOBBS: Sure.</p><p>MNUCHIN: -- want people to think that they cancelled the trip and that meant they weren't buying agriculture. They are buying agriculture. We just decided the timing of the trip wasn't necessarily the perfect timing. So they'll rescheduling that to after our trade meetings.</p><p>DOBBS: When you say we, you're referring to you and Lighthizer?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Exactly, Bob and I.</p><p>DOBBS: Okay, great. Let's go to another very important and I think most people would probably be surprised to learn just how much of your time is spent on national security on sanctions approaching at least half your time, right?</p><p>MNUCHIN: It is.</p><p>DOBBS: And Iran, we're at a juncture that I think very few people saw arriving. That is with tensions at a height, and the president cool headedly, and constrained not unleashing the hounds of hell. Give us your sense of where we are and how sanctions in fact working?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, let me just put this in perspective because I think you know, the president campaigned on that he was going to reap up the Iran nuclear deal, that it was a terrible deal, and that it would have allowed Iran to end up with nuclear weapons, at the end of a relatively short-term.</p><p>And also had many other things that didn't address, so when the president came in, he did that. He instructed us to put the sanctions back on. These have been the toughest sanctions that have ever in place and there's no question they're working, we've cut off the money to Iran and that money was being used to spread terrorism.</p><p>DOBBS: Sanctioning now, even the central bank?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Yes, so the president did three things recently, one was he authorized us to put sanctions on the central bank and the sovereign well fund but we're using money for terror.</p><p>He also agreed to send a couple of hundred troops for defensive purposes to Saudi and expedite arm sales.</p><p>DOBBS: And the consequence because these sanctions have been in effect, they have obviously the gradation has been to tighter and stronger sanctions throughout.</p><p>But these sanctions now are severe as they are, does it mean that Iran in your judgment will be forced to come to a negotiating table and to change their waves?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well I don't want to predict what they'll do but I will say is they are working so there is no question that they are working and that they're cutting off the source of funds.</p><p>DOBBS: And the maximum pressure campaign, are you now at maximum pressure in these sanctions, or is there still room to inflict further burden on the Iranians if they continue as they have?</p><p>MNUCHIN: We're almost at maximum pressure with Iran but more importantly, we still have the ability to go after third parties that violate our sanctions and that will really be the focus of what we're working on now at-this-point.</p><p>DOBBS: Talking about the constraints, Huawei, their role now is - it's ambiguous where they stand within both our national security as well as national economic policies.</p><p>The Europeans have not eagerly at least moved toward the same degree of concern about the espionage organization of the PLA. Your thoughts?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, I want to be careful what I say because obviously, I have access to a lot of information on this. The first issue and really the most important issue is we want to make sure that the U.S. government and our allies are not using Huawei equipment in our infrastructure and that's really something we're focused on.</p><p>As it relates to selling things to them, I think you know, some of the stuff are commodity items that we make, that South Korea makes, and some of them are more strategic.</p><p>So, there's really two different issues, one is what we're buying from them, and two is what we're selling to them.</p><p>DOBBS: And as we conclude here, the relationship with business in this country, there has never been a better president in the first --in his first term in office and we know there'll be two, for business, for markets, and yet we have a Wall Street that has been resistant to balance trade with China.</p><p>They are not being particularly helpful, they, being the be community in fighting against the policies of this president, and you, and Robert Lighthizer on balancing trade. You call it rebalancing and I would call it for the first time truly a balancing.</p><p>What more would you ask of - it just seems to me that something should be asked of business community, of Wall Street to assist this government in pursuing national economic and national security policy because in many instances they are working against the interest of the country?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well I think as you said, this president a very much pro- business, and pro-economy president. So, when we came in, there were three parts, first was tax cuts, historic tax cuts. Number two was regulatory relief which allowed us to really do business properly again, and the third is trade.</p><p>And I think there are a lot of people in the business community that are supportive of the trade. I think there's also a lot of people who realize that China is a giant market, that if U.S. companies and U.S. workers can compete fairly in China, that's a tremendous opportunity for U.S. business and U.S. workers. So that's a big priority for us.</p><p>DOBBS: I understand, but I don't understand why there isn't at least an expression of reciprocity and some gratitude for the leadership of the president and his policies that would assure some alignment between Wall Street, the Chamber of Commerce, and the business roundtable with you and Robert Lighthizer.</p><p>Mr. Secretary, great talking with you, I appreciate it, look forward to talking with you soon.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Great to be here. Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you and much luck. Up next, we take a look at a bill, Senator Mike Lee is trying to force through the Senate. Oh, man, does it have interesting sponsors, and you know outsourcing, and American workers, it's a problem in that bill. We take it up right after these quick messages, stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: There's something percolating in U.S. Senate right now that I wanted to bring to your attention because it is a very serious matter. Rino Senator Mike Lee has put forward a plan this week to -- as he is the lead sponsor to push through legislation that would be detrimental to the American worker.</p><p>No ifs, ands, or buts, about it. Lee Senate Bill 386, it's called the fairness for high skilled immigrants act. Think about this, fairness for high skilled immigrants act, it would remove green card Limits. He will allow largest the countries, India and China, those two countries to pack green card lines with as many H-1B visa workers as they like all eager to take up U.S. jobs and historically its significantly lower pay.</p><p>Pushing this legislation are companies like Cognizant, and Deloitte, who are two of the biggest sponsors of H-1B visa workers all of America. The U.S. Chamber of Commers, also that's where they're working and they are pushing like the dickens as is Microsoft and Google's parent, Alphabet.</p><p>In this recent election cycle, that is the last election cycle. Senator Lee has raked in tens of thousands of dollars from big tech companies, including more than 33,000 from Microsoft, about 18,000 from Google just for openers.</p><p>Joining us tonight, former Reagan White House political director, Republican strategies, Fox Business political analyst, the most knowledgeable person in this country, I know on politics. Good to have you, Ed.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, GREAT AMERICA PAC CHAIRMAN: Thank you. This is a critical bill for two reasons, one is the president has made a commitment to create jobs for Americans and particularly young Americans coming out of college, and what have you with engineering degrees and health care degrees, what have you.</p><p>And now you basically, this bill would create a competition for them by giving these visas to Indian students who come here and particularly, you know, which is a country of a billion people, give them jobs at lower rates, lower wages than the Americans --</p><p>DOBBS: But typically, somewhere around 20 to 30 percent lower wages, than prevailing wages.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right. Absolutely.</p><p>DOBBS: Even though we're talking about high skilled workers, they're often in jobs that your four basic quadrants of skill and they're usually in lowest of those four levels that define the H1-B visa.</p><p>ROLLINS: As we've talked so many times, immigration is such a critical issue here and we always have to make sure that American students, American -- young Americans seeking jobs they have the benefit of their education and that their competition is among themselves initially.</p><p>And without creating this false competition by giving all these students from India advantages or the visa. And I think to certain extent this bill is kind of a sleeper bill being pushed through by --</p><p>DOBBS: They tried to run it by with unanimous consent last week, and Senator Perdue stopped it because he was uncomfortable, he said with the language.</p><p>I was cheering Senator Purdue until then I found out he'll support it once they fix a little bit of the language which I again led this considerable disappointment. Yes, I've been hanging around politics so long, I still get disappointed and this is one --</p><p>ROLLINS: Well this is one of those bills, it's an imperfect bill, they admitted it's an imperfect bill. And to me, anything that relates to immigration at this point in time needs to get perfectly a lot of imperfect bill.</p><p>And anything that's detriment to the young Americans coming out of college and universities with technical skills should be looked at --</p><p>DOBBS: This president is the president of the working man and woman -</p><p>ROLLINS: And he promised that too, right?</p><p>DOBBS: And you know, these senators need to be very careful about the position they put the president in. Radical Dems, quote, unquote \"Whistleblower,\" who doesn't know while they has no personal knowledge of anything? Isn't a member of the intelligence community, and therefore isn't a whistleblower entitled to any kind of protections.</p><p>I guess we should just ask this person who the hell told that you all this nonsense.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well this is all part of deep state again that we've been fighting now for two years here and I think the reality is that as Rudy Giuliani is so very effectively put, you know Biden's young son has been out there doing some things.</p><p>DOBBS: Well the president makes it very clear.</p><p>ROLLINS: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: We need to know what happened out there.</p><p>ROLLINS: And we should.</p><p>DOBBS: And I have loved the fact that the Dems just hate the idea that president of the United States can ask a question of a foreign leader.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROLLINS: And the reality is -</p><p>DOBBS: And you've got Adam Schiff out there. Ed, he's at it again. Lying through his teeth and just lied.</p><p>ROLLINS: He's been so dismissed but you have to understand, he is the speaker in waiting as far as Nancy Pelosi is concerned.</p><p>DOBBS: He's a fraud in the present.</p><p>ROLLINS: And I think they're looking for any excuse to hold his impeachment hearings. This is --</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let them have at it. They might as well --</p><p>ROLLINS: Let them go, let them go, they're not going to win it, and this is stupid, and they want to expose Biden.</p><p>DOBBS: If they want to indulge in self-emulation then you know --</p><p>ROLLINS: But the one thing is the national news media, it thus need to get after this situation, I mean you know in those tickets. Otherwise, there's, you know they have no credibility.</p><p>DOBBS: This is a comedy act. This is a comedy act. A whistleblower who isn't a whistle blower who is complaining about something he does not know or she doesn't heard, I mean you know that's perfect for Saturday Night Live not for the house of representatives or the Senate.</p><p>And it's always great to see you, partner.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thanks my friend. You take care.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you, you too partner.</p><p>Cory Lewandowski join us next, the former Trump campaign manager and senator to be perhaps, we'll find out. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Joining me now, former Trump campaign manager and author Corey Lewandowski and soon to be senator? How about that? Let's get that out of way right now. You want to declare here tonight or?</p><p>COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, Lou, you know I told you when I'm ready to go, I'm going to let you know first and the Q3 fundraising numbers are due out here very shortly, right end of September.</p><p>And I've said very publicly if the Republican declared candidates in state of New Hampshire can't raise money commensurate with what it takes to beat an incumbent two term senator that, it's going to push me further into the race.</p><p>And after last week's fiasco in front of the house judiciary committee, I don't think another person should ever have to be treated the way I was which was so rude, the name-calling, the disrespect that those committee members showed me, I may run for the U.S. Senate just in case.</p><p>DOBBS: I thought they were very nice to you Corey? I thought they were very respectful.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I mean for Democrats.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: I don't think President Swalwell (ph) was that nice. President Swalwell (ph( wasn't that nice, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let's turn to what's going on right now. The whistleblower, your thoughts?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Lou, my cousin's sister's brother's dog, this is like theme out of baseball the movie told me the story, right. And so, all of a sudden, I'm a whistleblower. Of course, that's not the case. This is a person who has no direct knowledge of the conversation who heard it at a bar that was on a cocktail napkin that given to him by his cousin's friend who might have worked in the White House one day.</p><p>DOBBS: I think you're expecting too much of people, Corey. I mean first of all, you feel, well you know, insulted and affronted by the Radical Dems on Judiciary Committee and now you think a whistleblower should actually know what the hell he or she is talking about at firsthand experience and be a member of the intelligence community in which they are seeking whistleblower status. This is amazing.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: This is crazy talk. But look, if you're going to actually hear the conversation then you've had to actually have heard the conversation. This person never actually heard the conversation.</p><p>And they were so insulted by what they heard, they decide to go to a person who said, you have no credibility in this conversation, so we're not going to pursue this. That's the chaos.</p><p>But Lou, you know this. The mainstream media --</p><p>DOBBS: They love it.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: -- hates this president more than they love the country. And what that means is anything to stop Donald Trump.</p><p>DOBBS: I think you're exactly right. Corey, great to have you with us. And by the way, this is where you're going to announce your senatorial run, right?</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Lou, if I do it, I'm coming here, you know that.</p><p>DOBBS: You got it. All right, you're on the record.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And I know you want to now you top start with a clean record. Thanks so much.</p><p>LEWANDOWSKI: Yes, I do.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks so much.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Thanks, Corey. Corey Lewandowski. Joining me now, Pastor Robert Jeffress, member of the White House Faith Initiative Pastor The First Baptist Church of Dallas, Fox Business contributor, the president today Pastor, actually I mean taking up for the world to hear the religion liberties as a priorities of this president and this nation.</p><p>PASTOR ROBERT JEFFRESS, WHITE HOUSE FAITH INITIATIVE MEMBER: And the first time in history any leader of any nation has ever spoken to the U.N. on that topic, that is unbelievable. But he was addressing a real problem, he did it with passion, he did it honestly.</p><p>And look, Lou, this was right thing to do morally, but it was a brilliant thing to do politically. I mean instead of going to some boring summit on climate change and imaginary problem, he says, to heck with that, and he has his own conference on a real problem, religious liberty.</p><p>There is no president in history that would have the guts to do what this president did today.</p><p>DOBBS: You know and he's had a lot of days like today.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: No previous president would have had the guts to do because they didn't do it. They had opportunity whether it is standing up for this nation and international trade, whether it is making a partner of Mexico.</p><p>Putting tens of thousands of troops on the borders of south and northern borders of Mexico to stop illegal immigration, the list goes just on and on, tearing up what was the so-called legacy of Barack Obama.</p><p>JEFFRESS: You know watching him deal with the Democrats, Lou, it reminds me of that Road Runner cartoon, Road Runner and Wild Coyote. Road Runner was always out smarting the Coyote. They thought they had even a box and they didn't.</p><p>The Dems have not been able to catch him yet. They felt that having trapped in this global climate thing today, he said the heck with that, I'm going to have my own summit. This is the leadership that infuriates his enemies and makes his people love him.</p><p>DOBBS: And by the way, it's great for America. Pastor, as are you, appreciate it. Pastor Robert Jeffress, thanks so much.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: We'll be right back, stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: A few concluding thoughts tonight on a few of this historic president's detractors and of course the Radical Dems who oppose everything he intends and achieves and a word or two of caution to them.</p><p>Let's begin with Mitt Romney, a tire-sen fellow with their rule over one, his latest tweet is so pathetic it begins with a hypothetical quote. If the president asked who are pressured et-cetera, et-cetera, Romney is a know nothing, and the worst kind of rino who wanted to lead but who can't now follow the nation's true leader.</p><p>It doesn't matter to Romney or the Radical Dems that the so-called whistleblower has no firsthand knowledge of anything that president's enemies claimed, but that was enough for the ignored than the venal to charge head long into fabrications and absurdly baseless calls to impeach the president.</p><p>These people are worse than fools, they know better and still they lie. But this time they've been caught early. And the person who is being hosted with the left's petard is none there than sleepy Joe Biden himself because these are his words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VP OF THE UNITED STATES: You're not getting the bill and I will be leaving here, and I think about six hours, I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Now dear Dem hopefuls and leftist media, Biden is in full glaring focus. And now finally, we're about to watch what appears to be the beginning of an investigation of the Obama-Biden era and all of the political corruption it spawned.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. We thank you for being with us. Tomorrow night, Judge Jeanine Pirro and Sebastian Gorka among our guests. And we hope you all join us.</p><p>A reminder to follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs, like me on Facebook, follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Thanks for being with us tonight, see you here tomorrow. Good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

India\u2019s growing protectionism, and its $5.5bn purchase of a Russian missile shield system hasn\u2019t helped.</p><p>Negotiators have been trying for weeks to put together an accord ahead of the visit. It\u2019s still not clear whether something could be signed on Monday and Washington has been playing down the prospect, but even a mini-deal could ease trade tension between the two countries.</p><p>Last year Mr Trump sang Mr Modi\u2019s praises when the pair appeared at a mass rally in Texas.

Moderate Democrats Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar will want to show they can do well among groups that haven\u2019t really warmed to them before.</p><p>Success in South Carolina also offers the chance to build momentum ahead of Super Tuesday, when Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, will be on the ballot for the first time.</p><p>Assange extradition</p><p>Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, will begin his fight against extradition to the US in a London court on Monday, arguing that the spying charges against him are politically motivated. </p><p>Mr Assange faces 18 criminal charges in the US and is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning over the leak of hundreds of thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks in 2010.</p><p>The court is also likely to hear details of claims that surfaced last week over a visit by a former US Republican congressman, Dana Rohrabacher, to Mr Assange in 2017 while he was holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.</p><p>Mr Assange\u2019s lawyers claimed at a hearing at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday that during the visit Mr Rohrabacher had, \u201con instructions\u201d from President Donald Trump, allegedly offered their client a pardon. </p><p>In exchange, Mr Assange would have to say that Russia played no role in the leaking of Democratic National Committee emails in 2016 ahead of the US presidential election, according to the claims. The series of embarrassing emails were hacked before being published by WikiLeaks.</p><p>Both Mr Rohrabacher and the White House have denied any offer of a pardon was made.</p><p>Catalan talks</p><p>Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Catalonia\u2019s regional leader Quim Torra begin talks on Wednesday about the future of Catalan independence \u2014 a cause favoured by just under half of the region\u2019s voters.</p><p>Any co-operation between the government in Madrid and Catalan politicians is enormously sensitive. A backlash in the rest of Spain to the botched 2017 independence bid fuelled the rise of hard-right party Vox.</p><p>Talks were a condition set out by separatists from the Catalan Republican Left, who were instrumental in Mr Sanchez\u2019s confirmation as prime minister in January.</p><p>Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont will on Saturday hold a rally in Perpignan, southern France, ahead of next month\u2019s nationwide municipal elections.</p><p>\u25cf French far-right targets disaffected Perpignan</p><p>South Africa budget</p><p>South Africa\u2019s budget on Wednesday is seen as a last chance to stop Moody\u2019s stripping the country of its last remaining investment-grade credit rating and to prevent state borrowing costs spiralling further.</p><p>South Africa\u2019s troubled economy has been hamstrung by the increasingly frequent power shortages caused by the crisis at heavily indebted electricity monopoly Eskom. </p><p>In a midterm budget in October, the Treasury cut its growth forecasts and warned that fiscal deficits will be higher than expected for the next few years.</p><p>Slovakia election</p><p>The ruling Smer party is expected to lose its parliamentary majority this Saturday. Polls suggest that a coalition of four opposition parties could oust Smer, which has dominated Slovak politics for more than a decade. </p><p>The four political groups come from different parts of the political spectrum, ranging from liberal to centre right and failure to co-operate could leave the door open for Smer to cling on to power.</p><p>Earnings</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AB InBev</emphasis>, the world\u2019s largest beer maker, reports fourth-quarter results on Thursday. Last year, AB InBev scaled down earnings expectations because of tough conditions in key markets, such as Brazil and the US. The brewer has a fierce reputation for cost-cutting, but analysts say it now must show it can boost sales, not just by raising prices but by persuading people to drink more of its beer.</p><p>It\u2019s a busy week for earnings in London with AB Foods, Reckitt Benckiser, Rolls-Royce, WPP, Rio Tinto, William Hill, StanChart and Metro Bank among the many reporting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reckitt Benckiser</emphasis>\u2019s full-year results on Thursday will give chief executive Laxman Narasimhan a chance to reveal his next moves after promising a \u201cfull diagnosis\u201d to determine \u201cwhere improvements need to be made to return the company to sustained positive performance\u201d after a weak third-quarter.</p><p>Investors will focus on how Mr Narasimhan plans to stabilise profit margins, address falling sales at baby formula maker Mead Johnson and whether he intends to split Reckitt\u2019s hygiene and home business from the health business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WPP</emphasis> reports the same day when investors will hope the strategy shift at global advertising group can deliver again after it bounced back to quarterly growth for the first time in more than a year last October.</p><p>However, chief executive Mark Read still faces a challenge to revive flagging growth at a time of sweeping change in the industry and he has warned the turnround will not be \u201ca linear progression\u201d. </p><p>Primark-owner <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Associated British Foods</emphasis> updates on first-half trading on Monday, when investors will see if Covid-19 will hit clothing shipments from China, where 40 per cent of Primark\u2019s clothing comes from.</p><p>Focus is likely to fall on cash generation when miner <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rio Tinto</emphasis> publishes full-year results on Wednesday. High iron ore prices could mean a windfall for shareholders and dividends could be as high as three dollars a share \u2014 90 per cent of earnings.</p><p>Housebuilders <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Persimmon</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Taylor Wimpey</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vistry</emphasis>, formerly Bovis, report through the week, when future guidance will be of interest to investors in search of notes of optimism now that Brexit uncertainty has lifted.</p><p>Earnings season in the US is beginning to wind down with just 44 companies in the S&amp;P 500 scheduled to report results.

And it's very dangerous. And they're told never to leave their house at night and at the day, during the day, always carry a gun.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAPPER: CNN's Kaitlan Collins at the White House for us right now.</p><p>Kaitlan, the president painting a rather stark picture there.</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, sharpening his message on immigration.</p><p>And, Jake, as he was recounting those stories that he said he heard from the donors around him, the president said he wants to send more military to the southern border. Now, we're told a formal request has not been made with the Pentagon yet, but, Jake, that's coming amid another big fight in Washington, that one over the president's taxes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: While I'm under audit, I won't do it.</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): President Trump holding the line.</p><p>TRUMP: There's no law whatsoever.</p><p>COLLINS: Insisting he's still under audit on the day of a deadline set by House Democrats for the IRS to hand over six years of his tax returns.</p><p>TRUMP: If I'm not under audit, I would do it. I have no problem with it. But while I'm under audit, I would not give my taxes.</p><p>COLLINS: The IRS has made it a regular practice to audit every sitting president and vice president since the 1970s.</p><p>RICHARD NIXON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook.</p><p>COLLINS: And both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush released their returns while in office.</p><p>TRUMP: No lawyer would tell you to release your tax returns while you're under audit.</p><p>COLLINS: That fight brewing amid an upheaval at the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>TRUMP: I think that the whole asylum rules, laws, and regulations have been taken advantage of by people that are very bad people in many cases.</p><p>COLLINS: It's Kirstjen Nielsen's last day on the job after being pushed out earlier this week. And the acting deputy secretary was forced to step down yesterday.</p><p>But some are skeptical the changes in leadership will change anything.</p><p>TRUMP: It's very important that the Democrats in Congress change these loopholes.</p><p>COLLINS: Today, Trump praised the aide he recently put in charge of all immigration and border issues.</p><p>TRUMP: Stephen is an excellent guy. He's a wonderful person.</p><p>COLLINS: The DHS purge has put Stephen Miller under a microscope.</p><p>SEN. ROBERT MENENDEZ (D-NJ): It's really problematic. It's really concerning. And he is a big driver of the president's xenophobic views.</p><p>COLLINS: But, today, Trump made clear who's really in control.</p><p>TRUMP: Frankly, there's only one person that is running it. You know who that is? It's me.</p><p>COLLINS: Minutes after that, Miller echoed the president's exact words, telling CNN in a statement, \"Only one person in this U.S. government runs immigration policy, President Donald Trump.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COLLINS: Now, Jake, those big staffing changes at DHS are supposed to make way for more aggressive immigration tactics, but Miller, while he has influence, is certainly not the only one working on immigration. We're also told that the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is working on his own legal immigration reform, something that the president said will be unveiled shortly and that he's excited about -- Jake.</p><p>TAPPER: All right, Kaitlan Collins, thank you so much.</p><p>Let's talk about this.</p><p>President Trump again claiming today he cannot release his taxes because he's under audit. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: And while I'm under audit, I won't do it. If I'm not under audit, I would do it. I had no problem with it. I would love to give them, but I'm not going to do it while I'm under audit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAPPER: First of all, he's -- just as a factual matter, he's provided no evidence he's under audit. He's been saying this for a long, long time.</p><p>But even if you're under audit, you're allowed to release your returns. It hasn't stopped previous presidents.</p><p>SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: He could, and he could have released them in 2016.</p><p>But he didn't and he still won the election. So, I think if he's thinking of it politically, he's like, I didn't do it before and I won. Why would I do it again?</p><p>It strikes me that there are a number of lines of inquiry into his taxes. You have got state issues in New York, federal issues in Washington. And so they need to be prepared to lose one of those lines of inquiry sometime over the next two years and then deal with it if they don't win out on this.</p><p>I'm not really concerned about the polling, because I don't really think this is going to be material to whether he gets recollected or not. If I were running, I would release my taxes. But I get why he's not doing it.</p><p>MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: But he would love to do it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CARDONA: He said he would love to do it, Jake.</p><p>MIA LOVE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Right. Yes.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes.</p><p>CARDONA: So, I think somebody just needs to convince him that, even though he's under audit, like every other president was under audit when they put out their taxes, he can do it, because he would love to do it.</p><p>JENNINGS: And I don't really care about Bernie Sanders' taxes, either. I mean, look, what are we going to find out? These are rich guys...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JENNINGS: ... who have some real estate. That's what we're going to find out. People already know that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARDONA: But, see, this is a really good question, Scott, because there is clearly something in there that he is dying for us not to know, or else he would have released it.</p><p>[16:35:04]</p><p>What you see in somebody's taxes can be whether he's beholden to foreign governments, whether he's beholden to Russian oligarchs. And a president who is beholden to foreigners of any type is a president who is compromised.</p><p>LOVE: You know, I'm not going to make a decision of what's in his taxes, because I haven't seen it.</p><p>TAPPER: Right.</p><p>LOVE: So I'm not going to assume that -- whatever's in there.</p><p>But I can tell you this. If you're thinking strictly politically, his supporters that voted him in do not care about it. And those who actually voted for him aren't going to look at this. And I don't think it's going to take any of his supporters away or bring people to come along.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TIFFANY CROSS, THE BEAT D.C.: Thank God his supporters are not the litmus test for what matters in the country. His supporters don't care about a lot of things.</p><p>They don't care about people who look like me, I would argue, or people who look like you, I would argue. So, I don't think that's the litmus test for him to release his taxes.</p><p>I think, look, there is demonstrable evidence that this president is compromised. We learned in the Michael Cohen plea deal that he had a multimillion-dollar reason to laud all of this praise on Vladimir Putin.</p><p>LOVE: Yes. CROSS: I want to know, as a citizen, and I would hope my fellow patriots as citizens also want to know, why is he not releasing his tax returns?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LOVE: I'm not making the argument about whether we think he should be -- I'm just saying that, politically, he doesn't have -- there isn't anything that is forcing him to do it right now, and so he's not going to do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TAPPER: So, Kellyanne Conway today defended her boss, the president, on CNN about his not releasing the tax returns. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: He's under audit. If he wasn't under audit, maybe he would release them. He didn't release them during the campaign and he was elected anyway. Everybody knew that that -- that people were asking about those tax returns.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAPPER: You know who was asking about those tax returns back in 2016? Well, Kellyanne Conway.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONWAY: It's a completely transparent, Donald Trump's tax returns aren't. I would like to see those be transparent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAPPER: That was, of course, before she took a -- she joined the campaign.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TAPPER: But there is a precedent here. And explain why it's important for people to see the returns; 67 percent of the American people, according to CNN's recent poll, think it's important. Why?</p><p>CROSS: Yes.</p><p>I think, first of all, we have seen evidence from this president of not being truthful. So, again, to the point that there is nothing stopping him from releasing his taxes, he said multiple times on the campaign trail, I will release them when Hillary releases her e-mails, I will release them when I'm not under audit.</p><p>I think it's really important for a president to be transparent about his finances and his financial obligations. I think part of the reason, quite honestly, is his ego. I think perhaps he's not as wealthy as he's presented himself to be. I think he's presented himself to be this billionaire. Perhaps we will see that that's not quite true.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes.</p><p>I want to turn to immigration. The president today complimented his top aide, Stephen Miller, who's come under a lot of fire from the left and the center, but he also said this about his immigration policies. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Frankly, there's only one person that's running it. You know who that is? It's me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAPPER: You guys, I know, both support some sort of larger immigration reform compromise. And Stephen Miller is kind of in the way of that.</p><p>LOVE: This is an issue that -- I would rather be talking about this issue. This is something that is incredibly important to me.</p><p>I am a daughter of parents who emigrated to this country. I would actually like to see the administration say something positive about good immigrants that have come to this country and have contributed to our great American democracy.</p><p>My parents came with just $10 in their pockets. And I have to tell you, the greatest pride that my father has is the fact that he said, I wasn't willing to just take on the benefits. I was willing to take on the responsibilities. And I raised a daughter to be the first black female Republican in the House of Representatives.</p><p>And there's such great people that come into this country that want to contribute, and there's really no way for them to do that.</p><p>CARDONA: So, as a Latina immigrant myself, coming from one of those S-hole countries...</p><p>TAPPER: You're an immigrant yourself?</p><p>CARDONA: I am.</p><p>TAPPER: Where are you from?</p><p>CARDONA: I born in Colombia.</p><p>TAPPER: Oh, I did not know that.</p><p>CARDONA: I came over here at 2 years old, and my had had $10 in his pocket.</p><p>So this is my story. This is, frankly, all of our stories, if we look at actually where we came from.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARDONA: This is why this issue is so infuriating, not just to immigrants, but to people who understand that this is about America's values. This is about the foundation of why and how we put this country together.</p><p>I was at a gala for a Latino civil rights group the other night, and the president of the gala was lauding Ronald Reagan, because Ronald Reagan, the Republican president that everybody admires, including Donald Trump, is the one who called this country a shining city on a hill.</p><p>Donald Trump wants to abolish that shining city, wants to close it down. He has already said there is no more room. And this is, I think, going to be a big issue going into 2020.</p><p>TAPPER: Scott, very quickly, there could be a big -- in the only Nixon can go to China kind of way, Donald Trump could have a big comprehensive immigration reform and get some stuff he wants, along with some stuff he doesn't want.</p><p>Is Stephen Miller the impediment, or is it the Trump base? What's the problem?</p><p>JENNINGS: I don't think the Trump base is an impediment.</p><p>I think if the president were to bless a deal, big or small, the Trump base would go along with it. Obviously, he has competing interests in the White House. We heard Jared Kushner is working on a deal to -- right now to increase legal immigration, which would have to be part of a comprehensive plan.</p><p>[16:40:10]</p><p>I totally agree with you. If Donald Trump puts it together and blesses it, the Republicans will go with it. If he doesn't bless it, they won't be able to vote for it because they won't trust the congressional leaders as much as they trust the president.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LOVE: I have got a deal for him. We have got all of these good, comprehensive bills. He really doesn't have to rewrite the book.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CROSS: It's never going to happen.</p><p>TAPPER: Everyone, stick around.</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders just unveiled a proposal that some of his 2020 rivals are signing on to. The White House is attacking it. That's next.</p><p>TAPPER: The 2020 lead now.</p><p>Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders just pushed Medicare for all front and center.</p><p>[16:45:00] Four years ago Sanders proposal was basically considered fringe by many in the Democratic establishment. Today it's rather mainstream in the party embraced by several other presidential candidates.</p><p>Sanders presented his plan today but was not willing to stick around for questions from reporters afterwards. CNN's Ryan Nobles has a story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning, everybody!</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Bernie Sanders today doubling down on Medicare for all.</p><p>SANDERS: They want a health care system which will guarantee them freedom of choice in terms of the doctor or hospital they go to.</p><p>NOBLES: The Vermont Senator today flanked by his 2020 rival Kirsten Gillibrand unveiling Medicare for all 2.0.</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The money, the greed, the corruption that surrounds our health care system today is what is in the way.</p><p>NOBLES: The revamped proposal would add new provisions to cover long- term care and eliminate premiums, deductibles, and co-pays except for a potential $200 copay for brand name drugs. The sweeping overhaul of the country's health care system would effectively eliminate the private health insurance industry.</p><p>SANDERS: The American people wants and we are going to deliver a Medicare-for-all single-payer system.</p><p>NOBLES: The ambitious new plan which does not come with an estimated price tag raises the stakes for the rest of the 2020 field. Four of Sanders rivals Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker have signed on as co-sponsors. But each is still seeking to carve out their own path when it comes to health care policy.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Anybody who says those words Medicare for all who's running for president, the next thing out of their mouth should be talking to people about well, if we have 50 -- if we have split Congress, what are you going to actually do in your first year could make that health care more accessible and affordable.</p><p>NOBLES: But other 2020 rivals are taking a more measured approach. Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar passed on the chance to co-sponsor the Sanders bill and argues the path forward requires a balance.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'd make clear what I think I'd like to do to get us to universal health care more quickly and to move more quickly, and that is to first of all put in a public option.</p><p>NOBLES: For their part, Republicans seem eager for this fight. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders claiming in a tweet the proposal \"confiscates every American's private health insurance\" while adding, \"stand with President Trump so America will never be a Socialist country.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBLES: And one thing we didn't get today is a price tag for this plan. It will likely be expensive but the Sanders team argues that the overall savings to American taxpayers will be much greater and essentially offering up and even swap here. Whatever they pay additionally in taxes will be offset by the fact that they won't have to pay anything for their health insurance. Jake?</p><p>TAPPER: All right, Ryan Nobles, thank you so much. Speaker Pelosi said just last week, she believes fixes to ObamaCare are the best options right now. On Medicare for all, she told The Washington Post \"I'm agnostic. Show me how you think you can get there.\" This is going to be a fight, a debate in the Democratic primaries.</p><p>MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes. I agree with you. I think that this is going to be a very robust debate within the Democratic primary, and that's what primaries are for. You're going to have now I think there are four candidates who have actually signed on to Bernie's bill so they are going to have to talk about this robustly in terms of what it is they support, how they're going to pay for it.</p><p>But I'll tell you one thing, Jake. I love that the debate and the conversation within the Democratic Party is how you actually try to give more people more access to the best health care while the debate on the Republican side starting from the President on down is we're going to take away your health care America and we have no plan to support that.</p><p>MIA LOVE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I don't think that's fair. I mean, again -- I mean --</p><p>TAPPER: That's why I came to you.</p><p>LOVE: Come on, seriously, you know, the whole issue with the Affordable Care Act was how much it was going to cost. And remember the whole idea is you're going to be able to keep your doctor, you're going to be able to keep your health care insurance. I had story after story from people in my district, pregnant women, that were like look, I've been kicked off of my health care insurance. I think that the American people have adjusted a little bit. I think that --</p><p>CARDONA: They support it now, majority of them support ObamaCare. LOVE: I think what they do really well, the American people are very good at adjusting to what's been given to them. Can we make it better? Absolutely.</p><p>CARDONA: That's what we want.</p><p>LOVE: Do I think that Medicare for all is the answer, that's the big question.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TIFFANY CROSS, CO-FOUNDER AND MANAGING EDITOR, THE BEAT D.C.: The American people didn't adjust to it, the Republican Party did. Most members ran on it last election cycle. And when you say it's not fair, fact are not fair sometimes but they're still facts. The Republicans have no plan. They're simply saying --</p><p>LOVE: The whole point is --</p><p>CROSS: They're simply saying --</p><p>LOVE: -- supposed to be Medicare for all is what's going to be fair.</p><p>CROSS: They're saying -- but what's the alternative? Donald Trump is saying we're going to kick over 20 million people off their plan and trust me I have something better. Forgive me if I don't --</p><p>LOVE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Again, you're tying me or the Republican -- you're tying me or the Republican Party to Donald Trump, and this is why --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>[16:50:02] CROSS: How dare us!</p><p>LOVE: Hang on a second.</p><p>TAPPER: Hold on. One at a time. One at a time.</p><p>LOVE: I have got my own set of principles and I believe that everyone should be held accountable to those principles and to the Republican platform. That means holding the President accountable to those things also.</p><p>CROSS: You should probably asked for answers.</p><p>LOVE: I do this all the time. I do this all the time. But it's not okay to say I'm going to put out a plan and not tell people how you're going to sustain that plan. If it were me, I would do everything I can to bring down the cost of health care and thereby giving as many people as much access to health care their way that you can do it.</p><p>CARDONA: It's also not OK to tell the American people we are going to challenge the health care system that we have now, we're going to take you off of it if the Supreme Court abolish is it and we have no plan to put in its place. TAPPER: So Scott, I want -- I want to run this sound for you. This is Bernie Sanders. Because obviously, his bill would end private health insurance as we know it today. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: Under Medicare for all, we couple all basic health care needs so they're not going to be there to do that. I suppose if you want to make yourself look a little bit more beautiful, you want to work on that nose, your ears, they can do that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So basically BlueCross BlueShield would be reduced to nose jobs.</p><p>SANDERS: Something like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: What you just said is interesting. You can't just tell people we're going to upend their whole health care. That's what he's doing.</p><p>CARDONA: He's not the president, Scott.</p><p>LOVE: But he's running for President.</p><p>JENNINGS: And by the way, he might be the frontrunner. What I find amazing is --</p><p>TAPPER: He's definitely the frontrunner.</p><p>LOVE: Yes.</p><p>JENNINGS: -- these Democrats are running away from ObamaCare.</p><p>CROSS: No they're not.</p><p>JENNINGS: I mean, you got Bernie Sanders trashing --</p><p>TAPPER: The -- he's saying the ones that are embracing Medicare for all.</p><p>JENNINGS: If you have embraced Medicare for all --</p><p>CROSS: I don't think there are running away from ObamaCare.</p><p>JENNINGS: You're saying that health care is broken and we have to do something different. We currently have ObamaCare. I find this amazing. You have Democrats arguing ObamaCare is great and then you have the front-runner for the nomination arguing that health care is failing and we have to throw it out and do something else. I think he is going to win the primary at this moment. If you --</p><p>TAPPER: Oh, you thought Michael Avenatti was going to be the --</p><p>JENNINGS: Well, he's coming back. LOVE: My theory is this. My theory is this. And mark my words. If this continues to be the conversation where there aren't any real plans for anything, the President is going to win again.</p><p>CARDONA: If health care is the conversation, bring it on.</p><p>TAPPER: OK, be sure to tune in to CNN tonight for a town hall with Washington Governor and Democratic Presidential Candidate Jay Inslee. My colleague and friend Wolf Blitzer will host the live event tonight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>Coming up,, Senator Elizabeth Warren agreeing with Medicare for all as she runs a substance over style campaign some say. It could be paying off. New reporting on Warren's 2020 strategy next.</p><p>[16:55:00] TAPPER: Our \"MONEY LEAD\" now. Moments ago Senator Elizabeth Warren released her first quarter fundraising numbers, more than $6 million which gives her a leg up over senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, but falls behind other 2020ers such as Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke, Senators Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders. CNN M.J. Lee has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>M.J. LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Senator Elizabeth Warren today announcing her first quarter fundraising haul more than $6 million. In an e-mail to supporters, her campaign manager sharing these details about Warren's war chest, total number of donors over $135,000, average donation $28.00, cash on hand $11.2 million.</p><p>Warren's fundraising total lagging behind a handful of her competitors Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, and Pete Buttigieg, but ahead of fellow Senators Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. But the number of donors that gave to Warren this quarter rivaling some of those competitors.</p><p>All of this coming after Warren pledged she would not solicit high- dollar donations during the 2020 primary including through fundraisers. Warren insisting to CNN last week that even a disappointing fundraising number would not change her game plan.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): I'm running the campaign I want to run and that is instead of spending time with millionaire donors, I've been out of 12 states and Puerto Rico.</p><p>LEE: And today, new details about Warren's long haul 2020 strategy. Advisers telling CNN that the campaign now has more than 170 full-time paid staff. Half of them in the early States of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. CNN has also learned that the warren campaign is pursuing a 50-state strategy.</p><p>Warren is traveling extensively and mapping out opportunities to pick up delegates and what could be a long slog to the Democratic convention next summer. WARREN: So we're going to get organized, we're going to fight for working people, we're got to build a grassroots movement, and that is how I am going to be the first woman elected president of the United States of America.</p><p>LEE: As she heads into the second quarter, Warren pulling in single digits nationally despite driving the conversation with numerous far- reaching policy ideas. She's proposed a wealth tax on the richest Americans, a plan on universal child care and called for breaking up big tech companies. And her latest proposal ending the Senate filibuster jump-starting a debate in Washington.</p><p>WARREN: When Democrats next have power, we should be bold. We are done with two sets of rules, one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEE: Now the campaign says it spent $5.2 million of the $6 million that it raised in the first quarter which is a pretty high burn rate but it also said that it transferred more than $10 million from Warren Senate campaign so that's a pretty big cushion for now, Jake.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019041002CNV40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVY-D701-DXH2-64FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4184\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bernie Sanders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

And I'm speaking to tenants - in some cases foreign people, foreign tenants - but they have where they're tenants in buildings throughout various cities in California, and other places ... where they want to leave the country. They can't believe what's happening,\" Trump told reporters traveling with him on his way to a fundraiser in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Homelessness is a huge problem, particularly on the West Coast. It's also where the Trump Organization owns real estate, including a share of 555 California Street, one of the tallest buildings in San Francisco. Trump said Tuesday that homelessness is hurting real estate investment because, he said, foreign investors want to leave the US.</p><p>\"We have people living in our ... best highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings and pay tremendous taxes, where people in those buildings pay tremendous taxes, where they went to those locations because of the prestige,\" he said.</p><p>But what exactly he'll do remains something of a mystery, although there are some clues.</p><p>During a call with reporters Monday, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/09/16/trump-prepares-big-push-homelessness-white-house-floats-new-role-police/\">acting head of the Council of Economic Advisers Tom Philipson</url> said \"policing may be an important tool to help them get off the street.\"</p><p>The federal government does not generally police US cities. That's a role left to local governments. The specter of a federal police force entering California to deal with homelessness would cause all sorts of problems, especially since cities in that state have already pledged to be sanctuaries from federal agents cracking down under Trump on undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Philipson made the comments about policing as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-State-of-Homelessness-in-America.pdf\">administration released a new report on its view of homelessness</url>, particularly in California, where a large portion of the country's unsheltered homeless people live. The main policy proposal the report suggested was to deregulate housing markets, which the report argued would lower housing prices. Trump signed an executive order in June that creates a new council under Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson that would explore ways to change building regulations and zoning laws to make houses cheaper.</p><p>The administration's report on homelessness also suggested that places with so-called Right to Shelter laws have higher rates of homelessness and argued these laws are counterproductive.</p><p>The Washington Post also reported Tuesday his administration is looking at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-homeless-people-hurt-the-prestige-of-los-angeles-san-francisco/2019/09/17/71e71b9e-d982-11e9-ac63-3016711543fe_story.html\">abandoned government facilities as an option to house</url> homeless people.</p><p>Trump promised action on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/17/politics/donald-trump-california-emissions-homelessness/index.html\">homelessness issue before his trip out West.</url></p><p>\"We are going to have to step in and do something about it,\" he told a gathering of House Republicans in Baltimore last week. \"We can't allow it. And in the not too distant future, you are going to see we are going to step in.\"</p><p>Trump's involvement with foreign interests in his buildings is well documented and perhaps to be expected in the world of high-priced real estate. He talked in 2015 about selling apartments in his buildings to Saudi Arabians.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/09/17/trump-arrives-in-bay-area-for-fundraiser-in-first-visit-as-president/\">           Dodging protesters, Trump woos Big Tech donors in stealthy Bay Area visit       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/09/17/he-was-a-yale-graduate-wall-street-banker-and-entrepreneur-today-hes-homeless-in-california/\">           He was a Yale graduate, banker and entrepreneur.

Biden and Trump have very different views on how the next four years should look for this country. Because of that, certain sectors of the market will respond to a victory from each candidate differently.While there are positives and negatives for each candidate for the overall market, individual industries will be affected more directly. Below I discuss exactly what to expect from some selected sectors, and how to profit in either situation. </p><p>But first let's talk about how the markets perceive each candidate.Who Does the Market Favor? The market would prefer Trump to any Democratic candidate because of the threat of higher taxes. While Biden is a net negative for investors, he is perceived as less harmful than Bernie Sanders would have been.Because of Biden's time as Vice President, the market knows what it is getting, which would be similar polices to the Obama Administration. This creates some clarity and calm with investors as opposed to Trump, who has created volatility in the past with his aggression towards China.At the moment, the polls and betting markets give the edge to Biden. When he moved ahead of Trump, the stock market didn't react negatively. This is a sign that the investors don't have a major preference between the two outcomes. So, while the market might favor Trump slightly, there isn't major favoritism as there would have been with other Democratic nominees.Sector Outlook: Trump Let's look at a few sectors likely to perform well if Trump keeps his seat in the Oval Office.Infrastructure- Materials and industrials will benefit with a stimulus bill on infrastructure. A big deal has been promised for years, but after COVID-19, we are likely to see finally some movement after the election. Trump has been eyeing an $1 trillion infrastructure package that would target roads, bridges and public transport as well as 5G network infrastructure. The stocks that build and supply the materials for these projects with directly benefit.Energy- Trump would be friendly to the traditional oil companies, encouraging fossil fuel production with less regulation. Big oil could see a big rally in shares with any threat of a Green New Deal off the table.Financials- Wall Street will benefit with lower taxes and less regulations. While banks have struggled with low interest rates, the market volatility has been good for trading. Assuming the economy comes back and interest rates can tick higher, a second Trump term could be very bullish for the banks.Keep Reading . . . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Major Buying Opportunity: The 2020 Election[1]Donald Trump and Joe Biden have vastly different visions for America. After the election, different industries could skyrocket depending on who will lead the country for the next 4 years. Fast-moving investors can reap big gains when the buying frenzy begins.In Zacks' 2020 Election Stock Report, you'll discover 6 stocks to own if Trump wins and 6 if Biden wins.Before previous elections, Zacks reports recommended stocks that climbed +71%, +83%, even +185% in the following months. This year's picks could be even more lucrative.See Election Stocks Now  &gt; &gt;[2]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Consumer Discretionary- A Trump win would mean taxes stay low - and they could possibly even go lower if Trump gets his desired middle-class tax cut of 10%. A cut of that size would put more income in people's pockets, which would be good for the consumer staples and discretionary sectors. Think retail and discount retail stores as beneficiaries that would thrive with more cash in the pockets of the American consumer.Sector Outlook: Biden Now, let's explore sectors likely to benefit from a Biden victory in November.Infrastructure- Biden has even bigger ambitions on stimulus than Trump, aiming for $2 trillion of investment in his first term. Roads and bridges are of course on the agenda, but Biden will also focus on green spaces, water systems, electricity grids and broadband. A Biden presidency would have a focus on climate change, which brings us to our next sector.Energy- Big oil is in trouble with a Biden win. Energy would see more regulations and a movement towards greener industries to modernize the economy to combat climate change. Think solar power under Biden.Tech- The Trump admiration has been talking about rolling back protections for big tech. Additionally, Trump has had issues with tech platforms control of content, which has caused a conflict that could be an issue for big companies like Amazon, Facebook and Twitter.While a Biden win might throw a wrench in the tech momentum due to tax concerns, the break-up threat wouldn't be there. Additionally, improved relationship with China could help tech companies that have exposure to Chinese markets.Gold- The amount of spending that is likely to come under Biden will bring the gold bugs out like never before. Not only will we get a big infrastructure bill, but the pandemic has set a precedent for the government to spend.How to Capitalize The next president will have a lot on his plate with an economy trying to recover in the midst of a pandemic. Both Biden and Trump have different views on key economic issues, especially tax policy and energy. The one thing they agree on is infrastructure; it's just how much we need to spend that is the difference.Investors should map out a clear path and strategy to put in place the days and weeks after the election. The next president's plans will shift trillions of dollars around the economy and certain stocks will reward investors that get in early.I've created a special report to help you capture the huge gains that these stocks could produce, starting immediately after the votes are counted. Profits await to those that can execute!Zacks' 2020 Election Stock Report[3] provides my best advice to targeting significant gains after the election results are announced. It reveals specific stocks and ETFs I believe could benefit most: 6 if Trump wins, 6 if Biden wins.I wrote a similar report just before the 2016 election. My recommendations crushed the market with gains of +53%, +70%, +71% and +83% in the months following the election. This year's returns could be even bigger.The 2020 Election Stock Report is only available until Sunday, September 27.Click here to claim your copy of Zacks' Election Stock Report  &gt; &gt;[4]Good Investing,Jeremy Mullin Stock StrategistJeremy Mullin has been a professional trader for more than 15 years with specific expertise in profiting from patterns set by High-Frequency Traders.

This will be the first of the three debates between the two candidates before the election on Nov 3.Both candidates will debate on six topics - their track records, the Supreme Court, COVID-19, the economy, race and violence in cities, and the integrity of the election. According to the Dow Jones data[1], going back to 1960, the stock market dropped 0.14% on average the day after the first presidential debate, witnessed 1.51% decline from the first debate to the next, fell 2.51% between the first debate and the final presidential face-off and recorded a 0.35% dip from the first debate to Election Day.Ahead of the debate, let's take a closer look at some of their strategies and the likely impact on the ETF world: Poll Tracker Joe Biden maintains a steady lead[2] over Donald Trump in national polling at 10-percentage point margin, per the Washington Post and ABC News. The lead was also reflected in an Emerson College/NewsNation poll, which shows Biden leading by 4 percentage points. </p><p>A new MPR News/Star Tribune/KARE-11 Minnesota Poll of 800 registered voters shows former Vice President Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump by 48-42%[3] with 8% undecided (read: A Biden Presidency in the Making? ETF Strategies to Follow[4]).According to the Telegraph's poll tracker, Donald Trump's presidential approval ratings are at steady levels[5]. The tracker put Trump's approval rating at around 44%. Trump vs. BidenTax Policy One of the top priorities of Biden is to partially roll back corporate tax cuts from 38% to 21% enacted under Trump administration and raise the top income tax rate back to 39.6% from 37%. Biden is looking to hike corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% that will result in lower profits and likely reduce share prices.. As such, WisdomTree US Earnings 500 ETF EPS[6], which offers exposure to broad U.S. large cap profitable companies, will be in the spotlight (read: All About Biden's Tax Plan &amp;#38; Its Impact on the ETF World[7]). Healthcare Though both presidential candidates are in support of reducing drug prices, Biden has vowed to expand the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the health care overhaul that former President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. Meanwhile, Trump is fighting to dismantle Obamacare.In the 2021 budget proposal, the Trump administration has suggested deep health care spending cuts over the next decade, especially to Medicaid ($900 billion) and Medicare ($450 billion). On the other hand, Biden opposed to Medicare for All and wants to create a public health insurance option. He wants to lower Medicare eligibility age to 60.Given this, healthcare ETFs like iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF IYH[8], Invesco DWA Healthcare Momentum ETF PTH[9] and iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF IHF[10] are in focus. Clean Energy While Trump has pulled America out of Paris climate agreement, Biden wants to rejoin. He proposed to invest in sustainability and clean energy while Trump is a strong supporter of the fossil fuels industry. Biden aims to pump $2 trillion into green energy over four years to build solar panels, charging stations and more. The clean energy space has been soaring this year with Invesco Solar ETF TAN[11] and ALPS Clean Energy ETF ACES[12] making the most of Biden's proposed promise (read: Here's Why Clean Energy ETFs Are Shining Bright[13]). Big Tech The big technology giants are expected to face increased scrutiny, regardless of whoever wins the election[14]. Trump will maintain or possibly accelerate the broad-scale regulatory scrutiny of technology companies that marked his first term. This includes allegations of anticonservative bias online, antitrust investigations of Internet giants such as Alphabet GOOGL[15] and FacebookFB[16], and actions against China-owned apps such as TikTok and WeChat. On the other hand, Biden is a supporter of stricter antitrust oversight and online privacy rules. He, on his campaign, has emphasized forcing social media companies to better control their sites against false information, and taking government action to help workers under threat from innovations such as self-driving cars. Jobs and Wages Though both the candidates want to create jobs through infrastructure investments, Trump is expected to continue \"Buy American, Hire American\" immigration agenda. Meanwhile, Biden wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $15. The policies have brought consumer discretionary ETFs like Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY[17] and Invesco DWA Consumer Cyclicals Momentum ETF PEZ[18] in the spotlight. COVID-19 Biden's plan to address the pandemic includes offering free testing to all Americans. It calls for hiring 100,000 people for national contact tracing, as well as increasing drive-thru testing sites. On the other hand, Trump's administration has urged Americans to practice social distancing and wear masks to slow the spread of the virus. This policy has accelerated digitalization, giving boost to the stay-at-home ETFs like Direxion Work From Home ETF WFH[19], Roundhill Sports Betting &amp;#38; iGaming ETF BETZ[20] and WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund WCLD[21] (read: Stay-At-Home ETFs to Soar Further on New Lockdown Measures[22]).

Things are still pretty good. Some of those technology stocks that were swooning, by the way, are still up in excess of 30 percent from where they were a little more than a couple of weeks ago. That's with the sell-off.</p><p>The read right now from Susan Li, following all those numbers -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, worst day on Wall Street since June.</p><p>And you're right. Big tech, momentum plays, stocks that have run up a lot this year, were the main drags today. So, Apple saw its worst day since March, just before the stock market hit bottom.</p><p>Now, Apple, the world's largest company, and also the single most influential stock on Wall Street in close to half-a-century, it's so big that, when it falls, it takes the broader market along with it, so Apple taking a breather, along with the rest of markets, after a really hectic pace of gains since the end of March, ending the shortest bear market in history.</p><p>Apple, Salesforce, Microsoft, Home Depot, and Amgen accounting for more than half of the Dow's losses. Also, Amazon, Google, Facebook, other tech high-fliers recording steep losses in the session as well. Investors were even selling off the popular Elon Musk and Tesla. That says something, Tesla on its worst three-day sell-off since March, at the height of COVID.</p><p>Now, remember that Tesla is one of the best-performing stocks this year. It's up over 400 percent, catapulting Elon Musk as the third richest man on the planet, overtaking Mark Zuckerberg this week.</p><p>Zoom has also been a name and one of the, if not the lockdown winner of the year, rallying close to a 50 percent in one single session on Tuesday after earnings. Zoom, along with other work-from-home winners, the DocuSigns, the CrowdStrike, and the Pelotons giving back some of their incredible gains this year.</p><p>But I did look around for some winners for you, Neil. So, I want you to think of energy and oil plays. Travel, Carnival Cruise Lines and Hyatt Hotels, these stocks have been decimated, but they have been staging a comeback in the past month or so.</p><p>And, Neil, don't forget, we have a long weekend coming up, and so Wall Street tends to close up their books early, and don't want to hold too much risk if they can't sell out when the markets are closed.</p><p>CAVUTO: Very good perspective, Susan. Thank you very, very much, Susan Li, on all of that.</p><p>To put this in perspective on how rampant or widespread this selling got today, on the Big Board, declining issues were swamping gaining ones by an 18-1 margin, 18-1, in other words, 18 times more selling than buying.</p><p>On the Nasdaq, what do you think was going on there? -- 70-1, 70 decliners for every one gainer.</p><p>Now, here's what we're going to do before I get to my next guests, because I want us to be all over this. And we will leave for you.</p><p>As you can see, Verizon, American Express the two gainers within the Dow 30 today. We are going to rifle through all the biggest developments in sector moves, what other countries were doing, where we are, not only today, but I thought it would be very handy to give you a perspective with today's sell- off where we still are, so not to just sort of look at this day as a single snapshot of all the days.</p><p>It's not. It is an anomaly. So, no matter what we're talking about and who we're talking to, this will continue throughout this show. So, if you bear with us on that, no matter who's talking -- and it could be on a political development -- we will rifle through all of this, because we feel we owe you a lot more than just give you a headline number or a headline stock report, without giving you some context for that.</p><p>So, if you can -- don't mind being blitzkrieged by data, we're going to blitzkrieg the data.</p><p>With all of that, I do want to get a take on people who follow these type of movements very, very closely, whether this is a time to step back and pause or get out of Dodge.</p><p>Ted Weisberg, the market institution -- in fact, many have recommended putting him in one. He's that good.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: We have also got Kathryn Rooney Vera here of Bulltick Capital Markets, both geniuses.</p><p>So, I appreciate it.</p><p>All right, Teddy, to you first.</p><p>What happened today? What brought this on?</p><p>TED WEISBERG, PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES CORPORATION: Well, first of all, we have seen this show a number of times before.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely.</p><p>WEISBERG: So, I think, whatever the catalyst, Neil, when you get reversals in trends -- and the trends have certainly been positive, particularly for the tech sector -- when you get these reversals, I think, initially, you have to view it as technical in nature.</p><p>They're sharp. They're painful. It's hurtful. I'm not sure we're out of the woods yet. But the fact that they pulled -- kind of pulled the plug on the techs, and the rest of the market followed today, I think it's just a sign that the market was simply overbought.</p><p>It's probably been overbought for the last two or three weeks, if not the last month or so. And so these corrections happen. Fundamentally, I'm not sure that anything changed. We all know what the issues are. I don't think there's anything dramatically new today fundamentally to cause this.</p><p>So, from my perspective, I'm not sure we're through it yet, but I view it as a technical pullback from an overall positive trend. And I would -- I would think that, at some point, the trend will re-exert itself.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Kathryn, if we started the day, before the markets opened, with surprisingly good news on the claims front. I say good news from where we used to be, where these were regularly over a million, 881,000 in the latest period, a lot fewer claimants than thought.</p><p>The trend again continues, those with continuing claims down two million from what people thought they would be. So that looked good going into trading. And then all hell broke loose.</p><p>Now, when you see something like this, what do you tell your clients?</p><p>KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS HOLDINGS: I tell them it's an opportunity to buy, Neil.</p><p>I think that this is -- as Teddy correctly said, this is a fullback and a dip. And I think we need to take into consideration, Neil, what brought us to Apple rising 100 percent from its low, what took us 50 percent higher on the S&amp;P following March 23.</p><p>And the answer, Neil, is the Fed stimulus and federal government stimulus, neither of which is going to end anytime soon. So, if we don't get what I fully expect to occur, the cash that's waiting with breathless anticipation on the sidelines for a dip, a comfortable dip, I call it, of this magnitude, 3 percent, 4 percent.</p><p>It's not a meltdown. So, I think guys are going to step in. I expect that to happen today and tomorrow. And I think, if that doesn't happen, the Fed steps in. The Fed has shown us that they're willing and able to back up the markets. They're already buying high-yield bonds. They will increase their high-yield bond purchases.</p><p>And if this continues in the downside, I personally don't think that the Fed would discard buying equities.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow.</p><p>Well, that is an interesting issue, Ted, because, you think about it, Wall Street is typically this laissez-faire institution that hates government coming in and fixing things and spending a lot of money, that is, unless it's for them in the middle of a meltdown and they need their heinies saved?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: So, I'm wondering, is it a whole new world now, where Wall Street just waits for more stimulus? What do you think, Ted?</p><p>WEISBERG: No, Neil, I don't think so.</p><p>I think the one thing we have experience, thanks to the Fed, since the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, is that we have seen the Fed that's been in a very accommodative mode, and that really has created a back -- a positive backdrop for equities through most of the teens and now again because of the pandemic.</p><p>So, the Fed has basically been very Wall Street-friendly. I'm not sure I would agree with your other guest that we can count on the Fed coming in to bail us out all the time. I think they have already done that.</p><p>I think, really, what we're experiencing here, Neil, is a market that just got way ahead of itself. Stocks are not rational. Stock pricing is not rational. And stock markets are not rational. They tend to get overbought. And they tend to get oversold.</p><p>And I simply think that we have reached a point where we are way overbought. And so we're due for a correction. You can wrap around any rationale you want around it. And what we have learned today is that stocks -- and we know this always -- stocks always go down faster than they go up.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>WEISBERG: So, I think the smart thing to do is just kind of get out of the way and let the tanks roll over us, and wait for the dust to settle.</p><p>And I think, as your other guest has just pointed out, there's a ton of cash on the sidelines. And this will be an opportunity for those folks that haven't already to perhaps put a lot of money to work when things get just a little more reasonable in price.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Kathryn, Ted touched on the possibility of a correction, which is a 10 percent falloff from highs, which, for the Dow, would be another 2,800 points or so, if that were to be true.</p><p>But what do you tell investors, then, Kathryn, who've had these big gains in some stocks, at Apple, let's say if they're lucky enough to hold Amazon or Microsoft, some of the big technology giants?</p><p>You don't lose money until you sell. So I get that. It's all on paper for the time being if you don't move.</p><p>ROONEY VERA: Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: So what would you tell them to do?</p><p>ROONEY VERA: So what we have been telling them to do is to rotate away from tech, because tech since 2017, Neil, is five specific names, actually. And we all know what they are.</p><p>The five biggest tech names are the ones that have taken the markets higher. If you discount those five names, the markets are flat. So it is those names that have really taken markets to where they are. So we're recommending a rotation to industrials, which hasn't done as well, and to banks. Those are the ones that have really pulled up the rear, energy less so because it's such a highly volatile asset, specifically oil.</p><p>But I will defer with Teddy. I think this is the Fed moving the markets. I think the Fed is largely manipulating the markets. We have seen that both in treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, and now in investment-grade and now high-yield bonds.</p><p>So I think the dislocation between a 10 percent unemployment rate, 30 million people still claiming unemployment benefits, and a market at all- time record highs can only be, can only be attributed to both fiscal and monetary stimulus.</p><p>And let's not forget that 30 -- and this comes from the BLS, the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- 30 percent of people's personal income now comes from the federal government. So, consumption heretofore has been pushed by the government.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>ROONEY VERA: So this is a pernicious cycle, I think, that is fundamentally wrong. But the opportunity cost, Neil, of not being in the market is too large.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will see what happens.</p><p>Kathryn, I want to thank you. Ted, thank you. Both good reads of this market.</p><p>ROONEY VERA: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, everyone is focusing on what happens tomorrow, right? And the granddaddy of all economic reports comes out. That would be the employment report for the month of August.</p><p>And the betting seems to be will gain a million or so jobs. But what they're really focusing on -- and this is something they don't always do -- is that unemployment rate, which had climbed well near 16 percent for a while, gotten down to 10.2 percent in the latest month, talk that it could go under that tomorrow, be in single digits, certainly for the first time since this whole virus shutdown started.</p><p>I want to go to Charles Payne on that and the importance of that report.</p><p>So, Charles, let's say we get the read that I just said is that estimate for the employment report. What would the markets do with that? Or are they now focused more on looking at the downside of any number than the upside?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, HOST, \"MAKING MONEY\": You know, that's a great question.</p><p>And I'm not 100 percent sure, I will say, the bottom of today's session was 334. Then we saw -- we actually saw a flurry of buying, again, ahead of this number tomorrow. I think good news will be good news, because, to your earlier point, we're still going to be in a lot of trouble historically compared to where we have been.</p><p>So a number like two million would be phenomenal. The unemployment rate is not as an important if we don't see people come back into the labor force. We don't want one of these skewed unemployment rates, that moves down, but that's because people have left the labor force for good. That's really not good news.</p><p>So I'm still overall believing that Wall Street wants to see a better number, wants to see this momentum continue. But I think the issue, really, though -- and this market, I hope, sends a message to Congress today -- that there's work to be done, that this bridge that they provided has been -- was wonderful.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: It helped tremendously. But this sort of dithering and the political posturing, I'm really surprised we didn't have a bigger sell-off sooner, when everything expired and Congress went on recess.</p><p>We were working on sort of fumes. And Teddy and Kathryn made some wonderful points. And I will say, for these particular stocks that have led us, like Tesla, for instance, back in 2000, there was a company called World Online.</p><p>A lot of people don't know about this, because it was an IPO in Europe, a Dutch online company, one of the biggest in history. It was his. They raised the most amount of money ever at that time. There was a big party. Everyone's drinking champagne.</p><p>And a reporter says to the CEO, hey, what are you going to do now with your newfound wealth? And she looks at him and says, well, I already sold all my stock.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, man.</p><p>PAYNE: And everyone dropped their glasses. Huh?</p><p>So it turns out, in my mind, that was the top. That was the market top, that -- a week later, our markets crumbled. I'm not saying that's where we are. But I'm saying, a company like Tesla, where yesterday the company says they're going to sell $5 billion worth, then this morning we find out the second largest shareholder has dumped a lot of stock, that really put the brakes on the momentum stocks.</p><p>But I do believe Kathryn is right, in the sense that people are rotating. The banks, we will see what happens. Wall Street has believed the banks could carry us for a long time. The open trade, cruise ship, airline stocks look phenomenal.</p><p>Believe it or not, brick-and-mortar retailers have been really doing very well the last couple of weeks. So we want good news tomorrow. And I think that's what the last 26 minutes of trading told us today.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, great stuff.</p><p>You always stay calm through these things. Meanwhile, I'm freaking out and all. But you stay calm.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: This is why viewers love you, buddy. Let me have your e-mails.</p><p>PAYNE: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Charles Payne on all of that. He is our rock star on FOX Business. If you don't get it, you're missing it, and it's on you. I'm sorry, America. Don't do that.</p><p>All right, we have a lot more coming up, including, we were showing Dr. Fauci and how he might have contributed to this by comments he made about a vaccine that might not come out in October, after all. That's all a lot of investors had to hear to say, all right, well, that's it, get out of town.</p><p>Is that fair? Is that accurate? Is that even right?</p><p>After this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR: If there are a number of infections within a particular trial that allows you to make a decision sooner, rather than later, it is conceivable that you could have it by October, though I don't think that that's likely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: The idea that maybe October is a generous time frame for a vaccine, at least in the eyes of Dr. Fauci, rattled a lot of traders, who were hoping that we would see something like that by then, maybe even before then.</p><p>Keep in mind that Pfizer had indicated on the same day, actually within two hours, of whether -- when Fauci was making those remarks on CNN, saying that it will be in phase three trials of its own vaccine drug that looks promising by at least that time.</p><p>Nevertheless, Dr. Fauci and his comments did rattle a lot of folks.</p><p>It's a good time to sort of say, forget about investors and the reaction here. What is the likelihood of a vaccine this year?</p><p>Dr. Anita Gupta joins us, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, anesthesiologist, physician. You name it, she does it all. And she knows her stuff.</p><p>So I defer to your expertise, Doctor.</p><p>I mean, he is saying I think what's pretty obvious. We don't know for sure. We hope, but the idea of a vaccine in October that a lot of people think is sort of locked in place might not be. Is that true? Do you think that's real?</p><p>DR. ANITA GUPTA, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE: First of all, look, designing and distributing an COVID-19 vaccine is one of the most challenging public health initiatives in the United States and in the world, and I think that's really important to remember here, and that's ever -- ever undertaken.</p><p>And keep in mind, this isn't something that's going to be handled by Dr. Fauci alone. I think it's something that's being done on a global level. And it's being done by the health care industry as we speak. And we have to reach 300 million Americans, right?</p><p>And we may have to do it multiple times. So, everyone in the United States and beyond is at a global race. And so I think that we will get there, and we will get there very quickly. I think that we are at an unprecedented rate.</p><p>And I think that we will get there to the front lines to patients, but we have to do it very carefully. And it's not whether we get there now or whether we get four months to now. We need to begin preparation.</p><p>And I think that's what you're seeing right now, the preparation, the planning. It's never too early to begin action.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Doctor, it occurs the same time we heard from Temple University and SUNY Oneonta, the State University in New York school system of Oneonta, where they are killing kids now, no in-person classes through the fall, it's going to be all virtual.</p><p>Other schools are kicking around the same possibility amid spikes in cases, the University of South Carolina and elsewhere, so many others. I'm wondering what you make of where we stand right now with this thing.</p><p>GUPTA: Right.</p><p>Look, schools -- people need to be in school. And there's many, many reasons why, one, for social development there. There's an absolute need. And there's evidence that we need our children there. And there is absolute benefit there.</p><p>But this is a complex problem. It's not a one-size-fits-all. And the school closures are happening for many reasons, potential exposure, potential policies that are not being put in place early enough.</p><p>So, I think our economy, our families, our children, our young adults need it. They need it for their social and emotional development. But I think what we can do right now is create a framework, be sensitive and accountable for the safety and welfare for our businesses, our parents, so that there are no downstream negative consequences or those unintended consequences.</p><p>And being -- having said that, we're a very large country. And I think that there are some communities that can potentially open up, and some that won't be able to. So, I think we need to be considerate of that and plan accordingly.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well said.</p><p>Dr. Anita Gupta, thank you very much. Good catching up with you. And thanks for just giving us the big picture on all of this. I think we all need that.</p><p>All right, there are other worries besides just the virus and when a vaccine will come. How about all the violence across the country and how soon that will settle down? We told you about the former vice president is right now in Wisconsin, as was the president a couple of days earlier.</p><p>But there's another problem brewing. That is between the president of the United States and the governor of New York. Let's just say they are not, not seeing eye to eye.</p><p>And I think I'm putting it kindly -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, who said everyone was selling off today?</p><p>Look at that, Carnival Cruise Lines indicating right now that, at least when it comes to a subsidiary in Italy, it's going to set sail again.</p><p>Go figure -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, want to go to Peter Doocy right now.</p><p>He has been following the former Vice President Joe Biden and his trip to Wisconsin today. He has been busy, and he's meeting and talking to quite a few folks -- Peter Doocy, to you.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And today's event, Neil, was a hybrid.</p><p>Biden spent some of the time listening. He spent some of the time pitching his own policies. And he spent some of the time trying to help the local law enforcement and religious leaders and activists who are gathered here heal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I made a mistake about something. I thought you could defeat hate. Hate only hides.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: Biden says he spoke to Jacob Blake on the phone this afternoon. He spent one hour meeting with Jacob Blake's family inside an airplane hangar in Milwaukee, before motorcading this way.</p><p>There was a small march that arrived at the church a few minutes before Biden. And many curious locals have turned out, hoping to get a look at the Democratic nominee.</p><p>But everything has been mostly peaceful. And Biden is finding out that that was not the case about two weeks ago, where even businesses that were not burned down have been harmed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARB DEBERGE, OWNER, DEBERGE FRAMING AND GALLERY: They did break our windows, get into our store. They looted. And they tried to start a fire.</p><p>But a good samaritan came by and took this rack of our beautiful scarves out into the sidewalk, and put it out. Otherwise, our store would have been up in flames.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: The Democratic nominee and former vice president just left this church.</p><p>He and his motorcade are on their way to a local stop here in Kenosha, before heading on back home to Wilmington this evening -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Peter, thank you very much.</p><p>Want to go to Congressman Bryan Steil right now. His district includes Kenosha.</p><p>Congressman, thank you very much for taking the time.</p><p>Well, there, you have had the president visit, the man who wants to be president visit. What do you think?</p><p>REP. BRYAN STEIL (R-WI): You know, it was a real powerful couple days here in Kenosha.</p><p>So many people during these events, while criminal activity was rampant in the city of Kenosha, were reaching out. They were scared. They were nervous.</p><p>Having the president in just two days ago, really, to have that conversation with people who have been personally impacted, as well as to say thank you to the men and women of law enforcement who woke up every day and went out in the effort to reestablish public safety in our -- public safety in our city, was a great event.</p><p>It's a real rallying opportunity for the city to heal and now to begin the process of rebuilding the city of Kenosha.</p><p>CAVUTO: Congressman, I'm curious as to why the Democratic mayor of Kenosha, as well as the Democratic governor of Wisconsin, weren't keen on either having the president or Joe Biden, that now is not the time.</p><p>Did you agree with that?</p><p>STEIL: No.</p><p>I think it's -- it was a great opportunity in particular for the president to come to say thank you to the men and women of law enforcement, to start to heal the city, and then really to begin the process of rebuilding.</p><p>I think it's really impactful to walk the streets firsthand; 60th Street, where much of this happened, is, in better times, the Fourth of July parade route. My favorite memories are kids standing there waving flags and collecting candy.</p><p>It's impactful. And when you walk those streets and you see the damage that occurred in the center of the city of Kenosha, if anything, it reminds you of the importance of making sure we fund police and how dangerous of an idea it is to defund police.</p><p>CAVUTO: Congressman Bryan Steil, thank you, sir, very, very much. Be safe and be well.</p><p>Want to go to Bryan Llenas right now, because this idea kind of candidates going to key states, you're seeing a lot more of that, particularly the president, who has kept a very, very frenetic schedule in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, the state he surprisingly won four years ago and picked up its 20 electoral votes.</p><p>I guess he's trying to do a repeat -- Bryan Llenas, to you.</p><p>BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Neil, this is the second time the president has visited Pennsylvania in less than two weeks.</p><p>The last time, I spoke to you from Old Forge, Pennsylvania, obviously a very important battleground state, 20 electoral votes. He won this state in 2016 by less than 1 percentage point. He's going to be speaking here in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, at 7:00 p.m. tonight at this airport hangar.</p><p>And this is in Westmoreland County. He won this county with 64 percent of the vote. This is Trump country. But this is on the heels of what we're seeing, a bunch of new information from some of the polls.</p><p>A Monmouth poll released yesterday showed a race that is tightening among registered voters. It shows that Biden has just a four-point lead over Trump, 49-45. That is a shrinking lead compared to the same poll that was done at the end of July, which showed a 13-point lead.</p><p>We're also receiving new information from a Quinnipiac poll that was released just this afternoon. And in that poll, it shows that Biden has a lead over Trump by eight points among likely voters, not just registered voters, but likely voters.</p><p>And in that poll from Quinnipiac, it showed that voters believe that the economy is the most important issue. As a fact -- matter of fact, 29 percent of likely voters say it's the economy, followed by the coronavirus at 16 percent.</p><p>But here's what's interesting. On the issues on who they trust the most, Biden leads Trump on every one of the issues here in Pennsylvania, except for the economy. On the issue of the economy, they have President Trump leading Biden 52 percent to 45 percent here in Pennsylvania.</p><p>And that is the message that we have been hearing from the president here in Pennsylvania. He is really speaking to the blue-collar workers. We expect that message to continue. He's going to go after the former vice president, who is a Scranton native. He's going to probably repeat the same things we have heard, that he has abandoned the workers of Pennsylvania with supporting NAFTA and those other bad trade deals.</p><p>And we will see what else he has to say tonight. But one last thing, Neil, a really interesting point in this Quinnipiac poll, it shows that 94 percent of likely voters in Pennsylvania have already made up their mind.</p><p>Just 5 percent of voters are in the middle. So, this is an election that we have spoken to pollsters who say this is all going to be about turnout. Who can really bring out their base?</p><p>And, tonight, President Trump will be speaking in Trump country in Southwestern Pennsylvania to that base, a big crowd here in the airport hangar. It feels very much like the rallies we have seen in the past, before COVID-19, except now people are wearing masks -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, there is that distinction.</p><p>Bryan Llenas, thank you very, very much, my friend. Be safe. Be well.</p><p>That man is everywhere, isn't he?</p><p>All right, in the meantime here, the dust-up between the president of the United States and the governor of New York, it got a little dustier, or, should I say, nastier -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, they were kind of doing OK when it came to handling the virus, a little nastiness back and forth, but they were getting along, or so it seemed.</p><p>Then the whole violence and lawless cities things, and now you have the president of the United States and the governor of New York all but at each other's throats.</p><p>John Roberts with more on that and other developments from the White House at the White House.</p><p>Hey, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It's almost, Neil, like they were two guys from Queens who just couldn't help but get into a dust-up with each other.</p><p>Well, as you put it, it got a little bit dusty.</p><p>Let's give you the backdrop for this. Last night, the president signing a memorandum targeting cities like Portland, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and New York City, saying he just might withhold federal funds if they can't get a handle on law and order and lawlessness.</p><p>That prompted New York's attorney general, Letitia James, to say, you touch one penny of our budget from the federal government, we're going to take you to court.</p><p>And then Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, ripping the president here. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): He can't come back to New York. He can't. He's going to walk down the street in New York? Forget bodyguards. He better have an army if he thinks he's going to walk down the street in New York.</p><p>He is persona non grata in New York City. And I think he knows that, and he will never come back to New York, because New Yorkers will never forget how gratuitously mean he has been.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Well, the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, picking up on that, saying, well, the New York governor just basically admitted he can't bring law and order to the streets of New York City. Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's not often you hear a governor describe in vivid detail how he's lost control of his state.</p><p>But there you have Governor Cuomo saying, you can't come to New York without an army. Well, I guess that is the case when you have more than 1,000 shootings before Labor Day, when there's a 277 percent increase in shootings in a one-month period over the year prior on.</p><p>It's very rare you hear a Democrat governor nakedly admit to failure. And that's what Governor Cuomo has just done for us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: You're saying, Neil, you're saying, does he have the authority to do this?</p><p>Well, in 1987, the Supreme Court ruled that the Reagan administration Treasury Department could withhold 5 percent of highway funds from South Dakota because South Dakota would not raise its drinking age to 21.</p><p>So, the president can do it. However, that withholding was authorized by Congress. They hold the purse strings, and there is no way, no how Congress is going to authorize him to do this.</p><p>So, while he can, he won't be able to -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Just two New Yorkers at each other's throats.</p><p>All right, thank you, my friend, John Roberts.</p><p>ROBERTS: Two guys, two boys from Queens.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: There we go. What are you going to do about it?</p><p>All right, thank you, John Roberts.</p><p>George Pataki right now, the three-term former Republican governor of the beautiful state of New York.</p><p>It's still a beautiful state, Governor, but, man, oh, man, I mean, between the uptick in crime and a lot of people don't want to go back their, concerns about the virus, and whether New York will ever do things the way it used to do things, it just seems like a mess.</p><p>Your thoughts?</p><p>FMR. GOV. GEORGE PATAKI (R-NY): It is a mess.</p><p>And it's really sad to see, particularly -- I spent 12 years trying to get New York on the right track. And when I left, it was. And, right now, it's clearly on the wrong track.</p><p>Your point about two New Yorkers involved in a feud, Trump and Cuomo, Trump's a Floridian now. And maybe that was political, but there are many, many New Yorkers who are now Floridians.</p><p>It's just too expensive. The taxes are too high. The social climate has deteriorated enormously. And New York will come back. It's just a question of, will it come back quickly, or will it be a matter of many, many years?</p><p>CAVUTO: But, you know, while Governor Cuomo gets a bad rap, he's nowhere near as controversial or polarizing a figure as the New York City mayor, who's been pushing this notion that maybe we hold off on indoor dining in the Big Apple until next year.</p><p>Cuomo himself has hinted, you know, that's going to lead a lot of folks in New York to just hop across the river, either by train or swim, I guess, to get indoor dining in New Jersey, which will resume on Friday.</p><p>So he gets the bigger issues. He remains a very popular figure, less so the mayor of New York. How do you think they work all this stuff out? Because forget about the arguments with the president. It's those two who aren't on the same page.</p><p>PATAKI: That's right.</p><p>They don't even talk. And the mayor is a catastrophe. And I think you have bipartisan agreement. Even in this era where Republicans and Democrats don't agree on anything, I think, in New York, they agree that de Blasio has been a catastrophe.</p><p>But I don't think you can just say, if you're the governor, sit back and say, well, we have an awful mayor, the city is going down the tubes, isn't it sad?</p><p>If I were mayor -- governor today, I would use my emergency powers to take over the entire question of the homeless. Right now, one of the reasons for that spike in crime, one of the reasons for the decline in quality of life are mentally ill homeless wandering the streets, threatening people, and too often engaging in violence.</p><p>It is an emergency. I would use the governor's emergency power to remove that from the mayor, who obviously can't deal with that issue appropriately, and put in place the appropriate steps.</p><p>So, we have an awful mayor in New York City. But that's not an excuse. When you're a leader, you want to solve the problems, and you look at whatever levels -- levers of power you have to solve problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, the governor is not a fan of taxing the rich to sort of balance all of this out, as is the mayor.</p><p>Both the state and the city, like so many across the country, have been bleeding money as a result.</p><p>I'm just wondering, what would you do to shore up those finances? If you want to rule out tax hikes on the rich, what would you do?</p><p>PATAKI: You know, you have to improve the economic climate.</p><p>Neil, I went through this. When I took office, we had over a $5 billion deficit. It doesn't seem that big now, but it was back then in relation to the state budget. We had the highest tax burden in America and we were last in private sector jobs.</p><p>So, what I did is what I know works. And that is, you have to grow the private sector. You have to create an incentive for wealthy people, not just not to leave, but to come back. You have to create a program of economic incentives, deregulation, lower tax burden, where companies want to invest and expand and hire people and grow the economy.</p><p>That's what we did. It worked. It would work again. Right now, the taxes are way too high. The regulatory climate is awful. The social climate, the crime and other things, are just deteriorating day by day.</p><p>And so, if you're a wealthy person who can move, or an investor looking to build a factory or an office, you don't look in New York. That's got to change. It can change, but it requires strong leadership.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Governor Pataki, thank you very, very much, George Pataki, the former governor of New York.</p><p>We have reached out repeatedly to Governor Cuomo to get him on. Hope springs eternal we will. We had him on not too, too, too long ago, before the whole virus thing. But we shall see.</p><p>All right, in the meantime, we told you a little bit about New York City still not allowing indoor dining. Could keep that posture going right through the end of the year.</p><p>A New York restaurant owner who's at wit's end, and now suing -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, food for thought, how can you make money if you can't sell your food?</p><p>A lot of New York City area restaurants are asking that question right now, as the mayor aims at keeping indoor dining restrictions in effect right through the end of the year.</p><p>Tina Oppedisano joins us right now. Family owns Il Bacco Restaurant.</p><p>I hope I have got that correctly, Tina. And it is quite the attraction, quite the draw, but you and a lot of you and your fellow restaurateurs have effectively said, enough. You're suing for the right to reopen, right?</p><p>Where does that stand?</p><p>TINA OPPEDISANO, IL BACCO RESTAURANT: Hi, Neil. Thank you for having me.</p><p>We are suing right now. I think everybody is just sick and tired. Everybody's fed up. It's been far too long. Right now, we're suing the mayor and the governor for $2 billion. That's just an estimated number on the loss of the past six months.</p><p>At this point, we're just putting ourselves out there. The five boroughs are speaking out. They're speaking up. And we're just hoping -- we're hoping for a change. We're hoping something happens. We're hoping we catch his attention. And we're hoping that he eventually says, hey, you know what, you guys can eat indoors, just like the rest of the country can, with the exception of Jersey, now 25 percent, and I know California and some places, too.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, because you just talked about it, that New Jersey on Friday, they're going to allow indoor dining. I mean, this is something that you wanted as well.</p><p>Your numbers actually in the New York metropolitan area, the infection rate and all the other data they use, are lower than what's happening in the Garden State. It's really got to get under your skin.</p><p>OPPEDISANO: Yes, I believe New York, I think, originally they said, let's flatten the curve.</p><p>At this point, I believe it's been about 27 days where we haven't had any increases. And we just hear lots of comments. We hear comments. I have said this before. The mayor has made comments.</p><p>And now he's actually coming out and saying, in the month of September, we're going to give you an answer. It may be good, it may be bad, but you guys deserve an answer.</p><p>And now that just leaves -- it still leaves me confused. It still doesn't leave me very happy, because I don't understand why everybody else has just been given a direct answer, direct dates, a direct future, and we, unfortunately, haven't. We have definitely been doing the best we can.</p><p>I'm here trying to support my neighborhood people, my family, my friends. I mean, we hosted a rally today at Il Bacco. It actually went very, very well. We had about -- I would say about 150 to 200 people there. And everyone came out in support.</p><p>And, actually, at the rally, I heard people talking other perspectives on Northern Boulevard, the restaurant across the street, the restaurant down the block.</p><p>And to hear other people's experiences of the past six months, it really brings it close to home for you. It just opens up your eyes to how much this is just affecting everybody. It's a ripple-down effect.</p><p>And it's just -- it affects the people who wait, people who busboy, the people coming in, customers.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, do you have outdoor dining, Tina? Do you least have that outlet, outdoor dining? I'm sure you do delivery. Anything to just at least keep some of the business going?</p><p>OPPEDISANO: We do.</p><p>So, Il Bacco, ourselves, we are in a very fortunate position where we do have a rooftop with a retractable awning. So, thank God, during the summer, we have been OK.</p><p>Majority of these restaurants, though, they're outside, they're on the street, couple of tables, a tent, an umbrella, that's it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>OPPEDISANO: So that's why I say, like, we're OK. It's really more for looking towards the future.</p><p>Come the fall, come the winter, especially, December, January, February, March, there's no way these restaurants will survive. Without restaurants, the economy goes down tremendously, immensely.</p><p>And to see New York City, to see Queens, to see Brooklyn, to see these places this way that were once thriving is -- it's very, very disheartening.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, the mayor made a comment. I'm probably getting it not word for word, Tina.</p><p>So, the gist of it was that the restaurants, well, if some wealthy people can't go out and eat, that that's essentially their problem, that -- as if everyone who goes out to eat at your restaurant or any other is just some part of the Grey Poupon crowd.</p><p>I mean, did you take offense to that?</p><p>OPPEDISANO: Yes, that's -- that is a great point.</p><p>I mean, he said that restaurants -- indoor dining is for the middle to upper class. To hear such a thing, it's absolutely unbelievable to think that the mayor of our city would say such a thing, being that, what about the people that these restaurants employ? What about my staff?</p><p>We don't care about them? What about him? He doesn't go out to eat? He doesn't go inside indoor restaurants? So is he -- I mean, it's just -- it's preposterous to me, to be honest.</p><p>I hear lots of people say multiple things. I have heard Cuomo say, oh, they could go over the bridge, and eat in Jersey. Now I hear people saying that we should go out in Long Island.</p><p>It's almost like people are advocates for people leaving the city of New York. And that's truly how I feel. I'm not here to point fingers and say -- I'm not here to point fingers and get upset at anyone.</p><p>But just yesterday, the county executive of Nassau County, Laura Curran, made a speech, wine and dine in Nassau County, where we will -- we will keep you away from the cold. She made a comment like that.</p><p>And I know you want your county to thrive, but being that you're surrounded by Brooklyn and Queens, and you know that we're struggling and we're suffering, to say something like that is also unacceptable to me.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I think you're going to get through this.</p><p>I mean, your restaurant has a great reputation, great food. But you're right. I mean, this is something that, if they're allowing it in Jersey with numbers much, much higher certainly than the New York metropolitan area, it should at least consider it.</p><p>Tina, hang in there. I think -- I think there's light at the end of this tunnel. I just hope it's not an approaching train.</p><p>OPPEDISANO: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Tina Oppedisano at Il Bacco, destination for good Italian food.</p><p>OPPEDISANO: Thank you so much, yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, thank you. Best of luck to you and your staff.</p><p>I do want to bounce this off Mark Penn. I know you're thinking, all right, restaurants, Mark Penn and the economy issue, but for a reason.</p><p>Because these are issues that matter sometimes to a lot of people, Mark, a lot more than some of the bigger issues like the economy or the markets on a crazy day.</p><p>I'm just wondering how this falls out in areas that cannot get back to normal, and it's delay upon delay and delay. What do you think?</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST: Well, it's interesting.</p><p>I was just looking at our latest polls on this. And the public is very cautious. I mean, the public is willing to shut things down and keep them shut, and -- but mostly because they think that the virus is increasing. They think there's no vaccine for, well, half the people, six months or more, three-quarters, at least three months.</p><p>So, people don't see an end right now. They're very pessimistic about the virus. And so I think -- I think that also leads to a lot of situations here that -- where the public is, like I said, surprisingly cautious.</p><p>CAVUTO: How does it play out politically, though, Mark?</p><p>I always wonder, because, today notwithstanding, a crazy day in the markets, I get that -- they come and go. They're jarring, but they do remind you the risks of just investing in the markets. But the bigger picture here, the economy has been improving. The numbers have been looking better, today notwithstanding, the markets as well.</p><p>But it's these lifestyle issues. It's these life concern issues, whether it's violence and crime, not being able to go to your favorite restaurant, not being able to return to work. These seem to be much more substantive than then they're given credit.</p><p>PENN: Yes, I think -- I think most people say, hey, it's the issues I care about.</p><p>I think I have identified three V's and an E, right? The virus, where I think Trump was doing well, and then he fell back, and he's got a deficit now that he's got to come back from, the violence, where you can see Trump has been making this an issue. It is one of the most important issues; 90 percent think it will be a big issue.</p><p>The vaccine, which -- because no one expects it, if it comes out -- and I can't tell, between the CDC saying it will come out and Fauci saying it won't come out, and everybody -- if it is, it is. And that will shake things up.</p><p>And the economy, where, despite the economic problems, Trump has a very strong advantage in that area, relative to anything else or anybody else.</p><p>CAVUTO: Real quick, in the battleground states, where the polls are tightening, as you often remind me, it is all about the electoral vote.</p><p>How do things look?</p><p>PENN: It's interesting.</p><p>I think you're going to have to wait another week or to see how they're gelling. Some -- we just came back with a poll nationally that was six points. So I thought some of the FOX battleground polls were maybe a little higher, because we're showing that likely voters are tightening, tightening to a greater extent.</p><p>I think we have a real election now. I think -- I think, a month ago, this thing was wide-open for Biden. And now it's going to be a real election that's going to be close. And the debates are going to be big.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, my friend, thank you very, very much.</p><p>From restaurants, to stocks, the economy, you covered it all, Mark. Good job, Mark Penn, the former Clinton pollster, much, much more.</p><p>All right, end with a focus on tomorrow, whether we repeat this, a big employment report, which could go a long way to either easing fears or just adding to them. But, remember, markets do go up and down.</p><p>Here's \"The Five.\"</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Photo by Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Few social media platforms have propelled President Trump's political career like Twitter has. Conceivably, that's precisely the reason why its decision on 26 May to flag two of his posts as containing misleading statements related to the upcoming election, drew his ire. Just two days later, an executive order was signed, demanding immediate action from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to re-examine platform liability, allegations of political bias and federal ad spend on online platforms.</p><p>The stand-off between Donald Trump and Twitter accentuates two key issues in the global debate about the impact of Big Tech on human rights and democracy: freedom of expression and platform liability. In the US, while digital platforms have been protected from liability by Section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act (CDA), both the US Justice Department and the House Energy and Commerce Committee have started raising the issue of the provision's reform.</p><p>But Trump's executive order is fraught with misrepresentations about what the law originally set out to do as well as the nature of the companies he seeks to discipline. To a certain extent, this may be symptomatic of a common misunderstanding that legal scholars Danielle Citron and Mary Anne Franks have pointed out the conflation of Section 230 with the First Amendment. The double whammy is that while the latter vests obligations in the government, not private actors, the former not only does not require 'interactive computer services' to be the conduits of all users' opinions, it actually urges them to moderate that content. The First Amendment actually protects these private actors too, as a lawsuit by the Center for Democracy and Technology challenging the executive order has outlined.</p><p>One could argue that under Section 230, Twitter's decision to flag a misleading post about the elections or later to obscure a post glorifying violence was appropriate and in 'good faith', as surely those posts would be deemed 'objectionable' or 'excessively violent'. Facebook's decision not to fact-check or flag the same posts, is probably finding favour with the US president. Given the fact that Trump's executive order indicates that he has identified ad spend as useful leverage, Facebook may profit from this decision in other ways too.</p><p>A tale of misunderstandings</p><p>The executive order surfaces some common misunderstandings that compromise its stated goal and raise questions about its real purpose. For instance, despite the order's accusations of 'political bias', these private actors are under no obligation to be 'neutral'. Even if that were the case, an interim report on Facebook's potential bias led by Republican Senator Jon Kyl indicates critics may need to look harder. The view that tech platforms are online simulations of a 'public square' may be a bit off the mark as well, as it doesn't factor in the network effects and information feedback loops involved in the social media ecosystem.</p><p>Moving forward, recurring tendencies to compare apples and oranges by claiming that social media regulation can follow a similar approach to that of earlier technologies, such as a telecommunications, or the conflation of social media with the internet as a whole, should be avoided. It's possible that tech policymaking requires new terminology and conceptualizations that can be easily popularized.</p><p>Freedom of expression: one right to rule them all?</p><p>Trump's decision to posit protection of freedom of expression as the executive order's key motivation could force US-based tech companies to face challenging dilemmas in terms of the norms they propagate online. But that may be precisely the point. Twitter seems to be choosing to act on pressure to protect electoral integrity and public safety, while Facebook has doubled down on its defence of unrestrained freedom of expression, even when that polarizes society. A series of recent walkouts and resignations of Facebook staff may force the company to reconsider.</p><p>As set out in my 2019 paper on disinformation, the US approach to freedom of expression is not aligned with most other countries in which social media companies are operating. While other signatories to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) may impose restrictions on this fundamental right for reasons such as protecting national security, public order, public health, or the rights and reputations of others, the US has ratified the treaty with reservations committing to adhering to the requirements and constraints of its own Constitution. But even in the US context, policymakers and legislators need to consider that treating freedom of expression as an absolute right and allowing incitement to violence or abusive statements online, in effect silences the victims and refuses them the exercise of their own fundamental rights.</p><p>Academic Aernout Nieuwenhuis attributed the US approach to freedom of expression to \"a certain optimism about the operation of the 'free marketplace of ideas' that tends to be alien to Europeans\". After destructive wars and the re-emergence of far-right movements, Europe is probably not inclined to put its faith in the invisible hand of that particular marketplace. Indeed, it tends to prioritize the protection of groups over the complete freedom of political debate.</p><p>While in the US, the First Amendment sets freedom of expression as the foremost priority, Article 17 of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits the use of a right to conduct activity to destroy the rights set forth in the Convention, attempting to avert a situation whereby its provisions are used to weaken the ideals and values of a democratic society. The debate over freedom of expression in the digital space is ongoing. Still, inconvenient as it is, exporting the current US administration's interpretation of freedom of expression to the global market in which tech companies operate may become untenable for legal, cultural and political reasons.</p><p>Pending questions about Section 230 reform</p><p>Even though reform of Section 230 is overdue, basing it on misinterpretations of the role and obligations of tech companies, and what the international community already frustrated by US tech companies' effect on online political discourse is willing to accept, can pose existential risks for these companies. At the very least, any reform should consider the increased responsibility that political leaders and governments have by virtue of their credibility and reach when they are using these platforms.</p><p>In the end, the executive order will face so many obstacles such as the fact the president can't really force a federal agency like the FCC to act, or that the US has already locked itself into a safe harbour system through the United States Mexico Canada Agreement that one may wonder if its aim was not really the reform of Section 230. Daphne Keller, director of the Program on Platform Regulation at Stanford's Cyber Policy Center, has talked about what she calls the 'anticipatory obedience' by the big platforms, nudged by governments to proactively act in a certain way to avoid statutory regulation. In the end, maybe the executive order was more of a warning to Silicon Valley not to follow in Twitter's footsteps.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123748082</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603N-BCP1-DYTH-G0K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1287\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 9, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
