The ETF is expected to begin trading in March once regulatory approval is granted.</p><p>The PowerShares listing is a milestone for the new exchange as it nears the first anniversary of its launch, and represents something of a statement on the part of Invesco Canada, says its president, Peter Intraligi.</p><p>\"Philosophically, the idea of increasing competition in Canada makes a great deal of sense to us. We are always looking for ways to be more efficient with our Power-Shares ETF listings and are strong proponents of the notion that increased competition drives efficiency and innovation (Invesco is one of the shareholders of Aequitas Innovations Inc., the parent company of the NEO Exchange.)</p><p>As a shareholder the company has been able to closely monitor the growth of NEO since its launch, and with the development of the Powershares Global Momentum Index ETF, determined that the time was right to list on the exchange.</p><p>It was not a decision Invesco took lightly despite its ownership stake in in the parent company, Intraligi says. \"Clearly, the No. 1 and most important priority is the investors who invest in your products. You want to make sure that there aren't going to be any issues or flaws, and operationally we are very satisfied with where NEO is. We are very comfortable now with the position of the exchange.\"</p><p>Having made the first move, the Invesco president expects others to follow. \"Every issuer would subscribe to the idea that more competition is better. I think the challenge was getting to the level of comfort you need to be the first to support something new. It is the old story of, 'I don't want to be first, just in case.' For us, we feel very comfortable and we hope that when our listing goes live it sends a clear signal that NEO is ready to bring a new level of competitiveness to the market, competition which benefits everyone.\"</p><p>Intraligi says that his company has already received \"very positive\" comments from broker-dealer market makers. \"They would like to see more competition. When you look at the U.S. market, that (competition) does exist and you get greater efficiencies and economies.\" In Canada currently, all ETFs are traded on just one exchange. \"So I think this makes sense and we hope that this does start to broaden the market.\"</p><p>Brent Holliday, chief executive and founder of Vancouver-based Garibaldi Capital Advisors, is hopeful that the new exchange will prove to be a more cost-effective and efficient way for Canadian firms to go public.</p><p>\"If NEO does something in the senior listings space along the lines of what AIM (the London Stock Exchange market for smaller companies) did, and offers the liquidity and benefits like better pricing to companies, it might be a great alternative for growing tech companies.\"</p><p>Currently such companies have few options, he adds. \"The complaint against the TSX is that it is really a resource and financial service market and so if you see big tech companies in the U.S. and other markets, they don't think of the TSX as a place to go list their companies.</p><p>Similarly, large Canadian tech companies that are thinking about going public, if they have U.S. equity investors, they look to the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange and then think of only the TSX as a colist.\"</p><p>Tim Johnston, chief listings officer of the NEO Exchange, is bullish on NEO's opportunities in the listing space. The exchange launched its listings business in the middle of 2015, so \"to get your first listing just six or seven months after your launch is quite remarkable given everything involved in the process.\" says Johnston. \"The first listing is an important catalyst because it gets over that kind of resistance to being the first, and in the Canadian market, from a senior issuer's perspective, there really hasn't been an alternative to the TSX in our market before.\"</p><p>Michael Becker, executive vice-president international business strategy, with New York-based Business Wire and a NEO trusted service provider, understands the David-and-Goliath challenge the upstart exchange is facing.</p><p>\"You are fighting tremendous incumbent inertia, a lack of innovation and battling the status quo,\" he says, noting the landscape is ripe for a lower-cost and more innovative alternative.</p><p>\"If you are a Canadian company looking to list on a senior exchange in the Canadian market you didn't have a choice. But now you do.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Trump's elevation of ultra-hawkish ex-generals to key cabinet posts also suggests that he will aggressively expand the sprawling surveillance state inherited from Obama.

Thiel now sits on the transition team, and has begun drawing a select circle of tech industry allies into Trump's orbit. He and his friends are likely to make lots of money. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Related:  Neoliberalism - the ideology at the root of all our problems</p><p>And that's only the low-hanging fruit. Depending on Trump's appetite for domestic repression, Silicon Valley may benefit from even bigger market opportunities. Building a registry of all Muslims in the United States, for instance, would require a fair bit of technical expertise and infrastructure. When The Intercept asked nine big tech companies whether they would help create such a registry, only Twitter said no. The righteous indignation has receded, it seems.</p><p>But there's another, deeper reason that tech and Trump will prove highly compatible. It's not merely that tech CEOs will thrive under Trump. It's that Trump embodies a particularly extreme version of the worldview that Silicon Valley  epitomizes.</p><p>This worldview can be summarized in a single word: neoliberalism. Neoliberalism can mean many things, including an economic program, a political project, and a phase of capitalism dating from the 1970s. At its root, however, neoliberalism is the idea that everything should be run as a business - that market metaphors, metrics, and practices should permeate all fields of human life. </p><p>No industry has played a larger role in evangelizing the neoliberal faith than Silicon Valley. Its entrepreneurs are constantly coming up with new ways to make more of our lives into markets. A couple of decades ago, staying in touch with friends wasn't a source of economic value - now it's the basis for a $350bn company. Our photo albums, dating preferences, porn habits, and most random and banal thoughts have all become profitable data sets, mined for advertising revenue. We are encouraged to see ourselves as pieces of human capital that must ceaselessly enhance our value - optimizing our feeds and profiles, hustling for follows and likes and swipes.</p><p>No industry has played a larger role in evangelizing the neoliberal faith than Silicon Valley</p><p>If Silicon Valley is turning our personal lives into a business, then Trump hopes to turn our government into one. Like all of Trump's ideas, this isn't especially original. For decades, neoliberal politicians of both parties have promoted the notion that government should not only serve business, but operate like one. They've argued that public services should be privatized, or at least model the \"efficiency\" of the private sector. They've claimed that business is the highest form of human endeavor, and that the role of the state is to empower and emulate it.</p><p>Indeed, these neoliberal ideas have become so dominant over the past four decades that they are shared by nearly all mainstream politicians. But no one has ever pushed them further than Trump. The basic recipe of Trumpism involves taking a coded or qualified political sentiment and making it as loud and unambiguous as possible. What other politicians express with a wink and a whisper, Trump yells at the top of his lungs. He turns subtext into text, makes explicit what was previously implied. </p><p>Racism, misogyny, and Islamophobic fearmongering were all fixtures of American political life before Trump came along, but he articulated them with a bluntness seldom seen in conventional politics. Similarly, the neoliberal assumption that government should resemble business is widely held across the political spectrum. Yet Trump has taken it to an extreme, applying the logic of neoliberalism so literally as to be almost parody.</p><p>Trump built his campaign around the premise that his chief qualification for the presidency was his success as a businessman. He promised to make America great again by bringing business discipline and dynamism to government. It's true that he often denounced the depredations of corporate America, lobbing populist salvos at free trade, outsourcing, and Wall Street for hurting working people. But his principal solution to these sins of business was always more business: he would cut deals with CEOs and foreign leaders, drawing on his talents as a negotiator to get American workers better terms. </p><p>The irony is that Trump will only intensify the crisis that put him in power</p><p>Since his victory, Trump has begun turning his campaign rhetoric into reality. He is making government look more like a business than ever before. He has created the wealthiest cabinet in history. He has selected a fast food executive for secretary of labor, a billionaire Goldman Sachs alum for secretary of treasury, and the CEO of ExxonMobil for secretary of state. He is also preparing to personally profit from the presidency, refusing to cut ties with his corporate empire. Trump will run government not merely like a business, but as  a business.</p><p>Liberals are quick to condemn these moves as further evidence that Trump is far outside the mainstream. They portray him as fundamentally foreign, a \"banana republic\" strongman whose rise to power was the result of a Russian plot. But the truth is that Trump is deeply, maximally American. He didn't import his politics from abroad, but simply followed the governing logic of American society through to its radical conclusion. The reason that 62 million Americans were prepared to entrust the presidency to a billionaire best known for playing a businessman on television is because they've been absorbing the tenets of market absolutism their whole lives. Trump may have campaigned as an outsider, but his appeal was radically mainstream.</p><p> Related:  2016: the year Facebook became the bad guy</p><p>Yet if Trump personifies neoliberal ideas, his victory also reflects a revolt against neoliberal policies. The uncaged capitalism fostered by neoliberalism has produced an era of spiraling inequality, stagnant wages, declining life expectancy, and an increasingly post-democratic political system that is more or less openly oligarchic. These things make people angry, and Trump used that anger to get himself elected. </p><p>The irony is that Trump will only intensify the crisis that put him in power. His cure for the social catastrophe of neoliberalism is a stronger strain of neoliberalism. Trump is like a lunatic doctor who, after a treatment has nearly killed his patient, decides to double the dose in the hopes of a better result. </p><p>Whether we survive depends on the political struggle ahead: not only in the streets and statehouses, but at the level of ideas. Defeating neoliberalism will require not just the creation of a movement, but the creation of a new common sense. At its heart must be the belief that democracy is a better way to organize society than markets - that some things are not for sale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-47063248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MCR-H711-F021-64XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1305\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Current manages one of only a few commercial deployments of BPL service in the nation, near Cincinnati.</p><p>The problem is, the new momentum might be too little, too late. BPL may never become more than a niche technology limited to rural areas that can't get Internet service over TV cables or DSL telephone lines.</p><p>The idea of plugging into the World Wide Web by simply plugging into a wall socket has been around nearly as long as those two dominant broadband technologies.</p><p>With BPL, data travel over power lines from an Internet connection at a power plant to homes and offices. A customer simply plugs a computer into a wall socket or connects to a wireless transmitter mounted on a nearby power pole.</p><p>Just as significantly, BPL can give power companies unprecedented control over their lines. With it, utilities can monitor lines for problems, read meters remotely and turn service on or off without dispatching employees.</p><p>\"Yes, you can provide consumers an alternative to cable and DSL, but more importantly this is a major tool that can transform utilities and bring them into the 21st century,\" said Raymond Blair, vice president of BPL initiatives for IBM.</p><p>Atlanta-based utility giant Southern Co. has been considering BPL for nearly seven years. So far, the most intriguing application of the technology is for monitoring power lines and other equipment, said Leif Ericson, business development manager at Southern's telecom subsidiary.</p><p>\"We don't see ourselves as a broadband service provider or some sort of other ISP,\" Ericson said. \"Our real focus \u2026 has been on whether we might be able to overlay [BPL] to gain access to all sorts of intelligence\" about existing lines and equipment.</p><p>In all, about 40 utilities around the country have run or plan to run BPL trials.</p><p>Yet with the exception of Current partner Cinergy Corp. in Ohio, no investor-owned utility has committed to selling the service yet.</p><p>Even at Cinergy, some are less than enthusiastic about the year-old experiment.</p><p>\"We didn't anticipate this was going to happen overnight,\" said Cinergy spokeswoman Kathy Meinke. \"We're continuing to move forward.\"</p><p>Neither Cinergy nor Current would disclose how many customers have signed up for the service.</p><p>Partly what has kept more utilities from rolling out BPL is the cost. While the power lines that can carry broadband signals are already in place, it can cost $250 or more per household for equipment that gets the signals from a home to the power pole or underground line.</p><p>That's actually relatively cheap compared to cable and DSL equipment. But utilities are notoriously tight when it comes to spending on new technology. And the last time many of them strayed from their core business and tried to offer telephone voice service, they failed miserably.</p><p>Meanwhile, early BPL technology was slow and plagued with problems. Download speeds were only a little better than dial-up service, and radio operators complained the equipment caused interference.</p><p>Newer semiconductor technology has solved interference problems, industry officials claim. At the same time, BPL now offers both downloads and uploads at 3 megabits per second --- double the speed of DSL and faster than cable at a comparable price.</p><p>But performance may have become a moot point because of utilities' lateness to the broadband business.</p><p>Today, with cable modem and DSL available to an estimated 90 percent of all households, there really isn't much of a market left for utilities offering BPL, said Jim Penhune, an analyst with technology research company Strategy Analytics.</p><p>\"I just think the timing of it is wrong,\" Penhune said. \"Cable [and telephone] companies are so far ahead \u2026 it's a little hard for me to see how a third class of network is going to be viable.\"</p><p>BPL proponents disagree, of course.</p><p>The recent interest from the big tech companies shows that the technology still has plenty of promise, said Brett Kilbourne, director of regulatory services for the United Power Line Council, a trade group.</p><p>At the same time, Kilbourne and other proponents say, there are still plenty of households --- 13 million by some counts --- that aren't able to get broadband access because cable and telecom companies don't offer it in their areas.</p><p>Also driving interest in BPL are recent court decisions that limit Internet companies' access to cable and phone lines.</p><p>Atlanta-based EarthLink Inc., for instance, has run several trials in North Carolina and elsewhere and is very encouraged, said company Vice President Kevin Brand.</p><p>BPL's best shot at success may be in reaching rural households, said Jupiter Research analyst Joe Laszlo.</p><p>As a result, Laszlo predicts alternative broadband technologies including BPL, fixed wireless and satellite will triple their customers over the next five years, although they will still account for less than 3 percent of the broadband business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>GENE J.

The trade conflicts, expectations of lower growth and simple maths explain why they've fallen far more heavily than the wider US market.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The epicentre of the sharemarket meltdown in the US is the collection of big technology stocks generally referred to as the FAANGs. The explanation for their particular implosion is an exaggerated version of the influences on the wider market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/top-tech-investors-say-hold-your-nerve-as-faangs-bitten-20181026-p50c4y.html\">FAANGs - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google</url> - are the heavyweights of the big end of the tech sector in the US that had soared 27 per cent between the start of this year and mid-year. Since then they have fallen 24 per cent, with an 18 per cent decline since the start of October.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The broader market, as measured by the S&amp;P 500, had risen by about 9 per cent from January through to late September but is now down 2.3 per cent for the year after a 10 per cent decline since late September.</p><p>While there might be some specific reasons for the falls in individual stocks, as a group the FAANGs are particularly exposed to the key themes that have impacted the market-at-large.</p><p>The big tech stocks have international markets for their services. Some, like Apple and Amazon, have global supply chains anchored in China. They are exposed to global growth and global trade.</p><p>They also tend to use complex corporate structures for their offshore operations, driven by tax minimisation strategies, which are now generating a response in many of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Facebook and Google are also coming under pressure from new European data privacy rules.</p><p>The Trump administration's trade policies and the aggressive stance it has taken with China in particular have implications for the FAANGs' access to markets, their supply chains and their relationships with the regulators in the markets in dispute with the US.</p><p>They aren't alone - many US companies operating internationally or sourcing products or components offshore are concerned about the impact on their sales offshore and their costs at home - but, as a group, they are particularly leveraged to global growth.</p><p>While the trade conflicts are having some specific effects on individual companies, unless resolved soon they are also expected to have a negative effect on individual economies, including the US, and global growth.</p><p>The US economy and growth in corporate profits was expected to slow significantly next year anyway as the effect of the Trump tax cuts waned. The trade disputes have provided a depressing overlay to that expectation.</p><p>The FAANGs trade at very high multiples of their earnings - as a group they trade on more than twice the average price-earnings multiple of the overall market.</p><p>That's partly because they have had higher growth rates but also because they invest so much in future earnings. An Amazon or a Netflix could be far more profitable (and its price-earnings multiple lower) if they slowed their growth rate.</p><p>Big price-earnings multiples - pricing for perfection - do mean, however, that even a slight setback either inside the company or in the external environment will have an exaggerated impact on the share price.</p><p>The other vulnerability created by those big multiples of earnings is an indirect exposure to interest rates.</p><p>The US Federal Reserve Board has been raising US rates for nearly three years and has foreshadowed another rise next month and three more next year, although it is possible that the slowing economy and Donald Trump's hectoring might cause it to pause that process.</p><p>It is also shrinking, at a rate of $US50 billion a month, a balance sheet bloated by its post-crisis quantitative easing.</p><p>Share prices essentially reflect the market's assessment of the net present value of future cash flows. Critical to that calculation is the rate used to discount the future cash flows, which is built on the risk-free rate provided by government bonds.</p><p>The rates on US Treasury bonds have been rising in response to the Fed's tightening of monetary policy. A year ago US 10-year bonds were yielding 2.33 per cent. Last week they were yielding 3.04 per cent, having reached 3.24 per cent earlier this month.</p><p>As rates continue to rise and the expectation of future increases is built into investors' assessments of companies' values, the discount rate also increases and so the present value of future cash flows shrinks.</p><p>That has a very pronounced effect on valuations of high-growth, high-multiple companies like the FAANGs.</p><p>Thus there are both the negative influences from the external conditions - the trade issues and a slowing economic environment - and simple investment arithmetic that have combined to blow up the FAANGs share prices. Both those influences could recede.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/frontline-in-us-china-power-struggle-reaches-australia-s-doorstep-20181119-p50gvz.html\">Trump and China's Xi Jinping</url> are scheduled to meet at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires later this week, so it is possible (albeit unlikely) that the trade confrontation between the US and China could be defused.</p><p>The Fed might blink and pause the process of normalising US monetary policy, although that's also unlikely. The Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell, will give a speech to the New York Economic Club on Wednesday that the market will monitor closely for any hint that the Fed is having second thoughts about that process.</p><p>Any shift in the expectations for trade and rates would, as they have already, have pronounced impacts on share prices and those of the FAANGs in particular.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520076264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTS-YWY1-JBJ7-N2GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><timeReceived>12:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Since then they have fallen 24 per cent, with an 18 per cent decline since the start of October.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The broader market, as measured by the S&amp;P 500, had risen by about 9 per cent from January through to late September but is now down 2.3 per cent for the year after a 10 per cent decline since late September.</p><p>While there might be some specific reasons for the falls in individual stocks, as a group the FAANGs are particularly exposed to the key themes that have impacted the market-at-large.</p><p>The big tech stocks have international markets for their services. Some, like Apple and Amazon, have global supply chains anchored in China. They are exposed to global growth and global trade.</p><p>They also tend to use complex corporate structures for their offshore operations, driven by tax minimisation strategies, which are now generating a response in many of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Facebook and Google are also coming under pressure from new European data privacy rules.</p><p>The Trump administration's trade policies and the aggressive stance it has taken with China in particular have implications for the FAANGs' access to markets, their supply chains and their relationships with the regulators in the markets in dispute with the US.</p><p>They aren't alone - many US companies operating internationally or sourcing products or components offshore are concerned about the impact on their sales offshore and their costs at home - but, as a group, they are particularly leveraged to global growth.</p><p>While the trade conflicts are having some specific effects on individual companies, unless resolved soon they are also expected to have a negative effect on individual economies, including the US, and global growth.</p><p>The US economy and growth in corporate profits was expected to slow significantly next year anyway as the effect of the Trump tax cuts waned. The trade disputes have provided a depressing overlay to that expectation.</p><p>The FAANGs trade at very high multiples of their earnings - as a group they trade on more than twice the average price-earnings multiple of the overall market.</p><p>That's partly because they have had higher growth rates but also because they invest so much in future earnings. An Amazon or a Netflix could be far more profitable (and its price-earnings multiple lower) if they slowed their growth rate.</p><p>Big price-earnings multiples - pricing for perfection - do mean, however, that even a slight setback either inside the company or in the external environment will have an exaggerated impact on the share price.</p><p>The other vulnerability created by those big multiples of earnings is an indirect exposure to interest rates.</p><p>The US Federal Reserve Board has been raising US rates for nearly three years and has foreshadowed another rise next month and three more next year, although it is possible that the slowing economy and Donald Trump's hectoring might cause it to pause that process.</p><p>It is also shrinking, at a rate of $US50 billion a month, a balance sheet bloated by its post-crisis quantitative easing.</p><p>Share prices essentially reflect the market's assessment of the net present value of future cash flows. Critical to that calculation is the rate used to discount the future cash flows, which is built on the risk-free rate provided by government bonds.</p><p>The rates on US Treasury bonds have been rising in response to the Fed's tightening of monetary policy. A year ago US 10-year bonds were yielding 2.33 per cent. Last week they were yielding 3.04 per cent, having reached 3.24 per cent earlier this month.</p><p>As rates continue to rise and the expectation of future increases is built into investors' assessments of companies' values, the discount rate also increases and so the present value of future cash flows shrinks.</p><p>That has a very pronounced effect on valuations of high-growth, high-multiple companies like the FAANGs.</p><p>Thus there are both the negative influences from the external conditions - the trade issues and a slowing economic environment - and simple investment arithmetic that have combined to blow up the FAANGs share prices. Both those influences could recede.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/frontline-in-us-china-power-struggle-reaches-australia-s-doorstep-20181119-p50gvz.html\">Trump and China's Xi Jinping</url> are scheduled to meet at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires later this week, so it is possible (albeit unlikely) that the trade confrontation between the US and China could be defused.</p><p>The Fed might blink and pause the process of normalising US monetary policy, although that's also unlikely. The Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell, will give a speech to the New York Economic Club on Wednesday that the market will monitor closely for any hint that the Fed is having second thoughts about that process.</p><p>Any shift in the expectations for trade and rates would, as they have already, have pronounced impacts on share prices and those of the FAANGs in particular.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBTOL-1520076264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBTOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTS-YWY1-JBJ7-N2GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437139</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><timeReceived>12:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The trade disputes have provided a depressing overlay to that expectation.</p><p>The FAANGs trade at very high multiples of their earnings - as a group they trade on more than twice the average price-earnings multiple of the overall market.</p><p>That's partly because they have had higher growth rates but also because they invest so much in future earnings. An Amazon or a Netflix could be far more profitable (and its price-earnings multiple lower) if they slowed their growth rate.</p><p>Big price-earnings multiples - pricing for perfection - do mean, however, that even a slight setback either inside the company or in the external environment will have an exaggerated impact on the share price.</p><p>The other vulnerability created by those big multiples of earnings is an indirect exposure to interest rates.</p><p>The US Federal Reserve Board has been raising US rates for nearly three years and has foreshadowed another rise next month and three more next year, although it is possible that the slowing economy and Donald Trump's hectoring might cause it to pause that process.</p><p>It is also shrinking, at a rate of $US50 billion a month, a balance sheet bloated by its post-crisis quantitative easing.</p><p>Share prices essentially reflect the market's assessment of the net present value of future cash flows. Critical to that calculation is the rate used to discount the future cash flows, which is built on the risk-free rate provided by government bonds.</p><p>The rates on US Treasury bonds have been rising in response to the Fed's tightening of monetary policy. A year ago US 10-year bonds were yielding 2.33 per cent. Last week they were yielding 3.04 per cent, having reached 3.24 per cent earlier this month.</p><p>As rates continue to rise and the expectation of future increases is built into investors' assessments of companies' values, the discount rate also increases and so the present value of future cash flows shrinks.</p><p>That has a very pronounced effect on valuations of high-growth, high-multiple companies like the FAANGs.</p><p>Thus there are both the negative influences from the external conditions - the trade issues and a slowing economic environment - and simple investment arithmetic that have combined to blow up the FAANGs share prices. Both those influences could recede.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/frontline-in-us-china-power-struggle-reaches-australia-s-doorstep-20181119-p50gvz.html\">Trump and China's Xi Jinping</url> are scheduled to meet at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires later this week, so it is possible (albeit unlikely) that the trade confrontation between the US and China could be defused.</p><p>The Fed might blink and pause the process of normalising US monetary policy, although that's also unlikely. The Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell, will give a speech to the New York Economic Club on Wednesday that the market will monitor closely for any hint that the Fed is having second thoughts about that process.</p><p>Any shift in the expectations for trade and rates would, as they have already, have pronounced impacts on share prices and those of the FAANGs in particular.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520076264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTS-YWY1-JBJ7-N2G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><timeReceived>12:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Since then they have fallen 24 per cent, with an 18 per cent decline since the start of October.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The broader market, as measured by the S&amp;P 500, had risen by about 9 per cent from January through to late September but is now down 2.3 per cent for the year after a 10 per cent decline since late September.</p><p>While there might be some specific reasons for the falls in individual stocks, as a group the FAANGs are particularly exposed to the key themes that have impacted the market-at-large.</p><p>The big tech stocks have international markets for their services.

The trade disputes have provided a depressing overlay to that expectation.</p><p>The FAANGs trade at very high multiples of their earnings - as a group they trade on more than twice the average price-earnings multiple of the overall market.</p><p>That's partly because they have had higher growth rates but also because they invest so much in future earnings. An Amazon or a Netflix could be far more profitable (and its price-earnings multiple lower) if they slowed their growth rate.</p><p>Big price-earnings multiples - pricing for perfection - do mean, however, that even a slight setback either inside the company or in the external environment will have an exaggerated impact on the share price.</p><p>The other vulnerability created by those big multiples of earnings is an indirect exposure to interest rates.</p><p>The US Federal Reserve Board has been raising US rates for nearly three years and has foreshadowed another rise next month and three more next year, although it is possible that the slowing economy and Donald Trump's hectoring might cause it to pause that process.</p><p>It is also shrinking, at a rate of $US50 billion a month, a balance sheet bloated by its post-crisis quantitative easing.</p><p>Share prices essentially reflect the market's assessment of the net present value of future cash flows.

The explanation for their particular implosion is an exaggerated version of the influences on the wider market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The FAANGs - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - are the heavyweights of the big end of the tech sector in the US that had soared 27 per cent between the start of this year and mid-year. Since then they have fallen 24 per cent, with an 18 per cent decline since the start of October.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The broader market, as measured by the S&amp;P 500, had risen by about 9 per cent from January through to late September but is now down 2.3 per cent for the year after a 10 per cent decline since late September.</p><p>While there might be some specific reasons for the falls in individual stocks, as a group the FAANGs are particularly exposed to the key themes that have impacted the market-at-large.</p><p>The big tech stocks have international markets for their services. Some, like Apple and Amazon, have global supply chains anchored in China. They are exposed to global growth and global trade.</p><p>They also tend to use complex corporate structures for their offshore operations, driven by tax minimisation strategies, which are now generating a response in many of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Facebook and Google are also coming under pressure from new European data privacy rules.</p><p>The Trump administration's trade policies and the aggressive stance it has taken with China in particular have implications for the FAANGs' access to markets, their supply chains and their relationships with the regulators in the markets in dispute with the US.</p><p>They aren't alone - many US companies operating internationally or sourcing products or components offshore are concerned about the impact on their sales offshore and their costs at home - but, as a group, they are leveraged to global growth.</p><p>While the trade conflicts are having some specific effects on individual companies, unless resolved soon they are also expected to have a negative effect on individual economies, including the US, and global growth.</p><p>The US economy and growth in corporate profits was expected to slow significantly next year anyway as the effect of the Trump tax cuts waned. The trade disputes have provided a depressing overlay to that expectation.</p><p>The FAANGs trade at very high multiples of their earnings - as a group they trade on more than twice the average price-earnings multiple of the overall market. That's partly because they have had higher growth rates but also because they invest so much in future earnings. An Amazon or a Netflix could be far more profitable (and its price-earnings multiple lower) if they slowed their growth rate.</p><p>Big price-earnings multiples - pricing for perfection - do mean, however, that even a slight setback inside the company or in the external environment will have an exaggerated share price impact.</p><p>The other vulnerability created by those big multiples of earnings is an indirect exposure to interest rates. The US Federal Reserve Board has been raising US rates for nearly three years and has foreshadowed another rise next month and three more next year, although it is possible that the slowing economy and Donald Trump's hectoring might cause it to pause that process.</p><p>It is also shrinking, at a rate of $US50 billion a month, a balance sheet bloated by its post-crisis quantitative easing.</p><p>Share prices essentially reflect the market's assessment of the net present value of future cash flows. Critical to that calculation is the rate used to discount the future cash flows, which is built on the risk-free rate provided by government bonds.</p><p>The rates on US Treasury bonds have been rising in response to the Fed's tightening of monetary policy. A year ago US 10-year bonds were yielding 2.33 per cent. Last week they were yielding 3.04 per cent, having reached 3.24 per cent earlier this month.</p><p>As rates continue to rise and the expectation of future increases is built into investors' assessments of companies' values, the discount rate also increases and so the present value of future cash flows shrinks. That has a very pronounced effect on valuations of high-growth, high-multiple companies like the FAANGs.</p><p>Thus there are both the negative influences from the external conditions - the trade issues and a slowing economic environment - and simple investment arithmetic that have combined to blow up the FAANGs share prices. Both of those influences could recede.</p><p>Trump and China's Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires later this week, so it is possible (albeit unlikely) that the trade confrontation between the US and China could be defused.</p><p>The Fed might blink and pause the process of normalising US monetary policy, although that's also unlikely. The Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell, will give a speech to the New York Economic Club tomorrow that the market will monitor closely for any hint that the Fed is having second thoughts about that process.</p><p>Any shift in the expectations for trade and rates would, as they have already, have pronounced impacts on share prices and those of the FAANGs in particular.</p><p>+27%</p><p>How much the tech sector soared in the first half of 2018.</p><p>-18%</p><p>The sector's decline since the start of October.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc72xke9dff7m18g09e9g0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTT-2B51-F0J6-J33Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"884\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Here are five things you need to know before the start of trading on Wednesday July 17.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><br/>1. -- Netlfix and FAANG  <br/></p><p>Netflix  , the first of the six major tech companies -- along with Microsoft  -- in the so-called FAANG complex of stocks will report second quarter earnings after the close trading today, with analysts likely keying on it outlook for online streaming subscriber additions in a suddenly competitive market.</p><p>Netflix itself is forecasting online subscriber growth of 5 million for the three months ending in June, a figure that would boost its worldwide total to just under 155 million, but the near-term loss of hits such as 'Friends' and 'The Office' could take its toll on growth rates in the coming months, as will the addition of rival streaming services from Disney DIS, Apple AAPL, and Comcast  .</p><p>Microsoft will follow with its earnings report Thursday, while Facebook  , Amazon  , Google parent Alphabet  and Apple will all update investors will quarter reports over the next two weeks.</p><p>The FAANG stock earnings -- which comprise nearly a fifth of the S&amp;P 500's $26 trillion market cap --are expected to be a crucial test for Wall Street as benchmark test fresh record highs, thanks in part to hopes of deeper monetary support from the Federal Reserve, even as broader corporate profits suggest slowing growth in the months ahead as the U.S.-China trade war takes its toll on American businesses.</p><p><br/>2. -- Banking at the Margins <br/></p><p>Bank of America  will publish second quarter earnings Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley  rounding out the sector's biggest players with three months results on Thursday, as investors digest a mixed bag of readings of the health of the country's lenders amid a slowing -- but solid -- domestic economy and the likelihood of even lower interest rates.</p><p>Tuesday's trio of big bank earnings -- JPMorgan  , Goldman Sachs  and Wells Fargo  -- all managed to top Wall Street forecasts for top and bottom line growth, but each signaled concern that Fed rate cuts would likely make near-term profits even more difficult to achieve. </p><p>Investors today will be looking at one of the sector's key measurements -- net interest margin -- for signs of weakness in not only Bank of America, but also smaller rivals such as U.S. Bancorp  , PNC Financial  and BNY Mellon  .</p><p><br/>3. -- Bitcoin Bashed <br/></p><p>Bitcoin prices tumbled well below $10,000 in overnight trading Wednesday as lawmakers on Capitol Hill grilled big tech executives and hounded social media giant Facebook FB over its plans to launch a its new 'Libra' digital currency next year.</p><p>Facebook's unveiling of Libra earlier this month helped bitcoin rise past $14,000 amid a renewed rally in cryptocurrency markets linked to the hope that wider use of various digital coins would allow for faster adoption of bitcoins in everyday transactions.</p><p>However, with regulators and central bankers around the world expressing doubts -- or outright hostility -- to Facebook's Libra ambitions, and President Donald Trump suggesting cryptocurrencies are \"based on thin air\", bitcoin prices have fallen more than $5,000 from their early July peak.</p><p>\"I know we have to earn people's trust for a very long period of time,\" Facebook's David Marcus told lawmakers Tuesday. \"We know we need to take the time to get this right.\"</p><p>Marcus will appear before the Senate Banking Committee later today.</p><p><br/>4. -- Oil's Well? <br/></p><p>U.S. oil prices bounced higher in early trading following data late Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute which showed domestic crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels in the week ending July 12. If confirmed later today by the Energy Information Administration, the declines will stretch to a fifth consecutive week, the longest in at least 18 months.</p><p>Prices were further pressured by the slow return of production capacity in the Gulf of Mexico, where more than half of the area's output, or around 1.1 million barrels per day, remains offline in the wake of storm Barry, which hammered the Louisiana coast this past weekend.</p><p>WTI futures contracts for August delivery, which typically dictate the direction of U.S. gas prices, were marked 29 cents higher in early New York trading at $57.91 per barrel.</p><p><br/>5. -- Apollo Holo <br/></p><p>The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing mission with a with a life-size projection of the Saturn V rocket on the Washington Monument in a three-day tribute to astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.</p><p><br/><br/> \"The Washington Monument is a symbol of our collective national achievements and what we can and will achieve in the future. It took 400,000 people from across the 50 states to make Apollo a reality,\" said Ellen Stofan, the Air and Space Museum director. \"This program celebrates them, and we hope it inspires generations too young to have experienced Apollo firsthand to define their own moonshot.\"  <br/><br/></p><p>A 17-minute program outside the Smithsonian Castle, slated for July 19 and 20 will also recreate the Apollo 11 mission's launch following Congressional approval for the displays earlier this year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-15022263</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-K1R1-JCHV-V1YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"887\"/><timeReceived>5:41 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.

The issue flared up earlier this year following news that <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>streaming speeds for customers of ISPs including Verizonand Comcast were slowing, as these firms attempted to extract a fee from <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>in exchange for connecting directly to their networks and resolving the issue.</p><p><person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>announced an agreement with Comcast last month in which it will indeed pay for a connection, and has been in talks with Verizonas well. But Hastings said the company was engaging in these talks \"reluctantly.\"</p><p>\"If this kind of leverage is effective against <person><nameText>Netflix, </nameText></person>which is pretty large, imagine the plight of smaller services today and in the future,\" Hastings wrote.</p><p>\"<person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>believes strong net neutrality is critical, but in the near term we will in cases pay the toll to the powerful ISPs to protect our consumer experience.\"</p><p/><p>Net neutrality advocates faced a setback earlier this year, when Verizonconvinced a judge to strike down the Federal Communications Commission's regulations on the issue. The FCC is now attempting to craft new net neutrality regulations that will better withstand legal scrutiny.</p><p>But the FCC's rules will only cover how ISPs treat traffic on their own networks; they don't address the issue of connections between networks, which is at the heart of the <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>dispute.</p><p>\"The traditional form of net neutrality which was recently overturned by a Verizon lawsuit is important, but insufficient,\" Hastings said. \"Without strong net neutrality, big ISPs can demand potentially escalating fees for the interconnection required to deliver high quality service.\"</p><p>Other big tech companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook, already have paid-connection deals with big ISPs.</p><p>Given the massive amount of data consumption <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>generates -- around a third of traffic online during peak hours -- the big ISPs argue that it should help foot the bill for delivery.</p><p>But Hastings says <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>is simply satisfying requests from the ISPs' customers, who pay steep monthly bills in the expectation that their content will be delivered at a certain speed regardless of where it comes from. In many places, he noted, consumers have just one or two choices for broadband Internet service.</p><p>\"The big ISPs can make these demands -- driving up costs and prices for everyone else -- because of their market position,\" Hastings wrote.</p><p>Comcast vice president David Cohen said in a statement that the FCC's net neutrality rules were never designed to deal with paid connections between networks, \"which have been an essential part of the growth of the Internet for two decades.\"</p><p>\"Providers like <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>have always paid for their interconnection to the Internet and have always had ample options to ensure that their customers receive an optimal performance through all ISPs,\" Cohen said. \"We are happy that Comcast and <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>were able to reach an amicable, market-based solution to our interconnection issues and believe that our agreement demonstrates the effectiveness of the market as a mechanism to deal with these matters.\"</p><p>Verizondeclined to comment;

The issue flared up earlier this year following news that Netflixstreaming speeds for customers of ISPs including Verizonand Comcast were slowing, as these firms attempted to extract a fee from Netflixin exchange for connecting directly to their networks and resolving the issue.</p><p>Netflixannounced an agreement with Comcast last month in which it will indeed pay for a connection, and has been in talks with Verizonas well. But Hastings said the company was engaging in these talks \"reluctantly.\"</p><p>\"If this kind of leverage is effective against Netflix, which is pretty large, imagine the plight of smaller services today and in the future,\" Hastings wrote. </p><p>\"Netflixbelieves strong net neutrality is critical, but in the near term we will in cases pay the toll to the powerful ISPs to protect our consumer experience.\" </p><p>Net neutrality advocates faced a setback earlier this year, when Verizonconvinced a judge to strike down the Federal Communications Commission's regulations on the issue. The FCC is now attempting to craft new net neutrality regulations that will better withstand legal scrutiny.</p><p>But the FCC's rules will only cover how ISPs treat traffic on their own networks; they don't address the issue of connections between networks, which is at the heart of the Netflixdispute. </p><p>\"The traditional form of net neutrality which was recently overturned by a Verizon lawsuit is important, but insufficient,\" Hastings said. \"Without strong net neutrality, big ISPs can demand potentially escalating fees for the interconnection required to deliver high quality service.\"</p><p>Other big tech companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook, already have paid-connection deals with big ISPs.</p><p>Given the massive amount of data consumption Netflixgenerates -- around a third of traffic online during peak hours -- the big ISPs argue that it should help foot the bill for delivery. </p><p>But Hastings says Netflixis simply satisfying requests from the ISPs' customers, who pay steep monthly bills in the expectation that their content will be delivered at a certain speed regardless of where it comes from. In many places, he noted, consumers have just one or two choices for broadband Internet service. </p><p>\"The big ISPs can make these demands -- driving up costs and prices for everyone else -- because of their market position,\" Hastings wrote.</p><p>Comcast vice president David Cohen said in a statement that the FCC's net neutrality rules were never designed to deal with paid connections between networks, \"which have been an essential part of the growth of the Internet for two decades.\"</p><p>\"Providers like Netflixhave always paid for their interconnection to the Internet and have always had ample options to ensure that their customers receive an optimal performance through all ISPs,\" Cohen said. \"We are happy that Comcast and Netflixwere able to reach an amicable, market-based solution to our interconnection issues and believe that our agreement demonstrates the effectiveness of the market as a mechanism to deal with these matters.\"</p><p>Verizondeclined to comment; AT&amp;T and Time Warner Cable did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2014 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But the real debacle came in September, when Netflixannounced its DVD service would be rebranded as Qwikster. Customers raged so much that Netflixpulled a stunning reversal a few short weeks later and canceled the entire Qwikster plan.</p><p>\"We moved too fast with it,\" Hastings said. \"We berate ourselves tremendously.\"</p><p>But Hastings didn't shy away from the philosophy behind Qwikster, as he downplayed the DVD business several times during his talk.</p><p>\"Streaming is the future; we're focused on it,\" he said. \"DVD is going to do whatever it's going to do. We don't want to hurt it, but we're not putting much time or energy into it.\"</p><p>Instead, Hastings sees Netflixas more aligned with HBO (owned by CNNMoney parent Time Warner). He views the on-demand service HBO Go as Netflix's main competitor in the streaming space -- not direct rivals like Hulu and kiosk service Redbox (owned by Coinstar), or big tech players like Amazon and Google.</p><p>To that point, Netflixhas licensed its first original series, \"House of Cards,\" which stars <person><nameText>Kevin Spacey </nameText></person>and is due out in late 2012. Hastings touted the series several times while he discussed the problem of how customers view Netflix's streaming selection.</p><p>\"There's this idea of, 'It's the Internet, it's everything!'\" Hastings said. \"Because when you go to Amazon, you get to choose among all the books.

I know she will have great ideas that help us address both the opportunities and challenges facing our company.\"</p><p>She will\u00a0be the third woman on Facebook's board, meaning it complies with a California law requiring companies with six or more people on their boards to appoint at least three women. It\u00a0had until 2021 to meet the requirement.\u00a0</p><p>Filings with US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday also revealed\u00a0that Mr Zuckerberg's security costs have risen from $7.6m to $9.96m between\u00a02017 and 2018, and\u00a0include a new $10m allowance for additional protection for the founder and his family.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Hastings, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8661081/Why-the-US-is-facing-these-unpalatable-decisions.html\">who founded Netflix in 1997,</url> reportedly clashed with fellow board member Peter Thiel over Mr Thiel's support for President Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>Mr Hastings supported Hillary Clinton in the US election that year, and told Mr Thiel that he was \"mystified\" by his support for Mr Trump, adding that it constituted \"catastrophically bad judgment\", the New York Times reported.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Bowles has also reportedly been critical of the company over Russian activity on Facebook.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook has come under attack from conservatives in the US who have argued that its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8661081/Why-the-US-is-facing-these-unpalatable-decisions.html\">content moderation policies</url> amount to censorship of right-wing political views, something the social network has strenuously denied.</p><p>In a Senate hearing on Wednesday Republican senator Ted Cruz claimed there had been a \"consistent pattern of political bias and censorship on the part of big tech\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8661081/Why-the-US-is-facing-these-unpalatable-decisions.html\">and threatened regulation</url> .\u00a0</p><p>But opponents have argued that harassment is still a significant problem on Facebook and other social media, and the tech giants need to do more to protect victims from attacks.</p><p>Mr Hastings' departure also comes amid Facebook's increasing move into video services. It launched Facebook Watch in August 2017, and last week Mr Zuckerberg said it would be rolling out a news service modelled on the video section of the site by the end of this year.\u00a0</p><p>On Friday, Facebook also came under fire after it admitted hiding \"easter egg\" joke written messages inside controllers for its virtual reality system Oculus Touch, including \"Big Brother is Watching\" and \"The Masons Were Here\".\u00a0</p><p>Oculus co-founder Nate Mitchell said on Twitter that the messages\u00a0were \"inappropriate and should have been removed\".\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-52868892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW5-0971-JCJY-G3HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"582\"/><timeReceived>10:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The streaming video giant doesn't have an advertising-based business and it's more of a media company than a tech firm, he noted on a video conference call Monday following the company's earnings report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think we're substantially inoculated from the other issues that are happening in the industry,\" Hastings said. \"And that's great.\"</p><p>Hastings is intimately familiar with Facebook's business model, because he serves on its board as a director.</p><p>\"I'm very glad that we built this business to not be advertising supported, but to be subscription,\" he said. \"We're very different from an ad-supported business.\"</p><p>Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified on Capitol Hill about his company's data protection and privacy practices following news that data on up to 87 million Facebook users was leaked to a data analysis firm linked to President Trump's election campaign. During the hearings, members of Congress brought up the possibility of new laws to protect consumer privacy, and to ensure transparency in online political ads. They also touched on the potential for new antitrust actions against some of tech's giants.</p><p>But Netflix stands apart from Facebook because it doesn't sell advertisements, Hastings said. Unlike Facebook, which at one point allowed app developers to download data it had collected about its users, Netflix has placed a premium on protecting the information it has on its customers' viewing habits, he said.</p><p>Furthermore, Netflix differs from other tech companies, because it's much more focused on producing, acquiring, and licensing movies and television shows than it is on building technology, Hastings said.

But Netflix CEO Reed Hastings thinks his company will be unaffected by a regulatory crackdown. Unlike other tech giants, the streaming video company doesn't sell ads, and is much more of a media company, he argued on a conference call following Netflix's first-quarter earnings report. </p><p>Hastings sits on Facebook's board of directors. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the Russian government's alleged attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election, policymakers in the US and abroad are talking seriously about new regulations targeting big tech companies. Netflix is often grouped with Facebook and Google in the lists of large technology firms, but company CEO Reed Hastings thinks his company has little to worry about when it comes to the heightened scrutiny of regulators. The streaming video giant doesn't have an advertising-based business and it's more of a media company than a tech firm, he noted on a video conference call Monday following the company's earnings report. \"I think we're substantially inoculated from the other issues that are happening in the industry,\" Hastings said. \"And that's great.\" Hastings is intimately familiar with Facebook's business model, because he serves on its board as a director. \"I'm very glad that we built this business to not be advertising supported, but to be subscription,\" he said. \"We're very different from an ad-supported business.\" Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified on Capitol Hill about his company's data protection and privacy practices following news that data on up to 87 million Facebook users was leaked to a data analysis firm linked to President Trump's election campaign. During the hearings, members of Congress brought up the possibility of new laws to protect consumer privacy, and to ensure transparency in online political ads. They also touched on the potential for new antitrust actions against some of tech's giants. But Netflix stands apart from Facebook because it doesn't sell advertisements, Hastings said. Unlike Facebook, which at one point allowed app developers to download data it had collected about its users, Netflix has placed a premium on protecting the information it has on its customers' viewing habits, he said. Furthermore, Netflix differs from other tech companies, because it's much more focused on producing, acquiring, and licensing movies and television shows than it is on building technology, Hastings said. The company expects to spend more than $10 billion on such content this year, compared with about $1.3 billion on technology, he said. \"We're really pretty different from the pure tech companies,\" Hastings said. Earlier on Monday, Netflix announced that it added 5.5 million subscribers in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street's expectations[1].

But investors in tech stocks don't seem too concerned.</p><p>Maybe it's despite Trump, or because of Trump -- after all, he is also promising to stimulate the economy with tax cuts, more government spending on infrastructure and fewer regulations -- many big tech stocks are on fire this year.</p><p>The so-called FANG stocks of tech, Facebook, Amazon, Netflixand Google, have all soared in 2017. </p><p>Facebookis up nearly 20%. Amazon has gained 12%. Netflixis up 14%. And Googleparent company Alphabet is up 7%. </p><p>And don't forget Apple. It's the best performer in the Dow this year, rising 20%. Fellow Dow component Cisco is up more than 13% too.</p><p>All six stocks are part of the Nasdaq, which has gained 8% and has outperformed the Dow and S&amp;P 500. </p><p>The solid performance of these companies has helped push the Nasdaq to within spitting distance of topping the 6,000 mark for the first time ever.</p><p>How long will it take for the Nasdaq to get to 6,000? That probably will depend on earnings. Most tech companies reported solid results for the fourth quarter and have issued good guidance for the first quarter and 2017.</p><p>While many investors are obsessed with news from Washington (and what's popping up on Trump's Twitter accounts) these tech giants should keep doing well regardless of the political landscape since they are leaders in their respective industries.</p><p>\"There are some meaningful fundamental drivers in the market right now,\" said David Jilek, chief investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisers. \"It's not just the Trump rally.\"</p><p>Just look at Netflix, for example. The stock rose Monday after UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson upgraded it to a buy.</p><p>He boosted his subscriber targets for the company -- and said that even though Trump's new FCC chair may eliminate Net neutrality rules that now help Netflix, he's not overly concerned that regulatory changes will hurt Netflixor other techs too severely. </p><p>There's also the fact that other Trump policies -- particularly tax reform -- could boost tech stocks substantially. </p><p>If Apple, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Cisco and other large techs with a lot of cash overseas are allowed to bring the cash back, or repatriate it, at a lower tax rate, they may invest more in R&amp;D, buy back stock, boost dividends or acquire more companies. </p><p>And at the end of the day, as long as investor sentiment about Trump remains strong -- CNNMoney's Fear &amp; Greed Index continues to show signs of Greed in the market -- then big tech stocks and other blue chips should continue to lead.</p><p>\"This is still the most hated bull market ever but we're not seeing any signs of that trend turning,\" said Scott Colyer, CEO &amp; chief investment officer of Advisors Asset Management.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But investors in tech stocks don't seem too concerned.</p><p>Maybe it's despite Trump that many big tech stocks are on fire this year -- or is it because of Trump? After all, he is also promising to stimulate the economy with tax cuts, more government spending on infrastructure and fewer regulations.</p><p>The so-called FANG stocks of tech, <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Amazon, <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>and Google, have all soared in 2017.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is up nearly 20%. Amazon has gained 12%. <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>is up 14%. And Googleparent company Alphabet is up 7%.</p><p>And don't forget Apple. It's the best performer in the Dow this year, rising 20%. Fellow Dow component Cisco is up more than 13% too.</p><p>All six stocks are part of the Nasdaq, which has gained 8% and has outperformed the Dow and S&amp;P 500.</p><p>The solid performance of these companies has helped push the Nasdaq to within spitting distance of topping the 6,000 mark for the first time ever.</p><p/><p>How long will it take for the Nasdaq to get to 6,000? That probably will depend on earnings. Most tech companies reported solid results for the fourth quarter and have issued good guidance for the first quarter and 2017.</p><p>While many investors are obsessed with news from Washington (and what's popping up on Trump's Twitter accounts) these tech giants should keep doing well regardless of the political landscape since they are leaders in their respective industries.</p><p>\"There are some meaningful fundamental drivers in the market right now,\" said David Jilek, chief investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisers. \"It's not just the Trump rally.\"</p><p>Just look at <person><nameText>Netflix, </nameText></person>for example. The stock rose Monday after UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson upgraded it to a buy.</p><p>He boosted his subscriber targets for the company -- and said that even though Trump's new FCC chair may eliminate Net neutrality rules that now help <person><nameText>Netflix, </nameText></person>he's not overly concerned that regulatory changes will hurt <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>or other techs too severely.</p><p>There's also the fact that other Trump policies -- particularly tax reform -- could boost tech stocks substantially.</p><p>If Apple, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Cisco and other large techs with a lot of cash overseas are allowed to bring the cash back, or repatriate it, at a lower tax rate, they may invest more in R&amp;D, buy back stock, boost dividends or acquire more companies.</p><p>And at the end of the day, as long as investor sentiment about Trump remains strong -- CNNMoney's Fear &amp; Greed Index continues to show signs of Greed in the market -- then big tech stocks and other blue chips should continue to lead.</p><p>\"This is still the most hated bull market ever but we're not seeing any signs of that trend turning,\" said Scott Colyer, CEO &amp;

It doesn't want to spend money trying to challenge online-advertising giants like Google and Facebook, CEO Reed Hastings said. It also wants \"none of the controversy around exploiting users with advertising,\" Hastings said. Still, Netflix has been cozying up to brands in other ways, including more product placements, brand partnerships, and consumer products, as Business Insider has covered closely. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] Netflix is beefing up its explanation for why it won't sell advertising, as a small contingent of Wall Street firms continue to push the company to consider new revenue streams. Wall Street analysts, including those at Needham[2] and Nomura[3], have argued that Netflix could boost subscriptions and revenue by introducing a plan that includes advertising. Netflix hassaid[4] it will not sell ads because doing so would damage its ad-free brand proposition. CEO Reed Hastings added on Tuesday that building a meaningful advertising business would require challenging online-ad behemoths like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Such a feat wouldn't come cheap. \"There's not easy money there,\" Hastings said during Netflix fourth-quarter earnings video. \"They're integrating so much data from so many sources ... To keep up with those giants, you've got to spend very heavily on that and track locations and all kinds of other things that we're not interested in doing.\" Hastings also pointed to the regulatory risks around ad targeting that have arisen as regions like the European Union and US state of California adopt new data-privacy laws, and US politicians push to break up big tech companies, in part, because of the immense user data they control. \"We want to be the safe respite where you can explore; you can get stimulated, have fun, enjoy, relax and have none of the controversy around exploiting users with advertising,\" Hastings said. Nevertheless, other streaming services like Hulu have successfully built advertising businesses. And forthcoming platforms like NBCUniversal's Peacock[5] and the mobile-video startup Quibi[6] are forgoing Netflix's subscription-only model for a hybrid model that includes both subscriptions and advertising. Dual revenue streams have also historically been the bedrock of the television industry, allowing it to fund expensive programming. Netflix has also been cozying up to brands in other ways, including more product placements, brand partnerships, and consumer products, as Business Insider has covered closely. The streaming company is building out its consumer-products team[7] that partners with companies like Ben ...rry's and Nike on products that promote the Netflix brand. It's also co-marketing its originals[8] with brands like Baskin-Robbins and Burger King to reach like-minded audiences that aren't yet on Netflix.

It now has 125 million subscribers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The strong subscriber growth came in well ahead of Wall Street's estimates, helping send Netflix stock up 6% in after-hours trading Monday. </p><p>Daniel Ives, an analyst with GBH Insights, called Netflix's earnings results \"eye popping\" in an investor note. </p><p>\"It shows the company's aggressive international expansion strategy is bearing fruit and putting major fuel in the company's growth engine for the rest of 2018 and beyond,\" Ives wrote.</p><p>Expectations were high heading into Netflix's earnings report. While several leading tech companies have stumbled this year amid regulatory concerns, Netflix stock has soared 60% on optimism for its original content strategy.</p><p>On a conference call with analysts, Netflix executives admitted to being surprised by the company's current level of success.</p><p>\"We've outperformed the business in a way we didn't predict,\" David Wells, Netflix's CFO, said on a conference call with analysts Monday. \"The business has grown faster than we expected.\"</p><p>Much of that growth is now coming from overseas. The vast majority of the new subscribers last quarter, nearly 5.5 million, came from outside the United States as Netflix continues to gain ground in international markets. </p><p>During the first quarter of this year, Netflix launched 18 original series, 11 new seasons for existing original series, and 14 new original movies, according to Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush.</p><p>The lineup included a new season of \"Jessica Jones,\" a reboot of \"Queer Eye\" and the launch of a new talk show from David Letterman, which kicked off with an interview with former President Barack Obama. </p><p>Netflix expects to have 700 programs available for customers in 2018. But there's at least one area it's not planning to expand into: news programs.</p><p>\"We're not looking to expand into news beyond the work that we're doing in shortform and longform feature documentary,\" Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, said on the call.</p><p>All that original content doesn't come cheap. The company expects to spend as much as $8 billion on shows and movies this year, up from $6 billion in 2017, according to the earnings report.</p><p>Netflix has now committed $17.9 billion to streaming content deals, up from $15.3 billion a year earlier. It also reportedly coughed up $300 million to hire Ryan Murphy, the power producer behind \"Glee.\"</p><p>To help cover its mounting costs, Netflix hiked prices by 10% in the final quarter of 2017, to $10.99 a month for the standard service. Yet, the company's subscriber growth continues to be trending in the right direction. </p><p>Netflix expects to add 6.2 million subscribers in the upcoming quarter, which would also come in above Wall Street estimates.</p><p>Still, Netflix continues to face stiff competition. Apple is ramping up its investments in original content. Amazon is rumored to be willing to drop $1 billion on a single TV show. Even Facebook is pushing deeper into video content. (Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings sits on its board).</p><p>The belief among analysts like Deutsche Bank's Brian Kraft is that Netflix has too much of a head start to lose now. </p><p>\"Netflix has changed the industry in a profound way and in doing so has given itself a significant lead, making it very difficult for the traditional media companies, or even other big tech companies, to catch up,\" Kraft wrote last week.</p><p>-- CNN's Paul R.

It now has 125 million subscribers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The strong subscriber growth came in well ahead of Wall Street's estimates, helping send Netflix stock up 6% in after-hours trading Monday.</p><p>Daniel Ives, an analyst with GBH Insights, called Netflix's earnings results \"eye popping\" in an investor note.</p><p>\"It shows the company's aggressive international expansion strategy is bearing fruit and putting major fuel in the company's growth engine for the rest of 2018 and beyond,\" Ives wrote.</p><p>Expectations were high heading into Netflix's earnings report.

The vast majority of the new subscribers last quarter, nearly 5.5 million, came from outside the United States as Netflix continues to gain ground in international markets.</p><p>During the first quarter of this year, Netflix launched 18 original series, 11 new seasons for existing original series, and 14 new original movies, according to Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush.</p><p>The lineup included a new season of \"Jessica Jones,\" a reboot of \"Queer Eye\" and the launch of a new talk show from David Letterman, which kicked off with an interview with former President Barack Obama.</p><p/><p>Netflix expects to have 700 programs available for customers in 2018. But there's at least one area it's not planning to expand into: news programs.</p><p>\"We're not looking to expand into news beyond the work that we're doing in shortform and longform feature documentary,\" Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, said on the call.</p><p>All that original content doesn't come cheap. The company expects to spend as much as $8 billion on shows and movies this year, up from $6 billion in 2017, according to the earnings report.</p><p>Netflix has now committed $17.9 billion to streaming content deals, up from $15.3 billion a year earlier. It also reportedly coughed up $300 million to hire Ryan Murphy, the power producer behind \"Glee.\"</p><p>To help cover its mounting costs, Netflix hiked prices by 10% in the final quarter of 2017, to $10.99 a month for the standard service. Yet, the company's subscriber growth continues to be trending in the right direction.</p><p>Netflix expects to add 6.2 million subscribers in the upcoming quarter, which would also come in above Wall Street estimates.</p><p>Still, Netflix continues to face stiff competition. Apple is ramping up its investments in original content. Amazon is rumored to be willing to drop $1 billion on a single TV show. Even Facebook is pushing deeper into video content. (Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings sits on its board).</p><p>The belief among analysts like Deutsche Bank's Brian Kraft is that Netflix has too much of a head start to lose now.</p><p>\"Netflix has changed the industry in a profound way and in doing so has given itself a significant lead, making it very difficult for the traditional media companies, or even other big tech companies, to catch up,\" Kraft wrote last week.</p><p>-- CNN's Paul R.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning! Let's talk tech. </p><p>NetflixKeeps Growing</p><p>  People on Wall Street thought they knew how fast Netflixwas growing. Very fast, they thought. It turns out they were wrong: It's even faster.</p><p>  The company reported this week that it had added 8.3 million subscribers in the last quarter, about two million more than analysts were expecting. But it's still spending tons of money on content -- about $8 billion this year, and perhaps more in future years. Many in the industry continue to wonder whether the company's business will ever work.</p><p>  The problem: To start making money, Netflixmight eventually have to raise prices a lot. What will happen then?</p><p>  Well, we learned something interesting in Netflix's earnings report. Netflixraised the prices of some its plans over the last quarter, and people still signed up.</p><p>  I suspect that accounts for how the service is changing. Now that there's just so much stuff on Netflix-- so many comedies, so many dramas, so many dumb movies, so many smart movies -- it has become not just another premium cable channel but something like a replacement for TV itself. In other words, it's indispensable. You can expect to keep paying for it forever.</p><p>  A Smart, if Tardy, Speaker</p><p>  Remember HomePod? Probably not. Last summer, Apple unveiled a smart speaker inspired by Amazon's Echo and <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>Home, because it is apparently the rule in the tech industry that if one big company does something, every other company has to do it, too. Think Same.</p><p>  Then, nothing.</p><p>  A new Apple device is usually a Big Deal event, one of those campaigns that Apple rolls out with the precision of a military conquest. But nobody heard anything more about the HomePod until late November, when Apple announced that the timing had slipped and that HomePod wouldn't come until after the holidays.</p><p>  It was a crucial miss -- the Echo seems to have had a gangbusters holiday, with Amazon expanding its head start in the category by probably tens of millions of devices. In a widely passed-around post, the venture capitalist M. G. Siegler wondered whether Amazon was so far ahead that HomePod was essentially dead on arrival.</p><p>  Well, we'll see. Apple announced this week that HomePod was back in action -- available to order on Friday, and in stores starting Feb. 9.</p><p>  It's still an odd announcement; Apple provided only a short demo of the device in June, so people brave enough to order will be going in blind. But you count Apple out in the hardware business at your peril. It will be fun to see what happens here.</p><p>  Democrats vs. Silicon Valley</p><p>  My colleagues Cecilia Kang and Daisuke Wakabayashi had an interesting article this week about the growing tensions between the tech industry and the Democratic Party. Democrats and techies have long been reliable allies -- techies donate tons of money, and Democratic candidates get to show off their association with widely admired visionaries of the future.</p><p>  That's past. Now that the tech industry has become more a cause of national angst and confusion rather than of wondrous gadgets and money, Democrats are being called on to police the business more stringently. Lefty activists want antitrust investigations of big tech companies and regulations on political advertising -- a generally more combative relationship between the government and the pursuits of business.</p><p>  There's another side to this story, too: While tech C.E.O.s have very publicly sparred with President Trump on a variety of issues, they're all enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime windfall of profits from the Republican tax plan. As rich people running wealthy companies, the tech industry's leaders have short-term corporate interests that are obviously very well served by the low-tax, low-regulation Republican Party.</p><p>  It's an election year. It will be interesting to see whether Democrats run against tech, whether tech sticks with Dems and, always, what Trump does with all this.</p><p>  Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called State of the Art.

Netflix\u2019s shares soared as much as 13 percent in the trading that takes place after regular market hours.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the stock market suffered a steep swoon this month, results like that should help stocks recover. Netflix\u2019s report was the first from one of the big technology companies that helped drive the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to a record last month.</p><p>Investors have charted the performance of these tech stocks by bunching them into a group they call FAANG, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Their contribution to the overall market has been significant. In the 12 months through Monday, the S. &amp; P. 500 had risen 7.7 percent, but without the five technology stocks its performance was only 5.2 percent, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.</p><p>Netflix is the priciest of the five prominent technology companies. This makes it a good barometer for the amount of bullishness in the stock market. If the stock keeps rising over the coming weeks, it will underscore that investors still have a strong appetite for riskier companies, an attitude that might spill over into other technology firms.</p><p>As Netflix\u2019s third-quarter results showed, it is doing well in some respects. It added seven million subscribers in the period, a larger amount than it added in the third quarter of last year. But the company is also consuming large sums of cash to finance its growth and borrowing more to cover its shortfall. Netflix also faces serious competitive threats, like Disney\u2019s plan to set up its own subscription video service.</p><p>Yet an important stock market yardstick \u2014 the price-earnings ratio \u2014 suggests investors have an almost unquestioning faith in Netflix\u2019s ability to notch fast-growing earnings. This ratio compares its stock price with its earnings. Take a company with a stock trading at $100. If investors expect it to make $10 per share (its net income divided by the number of shares it has issued), it would have a price-earnings ratio of 10.</p><p>The ratio for the companies in the S. &amp; P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. &amp; P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s still early in the earnings reporting season \u2014 and jarring disappointments may occur. Facebook is facing mounting regulatory scrutiny and is spending large sums on making its network more secure. Apple is trying to increase its revenue in part by selling higher-priced phones that may turn off some consumers.</p><p>Outside of the technology space, investors are concerned that President Trump\u2019s trade wars may hurt the earnings of large manufacturing companies.</p><p>But after stocks had a wobbly start to October, strong earnings have already helped reassure investors. Before Netflix reported its performance, two well-known Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, reported earnings that provided more evidence that the banking sector is in a good position to finance economic growth.</p><p>After those reports and a few others, the S. &amp; P. 500 jumped 2.15 percent, its biggest single-day gain since March.</p><p>PHOTO: Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, which added seven million subscribers in its third quarter.

But nobody's asked it to</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a bizarre election stunt, with a suddenly folksy Stephen Harper warning of an apocalypse where ordinary citizens would be penalized for watching TV.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Some politicians want to tax digital streaming services like Netflix and YouTube,\" the then prime minister warned in a 2015 election campaign video. \"I love movies and TV shows. I'm 100 per cent against a Netflix tax.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And by the way, his favourite show, if you didn't know, was Breaking Bad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem? The new \"tax\" was never supported by any of the opposition parties in the first place. And there was an existing tax that wasn't being enforced. Digital services like Netflix never had to collect GST or relevant provincial sales taxes under current laws if they didn't have a substantial physical presence in Canada. It meant that consumers who subscribed to Netflix were required to submit that tax to the government themselves. Not many did.</p><p>That has, according to some estimates, resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue that would have gone into the Canadian economy over the years since Netflix first set up shop north of the border in 2010.</p><p>Harper's messaging worked. The incoming government of Justin Trudeau enthusiastically pledged there would never be a Netflix tax. And he has been true to his word, with no suggestion he will introduce one, even after the upcoming federal election. A report by the auditor general released last week says in 2017 alone, Ottawa lost $169 million in GST revenue because of its reluctance to force streaming companies to collect taxes.</p><p>\"It's absolutely weird to me that Justin Trudeau adopted a talking point from Harper and ran with it. It's so ironic that we have to pay GST on all the services we receive, but the one that's not collected is by a foreign service provider,\" says David Sparrow, national president of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA). \"This should have been a no-brainer. It makes sense that Netflix should collect the taxes like everybody else, but somehow it became this political football.\"</p><p>The ground is now shifting, although for some, not fast enough. At the beginning of this year, both Quebec and Saskatchewan introduced legislation requiring that provincial sales tax be collected on digital enterprises. Quebec expects to raise $154.5 million from that move over the next five years.</p><p>The two provinces are following a global trend that has seen regulators in Europe and Asia introduce tax and content requirements for online broadcasters.</p><p>So far there has been little movement at the federal level, although a legislative review panel headed by former Telus executive Janet Yale is currently hearing submissions looking into broadcasting and telecommunications laws, including the issue of taxation. An interim report is due in June. But final recommendations won't be ready until January 2020, well after the October election.</p><p>\"God help us if the new government ends up packing all that work in a box and shoving it under the bed,\" says Sparrow. \"Then we'd be back to square one.\"</p><p>Netflix Canada, meanwhile, says it is happy to comply with any government regulation and will collect taxes if requested to do so. But so far, the government hasn't required it to.</p><p>\"There was no agreement or special deal on taxation of any kind. We will comply with tax laws if and when they legally are extended to services like Netflix,\" says the company in a filing to the legislative review panel provided to the Star.</p><p>The federal Liberals did try to appease the critics: they unveiled an agreement in 2017 under then heritage minister M\u00e9lanie Joly that would see the streaming giant invest $500 million over five years in Canada, with an additional $25 million to develop French, Indigenous and female-focused content. Netflix also announced recently it would build a production hub in the Toronto Port Lands district, which it says will create an additional 1,850 jobs.</p><p>As a result, Netflix says it is on track to \"significantly exceed\" the $500 million originally promised. Netflix Canadian content co-productions have included the CBC'sAnne with an E and Northern Rescue, Travellers with Corus, and Degrassi: Next Class with DHX Media.</p><p>However, the deal has been pilloried by critics who say Netflix would likely have spent that money in Canada anyway, with some detractors acting as if a naive Joly had given away the sacred cow of Canadian culture for a handful of magic beans. Netflix, after all, spent $12 billion in 2018 and analysts say it could spend up to $15 billion this year.</p><p>\"I think they were able to give M\u00e9lanie Jolie a big flashy number she could put in a headline. But spending $100 million per year in Canada is not unrealistic given their global budget. They are here in Canada because of our excellent tax credits, our low Canadian dollar and talented artists,\" argues Sparrow. \"If conditions were to change, they would be somewhere else. We shouldn't delude ourselves into thinking they are doing this solely for our benefit.\"</p><p>The most vocal criticism from the industry has been that the government inadvertently created an unlevel playing field between powerful global technology companies and local broadcasters. Canadian firms such as Rogers, Bell and Corus are forced to collect the taxes, making their services comparatively more expensive than offerings by Netflix and making them less competitive.</p><p>Netflix is the largest, but not the only player in the game, of course. Founded in 1997 in Los Gatos, Calif., the subscription-based digital service has chipped away at the dominance of the cable broadcast model by giving consumers content whenever and wherever they want it. It has more than 148 million subscribers, with an estimated 6.7 million of them in Canada.</p><p>Other online producers include Amazon Prime Video, CBS All Access and Hulu. There is also a rash of upcoming players including Disney and AppleTV that will compete against budding domestic players in the same pool, such as Bell Media's Crave and CBC's Gem.</p><p>Another key issue separate from the collection of sales taxes, is that Netflix, unlike domestic cable companies, is not required to put 5 per cent of its gross revenue into the Canada Media Fund (CMF) to produce Canadian content.</p><p>\"Foreign streaming services must be required to contribute to the production of Canadian projects,\" says Reynolds Mastin, president and CEO of the Canadian Media Producers Association, the national trade body representing independent producers. \"They also need to ensure Canadian audiences can access this programming. How this will happen is up to debate, but we need government to make this a priority.\"</p><p>Other jurisdictions so far have provided something of a potential road map: The European Union in the fall of 2018 issued a directive that on-demand video services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video devote at least 30 per cent of their offerings to European content. They are also required to make a direct investment in content. In France, they are required to contribute 2 per cent of their revenues to fund French content. In Germany, that number is 2.5 per cent.</p><p>Netflix, however, says it would be unfair to pursue a similar path in Canada.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" the company says in its submission to the federal panel.</p><p>The idea of levelling the playing field is a fallacy, says Netflix, because Canadian broadcasters get a myriad of regulatory protections that are not afforded to foreign companies. That includes dedicated channels of distribution and simultaneous substitution rules allowing Canadian broadcasters to replace foreign advertising with their own.</p><p>\"Netflix is already a significant investor,\" through co-productions that reflect Canadian content policy, the streamer says in its submission to the federal panel. \"Requiring foreign online services to contribute to the CMF could generate problematic and discriminatory outcomes.\"</p><p>Mastin of the Canadian Media Producers Association says, perhaps a little frustratingly, that they have tried to work with Netflix on solutions in the past, but have come up empty.</p><p>\"We are ready to work with Netflix and other streaming services to find a solution that strikes the right balance - one that allows foreign streaming services to benefit from access to Canadian audiences, while also ensuring they contribute to the health of our domestic production sector. Unfortunately, Netflix has said 'No' to every proposed solution that's been put forward to them so far.\"</p><p>Netflix said a spokesperson was not available for comment to the Star, instead referring to the company's 30-page submission to the legislative review panel. One key assertion by Netflix is that it shouldn't come under the same rules for broadcasters. That's because Canadian regulators determined that audiovisual content over the internet was exempt from licensing and not subject to the same kinds of oversight as domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"Netflix does not consider online services to be broadcasters or encourage proposals that would regulate online services as broadcasters,\" it said. \"Regulation can risk undermining Canadian content's online success.\"</p><p>But ACTRA's Sparrow says if it walks like a duck, it is a duck.</p><p>\"Why are we fetishizing the internet as if it's different? It's a pipeline like any other. The internet is a bunch of cables that come to your home, just like the other guys and it should be regulated.\"</p><p>Not everyone is in agreement with the broadcasters. Law professor Michael Geist has been a staunch defender of the rights of digital streamers, saying they already make significant contributions without the need for additional regulation.</p><p>\"Calls to regulate due to so-called existential threats, level playing fields, or European models ring hollow against an evidence that points to remarkable Canadian cultural success story without new taxes or regulation,\" says Geist in a blog post.</p><p>Geist also chastised CBC president Catherine Tait, who controversially compared Netflix this year to a foreign occupying force with a colonializing effect on Canadian culture, saying her comments were \"wholly inappropriate.\"</p><p>Tait also said in earlier statements referring to the digital streamers that \"everybody's swimming in the same swimming pool. But some of the people aren't cleaning it up.\"</p><p>Those assertions don't sit well with Netflix. Canada, after all, was its first foreign market outside the U.S. The argument that \"Netflix benefits from the system without giving back\" is simply false, says the company. \"Revenues earned from our Canadian members contribute directly to our content spending,\" it says, adding Canada is one of its top three locations worldwide for original content production.</p><p>What worries Sparrow though, is not the present, but the future. The Canadian movie and TV industry is going through a remarkable growth spurt, buoyed by the era of peak television with more than 500 new dramas every year. For the first time in 2018, the number of new streaming shows surpassed the output of basic cable and broadcast networks. Cities such as Vancouver and Toronto have been major beneficiaries. And that number is poised to get bigger in the short term at least.</p><p>Toronto Mayor John Tory met with media companies in Los Angeles last week and tweeted that he is pushing hard for a piece of the $1 billion in spending on TV that Apple is expected to make in original content this year.</p><p>But Sparrow argues that the good times won't last forever.</p><p>\"The concept of peak TV means that this global boom will end, and we believe this will happen,\" says ACTRA. \"It is inevitable the global pace of English-language production will decline.\"</p><p>Other broadcasters, including FX CEO John Landgraf who coined the term peak television, arguing there were far too many series being produced, believes there will be consolidation in the market. When that happens, some believe production will inevitably slow. But that's why it's important to have regulatory safeguards in place, argues Sparrow.</p><p>\"It just makes sense you pay for the privilege of having access to Canadian homes and eyeballs.\"</p><p>That's up to future governments to decide. The legislative review panel will eventually make its final recommendations next year and it will be up to the sitting government to decide what direction to take. In the meantime, the existential battle over what constitutes Canadian broadcast culture and who should pay for it remains in the balance.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

I'm 100 per cent against a Netflix tax.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And by the way, his favourite show, if you didn't know, was Breaking Bad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem? The new \"tax\" was never supported by any of the opposition parties in the first place. And there was already an existing tax, one that wasn't being enforced. Digital services like Netflix never had to collect GST or relevant provincial sales taxes under current tax laws if they didn't have a substantial physical presence in Canada. It meant that consumers who purchased Netflix were required to submit that tax to the government themselves. Not many did.</p><p>That has, according to some estimates, resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue that would have gone into the Canadian economy over the years since Netflix first set up shop north of the border in 2010.</p><p>Harper's messaging worked. The incoming government of Justin Trudeau enthusiastically pledged there would never be a Netflix tax. And he has been true to his word, with no suggestion he will introduce one, even after the upcoming federal election. A report by the auditor general released last week says in 2017 alone, Ottawa lost $169 million in GST revenue because of its reluctance to force streaming companies to collect taxes.</p><p>\"It's absolutely weird to me that Justin Trudeau adopted a talking point from Harper and ran with it. It's so ironic that we have to pay GST on all the services we receive, but the one that's not collected is by a foreign service provider,\" says David Sparrow, national president of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA). \"This should have been a no-brainer. It makes sense that Netflix should collect the taxes like everybody else, but somehow it became this political football.\"</p><p>The ground, however, is shifting. Although for some, not fast enough. At the beginning of this year, both Quebec and Saskatchewan introduced legislation requiring that provincial sales tax be collected on digital enterprises. Quebec expects to raise $154.5 million from that move over the next five years.</p><p>The two provinces are following a global trend that has seen regulators in Europe and Asia introduce tax and content requirements for online broadcasters.</p><p>So far there has been little movement on the federal level, although currently, a legislative review panel headed by former Telus executive Janet Yale is hearing submissions looking into broadcasting and telecommunications laws, including the issue of taxation. An interim report is due in June. But final recommendations won't be ready until January 2020, well after the October election.</p><p>\"God help us if the new government ends up packing all that work in a box and shoving it under the bed,\" says Sparrow. \"Then we'd be back to square one.\"</p><p>Netflix Canada, meanwhile, says it is happy to comply with any government regulation and will collect taxes if requested to do so. But so far, the government hasn't required it to.</p><p>\"There was no agreement or special deal on taxation of any kind. We will comply with tax laws if and when they legally are extended to services like Netflix,\" says the company in a filing to the legislative review panel provided to the Star.</p><p>The Liberals did try to appease the critics: They unveiled an agreement in 2017 under then-Heritage Minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly that would see the giant streamer invest $500 million over five years in Canada, with an additional $25 million to develop French, Indigenous and female-focused content. Netflix also announced recently it would build a production hub in the Toronto Port Lands district, which it says will create an additional 1,850 jobs.</p><p>As a result, the streaming giant says it is on track to \"significantly exceed\" the $500 million originally promised. Netflix Canadian content co-productions have included the CBC's Anne with an E and Northern Rescue, Travellers with Corus, and Degrassi: Next Class with DHX Media.</p><p>However, the deal has been pilloried by critics who say Netflix would likely have spent that money in Canada anyway, with some detractors acting as if a naive Joly had given away the sacred cow of Canadian culture for a handful of magic beans. Netflix, after all, spent $12 billion in 2018 and analysts say it could spend up to $15 billion this year.</p><p>\"I think they were able to give M&amp;#233;lanie Jolie a big flashy number she could put in a headline. But spending $100 million per year in Canada is not unrealistic given their global budget. They are here in Canada because of our excellent tax credits, our low Canadian dollar and talented artists,\" argues Sparrow. \"If conditions were to change, they would be somewhere else. We shouldn't delude ourselves into thinking they are doing this solely for our benefit.\"</p><p>The most vocal criticism from the industry has been that the government inadvertently created an unlevel playing field between powerful global technology companies and local broadcasters. Canadian firms such as Rogers, Bell and Corus are forced to collect the taxes, making their services comparatively more expensive than offerings by Netflix and making them less competitive.</p><p>Netflix is the largest, but not the only player in the game, of course. Founded in 1997 in Los Gatos, California, the subscription-based digital service has chipped away at the dominance of the cable broadcast model by giving consumers content whenever and wherever they want it. It has more than 148 million subscribers, with an estimated 6.7 million of them in Canada.</p><p>Other online producers include Amazon Prime Video, CBS All Access and Hulu. There is also a rash of upcoming players including Disney and AppleTV that will compete against budding domestic players in the same pool, such as Bell Media's Crave and CBC's Gem.</p><p>Another key issue separate from the collection of sales taxes, is that Netflix, unlike domestic cable companies, is not required to put 5 per cent of its gross revenue into the Canada Media Fund (CMF) to produce Canadian content.</p><p>\"Foreign streaming services must be required to contribute to the production of Canadian projects,\" says Reynolds Mastin, president and CEO of the Canadian Media Producers Association, the national trade body representing independent producers. \"They also need to ensure Canadian audiences can access this programming. How this will happen is up to debate, but we need government to make this a priority.\"</p><p>Other jurisdictions so far have provided something of a potential road map: The European Union in the fall of 2018 issued a directive that on-demand video services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video devote at least 30 per cent of their offerings to European content. They are also required to make a direct investment in content. In France, they are required to contribute 2 per cent of their revenues to fund French content. In Germany, that number is 2.5 per cent.</p><p>Netflix, however, says it would be unfair to pursue a similar path in Canada.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" the company says in its submission to the federal panel.</p><p>The idea of levelling the playing field is a fallacy, says Netflix, because Canadian broadcasters get a myriad of regulatory protections that are not afforded to foreign companies. That includes dedicated channels of distribution and simultaneous substitution rules allowing Canadian broadcasters to replace foreign advertising with their own.</p><p>\"Netflix is already a significant investor,\" through co-productions that reflect Canadian content policy, the streamer says in its submission to the federal panel. \"Requiring foreign online services to contribute to the CMF could generate problematic and discriminatory outcomes.\"</p><p>Mastin of the Canadian Media Producers Association says, perhaps a little frustratingly, that they have tried to work with Netflix on solutions in the past, but have come up empty.</p><p>\"We are ready to work with Netflix and other streaming services to find a solution that strikes the right balance - one that allows foreign streaming services to benefit from access to Canadian audiences, while also ensuring they contribute to the health of our domestic production sector. Unfortunately, Netflix has said 'No' to every proposed solution that's been put forward to them so far.\"</p><p>Netflix said a spokesperson was not available for comment to the Star, instead referring to the company's 30-page submission to the legislative review panel. One key assertion by Netflix is that it shouldn't come under the same rules for broadcasters. That's because Canadian regulators determined that audiovisual content over the internet was exempt from licensing and not subject to the same kinds of oversight as domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"Netflix does not consider online services to be broadcasters or encourage proposals that would regulate online services as broadcasters,\" it said. \"Regulation can risk undermining Canadian content's online success.\"</p><p>But ACTRA's Sparrow says if it walks like a duck, it is a duck.</p><p>\"Why are we fetishizing the internet as if it's different? It's a pipeline like any other. The internet is a bunch of cables that come to your home, just like the other guys and it should be regulated.\"</p><p>Not everyone is in agreement with the broadcasters. Law professor Michael Geist has been a staunch defender of the rights of digital streamers, saying they already make significant contributions without the need for additional regulation.</p><p>\"Calls to regulate due to so-called existential threats, level playing fields, or European models ring hollow against an evidence that points to remarkable Canadian cultural success story without new taxes or regulation,\" says Geist in a blog post.</p><p>Geist also chastised CBC president Catherine Tait, who controversially compared Netflix this year to a foreign occupying force with a colonializing effect on Canadian culture, saying her comments were \"wholly inappropriate.\"</p><p>Tait also said in earlier statements referring to the digital streamers that \"everybody's swimming in the same swimming pool. But some of the people aren't cleaning it up.\"</p><p>Those assertions don't sit well with Netflix. Canada, after all, was its first foreign market outside the U.S. The argument that \"Netflix benefits from the system without giving back\" is simply false, says the company. \"Revenues earned from our Canadian members contribute directly to our content spending,\" it says, adding Canada is one of its top three locations worldwide for original content production.</p><p>What worries Sparrow though, is not the present, but the future. The Canadian movie and TV industry is going through a remarkable growth spurt, buoyed by the era of peak television with more than 500 new dramas every year. For the first time in 2018, the number of new streaming shows surpassed the output of basic cable and broadcast networks. Cities such as Vancouver and Toronto have been major beneficiaries. And that number is poised to get bigger in the short term at least.</p><p>Toronto Mayor John Tory met with media companies in Los Angeles last week and tweeted that he is pushing hard for a piece of the $1 billion in spending on TV that Apple is expected to make in original content this year.</p><p>But Sparrow argues that the good times won't last forever.</p><p>\"The concept of peak TV means that this global boom will end, and we believe this will happen,\" says ACTRA. \"It is inevitable the global pace of English-language production will decline.\"</p><p>Other broadcasters, including FX CEO John Landgraf who coined the term peak television, arguing there were far too many series being produced, believes there will be consolidation in the market. When that happens, some believe production will inevitably slow. But that's why it's important to have regulatory safeguards in place, argues Sparrow.</p><p>\"It just makes sense you pay for the privilege of having access to Canadian homes and eyeballs.\"</p><p>That's up to future governments to decide. The legislative review panel will eventually make its final recommendations next year and it will be up to the sitting government to decide what direction to take. In the meantime, the existential battle over what constitutes Canadian broadcast culture and who should pay for it remains in the balance.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

But nobody's asked it to</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a bizarre election stunt, with a suddenly folksy Stephen Harper warning of an apocalypse where ordinary citizens would be penalized for watching TV.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Some politicians want to tax digital streaming services like Netflix and YouTube,\" the then prime minister warned in a 2015 election campaign video. \"I love movies and TV shows. I'm 100 per cent against a Netflix tax.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And by the way, his favourite show, if you didn't know, was Breaking Bad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem? The new \"tax\" was never supported by any of the opposition parties in the first place. And there was an existing tax that wasn't being enforced. Digital services like Netflix never had to collect GST or relevant provincial sales taxes under current laws if they didn't have a substantial physical presence in Canada. It meant that consumers who subscribed to Netflix were required to submit that tax to the government themselves. Not many did.</p><p>That has, according to some estimates, resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue that would have gone into the Canadian economy over the years since Netflix first set up shop north of the border in 2010.</p><p>Harper's messaging worked. The incoming government of Justin Trudeau enthusiastically pledged there would never be a Netflix tax. And he has been true to his word, with no suggestion he will introduce one, even after the upcoming federal election. A report by the auditor general released last week says in 2017 alone, Ottawa lost $169 million in GST revenue because of its reluctance to force streaming companies to collect taxes.</p><p>\"It's absolutely weird to me that Justin Trudeau adopted a talking point from Harper and ran with it. It's so ironic that we have to pay GST on all the services we receive, but the one that's not collected is by a foreign service provider,\" says David Sparrow, national president of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA). \"This should have been a no-brainer. It makes sense that Netflix should collect the taxes like everybody else, but somehow it became this political football.\"</p><p>The ground is now shifting, although for some, not fast enough. At the beginning of this year, both Quebec and Saskatchewan introduced legislation requiring that provincial sales tax be collected on digital enterprises. Quebec expects to raise $154.5 million from that move over the next five years.</p><p>The two provinces are following a global trend that has seen regulators in Europe and Asia introduce tax and content requirements for online broadcasters.</p><p>So far there has been little movement at the federal level, although a legislative review panel headed by former Telus executive Janet Yale is currently hearing submissions looking into broadcasting and telecommunications laws, including the issue of taxation. An interim report is due in June. But final recommendations won't be ready until January 2020, well after the October election.</p><p>\"God help us if the new government ends up packing all that work in a box and shoving it under the bed,\" says Sparrow. \"Then we'd be back to square one.\"</p><p>Netflix Canada, meanwhile, says it is happy to comply with any government regulation and will collect taxes if requested to do so. But so far, the government hasn't required it to.</p><p>\"There was no agreement or special deal on taxation of any kind. We will comply with tax laws if and when they legally are extended to services like Netflix,\" says the company in a filing to the legislative review panel provided to the Star.</p><p>The federal Liberals did try to appease the critics: they unveiled an agreement in 2017 under then heritage minister M\u00e9lanie Joly that would see the streaming giant invest $500 million over five years in Canada, with an additional $25 million to develop French, Indigenous and female-focused content. Netflix also announced recently it would build a production hub in the Toronto Port Lands district, which it says will create an additional 1,850 jobs.</p><p>As a result, Netflix says it is on track to \"significantly exceed\" the $500 million originally promised. Netflix Canadian content co-productions have included the CBC'sAnne with an E and Northern Rescue, Travellers with Corus, and Degrassi: Next Class with DHX Media.</p><p>However, the deal has been pilloried by critics who say Netflix would likely have spent that money in Canada anyway, with some detractors acting as if a naive Joly had given away the sacred cow of Canadian culture for a handful of magic beans. Netflix, after all, spent $12 billion in 2018 and analysts say it could spend up to $15 billion this year.</p><p>\"I think they were able to give M\u00e9lanie Jolie a big flashy number she could put in a headline. But spending $100 million per year in Canada is not unrealistic given their global budget. They are here in Canada because of our excellent tax credits, our low Canadian dollar and talented artists,\" argues Sparrow. \"If conditions were to change, they would be somewhere else. We shouldn't delude ourselves into thinking they are doing this solely for our benefit.\"</p><p>The most vocal criticism from the industry has been that the government inadvertently created an unlevel playing field between powerful global technology companies and local broadcasters. Canadian firms such as Rogers, Bell and Corus are forced to collect the taxes, making their services comparatively more expensive than offerings by Netflix and making them less competitive.</p><p>Netflix is the largest, but not the only player in the game, of course. Founded in 1997 in Los Gatos, Calif., the subscription-based digital service has chipped away at the dominance of the cable broadcast model by giving consumers content whenever and wherever they want it. It has more than 148 million subscribers, with an estimated 6.7 million of them in Canada.</p><p>Other online producers include Amazon Prime Video, CBS All Access and Hulu. There is also a rash of upcoming players including Disney and AppleTV that will compete against budding domestic players in the same pool, such as Bell Media's Crave and CBC's Gem.</p><p>Another key issue separate from the collection of sales taxes, is that Netflix, unlike domestic cable companies, is not required to put 5 per cent of its gross revenue into the Canada Media Fund (CMF) to produce Canadian content.</p><p>\"Foreign streaming services must be required to contribute to the production of Canadian projects,\" says Reynolds Mastin, president and CEO of the Canadian Media Producers Association, the national trade body representing independent producers. \"They also need to ensure Canadian audiences can access this programming. How this will happen is up to debate, but we need government to make this a priority.\"</p><p>Other jurisdictions so far have provided something of a potential road map: The European Union in the fall of 2018 issued a directive that on-demand video services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video devote at least 30 per cent of their offerings to European content. They are also required to make a direct investment in content. In France, they are required to contribute 2 per cent of their revenues to fund French content. In Germany, that number is 2.5 per cent.</p><p>Netflix, however, says it would be unfair to pursue a similar path in Canada.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" the company says in its submission to the federal panel.</p><p>The idea of levelling the playing field is a fallacy, says Netflix, because Canadian broadcasters get a myriad of regulatory protections that are not afforded to foreign companies. That includes dedicated channels of distribution and simultaneous substitution rules allowing Canadian broadcasters to replace foreign advertising with their own.</p><p>\"Netflix is already a significant investor,\" through co-productions that reflect Canadian content policy, the streamer says in its submission to the federal panel. \"Requiring foreign online services to contribute to the CMF could generate problematic and discriminatory outcomes.\"</p><p>Mastin of the Canadian Media Producers Association says, perhaps a little frustratingly, that they have tried to work with Netflix on solutions in the past, but have come up empty.</p><p>\"We are ready to work with Netflix and other streaming services to find a solution that strikes the right balance - one that allows foreign streaming services to benefit from access to Canadian audiences, while also ensuring they contribute to the health of our domestic production sector. Unfortunately, Netflix has said 'No' to every proposed solution that's been put forward to them so far.\"</p><p>Netflix said a spokesperson was not available for comment to the Star, instead referring to the company's 30-page submission to the legislative review panel. One key assertion by Netflix is that it shouldn't come under the same rules for broadcasters. That's because Canadian regulators determined that audiovisual content over the internet was exempt from licensing and not subject to the same kinds of oversight as domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"Netflix does not consider online services to be broadcasters or encourage proposals that would regulate online services as broadcasters,\" it said. \"Regulation can risk undermining Canadian content's online success.\"</p><p>But ACTRA's Sparrow says if it walks like a duck, it is a duck.</p><p>\"Why are we fetishizing the internet as if it's different? It's a pipeline like any other. The internet is a bunch of cables that come to your home, just like the other guys and it should be regulated.\"</p><p>Not everyone is in agreement with the broadcasters. Law professor Michael Geist has been a staunch defender of the rights of digital streamers, saying they already make significant contributions without the need for additional regulation.</p><p>\"Calls to regulate due to so-called existential threats, level playing fields, or European models ring hollow against an evidence that points to remarkable Canadian cultural success story without new taxes or regulation,\" says Geist in a blog post.</p><p>Geist also chastised CBC president Catherine Tait, who controversially compared Netflix this year to a foreign occupying force with a colonializing effect on Canadian culture, saying her comments were \"wholly inappropriate.\"</p><p>Tait also said in earlier statements referring to the digital streamers that \"everybody's swimming in the same swimming pool. But some of the people aren't cleaning it up.\"</p><p>Those assertions don't sit well with Netflix. Canada, after all, was its first foreign market outside the U.S. The argument that \"Netflix benefits from the system without giving back\" is simply false, says the company. \"Revenues earned from our Canadian members contribute directly to our content spending,\" it says, adding Canada is one of its top three locations worldwide for original content production.</p><p>What worries Sparrow though, is not the present, but the future. The Canadian movie and TV industry is going through a remarkable growth spurt, buoyed by the era of peak television with more than 500 new dramas every year. For the first time in 2018, the number of new streaming shows surpassed the output of basic cable and broadcast networks. Cities such as Vancouver and Toronto have been major beneficiaries. And that number is poised to get bigger in the short term at least.</p><p>Toronto Mayor John Tory met with media companies in Los Angeles last week and tweeted that he is pushing hard for a piece of the $1 billion in spending on TV that Apple is expected to make in original content this year.</p><p>But Sparrow argues that the good times won't last forever.</p><p>\"The concept of peak TV means that this global boom will end, and we believe this will happen,\" says ACTRA. \"It is inevitable the global pace of English-language production will decline.\"</p><p>Other broadcasters, including FX CEO John Landgraf who coined the term peak television, arguing there were far too many series being produced, believes there will be consolidation in the market. When that happens, some believe production will inevitably slow. But that's why it's important to have regulatory safeguards in place, argues Sparrow.</p><p>\"It just makes sense you pay for the privilege of having access to Canadian homes and eyeballs.\"</p><p>That's up to future governments to decide. The legislative review panel will eventually make its final recommendations next year and it will be up to the sitting government to decide what direction to take. In the meantime, the existential battle over what constitutes Canadian broadcast culture and who should pay for it remains in the balance.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

I\u2019m 100 per cent against a Netflix tax.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And by the way, his favourite show, if you didn\u2019t know, was Breaking Bad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem? The new \u201ctax\u201d was never supported by any of the opposition parties in the first place. And there was already an existing tax, one that wasn\u2019t being enforced. Digital services like Netflixnever had to collect GST or relevant provincial sales taxes under current tax laws if they didn\u2019t have a substantial physical presence in Canada. It meant that consumers who purchased Netflixwere required to submit that tax to the government themselves. Not many did.</p><p>That has, according to some estimates, resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue that would have gone into the Canadian economy over the years since Netflixfirst set up shop north of the border in 2010.</p><p>Harper\u2019s messaging worked. The incoming government of <person><nameText>Justin Trudeau </nameText></person>enthusiastically pledged there would never be a Netflix tax. And he has been true to his word, with no suggestion he will introduce one, even after the upcoming federal election. A report by the auditor general released last week says in 2017 alone, Ottawa lost $169 million in GST revenue because of its reluctance to force streaming companies to collect taxes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely weird to me that <person><nameText>Justin Trudeau </nameText></person>adopted a talking point from Harper and ran with it. It\u2019s so ironic that we have to pay GST on all the services we receive, but the one that\u2019s not collected is by a foreign service provider,\u201d says David Sparrow, national president of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA). \u201cThis should have been a no-brainer. It makes sense that Netflixshould collect the taxes like everybody else, but somehow it became this political football.\u201d</p><p>The ground, however, is shifting. Although for some, not fast enough. At the beginning of this year, both Quebec and Saskatchewan introduced legislation requiring that provincial sales tax be collected on digital enterprises. Quebec expects to raise $154.5 million from that move over the next five years.</p><p>The two provinces are following a global trend that has seen regulators in Europe and Asia introduce tax and content requirements for online broadcasters.</p><p>So far there has been little movement on the federal level, although currently, a legislative review panel headed by former Telus executive Janet Yale is hearing submissions looking into broadcasting and telecommunications laws, including the issue of taxation. An interim report is due in June. But final recommendations won\u2019t be ready until January 2020, well after the October election.</p><p>\u201cGod help us if the new government ends up packing all that work in a box and shoving it under the bed,\u201d says Sparrow. \u201cThen we\u2019d be back to square one.\u201d</p><p>NetflixCanada, meanwhile, says it is happy to comply with any government regulation and will collect taxes if requested to do so. But so far, the government hasn\u2019t required it to.</p><p>\u201cThere was no agreement or special deal on taxation of any kind. We will comply with tax laws if and when they legally are extended to services like Netflix,\u201d says the company in a filing to the legislative review panel provided to the Star.</p><p>The Liberals did try to appease the critics: They unveiled an agreement in 2017 under then-Heritage Minister M#233;lanie Joly that would see the giant streamer invest $500 million over five years in Canada, with an additional $25 million to develop French, Indigenous and female-focused content. Netflixalso announced recently it would build a production hub in the Toronto Port Lands district, which it says will create an additional 1,850 jobs.</p><p>As a result, the streaming giant says it is on track to \u201csignificantly exceed\u201d the $500 million originally promised. NetflixCanadian content co-productions have included the CBC\u2019s Anne with an E and Northern Rescue, Travellers with Corus, and Degrassi: Next Class with DHX Media.</p><p>However, the deal has been pilloried by critics who say Netflixwould likely have spent that money in Canada anyway, with some detractors acting as if a naive Joly had given away the sacred cow of Canadian culture for a handful of magic beans. Netflix, after all, spent $12 billion in 2018 and analysts say it could spend up to $15 billion this year.</p><p>\u201cI think they were able to give M#233;lanie Jolie a big flashy number she could put in a headline. But spending $100 million per year in Canada is not unrealistic given their global budget. They are here in Canada because of our excellent tax credits, our low Canadian dollar and talented artists,\u201d argues Sparrow. \u201cIf conditions were to change, they would be somewhere else. We shouldn\u2019t delude ourselves into thinking they are doing this solely for our benefit.\u201d</p><p>The most vocal criticism from the industry has been that the government inadvertently created an unlevel playing field between powerful global technology companies and local broadcasters. Canadian firms such as Rogers, Bell and Corus are forced to collect the taxes, making their services comparatively more expensive than offerings by Netflixand making them less competitive.</p><p>Netflixis the largest, but not the only player in the game, of course. Founded in 1997 in Los Gatos, California, the subscription-based digital service has chipped away at the dominance of the cable broadcast model by giving consumers content whenever and wherever they want it. It has more than 148 million subscribers, with an estimated 6.7 million of them in Canada.</p><p>Other online producers include Amazon Prime Video, CBS All Access and Hulu. There is also a rash of upcoming players including Disney and AppleTV that will compete against budding domestic players in the same pool, such as Bell Media\u2019s Crave and CBC\u2019s Gem.</p><p>Another key issue separate from the collection of sales taxes, is that Netflix, unlike domestic cable companies, is not required to put 5 per cent of its gross revenue into the Canada Media Fund (CMF) to produce Canadian content.</p><p>\u201cForeign streaming services must be required to contribute to the production of Canadian projects,\u201d says Reynolds Mastin, president and CEO of the Canadian Media Producers Association, the national trade body representing independent producers. \u201cThey also need to ensure Canadian audiences can access this programming. How this will happen is up to debate, but we need government to make this a priority.\u201d</p><p>Other jurisdictions so far have provided something of a potential road map: The European Union in the fall of 2018 issued a directive that on-demand video services such as Netflixand Amazon Prime Video devote at least 30 per cent of their offerings to European content. They are also required to make a direct investment in content. In France, they are required to contribute 2 per cent of their revenues to fund French content. In Germany, that number is 2.5 per cent.</p><p>Netflix, however, says it would be unfair to pursue a similar path in Canada.</p><p>\u201cIt would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\u201d the company says in its submission to the federal panel.</p><p>The idea of levelling the playing field is a fallacy, says Netflix, because Canadian broadcasters get a myriad of regulatory protections that are not afforded to foreign companies. That includes dedicated channels of distribution and simultaneous substitution rules allowing Canadian broadcasters to replace foreign advertising with their own.</p><p>\u201cNetflixis already a significant investor,\u201d through co-productions that reflect Canadian content policy, the streamer says in its submission to the federal panel. \u201cRequiring foreign online services to contribute to the CMF could generate problematic and discriminatory outcomes.\u201d</p><p>Mastin of the Canadian Media Producers Association says, perhaps a little frustratingly, that they have tried to work with Netflixon solutions in the past, but have come up empty.</p><p>\u201cWe are ready to work with Netflixand other streaming services to find a solution that strikes the right balance \u2014 one that allows foreign streaming services to benefit from access to Canadian audiences, while also ensuring they contribute to the health of our domestic production sector. Unfortunately, Netflixhas said \u2018No\u2019 to every proposed solution that\u2019s been put forward to them so far.\u201d</p><p>Netflixsaid a spokesperson was not available for comment to the Star, instead referring to the company\u2019s 30-page submission to the legislative review panel. One key assertion by Netflixis that it shouldn\u2019t come under the same rules for broadcasters. That\u2019s because Canadian regulators determined that audiovisual content over the internet was exempt from licensing and not subject to the same kinds of oversight as domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\u201cNetflixdoes not consider online services to be broadcasters or encourage proposals that would regulate online services as broadcasters,\u201d it said. \u201cRegulation can risk undermining Canadian content\u2019s online success.\u201d</p><p>But ACTRA\u2019s Sparrow says if it walks like a duck, it is a duck.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we fetishizing the internet as if it\u2019s different? It\u2019s a pipeline like any other. The internet is a bunch of cables that come to your home, just like the other guys and it should be regulated.\u201d</p><p>Not everyone is in agreement with the broadcasters. Law professor Michael Geist has been a staunch defender of the rights of digital streamers, saying they already make significant contributions without the need for additional regulation.</p><p>\u201cCalls to regulate due to so-called existential threats, level playing fields, or European models ring hollow against an evidence that points to remarkable Canadian cultural success story without new taxes or regulation,\u201d says Geist in a blog post.</p><p>Geist also chastised CBC president Catherine Tait, who controversially compared Netflixthis year to a foreign occupying force with a colonializing effect on Canadian culture, saying her comments were \u201cwholly inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>Tait also said in earlier statements referring to the digital streamers that \u201ceverybody\u2019s swimming in the same swimming pool. But some of the people aren\u2019t cleaning it up.\u201d</p><p>Those assertions don\u2019t sit well with Netflix. Canada, after all, was its first foreign market outside the U.S. The argument that \u201cNetflixbenefits from the system without giving back\u201d is simply false, says the company. \u201cRevenues earned from our Canadian members contribute directly to our content spending,\u201d it says, adding Canada is one of its top three locations worldwide for original content production.</p><p>What worries Sparrow though, is not the present, but the future. The Canadian movie and TV industry is going through a remarkable growth spurt, buoyed by the era of peak television with more than 500 new dramas every year. For the first time in 2018, the number of new streaming shows surpassed the output of basic cable and broadcast networks. Cities such as Vancouver and Toronto have been major beneficiaries. And that number is poised to get bigger in the short term at least.</p><p>Toronto Mayor John Tory met with media companies in Los Angeles last week and tweeted that he is pushing hard for a piece of the $1 billion in spending on TV that Apple is expected to make in original content this year.</p><p>But Sparrow argues that the good times won\u2019t last forever.</p><p>\u201cThe concept of peak TV means that this global boom will end, and we believe this will happen,\u201d says ACTRA. \u201cIt is inevitable the global pace of English-language production will decline.\u201d</p><p>Other broadcasters, including FX CEO John Landgraf who coined the term peak television, arguing there were far too many series being produced, believes there will be consolidation in the market. When that happens, some believe production will inevitably slow. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have regulatory safeguards in place, argues Sparrow.</p><p>\u201cIt just makes sense you pay for the privilege of having access to Canadian homes and eyeballs.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s up to future governments to decide. The legislative review panel will eventually make its final recommendations next year and it will be up to the sitting government to decide what direction to take. In the meantime, the existential battle over what constitutes Canadian broadcast culture and who should pay for it remains in the balance.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

I'm 100 per cent against a Netflix tax.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And by the way, his favourite show, if you didn't know, was Breaking Bad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem? The new \"tax\" was never supported by any of the opposition parties in the first place. And there was an existing tax that wasn't being enforced. Digital services like Netflix never had to collect GST or relevant provincial sales taxes under current laws if they didn't have a substantial physical presence in Canada. It meant that consumers who subscribed to Netflix were required to submit that tax to the government themselves. Not many did.</p><p>That has, according to some estimates, resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue that would have gone into the Canadian economy over the years since Netflix first set up shop north of the border in 2010.</p><p>Harper's messaging worked. The incoming government of Justin Trudeau enthusiastically pledged there would never be a Netflix tax. And he has been true to his word, with no suggestion he will introduce one, even after the upcoming federal election. A report by the auditor general released last week says in 2017 alone, Ottawa lost $169 million in GST revenue because of its reluctance to force streaming companies to collect taxes.</p><p>\"It's absolutely weird to me that Justin Trudeau adopted a talking point from Harper and ran with it. It's so ironic that we have to pay GST on all the services we receive, but the one that's not collected is by a foreign service provider,\" says David Sparrow, national president of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA). \"This should have been a no-brainer. It makes sense that Netflix should collect the taxes like everybody else, but somehow it became this political football.\"</p><p>The ground is now shifting, although for some, not fast enough. At the beginning of this year, both Quebec and Saskatchewan introduced legislation requiring that provincial sales tax be collected on digital enterprises. Quebec expects to raise $154.5 million from that move over the next five years.</p><p>The two provinces are following a global trend that has seen regulators in Europe and Asia introduce tax and content requirements for online broadcasters.</p><p>So far there has been little movement at the federal level, although a legislative review panel headed by former Telus executive Janet Yale is currently hearing submissions looking into broadcasting and telecommunications laws, including the issue of taxation. An interim report is due in June. But final recommendations won't be ready until January 2020, well after the October election.</p><p>\"God help us if the new government ends up packing all that work in a box and shoving it under the bed,\" says Sparrow. \"Then we'd be back to square one.\"</p><p>Netflix Canada, meanwhile, says it is happy to comply with any government regulation and will collect taxes if requested to do so. But so far, the government hasn't required it to.</p><p>\"There was no agreement or special deal on taxation of any kind. We will comply with tax laws if and when they legally are extended to services like Netflix,\" says the company in a filing to the legislative review panel provided to the Star.</p><p>The federal Liberals did try to appease the critics: they unveiled an agreement in 2017 under then heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly that would see the streaming giant invest $500 million over five years in Canada, with an additional $25 million to develop French, Indigenous and female-focused content. Netflix also announced recently it would build a production hub in the Toronto Port Lands district, which it says will create an additional 1,850 jobs.</p><p>As a result, Netflix says it is on track to \"significantly exceed\" the $500 million originally promised. Netflix Canadian content co-productions have included the CBC's Anne with an E and Northern Rescue, Travellers with Corus, and Degrassi: Next Class with DHX Media.</p><p>However, the deal has been pilloried by critics who say Netflix would likely have spent that money in Canada anyway, with some detractors acting as if a naive Joly had given away the sacred cow of Canadian culture for a handful of magic beans. Netflix, after all, spent $12 billion in 2018 and analysts say it could spend up to $15 billion this year.</p><p>\"I think they were able to give M&amp;#233;lanie Joly a big flashy number she could put in a headline. But spending $100 million per year in Canada is not unrealistic given their global budget. They are here in Canada because of our excellent tax credits, our low Canadian dollar and talented artists,\" argues Sparrow. \"If conditions were to change, they would be somewhere else. We shouldn't delude ourselves into thinking they are doing this solely for our benefit.\"</p><p>The most vocal criticism from the industry has been that the government inadvertently created an unlevel playing field between powerful global technology companies and local broadcasters. Canadian firms such as Rogers, Bell and Corus are forced to collect the taxes, making their services comparatively more expensive than offerings by Netflix and making them less competitive.</p><p>Netflix is the largest, but not the only player in the game, of course. Founded in 1997 in Los Gatos, Calif., the subscription-based digital service has chipped away at the dominance of the cable broadcast model by giving consumers content whenever and wherever they want it. It has more than 148 million subscribers, with an estimated 6.7 million of them in Canada.</p><p>Other online producers include Amazon Prime Video, CBS All Access and Hulu. There is also a rash of upcoming players including Disney and AppleTV that will compete against budding domestic players in the same pool, such as Bell Media's Crave and CBC's Gem.</p><p>Another key issue separate from the collection of sales taxes, is that Netflix, unlike domestic cable companies, is not required to put 5 per cent of its gross revenue into the Canada Media Fund (CMF) to produce Canadian content.</p><p>\"Foreign streaming services must be required to contribute to the production of Canadian projects,\" says Reynolds Mastin, president and CEO of the Canadian Media Producers Association, the national trade body representing independent producers. \"They also need to ensure Canadian audiences can access this programming. How this will happen is up to debate, but we need government to make this a priority.\"</p><p>Other jurisdictions so far have provided something of a potential road map: The European Union in the fall of 2018 issued a directive that on-demand video services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video devote at least 30 per cent of their offerings to European content. They are also required to make a direct investment in content. In France, they are required to contribute 2 per cent of their revenues to fund French content. In Germany, that number is 2.5 per cent.</p><p>Netflix, however, says it would be unfair to pursue a similar path in Canada.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" the company says in its submission to the federal panel.</p><p>The idea of levelling the playing field is a fallacy, says Netflix, because Canadian broadcasters get a myriad of regulatory protections that are not afforded to foreign companies. That includes dedicated channels of distribution and simultaneous substitution rules allowing Canadian broadcasters to replace foreign advertising with their own.</p><p>\"Netflix is already a significant investor,\" through co-productions that reflect Canadian content policy, the streamer says in its submission to the federal panel. \"Requiring foreign online services to contribute to the CMF could generate problematic and discriminatory outcomes.\"</p><p>Mastin of the Canadian Media Producers Association says, perhaps a little frustratingly, that they have tried to work with Netflix on solutions in the past, but have come up empty.</p><p>\"We are ready to work with Netflix and other streaming services to find a solution that strikes the right balance - one that allows foreign streaming services to benefit from access to Canadian audiences, while also ensuring they contribute to the health of our domestic production sector. Unfortunately, Netflix has said 'No' to every proposed solution that's been put forward to them so far.\"</p><p>Netflix said a spokesperson was not available for comment to the Star, instead referring to the company's 30-page submission to the legislative review panel. One key assertion by Netflix is that it shouldn't come under the same rules for broadcasters. That's because Canadian regulators determined that audiovisual content over the internet was exempt from licensing and not subject to the same kinds of oversight as domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"Netflix does not consider online services to be broadcasters or encourage proposals that would regulate online services as broadcasters,\" it said. \"Regulation can risk undermining Canadian content's online success.\"</p><p>But ACTRA's Sparrow says if it walks like a duck, it is a duck.</p><p>\"Why are we fetishizing the internet as if it's different? It's a pipeline like any other. The internet is a bunch of cables that come to your home, just like the other guys and it should be regulated.\"</p><p>Not everyone is in agreement with the broadcasters. Law professor Michael Geist has been a staunch defender of the rights of digital streamers, saying they already make significant contributions without the need for additional regulation.</p><p>\"Calls to regulate due to so-called existential threats, level playing fields, or European models ring hollow against an evidence that points to remarkable Canadian cultural success story without new taxes or regulation,\" says Geist in a blog post.</p><p>Geist also chastised CBC president Catherine Tait, who controversially compared Netflix this year to a foreign occupying force with a colonializing effect on Canadian culture, saying her comments were \"wholly inappropriate.\"</p><p>Tait also said in earlier statements referring to the digital streamers that \"everybody's swimming in the same swimming pool. But some of the people aren't cleaning it up.\"</p><p>Those assertions don't sit well with Netflix. Canada, after all, was its first foreign market outside the U.S. The argument that \"Netflix benefits from the system without giving back\" is simply false, says the company. \"Revenues earned from our Canadian members contribute directly to our content spending,\" it says, adding Canada is one of its top three locations worldwide for original content production.</p><p>What worries Sparrow though, is not the present, but the future. The Canadian movie and TV industry is going through a remarkable growth spurt, buoyed by the era of peak television with more than 500 new dramas every year. For the first time in 2018, the number of new streaming shows surpassed the output of basic cable and broadcast networks. Cities such as Vancouver and Toronto have been major beneficiaries. And that number is poised to get bigger in the short term at least.</p><p>Toronto Mayor John Tory met with media companies in Los Angeles last week and tweeted that he is pushing hard for a piece of the $1 billion in spending on TV that Apple is expected to make in original content this year.</p><p>But Sparrow argues that the good times won't last forever.</p><p>\"The concept of peak TV means that this global boom will end, and we believe this will happen,\" says ACTRA. \"It is inevitable the global pace of English-language production will decline.\"</p><p>Other broadcasters, including FX CEO John Landgraf who coined the term peak television, arguing there were far too many series being produced, believes there will be consolidation in the market. When that happens, some believe production will inevitably slow. But that's why it's important to have regulatory safeguards in place, argues Sparrow.</p><p>\"It just makes sense you pay for the privilege of having access to Canadian homes and eyeballs.\"</p><p>That's up to future governments to decide. The legislative review panel will eventually make its final recommendations next year and it will be up to the sitting government to decide what direction to take. In the meantime, the existential battle over what constitutes Canadian broadcast culture and who should pay for it remains in the balance.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

I'm 100 per cent against a Netflix tax.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And by the way, his favourite show, if you didn't know, was Breaking Bad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem? The new \"tax\" was never supported by any of the opposition parties in the first place. And there was an existing tax that wasn't being enforced. Digital services like Netflix never had to collect GST or relevant provincial sales taxes under current laws if they didn't have a substantial physical presence in Canada. It meant that consumers who subscribed to Netflix were required to submit that tax to the government themselves. Not many did.</p><p>That has, according to some estimates, resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue that would have gone into the Canadian economy over the years since Netflix first set up shop north of the border in 2010.</p><p>Harper's messaging worked. The incoming government of Justin Trudeau enthusiastically pledged there would never be a Netflix tax. And he has been true to his word, with no suggestion he will introduce one, even after the upcoming federal election. A report by the auditor general released last week says in 2017 alone, Ottawa lost $169 million in GST revenue because of its reluctance to force streaming companies to collect taxes.</p><p>\"It's absolutely weird to me that Justin Trudeau adopted a talking point from Harper and ran with it. It's so ironic that we have to pay GST on all the services we receive, but the one that's not collected is by a foreign service provider,\" says David Sparrow, national president of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA). \"This should have been a no-brainer. It makes sense that Netflix should collect the taxes like everybody else, but somehow it became this political football.\"</p><p>The ground is now shifting, although for some, not fast enough. At the beginning of this year, both Quebec and Saskatchewan introduced legislation requiring that provincial sales tax be collected on digital enterprises. Quebec expects to raise $154.5 million from that move over the next five years.</p><p>The two provinces are following a global trend that has seen regulators in Europe and Asia introduce tax and content requirements for online broadcasters.</p><p>So far there has been little movement at the federal level, although a legislative review panel headed by former Telus executive Janet Yale is currently hearing submissions looking into broadcasting and telecommunications laws, including the issue of taxation. An interim report is due in June. But final recommendations won't be ready until January 2020, well after the October election.</p><p>\"God help us if the new government ends up packing all that work in a box and shoving it under the bed,\" says Sparrow. \"Then we'd be back to square one.\"</p><p>Netflix Canada, meanwhile, says it is happy to comply with any government regulation and will collect taxes if requested to do so. But so far, the government hasn't required it to.</p><p>\"There was no agreement or special deal on taxation of any kind. We will comply with tax laws if and when they legally are extended to services like Netflix,\" says the company in a filing to the legislative review panel provided to the Star.</p><p>The federal Liberals did try to appease the critics: they unveiled an agreement in 2017 under then heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly that would see the streaming giant invest $500 million over five years in Canada, with an additional $25 million to develop French, Indigenous and female-focused content. Netflix also announced recently it would build a production hub in the Toronto Port Lands district, which it says will create an additional 1,850 jobs.</p><p>As a result, Netflix says it is on track to \"significantly exceed\" the $500 million originally promised. Netflix Canadian content co-productions have included the CBC's Anne with an E and Northern Rescue, Travellers with Corus, and Degrassi: Next Class with DHX Media.</p><p>However, the deal has been pilloried by critics who say Netflix would likely have spent that money in Canada anyway, with some detractors acting as if a naive Joly had given away the sacred cow of Canadian culture for a handful of magic beans. Netflix, after all, spent $12 billion in 2018 and analysts say it could spend up to $15 billion this year.</p><p>\"I think they were able to give M&amp;#233;lanie Joly a big flashy number she could put in a headline. But spending $100 million per year in Canada is not unrealistic given their global budget. They are here in Canada because of our excellent tax credits, our low Canadian dollar and talented artists,\" argues Sparrow. \"If conditions were to change, they would be somewhere else. We shouldn't delude ourselves into thinking they are doing this solely for our benefit.\"</p><p>The most vocal criticism from the industry has been that the government inadvertently created an unlevel playing field between powerful global technology companies and local broadcasters. Canadian firms such as Rogers, Bell and Corus are forced to collect the taxes, making their services comparatively more expensive than offerings by Netflix and making them less competitive.</p><p>Netflix is the largest, but not the only player in the game, of course. Founded in 1997 in Los Gatos, Calif., the subscription-based digital service has chipped away at the dominance of the cable broadcast model by giving consumers content whenever and wherever they want it. It has more than 148 million subscribers, with an estimated 6.7 million of them in Canada.</p><p>Other online producers include Amazon Prime Video, CBS All Access and Hulu. There is also a rash of upcoming players including Disney and AppleTV that will compete against budding domestic players in the same pool, such as Bell Media's Crave and CBC's Gem.</p><p>Another key issue separate from the collection of sales taxes, is that Netflix, unlike domestic cable companies, is not required to put 5 per cent of its gross revenue into the Canada Media Fund (CMF) to produce Canadian content.</p><p>\"Foreign streaming services must be required to contribute to the production of Canadian projects,\" says Reynolds Mastin, president and CEO of the Canadian Media Producers Association, the national trade body representing independent producers. \"They also need to ensure Canadian audiences can access this programming. How this will happen is up to debate, but we need government to make this a priority.\"</p><p>Other jurisdictions so far have provided something of a potential road map: The European Union in the fall of 2018 issued a directive that on-demand video services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video devote at least 30 per cent of their offerings to European content. They are also required to make a direct investment in content. In France, they are required to contribute 2 per cent of their revenues to fund French content. In Germany, that number is 2.5 per cent.</p><p>Netflix, however, says it would be unfair to pursue a similar path in Canada.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" the company says in its submission to the federal panel.</p><p>The idea of levelling the playing field is a fallacy, says Netflix, because Canadian broadcasters get a myriad of regulatory protections that are not afforded to foreign companies. That includes dedicated channels of distribution and simultaneous substitution rules allowing Canadian broadcasters to replace foreign advertising with their own.</p><p>\"Netflix is already a significant investor,\" through co-productions that reflect Canadian content policy, the streamer says in its submission to the federal panel. \"Requiring foreign online services to contribute to the CMF could generate problematic and discriminatory outcomes.\"</p><p>Mastin of the Canadian Media Producers Association says, perhaps a little frustratingly, that they have tried to work with Netflix on solutions in the past, but have come up empty.</p><p>\"We are ready to work with Netflix and other streaming services to find a solution that strikes the right balance - one that allows foreign streaming services to benefit from access to Canadian audiences, while also ensuring they contribute to the health of our domestic production sector. Unfortunately, Netflix has said 'No' to every proposed solution that's been put forward to them so far.\"</p><p>Netflix said a spokesperson was not available for comment to the Star, instead referring to the company's 30-page submission to the legislative review panel. One key assertion by Netflix is that it shouldn't come under the same rules for broadcasters. That's because Canadian regulators determined that audiovisual content over the internet was exempt from licensing and not subject to the same kinds of oversight as domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"Netflix does not consider online services to be broadcasters or encourage proposals that would regulate online services as broadcasters,\" it said. \"Regulation can risk undermining Canadian content's online success.\"</p><p>But ACTRA's Sparrow says if it walks like a duck, it is a duck.</p><p>\"Why are we fetishizing the internet as if it's different? It's a pipeline like any other. The internet is a bunch of cables that come to your home, just like the other guys and it should be regulated.\"</p><p>Not everyone is in agreement with the broadcasters. Law professor Michael Geist has been a staunch defender of the rights of digital streamers, saying they already make significant contributions without the need for additional regulation.</p><p>\"Calls to regulate due to so-called existential threats, level playing fields, or European models ring hollow against an evidence that points to remarkable Canadian cultural success story without new taxes or regulation,\" says Geist in a blog post.</p><p>Geist also chastised CBC president Catherine Tait, who controversially compared Netflix this year to a foreign occupying force with a colonializing effect on Canadian culture, saying her comments were \"wholly inappropriate.\"</p><p>Tait also said in earlier statements referring to the digital streamers that \"everybody's swimming in the same swimming pool. But some of the people aren't cleaning it up.\"</p><p>Those assertions don't sit well with Netflix. Canada, after all, was its first foreign market outside the U.S. The argument that \"Netflix benefits from the system without giving back\" is simply false, says the company. \"Revenues earned from our Canadian members contribute directly to our content spending,\" it says, adding Canada is one of its top three locations worldwide for original content production.</p><p>What worries Sparrow though, is not the present, but the future. The Canadian movie and TV industry is going through a remarkable growth spurt, buoyed by the era of peak television with more than 500 new dramas every year. For the first time in 2018, the number of new streaming shows surpassed the output of basic cable and broadcast networks. Cities such as Vancouver and Toronto have been major beneficiaries. And that number is poised to get bigger in the short term at least.</p><p>Toronto Mayor John Tory met with media companies in Los Angeles last week and tweeted that he is pushing hard for a piece of the $1 billion in spending on TV that Apple is expected to make in original content this year.</p><p>But Sparrow argues that the good times won't last forever.</p><p>\"The concept of peak TV means that this global boom will end, and we believe this will happen,\" says ACTRA. \"It is inevitable the global pace of English-language production will decline.\"</p><p>Other broadcasters, including FX CEO John Landgraf who coined the term peak television, arguing there were far too many series being produced, believes there will be consolidation in the market. When that happens, some believe production will inevitably slow. But that's why it's important to have regulatory safeguards in place, argues Sparrow.</p><p>\"It just makes sense you pay for the privilege of having access to Canadian homes and eyeballs.\"</p><p>That's up to future governments to decide. The legislative review panel will eventually make its final recommendations next year and it will be up to the sitting government to decide what direction to take. In the meantime, the existential battle over what constitutes Canadian broadcast culture and who should pay for it remains in the balance.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

I'm 100 per cent against a Netflix tax.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And by the way, his favourite show, if you didn't know, was Breaking Bad.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem? The new \"tax\" was never supported by any of the opposition parties in the first place. And there was an existing tax that wasn't being enforced. Digital services like Netflix never had to collect GST or relevant provincial sales taxes under current laws if they didn't have a substantial physical presence in Canada. It meant that consumers who subscribed to Netflix were required to submit that tax to the government themselves. Not many did.</p><p>That has, according to some estimates, resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue that would have gone into the Canadian economy over the years since Netflix first set up shop north of the border in 2010.</p><p>Harper's messaging worked. The incoming government of Justin Trudeau enthusiastically pledged there would never be a Netflix tax. And he has been true to his word, with no suggestion he will introduce one, even after the upcoming federal election. A report by the auditor general released last week says in 2017 alone, Ottawa lost $169 million in GST revenue because of its reluctance to force streaming companies to collect taxes.</p><p>\"It's absolutely weird to me that Justin Trudeau adopted a talking point from Harper and ran with it. It's so ironic that we have to pay GST on all the services we receive, but the one that's not collected is by a foreign service provider,\" says David Sparrow, national president of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA). \"This should have been a no-brainer. It makes sense that Netflix should collect the taxes like everybody else, but somehow it became this political football.\"</p><p>The ground is now shifting, although for some, not fast enough. At the beginning of this year, both Quebec and Saskatchewan introduced legislation requiring that provincial sales tax be collected on digital enterprises. Quebec expects to raise $154.5 million from that move over the next five years.</p><p>The two provinces are following a global trend that has seen regulators in Europe and Asia introduce tax and content requirements for online broadcasters.</p><p>So far there has been little movement at the federal level, although a legislative review panel headed by former Telus executive Janet Yale is currently hearing submissions looking into broadcasting and telecommunications laws, including the issue of taxation. An interim report is due in June. But final recommendations won't be ready until January 2020, well after the October election.</p><p>\"God help us if the new government ends up packing all that work in a box and shoving it under the bed,\" says Sparrow. \"Then we'd be back to square one.\"</p><p>Netflix Canada, meanwhile, says it is happy to comply with any government regulation and will collect taxes if requested to do so. But so far, the government hasn't required it to.</p><p>\"There was no agreement or special deal on taxation of any kind. We will comply with tax laws if and when they legally are extended to services like Netflix,\" says the company in a filing to the legislative review panel provided to the Star.</p><p>The federal Liberals did try to appease the critics: they unveiled an agreement in 2017 under then heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly that would see the streaming giant invest $500 million over five years in Canada, with an additional $25 million to develop French, Indigenous and female-focused content. Netflix also announced recently it would build a production hub in the Toronto Port Lands district, which it says will create an additional 1,850 jobs.</p><p>As a result, Netflix says it is on track to \"significantly exceed\" the $500 million originally promised. Netflix Canadian content co-productions have included the CBC's Anne with an E and Northern Rescue, Travellers with Corus, and Degrassi: Next Class with DHX Media.</p><p>However, the deal has been pilloried by critics who say Netflix would likely have spent that money in Canada anyway, with some detractors acting as if a naive Joly had given away the sacred cow of Canadian culture for a handful of magic beans. Netflix, after all, spent $12 billion in 2018 and analysts say it could spend up to $15 billion this year.</p><p>\"I think they were able to give M&amp;#233;lanie Joly a big flashy number she could put in a headline. But spending $100 million per year in Canada is not unrealistic given their global budget. They are here in Canada because of our excellent tax credits, our low Canadian dollar and talented artists,\" argues Sparrow. \"If conditions were to change, they would be somewhere else. We shouldn't delude ourselves into thinking they are doing this solely for our benefit.\"</p><p>The most vocal criticism from the industry has been that the government inadvertently created an unlevel playing field between powerful global technology companies and local broadcasters. Canadian firms such as Rogers, Bell and Corus are forced to collect the taxes, making their services comparatively more expensive than offerings by Netflix and making them less competitive.</p><p>Netflix is the largest, but not the only player in the game, of course. Founded in 1997 in Los Gatos, Calif., the subscription-based digital service has chipped away at the dominance of the cable broadcast model by giving consumers content whenever and wherever they want it. It has more than 148 million subscribers, with an estimated 6.7 million of them in Canada.</p><p>Other online producers include Amazon Prime Video, CBS All Access and Hulu. There is also a rash of upcoming players including Disney and AppleTV that will compete against budding domestic players in the same pool, such as Bell Media's Crave and CBC's Gem.</p><p>Another key issue separate from the collection of sales taxes, is that Netflix, unlike domestic cable companies, is not required to put 5 per cent of its gross revenue into the Canada Media Fund (CMF) to produce Canadian content.</p><p>\"Foreign streaming services must be required to contribute to the production of Canadian projects,\" says Reynolds Mastin, president and CEO of the Canadian Media Producers Association, the national trade body representing independent producers. \"They also need to ensure Canadian audiences can access this programming. How this will happen is up to debate, but we need government to make this a priority.\"</p><p>Other jurisdictions so far have provided something of a potential road map: The European Union in the fall of 2018 issued a directive that on-demand video services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video devote at least 30 per cent of their offerings to European content. They are also required to make a direct investment in content. In France, they are required to contribute 2 per cent of their revenues to fund French content. In Germany, that number is 2.5 per cent.</p><p>Netflix, however, says it would be unfair to pursue a similar path in Canada.</p><p>\"It would effectively force foreign online services to subsidize Canadian broadcasters,\" the company says in its submission to the federal panel.</p><p>The idea of levelling the playing field is a fallacy, says Netflix, because Canadian broadcasters get a myriad of regulatory protections that are not afforded to foreign companies. That includes dedicated channels of distribution and simultaneous substitution rules allowing Canadian broadcasters to replace foreign advertising with their own.</p><p>\"Netflix is already a significant investor,\" through co-productions that reflect Canadian content policy, the streamer says in its submission to the federal panel. \"Requiring foreign online services to contribute to the CMF could generate problematic and discriminatory outcomes.\"</p><p>Mastin of the Canadian Media Producers Association says, perhaps a little frustratingly, that they have tried to work with Netflix on solutions in the past, but have come up empty.</p><p>\"We are ready to work with Netflix and other streaming services to find a solution that strikes the right balance - one that allows foreign streaming services to benefit from access to Canadian audiences, while also ensuring they contribute to the health of our domestic production sector. Unfortunately, Netflix has said 'No' to every proposed solution that's been put forward to them so far.\"</p><p>Netflix said a spokesperson was not available for comment to the Star, instead referring to the company's 30-page submission to the legislative review panel. One key assertion by Netflix is that it shouldn't come under the same rules for broadcasters. That's because Canadian regulators determined that audiovisual content over the internet was exempt from licensing and not subject to the same kinds of oversight as domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"Netflix does not consider online services to be broadcasters or encourage proposals that would regulate online services as broadcasters,\" it said. \"Regulation can risk undermining Canadian content's online success.\"</p><p>But ACTRA's Sparrow says if it walks like a duck, it is a duck.</p><p>\"Why are we fetishizing the internet as if it's different? It's a pipeline like any other. The internet is a bunch of cables that come to your home, just like the other guys and it should be regulated.\"</p><p>Not everyone is in agreement with the broadcasters. Law professor Michael Geist has been a staunch defender of the rights of digital streamers, saying they already make significant contributions without the need for additional regulation.</p><p>\"Calls to regulate due to so-called existential threats, level playing fields, or European models ring hollow against an evidence that points to remarkable Canadian cultural success story without new taxes or regulation,\" says Geist in a blog post.</p><p>Geist also chastised CBC president Catherine Tait, who controversially compared Netflix this year to a foreign occupying force with a colonializing effect on Canadian culture, saying her comments were \"wholly inappropriate.\"</p><p>Tait also said in earlier statements referring to the digital streamers that \"everybody's swimming in the same swimming pool. But some of the people aren't cleaning it up.\"</p><p>Those assertions don't sit well with Netflix. Canada, after all, was its first foreign market outside the U.S. The argument that \"Netflix benefits from the system without giving back\" is simply false, says the company. \"Revenues earned from our Canadian members contribute directly to our content spending,\" it says, adding Canada is one of its top three locations worldwide for original content production.</p><p>What worries Sparrow though, is not the present, but the future. The Canadian movie and TV industry is going through a remarkable growth spurt, buoyed by the era of peak television with more than 500 new dramas every year. For the first time in 2018, the number of new streaming shows surpassed the output of basic cable and broadcast networks. Cities such as Vancouver and Toronto have been major beneficiaries. And that number is poised to get bigger in the short term at least.</p><p>Toronto Mayor John Tory met with media companies in Los Angeles last week and tweeted that he is pushing hard for a piece of the $1 billion in spending on TV that Apple is expected to make in original content this year.</p><p>But Sparrow argues that the good times won't last forever.</p><p>\"The concept of peak TV means that this global boom will end, and we believe this will happen,\" says ACTRA. \"It is inevitable the global pace of English-language production will decline.\"</p><p>Other broadcasters, including FX CEO John Landgraf who coined the term peak television, arguing there were far too many series being produced, believes there will be consolidation in the market. When that happens, some believe production will inevitably slow. But that's why it's important to have regulatory safeguards in place, argues Sparrow.</p><p>\"It just makes sense you pay for the privilege of having access to Canadian homes and eyeballs.\"</p><p>That's up to future governments to decide. The legislative review panel will eventually make its final recommendations next year and it will be up to the sitting government to decide what direction to take. In the meantime, the existential battle over what constitutes Canadian broadcast culture and who should pay for it remains in the balance.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

And then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive. It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed to create addiction and manipulate our behavior, told by some of the very people who supervised the systems at places like Facebook, Google and Twitter. Tim Kendall, a former president of Pinterest, admitted that years ago he couldn't get off his phone even when he came home, despite having two young kids. </p><p>\"I am going to work during the day and building something that then I'm falling prey to,\" he says in the film. \"I couldn't help myself.\" The documentary is a well paced, absorbing look at the deep costs of Big Tech \u2014 fake news, election security concerns, radicalization, polarization and much more. Only in trying to dramatize those costs does it slip up badly. Director Jeff Orlowski interviews former tech execs, historians and social scientists, but apparently doesn't trust them enough to tell the story. So he also employs a gimmicky family of five actors \u2014 two parents, three teens \u2014 to dramatize the lure of social media in a clunky way. Worse, he also employs an actor \u2014 a weirdly cast Vincent Kartheiser of \"Mad Men\" fame \u2014 to pretend to act like the computer software, sending alluring phone alerts from a console to one of the teens and cuing up videos he knows will be clickbait, while ominous music plays. \"Yes, perfect,\" Kartheiser purrs after sending a video of epic skateboard fails to the teen. \"He's primed for an ad!\" Later: \"Don't show him any more sports updates. He doesn't engage.\" But we know \u2014 from the very talking heads \u2014 that this is an algorithm with no agency other than its program. Why humanize code? And why humanize code by portraying it as a sleazy middle-aged man who acts like a mid-level officer in \"Minority Report\"? The film then steps on itself. When one of the fake teens falls for a fake online conspiracy and attends a fake demonstration, it's juxtaposed against real footage of real violence and real demonstrations, muddying the water between fake and real \u2014 a terrible decision given what this film is about. Orlowski would have done better interviewing real teens buffeted by social media and real people caught up in conspiracies. Insulting our intelligence about artificial intelligence is not the way to go. The silly dramatizations mar an otherwise excellent documentary that shows how so many Silicon Valley leaders designed ways to keep us engaged online and that led to such things as Pizzagate, international destabilization, higher suicide rates in young people and a boom in depression. The film reveals much more than why you go from Googling the best sofa one minute to finding sofa ads on your Facebook stream the next. That so much online seems free is part of the trap: It's our private data that's being sold. As Aza Raskin, former Firefox and Mozilla Lab worker, says: \"Advertisers are the customers. We're the thing being sold.\" The film nicely delves into how algorithms that seek to maximize advertising revenue tap into psychology to keep us addicted to our screens. Did a friend just tag me? I got an alert! Hey, Facebook just invited me to an event. Those are all \"positive intermittent reinforcements,\" and they keep us checking our phone for more, like a gambler hoping for a windfall at a Vegas slot machine. Whether or not these techniques were actively employed, stumbled upon or just a byproduct of a user-engagement model is a little murky. The film offers all sides as to whether software makers consciously exploit human vulnerabilities: The guy who helped create the \"like\" button for Facebook says he wanted to spread love in the world, but a former Facebook executive admits purposely creating dopamine-driven feedback loops. If there is a hero here it is portrayed by Tristan Harris, an ex-Google executive who is now co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, and who hopes to change the system. He and critics like Jaron Lanier, author of \"Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,\" explain what the possible consequences are if we continue using our individual digital pacifiers \u2014 lots of cat videos, yes, and also civil war. Stick around after the film is over to hear lots of recommendations from former tech leaders who built the mess we're in: They turn off their notifications. They delete many apps. They urge regulation. They don't let their kids use social media. Think about that.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>This image released by Netflix shows Skyler Gisondo in a scene from \"The Social Dilemma.\" (Netflix via AP) Courtesy of Netflix \"The Social Dilemma\" on Netflix explores the ways social media lures and rewards users.

This is First Move and here's your need to know. A bad day at the office. Netflix shares drop premarket as it loses \"Friends\" and U.S. subscribers. Getting old. A face app backlash as users realize it's owned by Russians. And coming up, our exclusive interview with St. Louis Fed President, Jim Bullard. It's Thursday, let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A warm welcome to FIRST MOVE once again. Very excited as I mentioned about our exclusive interview with Jim Bullard. The St. Louis Fed President, that's coming up, but first a quick look at what we're seeing for the markets right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are set to lose a bit of ground here premarket it seems, but set for a mostly flat open, not all bad though. Manufacturing bellwether Honeywell and insurer, United Health raising their earnings guidance today. So, watch those ones and Morgan Stanley beating estimates on the top and the bottom lines. Thank you to a strong wealth management performance offsetting what we've seen, a lot of already equity trading revenue weakness.</p><p>But I do think it's poor numbers from Germany's SAP that's helping set the tone here. Trade uncertainty, they say, hitting their Asia business and on that point, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying that China's Huawei is not the sticking point in the current trade talks despite the front page of \"The Wall Street Journal\" today. It seems deal making, things are never just that simple.</p><p>Now, speaking of not simple, Netflix stock looking pretty challenged premarket and that's where we're going to begin drivers. As I mentioned, Netflix shares plummeting premarket, down some 10.5 percent right now, adding far fewer subscribers than promised; 2.7 million versus five million expected.</p><p>Frank Pallotta joins us now on these numbers. Frank, first thing, someone in the forecasting department needs firing based on those numbers. But they said look, this is not about competition. It was about content. What do we make of these numbers?</p><p>FRANK PALLOTTA, CNN BUSINESS MEDIA WRITER: Well, they're not good. I mean, this is probably their -- one of their worst forecast misses since 2016, and to really think about this, the question that everyone in Hollywood is really asking is, was this just a really bad quarter and a bad forecast miss? Or is this the sign of bad times to come for Netflix?</p><p>You've got to remember, in the coming year, they're going to see huge competition coming from Disney Plus, HBO Max, which is WarnerMedia, the owner of CNN's streaming service, Apple and others, not to mention the Hulu's of the world that are already out there.</p><p>So, this is kind of showing that they are kind of in a bad place. But we just don't know yet if this is the sign of things to come.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, the other point is, I mean, they raised prices in the quarter, too. So, there's a sense here that we are now getting to the point where it looks expensive. Potentially, when you've got Disney Plus coming at half the price in November of this year, I wonder, whether it's a question about the model itself and whether this also raises questions for some of the others coming from market hereto, Frank, not just about Netflix themselves.</p><p>PALLOTTA: It definitely could be. I mean, Netflix really put the blame on its content, saying that the Q2 content they had come out just did not bring in the type of subscribers that they anticipated.</p><p>They said that the second half of their year is full of just big hits, like \"The Crown,\" \"Orange is the New Black,\" and even like the third quarter started off with \"Stranger Things 3,\" which is a huge, massive hit for them.</p><p>But it could have a lot to do with the price, too, because they said the regions where the price increases happened is where they really saw the forecast miss. So, it it's going to be interesting to see the next year for Netflix and for all of streaming to see how consumers really take hold of this brand new world and market of over the top products, I should say.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, have we hit peak pricing giving all the competition. Frank Pallotta, thank you so much for joining us on that. All right, let's move on and talk SAP because that was also under a lot of pressure in the European session. They reported a 21 percent decline in operating profits due to restructuring, but it was the Asia business, the software sales that actually drew my attention.</p><p>Clare Sebastian joins us now on this. Clare, talk me through it. Because the CEO was saying, look, they are in wait and see mode over there, of course due to the trade tensions.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, the earnings call is going on right now. Actually, that's exactly the message from the CEO, Bill McDermott. He basically said in his exact words, \"Don't worry about it.\" He called his minor headwinds. And he pointed out that the quarter ended on June 30, which was the day after the Trump-Xi meeting at the G20, which of course when they agree to keep talking and hold off new tariffs.</p><p>[09:05:06] SEBASTIAN: And he said after that, many of the deals that have been postponed started to come back. He also pointed out that his companies started to make operational changes because of this trade war. Things like moving supply chains.</p><p>Sometimes the value of the deals they do with SAP actually goes up because they need even more help. So he is basically making the point that this is just a blip. It's just a short term issue.</p><p>But I think you know, it really shows just how far and wide this trade war is trickling through the economy. This isn't a Chinese or American company and this isn't even direct impact, Julia. This isn't something like, you know, costs going up because of tariffs.</p><p>This shows the effect of uncertainty and how much that is trickling down at some of the world's major companies.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and this is also a company that's pushing into Cloud, it's pushing more into software services. I mentioned the restructuring under the watchful eye, of course of Elliott Management. So, they've got a lot going on right now, anyway.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: They do, certainly. They are restructuring. They said today is going to cost about a billion that's causing some layoffs. They are moving more into the Cloud. They acquired the online software survey firm Qualtrics earlier this year, for about $8 billion and that is certainly where we see a lot of companies positioning themselves nowadays.</p><p>I think the issue that we see and why we see the stock down today is that whatever SAP is doing, it doesn't change the fact that they're still vulnerable to these macro headwinds -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, Clare Sebastian. Thank you for that. All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that are making headlines around the world.</p><p>A suspected arson attack on an animation studio in Kyoto, Japan has killed at least 25 people and injured 36 others. Police say a man poured what appeared to be gasoline around the building and set it on fire. They say the 41-year-old suspect in the attack has been detained and that he was also carrying several knives in a backpack.</p><p>The World Health Organization is now calling the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo a public health emergency of international concern. There has been more than 2,500 Ebola cases and 1,600 deaths since the outbreak started last August.</p><p>Iranian forces have seized a vessel carrying what Iran says was smuggled fuel. That's according to Iranian media which reported the seizure took place in the Persian Gulf. The reports did not identify the temple or its owner, but they did say 12 people were aboard.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but coming up as I've mentioned, our exclusive interview with voting Fed member, Jim Bullard. Stay with us. That's coming up.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. The U.S. Federal Reserve faces a momentous decision later this month. The Fed's open market committee will vote on whether to cut interest rates for the first time in over a decade.</p><p>One of the officials in the room in making that decision will be Jim Bullard. He is the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. He is one of the Fed's most influential members who urged the Central Bank to make its so-called insurance rate cut at the last meeting in June and Jim Bullard joins me now. Great to have you with us.</p><p>JAMES BULLARD, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST. LOUIS: Great to be here, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Has anything changed in your thinking or are you still thinking a quarter point rate cut in July is the right move?</p><p>BULLARD: Well, I said we should have got it in June, so, now I think we should ratify the signals that we've sent that we're going to follow through in July.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What about half a percentage point cut?</p><p>BULLARD: I don't think we really need to go that far at this point, but we can make further moves as we go through the fall. We'll see how the data come in. We could be data dependent on that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, a lot of analysts out there and the market itself is pricing three rate cuts for this year. You suggested perhaps one insurance rate cut in July, another one towards the back end of the year. The market is a bit overenthusiastic?</p><p>BULLARD: I mean, you know these things always depend on the data, but I think the critical thing here is to get inflation and inflation expectations better centered on our two percent inflation target. Credibility is very important. We've missed our inflation target on the low side for many years.</p><p>The economy has actually surprised on the upside during 2017 and 2018 and yet we still haven't been able to get inflation to two percent. So, I think it's a good opportunity to try to hit that target and then come what may later and we can react to data later.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So if it needs to be three cuts, so be it? If you're simply trying to get that inflation target more centered, three, four, whatever it takes?</p><p>BULLARD: Well, let's not get carried away. Let's move at the July meeting and then let's be data dependent from there and see how things go.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But as you're looking at the data right now, it only justifies two to the end of the year in your mind?</p><p>BULLARD: Yes, I mean economic forecasting is not -- not the most exact of sciences. So, if I was just penciling it in, that's what I would guess but we'll see as the data come in.</p><p>I think, you know another aspect about moving now is you have some insurance against further deterioration in the economy. The economy is slowing down, which isn't a terrible thing at three percent growth year- over-year as of the end of the first quarter.</p><p>But most forecasters have about two percent growth in the second quarter and depending on who you look at, maybe less than two percent in the second half. I think that wouldn't be the end of the world, but what if it slows down more than we think, possibly because of the trade war. This would provide a little bit of insurance against that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: To those that say you're stimulating stock market prices, we're trading around record highs, that you're acting too early, the Federal Reserve here with these insurance as you -- as you keep referring to them. What's your message?</p><p>BULLARD: Well, I mean we want the U.S. economy to perform well. We want great employment outcomes; we're getting those. And we also want inflation to be right around our two percent target. We're missing a little bit on the low side there, so we could re-center there. But overall, if that increases the value of the U.S. corporate sector, you know, that's part of the game.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Can recession be avoided if you act like this with insurance rate cuts?</p><p>BULLARD: You know, one thing about recession is recession predictor models are pretty high probability right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>BULLARD: A lot of those are based on yield curve arguments and the yield curve is inverted at -- parts of it are inverted right now. So, one thing I would like to do is kind of straighten out the yield curve, have a nice upward slope - kind of a natural slope to the yield curve.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And then we'll have a better reflection of the recession risks?</p><p>BULLARD: I think it would bring the Fed more in line with markets about where markets think medium term growth is and medium term inflation and where the Fed thinks it is.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, those that are saying recession risk is high or at least we could see recession right now in 2020 perhaps based on the yield curve measures is getting it wrong.</p><p>BULLARD: Yes, it's kind of hard to believe recession risk is really high right now because look at the job market, look at everything. But the yield curve is saying that, but I think if we -- if we make a cut here and maybe a little more later in the year, then we'll get a nice upward sloping yield curve, that's right.</p><p>[09:15:07] CHATTERLEY: Jay Powell was asked recently, and this is to your point on struggling with that inflation target, whether the Phillips curve relationship is dead, i.e. the connection, the relationship between unemployment and inflation. And he said there's a faint heartbeat.</p><p>BULLARD: Yes, if you look at the empirical evidence, it's gotten weaker and weaker. I think that's actually what he said, weaker and weaker over time. And there are good reasons to think that that -- you know, why that has occurred, I think it's basically the inflation targeting era means that central banks have paid a lot more attention to hitting their inflation targets.</p><p>If they get perfect - if they hit the inflation target perfectly, then inflation never moves even though the real economy is bouncing around, you wouldn't see any relationships. So, I think we can't just take the Phillips curve as an iron law that you know, when unemployment goes down, inflation goes up. You can't treat it that way, it's more subtle than that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is it subtle enough to say that the relationship is dead, that the Phillips curve is dead here? It's not just about not really feeling the heartbeat here that the patient has died?</p><p>BULLARD: I think the way to think about it is that the Philips curve interacts with the policymaker and if the policymaker offsets the effects coming from the Phillips curve, then you're not going to see any relationship. It doesn't mean that it's not there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It doesn't mean the patient is dead.</p><p>BULLARD: That's right. Sorry -- so I -- this is a deep issue and it's been discussed in macroeconomics for decades now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and we'll continue to discuss it.</p><p>BULLARD: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We're not writing it off at this stage. What do you say to savers at the moment who rely --</p><p>BULLARD: Sorry?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: To savers.</p><p>BULLARD: Oh, savers.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: To U.S. savers. I'm not sure we've asked this enough as we talk about bringing rates down and those that rely on that income from their deposits.</p><p>BULLARD: Yes, I would say people now coming into retirement are probably projecting lower returns than they would have, let's say in the `90s or something like that. So I --there has been some adjustment.</p><p>This low rate environment has been going on now for a decade in the U.S. and longer than that in Japan. So, it's definitely a new era and I think anybody that's saving for retirement should take everything into account as far as the global rate structure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: One of the interesting things -- and you mentioned Japan there, and you've long been talking about the risks of a Japan-ification of the United States. Is whether you do a similar policy to Japan and target a specific yield level to try and anchor the yield curve, to save you perhaps having to cut rates or move around such a degree. Are you having that conversation?</p><p>BULLARD: Well we are having a framework review and that would definitely be one of the policies that could be considered in this framework review.</p><p>We had a conference in Chicago. There's another earlier conference at Stanford on this. There are other conferences around the country and there are more to come. So, it's one of the things that could be looked at.</p><p>The U.S. did target longer term yields in the `40s during World War II, you could argue about that, but it actually ended up badly with a lot of inflation. But you could argue about whether that's really relevant -- the relevant example.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Times are very different now.</p><p>BULLARD: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's talk about trade. You mentioned the trade war and the risks this presents. We have the two things. We have a decision by the United States government to sign or not sign a trade deal with China.</p><p>We also have a President that's very eager to see rates lower. And there are those that look at this situation and say there's a moral hazard problem. The President could hold off signing a trade deal, allow the Federal Reserve to cut rates two or three times and then sign a trade deal. And that big risk then goes away. What's the problem?</p><p>BULLARD: My assessment is that trade uncertainty used to be relatively low, this used to be an issue that was relatively speaking on the backburner. The President has moved it to the front burner. Now, I think trade uncertainty is high and I don't see that uncertainty declining any time soon.</p><p>And I think other countries are getting into the game. They're wondering about their own trade relationships, they're wondering if they could get better deals or renegotiate. So I think we're in for a long period of higher trade uncertainty than what we're used to and it's not just the U.S., but obviously something like Brexit or other things around the world, I think the Chinese are rethinking their trade policies.</p><p>So, I think we're just going to have to cope with the idea that this is going to be a volatile area of policy, at least over the forecast horizon and maybe even much longer than that, whereas previously we kind of thought of this as okay, that was something that was decided via the post-war trade liberalization program.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Just to be clear, you're not anticipating a trade deal between the United States and China any time this year?</p><p>[09:20:10] BULLARD: Well, I think they could come to a nominal deal, but things could come up later that then, you know, provoke more uncertainty around that. So, I just think that countries are reconsidering what they're trade relationships are and I think that for investors that just means, well, you've got to -- you've got to be ready that trade relationships might change on a dime.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I think investors are more optimistic than you right now.</p><p>BULLARD: I think the story that you're going to all of a sudden reach a deal with China and then we're not going to hear anything more about trade over the next five years, I think that's a fantasy. These articles have -- these ideas have been brought out of the box and now we're going to have to wrestle with them and they're difficult to solve.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's talk about new Fed members -- potential Fed members joining. There's a concern out there that the nominations are people that are aligned with this White House, with the President on cutting rates for other things; if he changes his mind so will they. Are you worried about the dilution of the independence of the Fed?</p><p>BULLARD: Well, one of the potential nominees is my research director, Chris Waller.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>BULLARD: He was a chaired professor at Notre Dame then he came to work at the Fed. He has long experience on the FOMC, a long research record. A lot of his research is all about Fed independence; about half of his papers are about Fed independence, so he is actually a world expert on that. And I think he would be a very good person to put very much in the tradition of the technocratic appointments that we put at the Fed historically.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's talk about Judy Shelton then. Is she a good choice?</p><p>BULLARD: I don't know Judy Shelton as well. I have met her. I met her at a conference in Paris last year. I thought she was quite articulate, but she'll have to defend her own views. She's very capable of doing that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'm going to agree with you.</p><p>BULLARD: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: She did though say in the last year that she favors re-pegging the U.S. dollar to the gold standard. Is that a good idea?</p><p>BULLARD: The gold standard -- you know the U.S. did have a gold standard at one time.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And it was very messy.</p><p>BULLARD: And then we really didn't fully get off gold until Nixon in the early 1970s. So, there is a literature that talks about gold and the pluses and minuses.</p><p>I've said publicly before that I felt inflation targeting was the modern incarnation of the gold standard because what you're doing is putting some discipline around the future issuance of the currency and this is stabilizing the inflation outcomes compared to what you would otherwise get which is exactly what you would be trying to do under the gold standard.</p><p>But with gold, you've got mining and you know, how much gold are you going to find? And these kinds of issues and in some cases, it didn't work out well internationally.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Would you agree that it's inconsistent of someone to want to peg the U.S. dollar to gold but also be wanting to cut rates? You're trying to enforce a level of discipline on the one hand and then trying to push for lower rates on the other.</p><p>BULLARD: Yes, I mean I don't know. We don't have much inflation today. So, my idea is set the inflation target, manage to it and hit it. It's the credibility of the Central Bank that is really the critical variable here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It sounds like you two could have some lively discussions going forward. All right, let's talk about the U.S. dollar because this is something else.</p><p>BULLARD: I mean I would say this about this whole issue. A lot to of this was discussed in the 1970s when inflation was high and variable. That would be the natural time to talk about commodity standards and people did talk about commodity standards.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:Yes.</p><p>BULLARD: And the outcome of that debate was to not go to a commodity standard but try to get the Central Bank to do what they're supposed to do; that was the Volcker disinflation. And then since then, certainly since 1995 or so, inflation really has been pretty close to two percent the whole time.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I'll call it inconsistent. All right, let's talk about the U.S. dollar because this is something else that the President has said he would like, a weaker U.S. dollar and we've also seen currency intervention from the Treasury in the past, too. The Fed may not have liked it, but they went hand in hand with it. What's the likelihood that we see a call from this White House for direct intervention to weaken the dollar and would the Fed stand by and go with it?</p><p>BULLARD: The academic literature on this says it's very hard to intervene and have much impact on the dollar, especially for very thickly traded markets like dollar/yen or dollar/euro.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But if the White House said, look, we're abandoning our strong dollar policy outright, that would have an impact.</p><p>[09:20:02] BULLARD: It's very hard to have an impact and the other thing about exchange rates is it depends what the other guy is doing. So it's a relative game where the other country might be trying to do the same thing and then nothing happens to the exchange rate. I think, you know, this idea of competitive devaluation which is something that happened in the `30s is probably not something we want to get into.</p><p>We want to run a great policy for the U.S., get great innovation, use the great technology we have, use the workforce that we have, that's how you have a great economy. I don't think you can depreciate your way to success.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Very quickly because we've got one minute left, your views on Facebook Libra, the cryptocurrency alternative, future alternative to the dollar, a big threat?</p><p>BULLARD: I'm actually going to talk this in a day or two at a conference on cryptocurrency, my session is on cryptocurrency, so I'll have some good comments about that there, I hope.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Can you give us a teaser, for or against?</p><p>BULLARD: Well, this is -- what I've said about this in the past is that there are ideas for monetary theory and then there are ideas that the computer science guys have. They don't always match very well. So that's mostly what my topic is about.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you're not a fan at this stage?</p><p>BULLARD: I don't think that cryptocurrency really solves any fundamental problems that are natural to any currency and some of the other points are there's a lot of currency competition already, so you bring another currency in, it doesn't really make any difference.</p><p>There's always an equilibrium where no one wants to hold the currency, most of the cryptocurrencies are in that equilibrium today. They're worth zero. So, these are some of the things that I like to bring up.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Are you on Facebook?</p><p>BULLARD: I am not on Facebook. Corporately, we're on Facebook, yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We won't go there. Jim, fantastic to have you.</p><p>BULLARD: All right great to have you -- great to be here, yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Jim Bullard there, President of the St. Louis Fed. The market open is next.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE, live from the New York Stock Exchange. Wow, the screaming and shouting this morning is pretty loud. Stocks right now are opening a little bit lower. I think investors reacting to the latest one of earnings, weaker from the likes of SAP as we've mentioned. Netflix, of course, too, and a bit of softness as a result of Morgan Stanley's numbers as well. The liner again, equity trading, the trading divisions of all these banks this week have been weaker.</p><p>We also just bought to our exclusive interview with Jim Bullard, of course the President of the St. Louis Federal Reserve confirming, he is still of course pushing for a rate cut in July. He doesn't think that during half a percent cut at this stage in that July meeting is right. But he did say of course, that he thinks two this year will be enough.</p><p>I tried to push him on current market pricing three, he wouldn't be pushed, but interesting for me, I think on trade when he said, look, as far as the Fed is concerned, trade risks, trade uncertainty is not going away even if there's some kind of nominal deal between China and the United States. The risks around trade, even with other countries remains and there's still going to be tensions between these two countries. Interesting.</p><p>Let's bring in Greg Valliere now. He is Chief U.S. policy strategist to AGF Investments. Greg, always a pleasure to have you on the show. Interesting to hear what Jim Bullard said there in light of Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary's comments today, same talks are going to happen between the U.S. and China, but the rumor is they are really struggling here.</p><p>GREG VALLIERE, CHIEF U.S. POLICY STRATEGIST, AGF INVESTMENTS: Yes, Julia, I think there are a lot of unresolved issues. But one of the takeaways from your interview with Bullard is that the Fed I think recognizes this. And it's not just China. We haven't ratified the replacement for NAFTA. And there's still a threat of a trade with Western Europe that would involve hundreds and maybe even thousands of products from the two countries. So, there's definitely still a trade risk that the Fed has to worry about.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What about the prospects of some kind of agreement over the spending bill, the debt ceiling raised as well, because he hinted that at least at the top line, they've reached some kind of agreement here. What are you thinking on that?</p><p>VALLIERE: Yes, I do think that Pelosi and Mnunchin have made progress. There could be an announcement in the next 24 hours, the markets will be watching this carefully. But this could slip.</p><p>So much stuff in Washington slips until you absolutely have to do something. And they probably don't absolutely have to do something until early September. So I'm not a hundred percent convinced we will get a deal. And moreover, I'm not convinced that Trump is on board with any deal that has Nancy Pelosi's fingerprints all over it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What's in the President's best interest here on both these things, as you said, if it looks like Nancy Pelosi manages to get all sorts of spending measures passed here, he looks like he's given excessive ground even on the trade front here. This is somewhere where both the Democrats and the Republicans are united in pushing back on China here. What works best for the president here in campaign mode for 2020?</p><p>VALLIERE: Let me offer a theory. I think in the last few days, he has been so aggressive, playing the race card, you saw the rally last night in North Carolina, his base loves it. So, he has now solidified his base. There's nothing he could do to drive them away.</p><p>Now that gives them a little wiggle room to maybe cut a deal with China, to maybe cut a deal that increases spending. The base won't like it. But I think he's got the base firmly in his pocket now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, a lot of people looked at those tweets over the weekend, we've seen back and forth. I am talking about their perceived racist tweets towards the four nonwhite Congresswomen, of course, and people were like, wow, this is going to be incredibly toxic.</p><p>And then you see as you've mentioned the crowds last night saying, \"Send her home.\" In the end, has he turned what was a battle between the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi and the squad into something positive for him?</p><p>VALLIERE: Well, he's unified the Democrats, but he's also labeled the Democrats as the party of those four women. And I think that that's his goal. He wants to make it sound as if all the Democrats are like that.</p><p>I've talked to a lot of moderate Democrats this week in Washington, who weren't happy with the four women because they now are so inextricably linked to them. That's Trump's goal all along.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So basically, we found Nancy Pelosi backing four individuals that previously she was sort of saying, \"Guys look, get back in your box, and actually, at certain points your views are extreme, and they don't represent the whole,\" and now she is finding yourself aligned with them. In fact, the whole party is.</p><p>VALLIERE: That's part of it. But I tell you to you, Julia, Trump is going to need Pelosi in the next couple of months on the debt ceiling, on getting a new budget, on lifting spending calves. There are a lot of crucial issues where conservative House Republicans may not go along, and he is going to need votes from her troops. That's going to be fun to watch.</p><p>[09:35:16] CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, you sent out a note this week listing all the things that this government has not managed to achieve. No infrastructure bill, no trade deal, no healthcare bill, no labor reforms. I mean, there was a whole list.</p><p>And I have to say at the end of that, I did think what have we achieved? And also where is this Congress aligned, and one of them in particular was on Jay Powell. Everybody thinks that Jay Powell is the good guy and the right person for the job here.</p><p>Ultimately, what matters for investors here and can the Federal Reserve remain independent, follow through on policy and can that also play to Trump's policies and his campaign in 2020, too?</p><p>VALLIERE: It's a huge while card. Obviously, Jim Bullard was not going to talk explicitly about fears that the Fed concerning Powell and Trump, but I have talked to people at the Fed who worry that Trump may try to not fire Powell, but demote him from Chairman to a mere governor.</p><p>Trump apparently thinks he has the legal authority to do that. And I tell you, Julia, if the Fed cuts rates twice in the second half, or even three times in the second half, it won't be enough for Trump. And at some point next year, maybe the end of the winter, I think the option of demoting Powell is still going to be very much on the plate.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. Greg, you said it. No doubt, we'll talk about this more. Greg Valliere, always a pleasure to have you on FIRST MOVE. Thank you.</p><p>All right, let's move on. Morgan Stanley, as I've mentioned, earnings, beating expectations in the second quarter stack. Thank you to the strength in the wealth management business. We're also keeping an eye on a BB&amp;T, of course reporting record earnings in the second quarter for the mixed earnings picture for their major partner, Sun Trust.</p><p>Matt Egan joins us now with all the details. Matt, let's talk about Morgan Stanley first, your observations here.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: Julia, what I think is really interesting is that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are really moving in opposite direction when it comes to trading at least in the second quarter.</p><p>Now, Goldman had reported earlier this week an increase in equity trading revenue, which really bucked the broader trend that we've seen, and my eyebrows were raised when Goldman said that it may have picked up some market share. And now it looks like perhaps Morgan Stanley lost some ground to its arch rival because Morgan reported a 14 percent decline in equity trading revenue. That is among the worst that we've seen from any of the big banks surpassing even what we saw from Bank of America yesterday.</p><p>And you know, the company blamed lower balances from clients. Now, fixed income trading revenue was down even more, it was off by 18 percent. They blame shrinking rates, lower volatility, lower structured financial products.</p><p>And you know, during the conference call CEO James Gorman, he talked about how in the second quarter, it was met with a mixed market backdrop. He said the quarter began on a strong footing, but macroeconomic and political uncertainties affected sentiment.</p><p>Now clearly, you know, trading businesses under pressure, we're talking about low volatility, the rise of active trading. The bright spot for Morgan Stanley, as you mentioned though was wealth management, it unexpectedly grew revenue during the quarter. It posts the record pretax income, and a lot of that obviously has to do with the stock market boom.</p><p>So clearly, Morgan Stanley is not firing on all cylinders right now -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such a great interesting point about the divergence in approach and performance here particularly for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley here. I'll tell you what my takeaway, and we've talked about this is the strength in the U.S. consumer. You want to be facing the U.S. consumers of bank in the United States at this moment.</p><p>And it seems like it's the same story for BB&amp;T because again, loan growth here was a real strong point.</p><p>EGAN: Absolutely. So BB&amp;T and Sun Trust, both reported some solid numbers. Now, these are, of course, the regional banks, they're joining forces in a new mega regional bank that will be called Truist. I like to joke that that is the banking industry's answer to Trump as far as naming goes.</p><p>But another interesting point despite like -- on top of the fact that you know, these regional banks are enjoying strong loan growth and deposit growth. They are under pressure from the Federal Reserve and interest rates though, because both of these regional banks this morning reported to clients in net interest margins, both from the first quarter and also year- over-year.</p><p>And you know, as your interview earlier this morning suggested that this is going to continue to be a problem for banks as the Federal Reserve appears to be moving close to lowering interest rates -- Julia.</p><p>[09:40:10] CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that update there. All right, we're going to take a quick move -- quick break here on the FIRST MOVE. Get my words up, but coming up, plenty of stranger things here, in fact, Netflix earnings were a bit of a horror show, I think for investors, all the details and some analysis, next.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a quick look at our global movers today. As you can see eBay trading higher buy some 70.2 percent, second quarter profit and revenues beating estimates.</p><p>The company attracted more customers by making its platform easier to use. We saw net income fall into $400 million, down though from that $600 million last year.</p><p>IBM higher by some 2.3 percent. Income beating estimates and the company maintaining its full year outlook. IBM's Cloud division also jumped five percent on more than $5 billion dollars of revenues. However the overall revenue fell for the fourth quarter in a row.</p><p>What about Netflix though? They are down 10 percent. Right now, the online streaming giant posting a rare miss in subscriber growth. They have added just 2.7 million new subscribers in the second quarter, about half at the five million analysts expected. Netflix also lost some 120,000 U.S. subscribers. It expected to gain 350,000.</p><p>The company says it's expecting to have a strong third quarter. Daniel Ives is Managing Director at investment firm, Wedbush Securities. Always a pleasure, Dan.</p><p>DANIEL IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: Great to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What about Netflix? I said earlier on the show, sack the forecasting department. I mean that was a huge risk.</p><p>IVES: Yes, this is a gut punch for the bulls. I mean, if you look at that subscriber miss, that's one of the worst you've seen in a few years. And it's also as you feel like the walls are caving in a bit with Disney and Iger, as well as Apple and Cook starting to focus on streaming.</p><p>So, I think right now becomes a prove-me story going the second half and this is a silver bullet at least against the bulls.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, to your point and actually Netflix said this, they said look, this was not about competition. This was just about not having the right content mix in the quarter, but we know they've also been increasing prices.</p><p>[09:45:10] CHATTERLEY: And in a zero -- near zero inflation world, a 20 percent price rise feels like a lot at this moment. And perhaps, you know, subscribers are telling you that.</p><p>IVES: Yes, and I think that's really been the balancing act, and they might have sort of right now, a bit of a risk in terms of where they've priced this. And I think you're seeing consumer, especially in the U.S., you know, bit of a backlash there, especially in Disney and others are going to undercut them, including Apple from a pricing perspective.</p><p>For the first time in many, many years, they have a target on their back and it seems like it is working.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, Disney is going to come in November, and it is half the price that they're charging right now. But my question here is, is this a warning shot for all of these guys? Are we at a point where we're starting to see some degree of saturation for streaming? I mean, how many of these different subscriptions ultimately are you going to take home here?</p><p>IVES: Yes, there's a lot of kids in the sandbox right now in terms of overall streaming. And I think you're starting to see a lot of consumers, remember, on average, paying for two, potentially three. And I think now you're seeing a tipping point.</p><p>And I think going into next year, you'll see some of the weaker hands sort of play out. You could see consolidation, but it comes down to for the first time Netflix really has some competition and is facing some headwinds.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Now, I can't get you on without talking Big Tech in general and what we saw in front of Congress this week, whether it was tackling Amazon on its sort of dual role of host to sellers, but also a seller itself, but also Facebook, of course. So, where do you want to go first?</p><p>IVES: Look, I think there was a lot of grandstanding, which we expected of Facebook. You don't expect too many candlelight dinners between Zuckerberg and from Congressmen and women, and I think that's the issue right now.</p><p>You know, that's a glass half empty view of Facebook for good reason. And you look at Libra, you know, they are on the offensive instead of the defensive. You expected that. Now, the question is, what are their hurdles to ultimately get Libra to a green light situation?</p><p>Amazon, in our opinion, this is the first step to a broader antitrust view of them. We continue to think bark is worse than bite. But right now, the street is taking more of a focus of this issue, especially going into the 2020 elections.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's talk about Facebook again there because you've mentioned Libra, and that's the cryptocurrency. And we've focused entirely on that this week. What about Calibra, which is the payment system that they're talking about developing attached to Facebook?</p><p>For me, that could be incredibly powerful, and actually, the crypto part of it is a bit of a distraction.</p><p>IVES: Well, you're right. I think crypto is getting a lot of the focus. But when you've got Calibra from a monetization engine that really could be a successful initiative with not as much regulatory issues. It's about how do you monetize those few billion users, they might have figured out the formula.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, appetizers. You can click through, potentially, as you're on Facebook and buy something from there. That's got huge money potential.</p><p>Very quickly, Microsoft, after the bounce today, what are we thinking on this one?</p><p>IVES: I mean, look, Nadella will continue with the golden touch in Cloud. It is two oars raised M&amp;Ms, and we think Microsoft is gaining net share in Cloud, expect another strong quarter. And that's why you're seeing more and more of a rerating in the stock. Especially as more investor are trying to play the Cloud theme.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I've got to ask you about Tesla because that's coming up next week while I have you. We were talking earlier this week about the shifts in pricing, the juggling of pricing, and it happens so often. What are your thoughts on this one, they're trying everything.</p><p>IVES: They're trying everything to stimulate demand. 2Q obviously is a step in the right direction. The issue continues to be second half numbers. We think they're going to have to rip the Band-Aid off and lower their guidance for the year again, and then it comes down to how can they do this profitably? That's going to be the focus of the street in terms of profitability in 3Q and 4Q. That's where right now Musk and Tesla need to prove to investors.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, watch this space. Dan, we'll get you back next week to talk about it. Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities, thank you.</p><p>IVES: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Always great to get you on. All right. Coming up on the show, fun app or Russian hack? We will discuss the face filter app millions of people have been using this week that's now sparking major privacy concerns. That's next.</p><p>[09:51:16] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Shares of U.S. chip maker Qualcomm under pressure, the E.U. fined it more than $270 million dollars for quote \"predatory pricing.\" The Competition Commissioner says the company sold below cost to force its competitor, Icera out of the market.</p><p>The British fashion e-retailer, Asos issued a profit warning on Thursday. Shares are down as you can see some 16.5 percent late London trading. The company says they are working on fixing operational issues in warehouses, which increased costs and hit sales. This is Asos's third profit warning in eight months.</p><p>Cybersecurity experts are raising the red flag on the smartphone app that went viral this week called FaceApp. Users are having fun aging their selfies by decades. But they're also granting the Russian company that made FaceApp full access to their personal photos and their data.</p><p>U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer is now calling for an F.B.I. investigation into the app citing national security concerns. Hadas Gold joins us now on this story.</p><p>Hadas, I shouldn't laugh, I am. The number of texts I got from people this week saying you have to try, this is brilliant. And then got a sheepish follow up text going actually, don't bother. Look at the details of this. Just explain what happened.</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Right, Julia. It's very enticing, you know, using one of these fun apps to make -- to see what you might look like 20, 30, 40 years from now. And as you showed on screen, there's a lot of celebrities and a lot of our friends and families are likely having some fun with this.</p><p>But then people started digging into what this company is. Now, the company behind the FaceApp group is actually based in Russia. So, that already set up some red flags for people. But I do have to say, more so than where they're based or who they might share the information with, I think what's more important is if people look into the licensing and what you're allowing this app to do with the photos that you upload.</p><p>And what they say is that they allow that they can do whatever they want with a photo that you upload, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty free, worldwide transferable sub-licensable license, pretty much that means they own the photo. If they want to do whatever they want to do with it, they can do it for commercial purposes, and you won't get any money out of it.</p><p>So, that's why I'm sort of surprised to see a lot of celebrities whose whole business is often their image getting so involved with this app. Now, the app has come out against some of these concerns, especially around the concerns about that they're in Russia saying that, listen, our data is not being shared with any sort of Russian authorities.</p><p>But obviously in today's day and age, people are very concerned about their data going into some company that's based out of Russia, and they're also - - the company is trying to push back on this idea that they have access to your entire photo roll. They say that is not the case.</p><p>But I should also again, emphasize to you that the biggest thing people actually should be thinking about is the licensing and what they're allowing this app to do with the photo that they are uploading.</p><p>But obviously this is getting a lot of attention also from politicians. You noted Senator Chuck Schumer, and also the Democratic National Committee has warned its employees and its members not to upload the app -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I looked at it. I mean, it's not just about the photos, either. It gives you access to Siri, to search, it gives you access to refreshing in the background. So, even if you're not using it effectively, it's using you.</p><p>I mean, Hadas, big picture here, it proves actually we've learned nothing since Cambridge Analytica. We are still taking risks, huge risks, in fact with our privacy and with our data.</p><p>GOLD: Yes, because people want to use these apps. You ask people, \"Do you trust Facebook with your data?\" And people will say maybe no, but are you going to stop using Facebook? No, because people want to use these. These are fun. Obviously, we're seeing how much attention this app is getting. But there's a lot of privacy and legal issues behind the scenes that people just aren't very educated about that they need to understand what's happening.</p><p>[09:55:12] GOLD: And actually, some of the conversation is now turning to the app stores, to the Apple App Store, to the Google Play Store and asking, are you vetting these apps in a well enough category to allow them onto your platform and to even in some cases, promote them as an editor's pick?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I have to say my favorite was a picture of Boris Johnson one week after he enters Number 10 Downing Street and faces the Brexit conundrum. That didn't make me laugh. Naughty. Hadas Gold.</p><p>GOLD: Yes, you can't deny, it's fun.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you so much for that. All right. Let's take a look at what we're seeing for the markets this morning here in the United States, we are a little bit softer here. Interesting show there. Lots of news.</p><p>Obviously, Jim Bullard as well saying to us, still pushing for that rate cut in July, not pushing for more than two rate cuts at this stage in 2019.</p><p>So a little bit of an anomaly there with the market. Lots to discuss. But for now, that was it for FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours. I'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019071801cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-CG81-JB20-G1M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7994\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00025OQ</classCode><className>FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00020FE</classCode><className>SAP SE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Legislation should be introduced to address harmful online material. The CBC should be advertising free. And a government tax credit to support local journalism should not just be extended, but also applied to broadcast media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those were among the recommendations in a highly anticipated report released by a legislative review panel Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response, the government said it would move swiftly on the suggested reforms. Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave him direction to table legislation in the government's first year and \"we will follow through on this promise.</p><p>\"Our goal is simple - to make the system more equitable than it is right now,\" he said. \"The technological changes that we have seen have made it so that our system doesn't work anymore.\"</p><p>Guilbeault said a measure like charging the GST on streaming services such as Netflix could be imposed soon, noting that Trudeau \"talked about probably the next budget, so this is something we can move very quickly.\"</p><p>Currently, only Quebec and Saskatchewan require at least the provincial sales taxes to be collected on streaming services. The report urges that the GST/HST be applied \"equitably\" to services provided by foreign online providers, saying it \"would eliminate the disadvantage to competing Canadian providers.\"</p><p>The six-member panel was created in 2018 by the Liberals with a mandate to modernize antiquated broadcasting and media laws. Its 235-page report, titled \"Canada's Communications Future: Time To Act,\" contains 97 recommendations and is infused with a sense of urgency.</p><p>\"The need for this work has never been more urgent,\" panel chair Janet Yale told a news conference.</p><p>\"The pace of change is dizzying, the opportunities unprecedented and the risks - to our privacy as consumers, to our cultural sovereignty as a country, and to our economic competitiveness - are significant,\" she said.</p><p>The panel steered clear of the controversial taxes on digital platform providers such as Google and Facebook that are now the subject of international debate and even diplomatic tensions. France's plan to impose a digital tax on the American tech giants prompted Washington to threaten retaliatory tariffs. The Liberals' election platform proposed a three per cent tax on the revenue that such companies generate in the country and Guilbeault said Wednesday that Canada continues to discuss that issue with other countries.</p><p>However, the panel did say that online streaming companies such as Netflix, Apple TV and Disney+ should be required to contribute to Canadian content, a requirement that had long been sought by many Canadian producers and the media industry.</p><p>\"Culturally, the framework must ensure that Canada's creators continue to have the means for Canadian stories to be told and discovered in a world of so many choices,\" said the report. \"Netflix and other online streaming services would be required to devote a portion of their program budgets to Canadian programs.\"</p><p>Yale doubted that the proposed requirement would drive up costs for the streaming services. \"We do not think this is something that would be passed onto consumers or result in higher prices,\" she said.</p><p>\"If you benefit from operating in the Canadian system, you should contribute. It's a simple principle.\"</p><p>Significant recommendations include a remake of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to give the regulator more teeth and a bigger mandate in dealing with the digital giants. That would include giving the CRTC the power to impose spending requirements on media content providers and \"discoverability,\" or how content is displayed on a website.</p><p>But one expert said the new powers and responsibilities proposed for the regulatory agency would be \"wholly inappropriate,\" and likely run afoul of Canada's obligations under trade agreements and the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.</p><p>\"I've got huge concerns with the massive regulatory structure that this envisages,\" said Michael Geist, a professor at the University of Ottawa. \"It's really unprecedented to see this level of regulation.</p><p>\"They want give the regulator huge powers to determine what ... the website looks like, what content they provide,\" he said. \"If it were to be implemented, it would be subject to challenge on a number of grounds and quite frankly the government ought to reject them.\"</p><p>But the report's recommendations won endorsement from others, such as the Directors Guild of Canada, ACTRA and the Canadian Media Producers Association.</p><p>Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, an advocacy group, applauded the panel's vision for the CBC with an expanded mandate for more Canadian content, a long-term commitment of federal funding and an end to all commercial advertising within five years.</p><p>\"I would say it is ambitious but appropriately so,\" said Daniel Bernhard, the group's executive director.</p><p>\"We have this absurd situation in Canada where our government policy has allowed foreign tech companies to basically asphyxiate Canadian media,\" Bernhard said. \"This blueprint is really what is necessary to ensure that our own cultural conversation and democratic conversation can survive.\"</p><p>Recognizing the importance of local news in a democracy, the panel also recommended that the $595 million journalism labour tax credit be extended beyond its five-year mandate which started in January 2019, \"in order to strengthen the capacity of news organizations over the long term.\"</p><p>It also says that the credit, which has mainly benefited print media, should be applied to news on all platforms, including broadcasting.</p><p>Crucially, the panel says that an uneven playing field exists between social media platforms such as Facebook and news media organizations, a tilt that should be corrected.</p><p>\"As a result of the imbalance in their bargaining power, news content creators are unable to individually negotiate terms over the use of their content by social media platforms,\" says the panel.</p><p>Newspaper publishers have long called for more information behind the closely guarded algorithms that the digital giants use to determine what articles are most read. This information, says the panel, could be made public to the publishers.</p><p>\"We believe that the best way to address misinformation and fake news is to have accurate, trusted and reliable sources of news,\" Yale said.</p><p>In terms of privacy and data breaches, the panel called on the federal government to harness the power of their collective agencies, such as the office of the privacy commissioner, to examine the scope of the problem.</p><p>That review should examine \"the use of Big Data by dominant online platform providers and potential threats to privacy, competition, consumer protection, cultural sovereignty, democratic institutions, and taxation, and make recommendations on legislation.\"</p><p>The panel also examined the role of advanced networks such as 5G. It did not go into whether Huawei equipment should be used in Canadian networks, which the United States says is a security risk.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

The hour-and-10-minute discussion (see video clip below), which included an unusually comprehensive audience Q&amp;A, found both executives opening up a bit more than at typical conference sessions. The event was not streamed or covered by the usual cross-section of Hollywood press and Wall Street observers who closely track every media business utterance.</p><p>After hitting on a range of topics, from Sarandos' own origin story (which included living in Denver for five years in the 1990s) to data-mining, advertising and live sports, Fries ended the session with a \"lightning round.\" Calling it an \"exercise\" that he dubbed \"buy, hold or sell,\" he explained, \"'Buy' means you believe in it; it's a winner, 'hold' means it's too soon to tell, 'I'm waiting to see;' 'sell' means it's not a winner.\" The first \"buy/hold/sell\" question fired at Sarandos: Disney+. (Sensing intrigue, the audience of about 150 let out a murmur and a few chortles.)</p><p>\"I'd say it's a hold,\" Sarandos replied. \"But I'll say they're remarkable storytellers. [Disney CEO Bob Iger] has put together an amazing business. They're in new space, but they've been in new spaces a lot of times.\" Fries, who leads Europe's No. 1 cable operator, volunteered his own eyebrow-raising take on Disney's streaming efforts. \"You do realize, if they hit their wildest expectations with their forecasts, it's 11% of their revenue,\" he said. \"It's a hedge.\"</p><p>Next lighting-round topic: major talent agencies, which are locked in a battle with the Writers Guild and others in Hollywood over their mounting production activity. \"The further they get away from their core, the more difficult it is, I think,\" Sarandos said, without designating a \"buy/hold/sell\" rating. \"Their core is, talent really does need help. They need, how do you find projects, how do you - who's looking out for you all the time? But if they're going to be another producer of content, I don't know that they're going to be a great one.\"</p><p>As to Netflix's future in a dynamic M&amp;A environment of late, Fries asked if Sarandos thinks the streaming giant will still be an independent company in five years. \"I would bet on that,\" the exec replied.</p><p>Fries asked Sarandos about the impending competition from not only Disney+ but also new services from Apple, NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia launching during the next year.</p><p>\"The thing that's interesting about all these upcoming services as well as the services that are in the market today is that mostly they have none of the same programming,\" Sarandos said. \"Nothing that's on Disney+ is going to be on Netflix and nothing that's on Netflix is going to be on the [Comcast and WarnerMedia services]. They're going to be very unique.\" For that reason, despite research indicating resistance by consumers to the idea of paying for more than three services, Sarandos added, \"I think it's very likely that they'll add things\" in order access content they want.</p><p>Fries sardonically asked Sarandos about \"your friends in Silicon Valley,\" Google and Facebook. He wondered if he saw the companies being forced by regulators to break up, as some politicians and activists have been demanding. \"I could not begin to predict any of that,\" Sarandos replied. \"I know that I feel good that we're not in any of those businesses that draw that kind of fire. Another great reason not to sell advertising. We don't collect your data. I don't know how old you are when you join Netflix. I don't know if you're black or white. We know your credit card, but that's just for payment and all that stuff is anonymized.\"</p><p>Also on the data theme, Sarandos reaffirmed the company has no plans to incorporate advertising (a subject of mounting speculation) or bid on live sports. Both are \"not core to the proposition\" of Netflix, which is ad-free and on-demand, he added. While the price most Netflix subscribers pay has risen steadily, from $8.99 a month five years ago to $12.99 today, Sarandos waved away any concerns of price sensitivity. \"I honestly think about it not in terms of price but in terms of value,\" he said. \"So if people are getting the value for the dollar, they should track each other really closely.\" Given the increase in quality programming in recent years, Netflix is \"still pretty cheap,\" he maintained.</p><p>Given the festival audience, which was full of independent producers and content creators, the pair of executives spent considerable time talking about Netflix's method of selecting shows to produce. Fries suggested that because the company doesn't report ratings or divulge much in the way of viewership information, the green-light process is trapped in a \"black box,\" which even industry heavyweights can't access. \"Picking content and working with the creative community is a very human function,\" Sarandos said. \"The data doesn't help you on anything in that process. It does help you size the investment. ... Sometimes we're wrong on both ends of that, even with this great data. I really think it's 70, 80% art and 20, 30% science.\"</p><p>Sarandos recalled his own path through the video store business and then coming aboard Netflix in 2000, three years after its founding, as the company's sole entertainment employee. Early on, he said, he made a pivotal decision to stay in LA rather than moving up to Los Gatos and incubate a content effort from there. The buildout of the entertainment side in Southern California complemented the growth of the main headquarters scaled with thousands of engineers focused on the user experience.</p><p>Staying in LA \"turned out to be a good strategic bet,\" Sarandos said. \"You can respect the tech culture in the entertainment community and the entertainment community can respect the tech culture. But they hardly ever get together, mostly because it's just a tribal thing. Most of Hollywood was convinced that the tech guys would come down and clumsily write big checks and would be all gone pretty soon. [They were saying], 'We'll be here like we have been been the last 100 years doing this. We've seen this come and go, come and go.' And then the tech guys were convinced that all the studio guys were stupid and they were doing everything wrong. It wasn't a great culture to work together. But because I was [in LA] and started building out the team there ... [it got traction because] it's a relationship business.\"</p><p>Addressing the oft-pondered notion of whether the company should be considered as a tech or media concern, Sarandos reasoned, \"Netflix is an entertainment company that is intertwined and supported by unbelievable tech.\"</p><p>Here's a clip from the conversation:</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/2019/06/bathtubs-over-broadway-director-dava-whisenant-emmys-netflix-interview-1202636331/\">Emmys: Director Dava Whisenant And Star Steve Young On 'Bathtubs Over Broadway,' Sudsy Doc About \"Weird,\" Poignant Corporate Musicals</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/2019/06/the-old-guard-chiwetel-ejiofor-harry-melling-veronica-ngo-join-netflix-skydance-medias-action-fantasy-1202636108/\">'The Old Guard': Chiwetel Ejiofor, Harry Melling &amp;

Tiger King, Don\u2019t F*ck with Cats and more have proved that often, reality is stranger than fiction and a highly enthralling viewing experience.    But the latest offering from Netflix, The Social Dilemma is a strange entry that combines some really hard hitting revelations with what we\u2019d describe as B-grade acting.    [embedded content]      The \u201cstar\u201d of The Social Dilemma is Tristan Harris, former design ethicist at Google and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.    The documentary takes a look at social media and the various design choices made as the platforms have evolved. We meet folks like Aza Raskin and Justin Rosenstein. Those names probably mean nothing to you but those two people separately helped create infinite scrolling and the Like button.    More importantly, however, the documentary looks at how those design choices have influenced our way of thinking as we have become increasingly tied to the internet.    The core of The Social Dilemma sees many advocates for change in the tech industry voicing their concerns about the power big tech firms have found themselves with and how recklessly they use that power.    It\u2019s a rare insight behind the scenes of major tech firms from folks who worked at said firms and at times the content will shock you.    But that\u2019s if you make it beyond the incredibly cringe-worthy acted scenes.    Throughout the doccie you will get insight into a family\u2019s day-to-day life and the \u201cstruggles\u201d they have with social media.    Here, social media is represented by an AI (played by Vincent Kartheiser) which determines what each of the family members sees though for the most part we only ever see what the AI feeds the son Ben (played by Skyler Gisondo). And it\u2019s these scenes that seem like an after thought.    In one scene we see the \u201cAI\u201d auctioning off Ben\u2019s \u201cattention\u201d to an advertiser and within moments that \u201cattention\u201d is sold.    Now we get that the producers are trying to relay that advertising and content you see on social media is determined by an algorithm. We understand there is no easy way to showcase how algorithms recommend content based off of past behaviour or that an advertising profile has been amassed based on your behaviour online but there is a better way \u2013 tell people exactly that.    The problem here is that for most of the documentary we\u2019re treated to a high-level overview of how AI is used against us, how big tech has more power than any one nation and more very complex ideas.    And then we have Kartheiser playing with graphics that don\u2019t really mean anything or convey the seriousness of what is happening.    The Social Dilemma would\u2019ve been great if not for these fictional breakaways that showcase the worst possible outcome when using social media.    Is there a modicum of truth to these examples? Of course there is, but we feel these extreme examples only serve to detract from the real issues brought up in the course of the documentary.    What is the real issue? Tech companies have far too much power and think they can self regulate despite showcasing they have no idea how to do that.    And that is where the documentary shines. There are statements that will have you saying \u201cwhat the hell\u201d out loud and insights that even took us aback.    The Social Dilemma touches on some really important aspects of how the internet has changed the world for the worse but we think there is a better documentary that showcases that.    The Great Hack was released in 2019 and looks directly at the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal. The content there is more focused on Facebook rather than the internet at large but we feel the message that The Social Dilemma is trying to convey is done better in The Great Hack.    Both doccies are available to stream on Netflix South Africa right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43042986297</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T8-7JB1-F07F-808J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Htxt.Africa</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GR108</classCode><className>SOUTHERN AFRICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

And then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive. It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed to create addiction and manipulate our behavior, told by some of the very people who supervised the systems at places like Facebook, Google and Twitter. </p><p>Tim Kendall, a former president of Pinterest, admitted that years ago he couldn't get off his phone even when he came home, despite having two young kids. \"I am going to work during the day and building something that then I'm falling prey to,\" he says in the film. \"I couldn't help myself.\" The documentary is a well paced, absorbing look at the deep costs of Big Tech \u2014 fake news, election security concerns, radicalization, polarization and much more. Only in trying to dramatize those costs does it slip up badly. Director Jeff Orlowski interviews former tech execs, historians and social scientists but apparently doesn't trust them enough to tell the story. So he also employs a gimmicky family of five actors \u2014 two parents, three teens \u2014 to dramatize the lure of social media in a clunky way. Worse, he also employs an actor \u2014 a weirdly cast Vincent Kartheiser of \"Mad Men\" fame \u2014 to pretend to act like the computer software, sending alluring phone alerts from a console to one of the teens and cuing up videos he knows will be clickbait, while ominous music plays. \"Yes, perfect,\" Kartheiser purrs after sending a video of epic skateboard fails to the teen. \"He's primed for an ad!\" Later: \"Don't show him any more sports updates. He doesn't engage.\" But we know \u2014 from the very talking heads \u2014 that this is an algorithm with no agency other than its program. Why humanize code? And why humanize code by portraying it as a sleazy middle-aged man who acts like a mid-level officer in \"Minority Report\"? The film then steps on itself. When one of the fake teens falls for a fake online conspiracy and attends a fake demonstration, it's juxtaposed against real footage of real violence and real demonstrations, muddying the water between fake and real \u2014 a terrible decision given what this film is about. Orlowski would have done better interviewing real teens buffeted by social media and real people caught up in conspiracies. Insulting our intelligence about artificial intelligence is not the way to go. The silly dramatizations mar an otherwise excellent documentary that shows how so many Silicon Valley leaders designed ways to keep us engaged online and that led to such things as Pizzagate, international destabilization, higher suicide rates in young people and a boom in depression. The film reveals much more than why you go from Googling the best sofa one minute to finding sofa ads on your Facebook stream the next. That so much online seems free is part of the trap: It's our private data that's being sold. As Aza Raskin, former Firefox and Mozilla Lab worker says: \"Advertisers are the customers. We're the thing being sold.\" The film nicely delves into how algorithms that seek to maximize advertising revenue tap into psychology to keep us addicted to our screens. Did a friend just tag me? I got an alert! Hey, Facebook just invited me to an event. Those are all \"positive intermittent reinforcements\" and they keep us checking our phone for more, like a gambler hoping for a windfall at a Vegas slot machine. Whether or not these techniques were actively employed, stumbled upon or just a byproduct of a user-engagement model is a little murky. The film offers all sides as to whether software makers consciously exploit human vulnerabilities: The guy who helped create the \"like\" button for Facebook says he wanted to spread love in the world, but a former Facebook executive admits purposely creating dopamine-driven feedback loops. If there is a hero here it is portrayed by Tristan Harris, an ex-Google executive who is now co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and who hopes to change the system. He and critics like Jaron Lanier, author of \"Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,\" explain what the possible consequences are if we continue using our individual digital pacifiers \u2014 lots of cat videos, yes, and also civil war. Stick around after the film is over to hear lots of recommendations from former tech leaders who built the mess we're in: They turn off their notifications. They delete many apps. They urge regulation. They don't let their kids use social media. Think about that. * * * Directed by: Jeff Orlowski Other: A Netflix release.

This was followed by Saskatchewan. They are now the only two provinces to force online digital platforms to collect sales taxes.</p><p>\"Why would you not impose a tax on Netflix, but you would impose a tax on Bell and Rogers?\" Leitao asked. \"The biggest thing about this, and I don't want to sound too dramatic, was that at the end of the day, there was nothing to fear but fear itself. All we had to do was ask.\"</p><p>The implementation was spectacularly successful: Quebec estimated it would receive $28 million annually after the tax came into effect Jan. 1. By the end of August, it had already raised $38 million. That money will go into the province's general revenue fund where it could be used for any number of things, including education, infrastructure or security.</p><p>\"We were surprised at the number and at the speed at which suppliers complied with regulations,\" Leitao said. \"It really all worked out rather well.\"</p><p>So if it worked for Quebec, why hasn't the federal government followed suit?</p><p>Under current tax laws created before the digital era, companies that don't have a \"substantial physical presence\" in Canada aren't required to collect sales taxes. Domestic companies have to, creating an unlevel playing field.</p><p>\"You already have an unfair advantage between a foreign company and a local one of 15 per cent in Quebec (five per cent GST and 10 per cent QST), which is huge,\" Leitao said. \"So it's no surprise that Canadian companies aren't happy with that situation.\"</p><p>According to Canada's auditor general, the federal government lost $169 million in sales taxes (GST) alone in 2017, based on foreign digital products and services sold. That amount would likely be higher today given the increasing trend to digital services.</p><p>The issue will only get bigger. Apple TV+ recently launched in Canada and Disney+ launches tomorrow, joining a crowded field of streaming platforms.</p><p>\"Godzilla has landed on our shores, and the government still hasn't done anything about it,\" said Howard Law, director of the media sector for Unifor, the division of the union representing workers in the newspaper and broadcasting industries, including Toronto Star workers. \"You've essentially got Netflix 2 and Netflix 3 testing the waters, so now is the time.\"</p><p>After a hands-off approach to big tech, the Liberal government has become much tougher on taxing and regulating the industry over the past year. Public sentiment also shifted dramatically as opinion polls show more Canadians favour regulation and are distrustful of big tech.</p><p>Trudeau promised to follow France's lead by implementing at three-per-cent tax on the revenues of big technology firms ensuring \"multinational tech giants pay tax on the revenue they generate in Canada.\"</p><p>And in an exclusive interview, Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez told the Star he intends to make sure there are \"no more free rides\" when it comes to digital platforms contributing to Canadian culture.</p><p>Unifor's Law says if the government were serious, it could act on this quickly with an order-in-council to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications (CRTC) board overseeing the Broadcasting Act. It could require foreign platforms to spend money on Canadian content, similar to domestic broadcasters.</p><p>\"I think the Liberal government has gotten over the fear of being slagged politically for putting on a Netflix tax. Now they've got to follow through,\" Law said.</p><p>What makes it all the more baffling to some critics is why the government doesn't simply tackle the low-hanging fruit of ensuring that everyone, including foreign companies, collect sales tax as Canadian companies are already forced to do. It's a policy that would be far easier to implement since it is simply enforcing the law equally for all businesses.</p><p>\"Taxes are a tough sell. I think across Canada there is this almost visceral reaction to taxes,\" Leitao said. \"But really, this is about equity between local and foreign suppliers.\"</p><p>The Liberals, however, did say they would work to \"ensure digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada, collect and remit the same level of sales taxes as Canadian digital corporations,\" but this wasn't included in their fiscal plan or costed out by the Parliamentary Budget Office, according to lobby group Canadians for Tax Fairness.</p><p>Whether the Liberals will move in this direction is another issue, given their minority mandate. But their natural allies, including the NDP, the Bloc and the Greens have already said they believe in a \"level playing field\" and foreign multinationals must pay their fair share.</p><p>Still, the leadership on the Netflix tax means Quebec has given Canadians a model to work with, say economists.</p><p>\"What Quebec did was exactly the right thing,\" said tax expert Jack Mintz, president's fellow in the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary. \"They took the bull by the horns and went with it. Now that we know the Quebec experience, the federal government should go ahead. It was totally appropriate, an additional source of revenue for the government and exactly the right thing to do from a tax policy perspective.\"</p><p>Netflix has already said it would comply with collecting taxes if required to by the Canadian government. It just hasn't been asked.</p><p>But the question is so sensitive that platforms are reluctant to give details of their operations.</p><p>Netflix, for example, will not reveal if it currently has an office in Canada. Instead, \"confirming we have no comment\" when asked basic questions such as if it had an office, where it might be, or how many employees it may have.</p><p>Still, it remains invested. On Tuesday, they announced a partnership with the Toronto International Film Festival, a three-year investment to invest in emerging talent.</p><p>Netflix also said it had surpassed $500 million in production in Canada, only two years after it established its first presence here. The company had promised to invest at least that amount over five years.</p><p>Canada is the fifth most important market for Netflix with an estimated 6.3 million subscribers and $942 million in revenue annually, according to U.K.-based analysts Comparitech Ltd. Just the GST alone would be $47 million based on those figures, not including provincial sales taxes.</p><p>When Leitao's Liberal government set out to implement the tax in late 2016, it was sparked by lobbying from vested interests such as Quebec's Vid\u00e9otron cable company and other broadcasters who said they were at a tax disadvantage. Consumers have to pay GST and PST on cable services and for online Canadian platforms such as Bell Media's Crave, but not for foreign digital platforms.</p><p>There was also fear by politicians that the big digital companies wouldn't play ball if they were asked. And there was the perception that there would be pushback from consumers. But none of this happened, as the government framed the tax collection as one of national importance.</p><p>The biggest hurdle it turned out, was not the voters, or Netflix or Amazon or other suppliers. But convincing Quebec's bureaucracy in the Revenue Ministry (which reports to the Finance Minister) that this would actually work.</p><p>\"There was certainly a great deal of uneasiness. There was talk that this was going to be too difficult. That the companies will find all kinds of ways not to comply,\" Leitao said.</p><p>A turning point for Leitao was in 2017, when he visited Paris to talk to the OECD on how they were tackling the issue of taxing digital platforms. The European Union has been at the forefront in updating legislation to deal with the digital era.</p><p>But Leitao knew he had a win when, later that year, Quebec encountered little pushback from digital platforms after unveiling their plan.</p><p>The Quebec tax has been such a success, the government is looking at a pilot project to expand the tax to collect QST for online purchases of tangible goods from suppliers located outside Canada.</p><p>With the project, the Quebec government has seconded four Revenue Quebec employees on the 12-month experiment with Canada Border Services.</p><p>As for the Netflix tax, which is now part of his legacy, Leitao says during the early days, he resisted any calls to make the tax one that would go toward any specific group or industry.</p><p>\"The sales tax is a general sales tax and it goes into the general revenue fund. That's the way it should be. And that way it helps all residents. And it will benefit Quebec for years to come.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019111156283681</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGD-75B1-JBTY-W376-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001XRL</classCode><className>LAURENTIAN BANK OF CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

The internet and digital economy discourse again was a contested space at last year's IGF, whose relevant and apt theme was One World, One Vision, One Net.</p><p>UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres also refers to the UN as the \"appropriate platform where all relevant actors can meet to address such global challenges\". This could be indicative of how the IGF's future role and functions may be shaped.</p><p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in her opening address, stressed the benefits of the internet, and the strategic relevance of the physical infrastructure which enables the flow of data and information, connecting continents and regions.</p><p>Her reflections focused on the issue of digital sovereignty, and the risks of protectionist approaches and challenges of big tech. Referring to technological developments, she reminded us that although something is technologically feasible and possible online, this does not mean it is ethically desirable.</p><p>Merkel sees the global digital policy process as shifting rapidly. Describing this as a \"reordering of internet governance\", she echoed Guterres's reference to the UN as a home for reorienting global internet policy.</p><p>Among institutional innovations is the move towards IGF Plus, with support mechanisms such as a policy incubator pointing to a need that the self-regulation as a mode of managing policy in any context is not viable.</p><p>International Telecommunication Union (ITU) general secretary Houlin Zhao argued for a more robust policy framework in international norms, and the family of the UN, such as that offered by the ITU, seems a more sustainable, inclusive and democratic model, that can ensure internet for societal good and move towards the attainment of UN ideals such as its Declaration of Human Rights and Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>The internet as a vast social economic ecosystem and force for \"public good\" came into focus at IGF2019, especially against the background of the dominance of big tech, privacy violations, ad-tech monetisation, misuse of data in elections, rise of extremists, abuse of social media and the lack of a global-access-for-all agenda, etc.</p><p>African countries face many challenges in efforts to participate in the context of the Africa Free Trade Agreement, where an emerging digital trade and digital industrialisation agenda is being debated.</p><p>One of the highlights or controversies of the IGF was the debate on the sale of the.Org domain system hosted by InternetSociety (Isoc) to private equity firm Ethos Capital for $1billion. Access Now, a global NGO fighting for digital rights, was vocal in opposition to the sale, citing privacy concerns of global civil society and labour groups, and lack of transparency.</p><p>Perhaps this aptly symbolised the deeper challenges, fissures and contestations of internet governance in the 21st century.</p><p>Is another world and just internet possible? Possibly, but for now internet governance has to navigate the stormy seas of geopolitics.</p><p>Patel is a digital economy associate at IGD South Africa</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPARG-116207825</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPARG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1Y-6591-F091-R2D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312414</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cape Argus (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000218T</classCode><className>VISION ONE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC2752 COMMERCIAL LITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

While many of the Big Tech names -- Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq), Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq) and Nortel (NT:NYSE) -- have been crashing, a little outfit called NetIQ Corporation (NTIQ:Nasdaq) remains in the stratosphere. Sure, the shares are off 23% from their mid-December highs, but its valuation remains lofty, even as the Nazzdog is sinking faster than Al Gore's political career.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \u00a0(Chart Omitted)\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Well, NetIQ is a \"leading provider of Windows NT-based applications management software.\" To put it in layman's terms, NetIQ is a company whose products regulate, monitor and optimize the performance and availability of Windows NT-based systems and applications. Does that sound a warning bell yet? It should!\u00a0</p><p><table pgwide=\"544\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"544\"/><tbody><row><entry nameend=\"1\" namest=\"1\">Related Stories</entry></row><row><entry>And Then Came Microsoft: Tech Giant Joins the Preannouncement Crowd</entry></row><row><entry>Tough Questions for Microsoft After Joining the Warning Club</entry></row><row><entry>Microsoft's Billion-Dollar Bust Recalls the Old Shell Game</entry></row><row><entry>Pulse: Tech Chain-Saw Massacre Continues Post-Microsoft</entry></row><row><entry>Ballmer's Memo Got It Right</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p> Mighty Microsoft issued a first-time-in-a-decade warning last week that it would miss estimates, not only for this quarter but also for the next two quarters in 2001. Mr. Softee added that it was seeing a global slowdown in IT spending, and as a result was guiding estimates downward for this quarter and the next two quarters as well. So how does that bode for NetIQ? Not very well, I am afraid.\u00a0</p><p> There is no doubt that NetIQ has a killer suite of products. In October 2000, Microsoft ended up essentially buying (via a licensing deal ) NetIQ's Operations Manager product in exchange for roughly $175 million, plus exclusive rights for future enhancements to the core platform, and a co-marketing agreement for three years going forward. A nice endorsement, indeed.\u00a0</p><p> There is also no doubt that NetIQ has grown its revenue at a very impressive clip the last few quarters. The company, which came public in July 1999, was originally estimated by analysts to record revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, of $32.5 million. But NetIQ posted actual revenue of $99.8 million that year, beating original revenue estimates by over 200% -- and made money to boot. For the year ending June 30, 2001, analysts expect the company to increase its revenue to approximately $165 million with earnings estimates in the $0.78-$0.82 per-share range.\u00a0</p><p> However, the fact still remains that NetIQ is not a cheap stock by any means. With its chief source of revenue, Microsoft, seeing a global slowdown across all primary product lines, things can not look all that rosy for NetIQ. NetIQ is currently valued at 44.3 times trailing 12-month (TTM) sales compared to 11.4 times TTM for AOL (AOL:NYSE), 9.3 times for Microsoft, 12.4 times for Cisco and only 3.3 times TTM for Nortel.\u00a0</p><p> So, what is NetIQ's secret sauce? It's actually quite simple. There are 39.3 million shares outstanding, as of Sept. 30, out of which 30% are held by insiders, and almost all the rest of the balance is held by institutional shareholders.\u00a0</p><p> This leaves very little available to individual investors. As a result, this stock is very hard to borrow for shorting and is also very volatile, especially on the upside. Nevertheless, short interest as per last month's data almost doubled to 600,000 shares from a short position of 232,000 shares as of the previous month.\u00a0</p><p> Because the stock is hard to borrow, buying a few put options could prove to be a rather profitable strategy. This is a company that remains high even when Microsoft -- which according to analysts covering NetIQ will account for almost 31% of NetIQ's estimated revenue of $276 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2002 -- is faltering.

[ Image removed: ] Imagen licenciada para dominio p\u00fablico, sin atribuci\u00f3n. El Netizen Report de Advox ofrece una instantnea internacional de los problemas, victorias y nuevas tendencias en materia de derechos de internet en todo el mundo. Este informe cubre las noticias y acontecimientos ocurridos entre el 20 y el 26 de abril de 2019. En Arabia Saudita, 37 prisioneros fueron ejecutados por decapitaci\u00f3n[1] el 23 de abril. La mayora de los sentenciados pertenecan a la comunidad musulmana shita, que es minora en el reino. </p><p>Todos eran hombres. Seg\u00fan Human Rights Watch[2] y Amnista Internacional[3], 14 de los ejecutados fueron arrestados despus de protestas contra el Gobierno. Ambos grupos dicen que los hombres fueron obligados a confesar 'delitos relacionados con protestas' tras ser torturados, y que luego buscaron retractarse de sus confesiones en la corte, pues las hicieron bajo coerci\u00f3n. A\u00fan as, fueron sentenciados a muerte. Lynn Maalouf, que ejerce como directora de investigaci\u00f3n de Amnista Internacional para Medio Oriente, calific\u00f3 las ejecuciones[4] como 'otro espantoso indicador de c\u00f3mo se usa la pena de muerte como herramienta poltica para pulverizar la discrepancia de la minora shita del pas'. Apenas das antes, tres blogueros sauditas fueron arrestados[5] como parte de una represi\u00f3n[6] en curso contra periodistas y activistas que promocionaron los titulares en octubre de 2018 de la muerte de Jamal Khashoggi, periodista de The Washington Post, en la embajada saudita en Estambul. Las autoridades no han declarado p\u00fablicamente por qu detuvieron a Naif al-Hindas, Ali al-Saffar y Redha al-Boori, que no han sido escritores activos desde hace un tiempo. En 2015, Al-Saffar y al-Boori haban escrito sobre asuntos de seguridad regional, y Al-Hindas escriba sobre filosofa, feminismo y otros temas culturales y polticos hasta mediados de 2018. Al 1 de diciembre de 2018, haba al menos 16 periodistas en prisi\u00f3n[7] en Arabia Saudita. En total, esos casos legales y las ejecuciones demuestran las extremas medidas que el Gobierno saudita est dispuesto tomar para evitar las crticas y el trabajo legtimo de los medios en el reino.Sri Lanka bloquea medios sociales tras mortales ataquesHoras despus de los atentados con bomba que causaron cientos de muertes en iglesias y hoteles en Sri Lanka el domingo de Pascua, las autoridades bloquearon[8] los principales servicios de internet y m\u00f3viles, como Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Viber, Snapchat y Facebook Messenger. Las reacciones a la acci\u00f3n[9] fueron mezcladas, muchos expresaron su frustraci\u00f3n con el Gobierno y las plataformas de medios sociales, que no han logrado controlar la difusi\u00f3n de discurso violento y desinformaci\u00f3n en tiempos de emergencia p\u00fablica.Detienen a lder de derechos humanos ugands en Tanzania, luego lo deportanEl reconocido defensores de derechos digitales Wairagala Wakabi fue detenido[10] en el aeropuerto internacional Julius Nyerere en Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, el 25 de abril cuando lleg\u00f3 al pas desde su natal Uganda para ayudar a dirigir un taller de derechos humanos y tecnologa. Wakabi es director ejecutivo de la organizaci\u00f3n ugandaesa Colaboraci\u00f3n en Poltica Internacional de Tecnologas de la Informaci\u00f3n y la Comunicaci\u00f3n para frica Oriental y del Sur[11] (CIPESA), una de las principales organizaciones de derechos digitales en frica. Wakabi fue deportado de vuelta a Uganda tras varias horas de interrogatorio, en la que se le neg\u00f3 acceso a un abogado. Abogados de la Coalici\u00f3n de Defensores de Derechos Humanos de Tanzania intentaron defender al detenido, pero les dijeron que Wakabi fue deportado por motivos de 'inters nacional'. En una declaraci\u00f3n a CIPESA[12] pidieron a la comunidad de frica Oriental que 'condenaran esta tendencia de perturbar a los ciudadanos de la comunidad de frica Oriental cuando viajan dentro de la subregi\u00f3n'.Arrestan a periodista francs que informaba sobre protesta de Chalecos AmarillosLa polica francesa arrest\u00f3[13] al periodista Gaspard Glanz cuando informaba una protesta de Chalecos Amarillos en Pars el 20 de abril. Glanz es fundador de la agencia de noticias Taranis News, que informa principalmente protestas y movimientos sociales en lnea. Glanz pas\u00f3 48 horas detenido y fue liberado con la acusaci\u00f3n de 'desacato a una persona que ejerce autoridad p\u00fablica' por mostrar el dedo medio a un oficial de polica. Tambin se le ha impedido informar sobre las protestas, a la espera del inicio de su juicio, el 18 de octubre.Te transportas con Careem? Ten cuidado \u2014 tu conductor puede llamarte despusCareem, aplicaci\u00f3n de transporte emirat que fue recientemente adquirada por Uber[14], ha estado difundiendo los nombres completos de sus pasajeros y sus n\u00fameros de telfono. SMEX, grupo de derechos humanos libans, informa[15] que esto ha llevado a que los conductores intenten contactar a los pasajeros por Facebook y otros medios, lo que supone una amenaza a la seguridad y privacidad de los pasajeros. En el blog de SMEX, Abed Kataya escribi\u00f3: Careem.appears oblivious to the implications and risks of sharing users' personal data, even going as far as to deny that a phone number constitutes personally identifiable information. Careem. parece no darse cuenta de las consecuencias y riesgos de difundir datos personales, y llega hasta a negar que un n\u00famero de telfono constituye informaci\u00f3n que puede identifcar a una persona.Intrusos de tarjetas SIM explotan sistema de identificaci\u00f3n biomtrico de PakistnLas autoridades en Pakistn arrestaron a siete personas[16] por participar de robo de identidad en el que captaban datos de identidad -incluidas las huellas digitales- de personas que no sospechaban nada, y luego usaban esta informaci\u00f3n para obtener tarjetas SIM m\u00f3viles, que vendan a otros para actividades delictivas. Desde 2008, en Pakistn es obligatorio mostrar informaci\u00f3n de identidad biomtrica (por lo general, huellas dactilares) para comprar tarjetas SIM, medida que, seg\u00fan las autoridades, redujo la extorsi\u00f3n, el secuestro y el fraude por la 'desanonizaci\u00f3n' de las tarjetas SIM.Uni\u00f3n Europea modera poltica tecnol\u00f3gica 'antiterrorista', pero los problemas siguenEl 16 de abril, el ParlamentoEuropeo aprob\u00f3[17] una directiva que exigira a las plataformas de internet que retiraran publicaciones en lnea consideradas como 'contenido terrorista' al cabo de una hora de recibir \u00f3rdenes de las autoridades competentes. Los legisladores votaron[18] para eliminar las disposiciones de la directiva que hubiera exigido[19] a las plataformas a usar filtros de 'censura previa' automatizados y a vigilar la informaci\u00f3n que transmiten y guardan, para detectar y retirar contenido terrorista. Aunque grupos de derechos humanos han acogido bien[20] el retiro de estas disposiciones, sigue la preocupaci\u00f3n por la plazo de una hora. En una declaraci\u00f3nl European Digital Rights (EDRi) y Access Now 'saludaron' esta mejora, pero luego enfatizaron que dudan[21] que se puedan lograr los objetivos de la directiva. En una declaraci\u00f3n, los grupos afirmaron: Across Europe, the inflation of counter-terror policies has had disproportionate impact[22] on journalists, artists, human rights defenders, and innocent groups at risk of racism. En toda Europa, el aumento de las polticas contra el terrorismo han tenido un impacto desproporcionado[23] en periodistas, artistas, defensores de derechos humanos y grupos inocentes en riesgo de racismo.Internet sigue bloqueada en ChadPara abril de 2019, Chad tena un a\u00f1o completo sin acceso a internet[24]. Los proveedores del servicio atribuyen[25] la interrupci\u00f3n a problemas tcnicos, pero organizaciones como Internet sin Fronteras dicen[26] que el Gobierno ha ordenado a las empresas de telefona m\u00f3vil a cortar el acceso a internet, muy probablemente por el descontento p\u00fablico por el rgimen del presidente chadiano, Idriss Deby, en el cargo desde 1990. En 2018, Deby intent\u00f3 cambiar la Constituci\u00f3n de Chad para poder retener el cargo hasta 2033.Nueva investigaci\u00f3nIdentidad digital en el contexto de migraci\u00f3n y refugiados[27] - Data ...ciety Informe de la Salud de Internet 2019[28] - Mozilla Foundation Informe de la situaci\u00f3n anual de libertad de expresi\u00f3n en frica 2018[29] - African Freedom of Expression ExchangeSubscrbete al Netizen Report[30] Afef Abrougui[31], Ellery Roberts Biddle[32], Nwachukwu Egbunike[33], L.

[ Image removed: ] Image licensed to public domain, without attribution. The Advox Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in technology and human rights around the world. This report covers news and events from April 20 - April 26. In Saudi Arabia, 37 prisoners were executed by beheading[1] on April 23. Most of those killed belonged to the Shia Muslim community, a minority in the kingdom. </p><p>All were men. According to Human Rights Watch[2] and Amnesty International[3], 14 of those executed were arrested after joining anti-government protests. Both groups say the men were forced to confess to 'protest-related crimes' after being tortured, and that they later sought to retract their confessions in court, as they were given under duress. They were nevertheless sentenced to death. Lynn Maalouf, who serves as Amnesty International's Middle East research director, called the executions[4] 'another gruesome indication of how the death penalty is being used as a political tool to crush dissent from within the country's Shi'a minority.' Just a few days prior, three Saudi bloggers were arrested[5] as part of an ongoing crackdown[6] on journalists and activists that drew headlines in October 2018 with the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul. Authorities haven't publicly stated why they've detained Naif al-Hindas, Ali al-Saffar and Redha al-Boori, who have not been active as writers for some time. In 2015, Al-Saffar and al-Boori had written about regional security issues, and Al-Hindas wrote about philosophy, feminism, and other cultural and political topics up until mid-2018. As of December 1, 2018, there were at least 16 journalists in prison[7] in Saudi Arabia. All told, these legal cases and executions demonstrate the extreme measures the Saudi government is willing to take in order to prevent criticism and legitimate media work in the kingdom.Sri Lanka blocks social media after deadly attacksWithin hours of the bombings that killed hundreds of people at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, authorities blocked[8] major internet and mobile services including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Viber, Snapchat and Facebook Messenger. Reactions to the move[9] were mixed, with many expressing frustration with both the government and social media platforms, which have proven inept at controlling the spread of violent speech and disinformation in times of public emergency.Ugandan rights leader detained in Tanzania, then deportedLeading digital rights advocate Wairagala Wakabi was detained[10] at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on April 25 when he flew to the country from his native Uganda to help lead a workshop on human rights and technology. Wakabi is the Executive Director of the Uganda-based Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa[11] (CIPESA), one of the foremost organizations working on digital rights in Africa. Wakabi was deported back to Uganda after several hours of interrogation, during which he was denied access to a lawyer. Attorneys from the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition attempted to advocate on his behalf, but were told only that Wakabi was being deported on 'national interest' grounds. In a statement to CIPESA[12], they called upon members of the East African Community (EAC) 'to condemn this tendency of disturbing citizens of EAC when travelling within the subregion.'French journalist arrested while covering Yellow Vests protestFrench police arrested[13] journalist Gaspard Glanz while he was covering a Yellow Vests protest in Paris on April 20. Glanz founded the news agency Taranis News, which primarily covers protests and social movements online. Glanz spent 48 hours in detention before he was released and charged with 'contempt of a person holding public authority' for giving the middle finger to a police officer. He was also banned from covering the protests, pending the start of his trial on October 18.Riding with Careem? Be careful \u2014 your driver might call you laterThe UAE-based ride-hailing app Careem, which was recently acquired by Uber[14], has been sharing passengers' full names and real phone numbers with drivers. Beirut-based digital rights group SMEX reports[15] that this has led to drivers attempting to contact passengers through Facebook and other means, posting a threat to riders' safety and privacy. On the SMEX blog, Abed Kataya wrote: Careem.appears oblivious to the implications and risks of sharing users' personal data, even going as far as to deny that a phone number constitutes personally identifiable information.SIM card schemers exploit Pakistan's biometric ID systemLaw enforcement officials in Pakistan arrested seven people[16] who they say were running an identity theft scheme in which they captured identity data \u2014 including people's fingerprints \u2014 from unsuspecting individuals, and then used this information to obtain mobile SIM cards, which they then sold to people who used them to carry out criminal activities. Pakistan made it compulsory for people to present biometric identity information (typically fingerprints) in order to purchase SIM cards in 2008, a move that authorities say brought a decrease in extortion, kidnapping and fraud by 'deanonymizing' SIM cards.EU tempers 'anti-terrorism' tech policy, but problems are far from overOn April 16, the European Parliament approved[17] a policy directive that would require internet platforms to remove online posts deemed to be 'terrorist content' within an hour of receiving an order from competent authorities. Lawmakers voted[18] to delete provisions of the directive that would have required[19] platforms to use automated 'prior censorship' filters and to monitor the information they transmit and store, in order to detect and remove terrorist content. While human rights groups have welcomed[20] the removal of these provisions, they remain concerned about the one-hour deadline. In a statement, European Digital Rights (EDRi) and Access Now 'welcomed' this improvement, but then emphasized their doubt[21] that the proposal's objectives could be achieved. In a statement, the groups said: Across Europe, the inflation of counter-terror policies has had disproportionate impact[22] on journalists, artists, human rights defenders, and innocent groups at risk of racism.The internet is still shut down in ChadAs of April 2019, people in the central African nation of Chad have been without internet access[23] for a full year. Service providers attribute[24] the disruption to technical problems, but organizations like Internet without Borders say[25] that the government has ordered mobile phone companies to cut internet access, most likely owing to public discontent over the enduring reign of Chadian President Idriss Deby, who has been in office since 1990.

This report covers news and events from April 20 - April 26. In Saudi Arabia, 37 prisoners were executed by beheading[2] on April 23. Most of those killed belonged to the Shia Muslim community, a minority in the kingdom. All were men. </p><p>According to Human Rights Watch[3] and Amnesty International[4], 14 of those executed were arrested after joining anti-government protests. Both groups say the men were forced to confess to 'protest-related crimes' after being tortured, and that they later sought to retract their confessions in court, as they were given under duress. They were nevertheless sentenced to death.Lynn Maalouf, who serves as Amnesty International's Middle East research director, called the executions[5] 'another gruesome indication of how the death penalty is being used as a political tool to crush dissent from within the country's Shi'a minority.' Just a few days prior, three Saudi bloggers were arrested[6] as part of an ongoing crackdown[7] on journalists and activists that drew headlines in October 2018 with the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul. Authorities haven't publicly stated why they've detained Naif al-Hindas, Ali al-Saffar and Redha al-Boori, who have not been active as writers for some time. In 2015, Al-Saffar and al-Boori had written about regional security issues, and Al-Hindas wrote about philosophy, feminism, and other cultural and political topics up until mid-2018. As of December 1, 2018, there were at least 16 journalists in prison[8] in Saudi Arabia. All told, these legal cases and executions demonstrate the extreme measures the Saudi government is willing to take in order to prevent criticism and legitimate media work in the kingdom.Sri Lanka blocks social media after deadly attacksWithin hours of the bombings that killed hundreds of people at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, authorities blocked[9] major Internet and mobile services including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Viber, Snapchat and Facebook Messenger. Reactions to the move[10] were mixed, with many expressing frustration with both the government and social media platforms, which have proven inept at controlling the spread of violent speech and disinformation in times of public emergency.Ugandan rights leader detained in Tanzania, then deportedLeading digital rights advocate Wairagala Wakabi was detained[11] at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on April 25 when he flew to the country from his native Uganda to help lead a workshop on human rights and technology. Wakabi is the Executive Director of the Uganda-based Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa[12] (CIPESA), one of the foremost organizations working on digital rights in Africa. Wakabi was deported back to Uganda after several hours of interrogation, during which he was denied access to a lawyer. Attorneys from the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition attempted to advocate on his behalf, but were told only that Wakabi was being deported on 'national interest' grounds. In a statement to CIPESA[13], they called upon members of the East African Community (EAC) 'to condemn this tendency of disturbing citizens of EAC when travelling within the subregion.'French journalist arrested while covering Yellow Vests protest Declare Your Independence! Profit outside the rigged system! Protect yourself from tyranny and economic collapse. Learn to live free and spread peace! Counter Markets Newsletter - Trends ...rategies for Maximum FreedomFrench police arrested[14] journalist Gaspard Glanz while he was covering a Yellow Vests protest in Paris on April 20. Glanz founded the news agency Taranis News, which primarily covers protests and social movements online. Glanz spent 48 hours in detention before he was released and charged with 'contempt of a person holding public authority' for giving the middle finger to a police officer. He was also banned from covering the protests, pending the start of his trial on October 18.Riding with Careem? Be careful \u2014 your driver might call you laterThe UAE-based ride-hailing app Careem, which was recently acquired by Uber[15], has been sharing passengers' full names and real phone numbers with drivers. Beirut-based digital rights group SMEX reports[16] that this has led to drivers attempting to contact passengers through Facebook and other means, posting a threat to riders' safety and privacy. On the SMEX blog, Abed Kataya wrote:Careem.appears oblivious to the implications and risks of sharing users' personal data, even going as far as to deny that a phone number constitutes personally identifiable information. SIM card schemers exploit Pakistan's biometric ID systemLaw enforcement officials in Pakistan arrested seven people[17] who they say were running an identity theft scheme in which they captured identity data \u2014 including people's fingerprints \u2014 from unsuspecting individuals, and then used this information to obtain mobile SIM cards, which they then sold to people who used them to carry out criminal activities. Pakistan made it compulsory for people to present biometric identity information (typically fingerprints) in order to purchase SIM cards in 2008, a move that authorities say brought a decrease in extortion, kidnapping and fraud by 'deanonymizing' SIM cards.EU tempers 'anti-terrorism' tech policy, but problems are far from overOn April 16, the European Parliament approved[18] a policy directive that would require Internet platforms to remove online posts deemed to be 'terrorist content' within an hour of receiving an order from competent authorities. Lawmakers voted[19] to delete provisions of the directive that would have required[20] platforms to use automated 'prior censorship' filters and to monitor the information they transmit and store, in order to detect and remove terrorist content. While human rights groups have welcomed[21] the removal of these provisions, they remain concerned about the one-hour deadline. In a statement, European Digital Rights (EDRi) and Access Now 'welcomed' this improvement, but then emphasized their doubt[22] that the proposal's objectives could be achieved. In a statement, the groups said:Across Europe, the inflation of counter-terror policies has had disproportionate impact[23] on journalists, artists, human rights defenders, and innocent groups at risk of racism. The Internet is still shut down in ChadAs of April 2019, people in the central African nation of Chad have been without Internet access[24] for a full year. Service providers attribute[25] the disruption to technical problems, but organizations like Internet without Borders say[26] that the government has ordered mobile phone companies to cut Internet access, most likely owing to public discontent over the enduring reign of Chadian President Idriss Deby, who has been in office since 1990. In 2018, Deby moved to change Chad's constitution so that he could retain office until 2033.

It's happening right now with net neutrality - a critical issue that affects everyone who uses the internet that seems to have fallen off the face of the earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last December, the Trump administration repealed President Obama's net neutrality rules, setting off a firestorm of media attention and - if only briefly - focusing national attention on the need for clear rules ensuring that no internet company can block unpopular websites or unaffiliated services or otherwise discriminate online. Net neutrality is the idea that internet service providers treat all content equally.</p><p>There was then a brief effort to revive the rules through a highly partisan longshot approach called the \"CRA\" that made some headway in the Senate but was always, as its sponsors knew too well, dead on arrival in the House of Representatives.</p><p>While well-intentioned, it's no surprise this CRA tactic could not gain a foothold. It fetishized an anachronistic \"public utility\" approach to net neutrality that many regarded as gratuitous overkill for a largely unregulated internet and a buzzkill for new investment. It also oddly paid worship to administrative regulations that change with every new administration rather than a permanent congressional law. Even if it had succeeded, the Trump Federal Communications Commission could have altered them again. It's like that game of infinite regression.</p><p>In the meantime, the news cycle has churned on and net neutrality is like a forgotten summer romance. Many have started to believe it was all hype, drummed up by the professional consultant class to burnish their brands and raise funds, as the internet providers themselves have pledged to live by the rules even in their absence. Making sure they do now falls to the Federal Trade Commission as the honesty-in-advertising cop on the beat.</p><p>As much as we should celebrate consensus - and there seems to be widespread agreement on net neutrality now - legislation still seems to be the obvious coda. Legislation is a kind of \"trust but verify\" insurance policy against a future provider that may want to favor its new streaming service over those of, say, Netflix or Disney. But there are other reasons too. Interfering with internet traffic to increase profits is not just a salon-dinner theoretical conversation about future misbehavior by internet providers, it's a current way-of-life for the internet's new gilded monopolies like Facebook and Google.</p><p>Those companies that collect and profile our data and decide what we can see and where we can go online pose a greater risk of censorship and manipulation of our data than anyone. Washington's big thinkers in technology have come to the party late, after months of front page stories of how these companies facilitate election interference, hate and civic chaos and marketplace tyranny that is strip-mining our news, retail and creative industries.</p><p>Many of these leaders are now demanding that that net neutrality cover these Big Tech monopolies as well as internet providers - something only a new law from Congress can effectively ensure. It would seem obvious to anyone watching the disintegration of the internet that there is a crisis too big to corporate promises or overworked regulators. Net neutrality for all goes to the basic ability of citizens to connect and communicate, to find meaningful information, to organize and participate in the political process in a fair and open way.</p><p>On a bipartisan basis, congressional inaction conjures images of Nero fiddling while the internet burns. There is little disagreement about net neutrality widely applied and little disagreement about reining in abuses that lead to the Russia scandal, among others. It's up to party leadership on both sides to prove, contrary to growing populist sentiment in both camps, that they are not made up of decaying old politicians but rather modern problem solvers up to the task of protecting the most important communications medium of our time. Poll after poll shows that this is what the public wants by large margins.</p><p>Patricia Ford is a former executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLATDY-brv-1793112042</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLATDY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T92-YFF1-JC3H-047F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256483</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"713\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FLORIDA TODAY All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FLORIDA TODAY (Brevard County, Florida)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 18, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The US president has called for transparency from big tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter. That includes the signing of an executive order[2] geared at sending complaints about purported bias from social media and search giants alike to the FTC. </p><p>In this case, the aim is the removal of 'anti-conservative' bias. The Trump administration has further petitioned the FCC to reinterpret Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in order to limit protections for hosting sites. In effect, opening online platforms to legal action when platforms take down or alter content they deem objectionable. That would include sites like Twitter[3], which recently began flagging some of the president's statements. Now, AT&amp;#38;T has taken to its official blog stating that argument is the most important \"neutrality\" debate.What is AT&amp;#38;T saying about web \"neutrality\"?The primary argument from AT&amp;#38;T on neutrality for the web has nothing to do with earlier debates about net neutrality though. In fact, AT&amp;#38;T was one of the carriers to side with the Trump administration's FCC in gutting those rules. AT&amp;#38;T notes that a total of five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google \u2014 make up 25-percent of the S&amp;#38;P 500. And that the company's make decisions on a daily basis that shape America's economic, social, and political life. But, it argues, those decisions are effectively made in a void, away from public view. To that end, it argues that online platforms should be more transparent about those decisions. But the carrier took things quite a bit further as well. While the full extent of its proposal has not been published yet, the carrier also wants active enforcement. Chiefly, it wants the FCC to force changes in moderation of content. Summarily, it wants the same legal ramifications to apply to tech[4] companies like Google that apply to traditional publishing platforms.How likely is this to happen?For now, there is stiff opposition to reducing legal protections for online platforms. Those are largely based in First Amendments groundings and supported not just by FCC Democrats. Commissioner Michael O'Rielly has voiced concerns on that front too. It also remains unclear whether or not the FCC has the authority under Congress to enforce any such interpretation of Section 230.
