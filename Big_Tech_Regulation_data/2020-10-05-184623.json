But all that money isn\u2019t likely to buy Bezos a break on Wednesday.        Bezos is due to take his place \u2014 virtually \u2014 alongside Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai as four of the tech industry\u2019s most powerful chief executives face a grilling from lawmakers. And Bezos\u2019 Everything Store, the $1.5 trillion corporation that he started in his garage as an online bookstore 25 years ago, may have the most to lose as he makes his first-ever appearance before a skeptical Congress.    All four companies face serious problems: Google\u2019s dominance over markets like search and online advertising has brought it more than $9 billion in fines worldwide and an expected antitrust suit from the U.S. Justice Department. Apple faces two EU probes for the way it wields its App Store and mobile payments service against rivals, and Facebook is the subject of antitrust probes and a worldwide corporate advertising boycott over its approach to regulating hate speech and political deception.    Amazon, though, has steadily attracted ire from both the right and left in recent years for its uncommon influence over the way much of America lives.    It wasn\u2019t always this way. Amazon has spent years watching \u2014 or even prodding \u2014 from the sidelines as regulators in the U.S. and Europe went after America\u2019s other powerful tech companies.    When the  Obama administration sued Apple  over allegations that the iPad-maker had  conspired to fix the price of ebooks , Amazon executives were among the key witnesses for the government. In the U.S., prominent advocates for antitrust suits against Google and Facebook have included a Yale economist who also works as a paid Amazon consultant . Over the past decade, as fines and other penalties piled up for the three fellow tech giants, Amazon stood apart, portraying itself as a champion of consumers and low prices.    But now, critics are targeting Amazon over its ability to avoid sales taxes or federal income taxes, its treatment of warehouse workers amid the pandemic, and the availability of counterfeit goods  and  harmful products on its retail platform. President Donald Trump has accused it of ripping off the U.S. Postal Service and driving brick-and-mortar retailers out of business, while liberals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have complained about the state and local economic incentives Amazon sought while soliciting proposals for its new second headquarters.    Bezos\u2019 separate ownership of The Washington Post has added to Trump\u2019s ire, while his status as the world\u2019s richest person \u2014 and owner of D.C.'s largest private residence \u2014 has made him a foil for critics of America\u2019s economic inequality.    Even more than the other businesses in Wednesday's spotlight, Bezos\u2019 companies influence what and where people buy food and other essentials; the news, books and websites they read; the television and movies they watch; the advertising they see online. Amazon is the United States' second-largest private employer with 590,000 workers, and a leader in cloud computing and next-generation technologies including artificial intelligence, drones and self-driving cars.        None of this is an accident, said Matt Stoller, an anti-monopoly researcher and one of the most vocal detractors  of the big tech companies.   Stoller,   director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project,  co-wrote  a report last week that seeks to chronicle ways in which Amazon has used loopholes in the law \u2014 from tax to product liability to antitrust to the company\u2019s relationship with the Postal Service \u2014 to benefit its business.    \u201cBezos didn\u2019t luck into this,\u201d said Stoller, whose recent book \u201cGoliath\u201d explores how monopolies have influenced American politics and democracy. \u201cHe was deliberate in taking advantage of legal gaps.\u201d    Still, even some of Amazon's biggest critics acknowledge that its enormous wealth and power point to a problem that is bigger than just the company.        \"With all his billions, Jeff is [a] rounding error in the big picture. He\u2019s not the problem; the legal/regulatory power structures that enable him and his peers is,\u201d Tim Bray, a former vice president for Amazon, said in a blog post  on Monday. Bray, an executive with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing service,  publicly quit the company   in May over the company's treatment of warehouse workers.    Amazon declined to offer responses to its critics' arguments or comment on how it plans to address them at the hearing. In his prepared testimony , Bezos acknowledges the company's size merits Congress' inquiry.    \"I believe Amazon should be scrutinized,\" Bezos said in his prepared remarks. \"We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they\u2019re companies, government agencies, or non-profits. Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colors.\"   \u2018Who is the sovereign?'   The worldwide scrutiny for Amazon has accelerated in the past year.    Last summer, antitrust authorities in the U.S. and EU began investigating Amazon over allegations it abuses its dominance in online retail by using data collected from sellers on its marketplace to favor its own products. State attorneys general in California and Washington, where Amazon is located, have also opened probes. Last week, Italy\u2019s competition authority raided Amazon\u2019s offices in the country while investigating an agreement between the e-commerce giant and Apple over the sale of Beats headphones and other products.    At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, members of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are expected to delve into many of those allegations, as well as whether an Amazon executive misled the panel last summer in his testimony about whether the company uses the data it obtains from third-party sellers. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat whose Seattle district is home to Amazon\u2019s headquarters, said she plans to ask about the discrepancy \u2014 but also about the broader issue of the company\u2019s role as both owner of the marketplace and a seller within it.    \u201cAmazon has achieved such enormous dominance in the marketplace,\u201d said Jayapal, expressing concern that Congress is lagging behind European policymakers in understanding competition in tech markets. \u201cWe desperately need to catch up in terms of our regulation, in terms of our enforcement, and even just in terms of the conversation around what the implications are for a consumer of monopolistic antitrust behavior.\u201d    Earlier this year, the European Commission outlined plans   for a new regulatory approach to digital \"gatekeepers\" \u2014 the large tech platforms like Amazon that control how businesses interact with consumers. The bloc opened a public comment period in June, with the hopes of adopting regulations by the end of the year.    Shaoul Sussman, a lawyer who has researched the company for anti-monopoly group the Institute for Local Self-Reliance \u2014 an Amazon critic \u2014 said he expects that most questions to Bezos will involve specifics of Amazon\u2019s marketplace. But Sussman said he hopes lawmakers will focus on the larger picture of Amazon\u2019s business strategy and whether the U.S. should rethink how technology markets are regulated.    \u201cThere\u2019s a general question here about who is ruling who. Who is the sovereign and who dictates the rules of the game?\u201d said Sussman, who represented an Amazon seller who offered evidence in the congressional probe. \u201cWill Congress reassert itself over these corporations or will these corporations dictate the rules of the game to Congress?\u201d   Amazon lobbies up   Although the company has existed since 1995, Amazon\u2019s entrance to Washington was much more recent. In 2015, Amazon hired former White House press secretary Jay Carney as vice president for corporate affairs. That year, the company\u2019s lobbying expenditures also skyrocketed to $9.4 million, up from $4.9 million in 2014. The money Amazon has spent on lobbying has risen every year since.    More recently, Amazon has focused on staffing up on antitrust. Nate Sutton, the executive who testified before the House Judiciary panel last summer, joined the company at the end of 2016 after almost a decade in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. Two years later, the company added Bryson Bachman, a senior DOJ antitrust official at the beginning of the Trump administration who also formerly worked for Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.    This year alone, the company has added three attorneys to its legal team from the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 which is also investigating the company for antitrust violations, though none of the lawyers were directly involved in the probe \u2014 and another veteran of the DOJ\u2019s antitrust division.    Another prominent antitrust figure supporting Amazon is Fiona Scott Morton, a top antitrust economist for the Obama-era DOJ, who began consulting for the company on antitrust economics last year. She has recently faced criticism for not clearly disclosing her ties to Amazon and Apple while publicly advocating for antitrust  suits  against Google  and  Facebook .    On Thursday, Institute for Local Self-Reliance co-founder Stacy Mitchell resigned  an unpaid fellowship from  Yale's Thurman Arnold Project , a research initiative on antitrust in tech where Scott Morton is the director, because of the economist\u2019s work for Amazon.    Scott Morton said she has done economics consulting work on antitrust for Amazon and others \"when I am comfortable there is not a law being violated.\" That work helps inform her research  and  views  that the U.S. needs more regulation in digital markets and to revamp the antitrust laws, she said. Scott Morton has recused from research into Apple or Amazon for the Thurman Arnold Project, letting others at Yale oversee that work, to avoid perceived conflicts of interest.   Can low prices harm consumers   Specifically, Amazon notes that its share of the global retail market is small; it closed down most operations in China last year because of stiff competition from Alibaba. The research firm Emarketer, though, estimates that Amazon commands about 37 percent of U.S. online retail sales. The next closest competitor is Walmart, which has an estimated 5 percent share.    A group of unions, which earlier this year urged the FTC to probe Amazon\u2019s impact on American workers, merchants and consumers, argued in a letter last week that the e-commerce giant controls even more of the market in specific product categories, such as consumer electronics, where it has a 45 percent share of U.S. online sales. That trend may only increase as consumers move more of their shopping online because of the coronavirus, the unions said.    A large part of the reason Amazon has escaped the antitrust scrutiny of its peers relates to the company\u2019s customer-centric model. In his first letter to shareholders in 1997, Bezos pledged to \u201ccontinue to focus relentlessly on our customers.\u201d    That approach meshes with decades of the United States\u2019 prevailing approach to antitrust law, which since the late 1970s has looked at tangible effects like high prices as evidence that corporate conduct or mergers are harming competition. That lens, critics argue, has led antitrust enforcers and courts to pay too little attention to less tangible values like quality or innovation.    Lina Khan \u2014 a key staffer on the House antitrust probe who will join Columbia University Law School as a professor this fall \u2014 argued in a novel 2017 legal article that Amazon has benefited from that overemphasis on low price.    \u201cThe potential harms to competition posed by Amazon\u2019s dominance are not cognizable if we assess competition primarily through price and output,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFocusing on these metrics instead blinds us to the potential hazards.\u201d    Amazon\u2019s Bezos has always admitted he is playing a long game, Khan argued, and once the company has become dominant in an industry, it can raise prices.    Sellers who use Amazon\u2019s platform say the company has already started to do that.    In a study released Tuesday, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance found that Amazon keeps 30 percent of each sale made by third parties who use its marketplace, up from the 19 percent it kept five years ago. Fees charged to third-party sellers brought the company about $60 billion in 2019 \u2014 about 21 percent of Amazon\u2019s total revenue.    While the company\u2019s legendary levels of customer service may benefit consumers, those benefits don\u2019t extend to third-party sellers who make use of Amazon\u2019s marketplace, said Douglas Mrdeza, the CEO of Top Shelf Brands in Lansing, Mich. Mrdeza began selling on Amazon in 2014 after inadvertently ordering too much product for his barbershop. The company quickly grew by offering to help other companies \u2014 like Tootsie Roll, Bedhead hair products and Hatchimals toys \u2014 sell on Amazon. Over time, though, the amount the company charged for advertising and other fees began to grow, he said.    Amazon was \u201cvery promising in the beginning. But they\u2019ve got this whole system designed where they get sellers in door, but as time goes on they squeeze every dollar you could be making out of you,\u201d said Mrdeza, who said Top Shelf ranked among the top 50 U.S. sellers on Amazon. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a future selling on Amazon.\u201d    Mrdeza, who participated in a call hosted by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance with other small companies critical of Amazon, said he hoped speaking out might help other sellers on the platform.    \u201cSellers are the most profitable aspect of your business,\u201d Mrdeza said. \u201cWhen we have our own complaints, why aren\u2019t the same levels of customer service being offered to us as to consumers? That\u2019s the biggest disconnect between their public statements and what the reality is.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42712409194</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-GFJ1-F07F-82K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Politico.eu</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Jeff Bezos has spent the past five years trying to become a fixture in  Washington \u2014 hiring President Barack Obama\u2019s press chief, flooding the town with lobbying cash, buying The Washington Post, and even choosing a spot along the Potomac River for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.    But all that money isn\u2019t likely to buy Bezos a break on Wednesday.      Bezos is due to take his place \u2014 virtually \u2014 alongside Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai as four of the tech industry\u2019s most powerful chief executives face a grilling from lawmakers. And Bezos\u2019 Everything Store, the $1.5 trillion corporation that he started in his garage as an online bookstore 25 years ago, may have the most to lose as he makes his first-ever appearance before a skeptical Congress.      All four companies face serious problems: Google\u2019s dominance over markets like search and online advertising has brought it more than $9 billion in fines worldwide and an expected antitrust suit from the U.S. Justice Department. Apple faces two EU probes for the way it wields its App Store and mobile payments service against rivals, and Facebook is the subject of antitrust probes and a worldwide corporate advertising boycott over its approach to regulating hate speech and political deception.    Amazon, though, has steadily attracted ire from both the right and left in recent years for its uncommon influence over the way much of America lives.    It wasn\u2019t always this way. Amazon has spent years watching \u2014 or even prodding \u2014 from the sidelines as regulators in the U.S. and Europe went after America\u2019s other powerful tech companies.    When the Obama administration sued Apple over allegations that the iPad-maker had conspired to fix the price of ebooks , Amazon executives were among the key witnesses for the government. In the U.S., prominent advocates for antitrust suits against Google and Facebook have included a Yale economist who also works as a paid Amazon consultant . Over the past decade, as fines and other penalties piled up for the three fellow tech giants, Amazon stood apart, portraying itself as a champion of consumers and low prices.    But now, critics are targeting  Amazon over its ability to avoid sales taxes or federal income taxes, its treatment of warehouse workers amid the pandemic, and the availability of counterfeit goods and harmful products on its retail platform. President Donald Trump has accused it of ripping off the U.S. Postal Service and driving brick-and-mortar retailers out of business, while liberals like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have complained about the state and local economic incentives Amazon sought while soliciting proposals for its new second headquarters.    Bezos\u2019  separate ownership of The Washington Post has added to Trump\u2019s ire, while his status as the world\u2019s richest person \u2014 and owner of D.C.'s largest private residence \u2014 has made him a foil for critics of America\u2019s economic inequality.       Even more than the other businesses in Wednesday's spotlight, Bezos\u2019 companies influence what and where people buy food and other essentials; the news, books and websites they read; the television and movies they watch; the advertising they see online. Amazon is the United States' second-largest private employer with 590,000 workers, and a leader in cloud computing and next-generation technologies including artificial intelligence, drones and self-driving cars.    None of this is an accident, said Matt Stoller, an anti-monopoly researcher and one of the most vocal detractors of the big tech companies.  Stoller,  director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, co-wrote a report last week that seeks to chronicle ways in which Amazon has used loopholes in the law \u2014 from tax to product liability to antitrust to the company\u2019s relationship with the Postal Service \u2014 to benefit its business.    \u201cBezos didn\u2019t luck into this,\u201d said Stoller, whose recent book \u201cGoliath\u201d explores how monopolies have influenced American politics and democracy. \u201cHe was deliberate in taking advantage of legal gaps.\u201d    Still, even some of Amazon's biggest critics acknowledge that its enormous wealth and power point to a  problem  that is bigger than just the company.    \"With all his billions, Jeff is [a] rounding error in the big picture. He\u2019s not the problem; the legal/regulatory power structures that enable him and his peers is,\u201d Tim Bray, a former vice president for Amazon, said in a blog post on Monday. Bray, an executive with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing service, publicly quit the company in May over the company's treatment of warehouse workers.    Amazon declined to offer responses to its critics' arguments or comment on how it plans to address them at the hearing. In his prepared testimony , Bezos acknowledges the company's size merits Congress' inquiry.    \"I believe Amazon should be scrutinized,\" Bezos said in his prepared remarks. \"We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they\u2019re companies, government agencies, or non-profits. Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colors.\"   \u2018Who is the sovereign?'   The worldwide scrutiny for Amazon has accelerated in the past year.    Last summer, antitrust authorities in the U.S. and EU began investigating Amazon over allegations it abuses its dominance in online retail by using data collected from sellers on its marketplace to favor its own products. State attorneys general in California and Washington, where Amazon is located, have also opened probes. Last  week, Italy\u2019s competition authority raided Amazon\u2019s offices in the country while  investigating an agreement between the e-commerce giant and Apple over the sale of Beats headphones and other products.    At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, members of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are expected to delve into many of those allegations, as well as  whether an Amazon executive misled the panel last summer in his testimony about whether  the company uses the data it obtains from third-party sellers. Rep. Pramila Jayapal , a Democrat whose Seattle district is home to Amazon\u2019s headquarters, said she plans to ask about the discrepancy \u2014 but also  about the broader issue of the company\u2019s role as both owner of the marketplace and a seller within it.    \u201cAmazon has achieved such enormous dominance in the marketplace,\u201d said Jayapal, expressing concern that Congress is lagging behind European policymakers in understanding competition in tech markets. \u201cWe desperately need to catch up in terms of our regulation, in terms of our enforcement, and even just in terms of the conversation around what the implications are for a consumer of monopolistic antitrust behavior.\u201d    Earlier this year, the European Commission outlined plans for a new regulatory approach to digital \"gatekeepers\" \u2014 the large tech platforms like Amazon that control how businesses interact with consumers. The bloc opened a public comment period in June, with the hopes of adopting regulations by the end of the year.    Shaoul Sussman, a lawyer who has researched the company for anti-monopoly group the  Institute for Local Self-Reliance \u2014 an Amazon critic \u2014 said he expects that most questions to Bezos will involve specifics of Amazon\u2019s marketplace. But Sussman said he hopes lawmakers will focus on the larger picture of Amazon\u2019s business strategy and whether the U.S. should rethink how technology markets are regulated.    \u201cThere\u2019s a general question here about who is ruling who. Who is the sovereign and who dictates the rules of the game?\u201d said Sussman, who represented an Amazon seller who offered evidence in the congressional probe. \u201cWill Congress reassert itself over these corporations or will these corporations dictate the rules of the game to Congress?\u201d   Amazon lobbies up   Although the company has existed since 1995, Amazon\u2019s entrance to Washington was much more recent. In 2015, Amazon hired former White House press secretary Jay Carney as vice president for corporate affairs. That year, the company\u2019s lobbying expenditures also skyrocketed to $9.4 million, up from $4.9 million in 2014. The money Amazon has spent on lobbying has risen every year since.    More recently, Amazon has focused on staffing up on antitrust. Nate Sutton, the executive who testified before the House Judiciary panel last summer, joined the company at the end of 2016 after almost a decade in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. Two years later, the company added Bryson Bachman, a senior DOJ antitrust official at the beginning of the Trump administration who also formerly worked for Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.    This year alone, the company has  added three attorneys to its legal team from the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 which is also  investigating the company for antitrust violations, though none of the lawyers were directly involved in the probe \u2014 and another veteran of the DOJ\u2019s antitrust division.    Another prominent antitrust figure supporting Amazon is Fiona Scott Morton, a top antitrust economist for the Obama-era DOJ, who began consulting for the company on antitrust economics last year. She has  recently faced criticism for not clearly disclosing her ties to Amazon and Apple while publicly advocating for antitrust suits against Google and Facebook .    On Thursday, Institute for Local Self-Reliance co-founder Stacy Mitchell resigned an unpaid fellowship from Yale's Thurman Arnold Project , a research initiative on antitrust in tech where Scott Morton is the director, because of the economist\u2019s work for Amazon.    Scott Morton said she has done economics consulting work on antitrust for Amazon and others \"when I am comfortable there is not a law being violated.\" That work helps inform her research and views that the U.S. needs more regulation in digital markets and to revamp the antitrust laws, she said. Scott Morton has recused from research into Apple or Amazon for the Thurman Arnold Project, letting others at Yale oversee that work, to avoid perceived conflicts of interest.   Can low prices harm consumers?   Specifically, Amazon notes that  its share of the global retail market is small; it closed down most operations in China last year because of stiff competition from Alibaba.  The research firm Emarketer, though, estimates that Amazon commands about 37 percent of U.S. online retail sales. The next closest competitor is Walmart, which has an estimated 5 percent share.    A group of unions, which earlier this year urged the FTC to probe Amazon\u2019s impact on American workers, merchants and consumers, argued in a letter last week that the e-commerce giant controls even more of the market in specific product categories, such as consumer electronics , where it has a 45 percent share of U.S. online sales. That trend may only increase as  consumers move more of their shopping online because of the coronavirus, the unions said.    A large part of the reason Amazon has escaped the antitrust scrutiny of its peers relates to the company\u2019s customer-centric model. In his first letter to shareholders in 1997, Bezos pledged to \u201ccontinue to focus relentlessly on our customers.\u201d    That approach meshes with decades of the United States\u2019 prevailing approach to  antitrust law, which since the  late 1970s  has looked at tangible effects like high prices as evidence that corporate conduct or mergers are harming competition. That lens,  critics argue, has led antitrust enforcers and courts to  pay too little attention to less tangible values like quality or innovation.       Lina Khan \u2014 a key staffer on the House antitrust probe who will join Columbia University Law School as a professor this fall \u2014 argued in a novel 2017 legal article that Amazon has benefited from that overemphasis on low price.    \u201cThe potential harms to competition posed by Amazon\u2019s dominance are not cognizable if we assess competition primarily through price and output,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFocusing on these metrics instead blinds us to the potential hazards.\u201d    Amazon\u2019s Bezos has always admitted he is playing a long game, Khan argued, and once the company has become dominant in an industry, it can raise prices.    Sellers who use Amazon\u2019s platform say the company has already started to do that.    In a study released Tuesday, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance found that Amazon keeps 30 percent of each sale made by third parties who use its marketplace, up from the 19 percent it kept five years ago. Fees charged to third-party sellers brought the company about $60 billion in 2019 \u2014 about 21 percent of Amazon\u2019s total revenue.    While the company\u2019s legendary levels of customer service may benefit consumers,  those benefits don\u2019t extend to third-party sellers who make use of Amazon\u2019s marketplace, said Douglas Mrdeza, the CEO of Top Shelf Brands in Lansing, Mich. Mrdeza began selling on Amazon in 2014 after inadvertently ordering too much product for his barbershop. The company quickly grew by offering to help other companies \u2014 like Tootsie Roll, Bedhead hair products and Hatchimals  toys \u2014 sell on Amazon. Over time, though, the amount the company charged for advertising and other fees began to grow, he said.    Amazon was \u201cvery promising in the beginning. But they\u2019ve got this whole system designed where they get sellers in door, but as time goes on they squeeze every dollar you could be making out of you,\u201d said Mrdeza, who said Top Shelf ranked among the top 50 U.S. sellers on Amazon. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a future selling on Amazon.\u201d    Mrdeza, who participated in a call hosted by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance with other small companies critical of Amazon, said he hoped speaking out might help other sellers on the platform.    \u201cSellers are the most profitable aspect of your business,\u201d Mrdeza said. \u201cWhen we have our own complaints, why aren\u2019t the same levels of customer service being offered to us as to consumers? That\u2019s the biggest disconnect between their public statements and what the reality is.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42711225226</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-GFW1-F07F-81HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2414\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Politico</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Going into 2018, given sky-high tech stock valuations[1]and their big run in 2017, various market strategists[2]were recommendingthat investors rotate out of the sector. Nonetheless, more than55% ofthe gain in the S...00 Index (SPX)[3]for the year-to-date through February 20wasdriven by just fourtech giants, based onanalysis by S...ow Jones Indicesfor The Wall Street Journal[4].These are Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[5]),Microsoft Corp. (MSFT[6]),Netflix Inc.</p><p>(NFLX[7]),andNvidia Corp. (NVDA[8]).Their respective contributions were27%, 13%, 8%and 7%, per the same sources.\"When you see a Netflix or Amazon leading, it's not necessarily a great sign ofinvestor confidence, since you know those names can always deliver growth no matter what's going on,\" is what Jack Ablin, founding partnerand chief investment officer of Cresset Wealth Advisors told the Journal. Predictions Gone Wrong  Against a background of a strong U.S. and global economy, with GDP[9] growth forecasts being ratchetedupwards in recent months, economically sensitivecyclical stocks[10] were widelyexpected to lead the marketin 2018. These includemanufacturers, energy companies, banks,commodities producersand basic materials suppliers,the Journal notes.Banks constitutethe one groupamong these that has been a leader.The Financials Select Sector Index (IXM) has advanced by 4.0%for the year-to-date through February 23, per S...ow Jones Indices[11], beating the2.8% gain for the S...00.However, the Materials Select Sector Index (IXB) is up by just 1.2%.Industrials had soared in the aftermath of the 2016 election based onthe massive infrastructure spending program advocated byPresidentTrump. As this program has stalled, so have these stocks. They staged a rally late in 2017, but have cooled off since then. The Industrials Select Sector Index (IXI) has gained2.5% year-to-date.(For more, see also: 6 Stocks That Will Rise With the Global Economy[12].) BigValue Detractors  Energy stocks have been hit particularlyhard in 2018.Just two of them,Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM[13]) and Chevron Corp. (CVX[14]), tookaway about 12% of the S...00's advance through February 20, per S...ow Jones Indices and the Journal.Rounding out the five biggest drags on the S...00 throughthat date wereProcter ...mble Co. (PG[15]), Johnson ...hnson (JNJ[16])and General Electric Co. (GE[17]). These threecollectively knocked about 16% off the index, the Journal adds. The Fabulous Foursome  These are the performance figures for the four big tech stocks mentioned above, for the year-to-date through February 23,per Yahoo Finance: Amazon: +28.3% YTD, 97.47 forward P/EMIcrosoft: +10.0% YTD,23.93 forward P/ENetflix: +49.0%, 67.60 forward P/ENvidia: +27.2% YTD, 33.87 forward P/E The FAANG[18] stocks propelled the marketin 2017, but constituents Facebook Inc. (FB[19]), Apple Inc. (AAPL[20]),and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL[21]) have lagged Amazon and Netflixin 2018 due to mixed earnings reports and increased regulatory scrutiny, the Journal says. Nonetheless, all threehave performed much better than the S...00,up 3.9%, 4.1%and 7.1%, respectively, for the year-to-date through February 23. Tech Extends Dominance  The S...00 Information Technology Index (S5INFT) was up 36.9% in 2017 and has gained 7.5% so far in 2018, through February 23,according to S...ow Jones Indices.The respective figures for the full S...00 were19.4% in 2017 and 2.8% for year-to-date 2018.Thus, the ratio of tech stockgains to the advancefor the broader market has jumped from 1.9times in 2017 to 2.7times so far in 2018.Meanwhile, theS...00 Consumer Discretionary Index (S5COND) is up 7.2% for year-to-date 2018, driven almost entirely by the performance of Amazon and Netflix, per data presented by the Journal.Another way to look at the situation is to note that, per the Journal, thetechnology sectoras a whole accounted for75% of the increasein the S...00 for the year-to-date through February 20. Reclassify Amazon and Netflix from consumer discretionary to information technology, and tech accountedfor an astounding 110% of thatadvance. As a result, all the other constituents of the index combined to reduce its value by 10%. Financials, health careand industrials wereup, materials wereneutral, whiletelecom, utilities, real estate, energyand consumer staples weredown. Good News, Bad News  Nonetheless, the bulls note that the fourth quarter earnings season is shaping up as one of the best ever. More than half the companies that have reported so far arebeating consensus EPS estimates[22]. Moreover, positive earnings surprises[23] that beat forecastsare being met with subdued reactions among investors. Perhaps expectations about earnings are finally coming into alignment with reality. Likewise, those earning announcements that miss forecasts also are being met with unusual calm.(For more, see also: Why Big Stock Investors Are Bearish Despite Rally[24].)On the other hand, the increased dominance of tech stocks in general, and those four leaders in particular, suggest that the market may be in a precarious situation. If those stocks stumble for whatever reason, sending the S...00 downward, that may touch off a general stampede to the exits, particularly among investors in index funds[25] and ETFs[26]. Meanwhile, the Investopedia Anxiety Index (IAI)[27]is recording extremely high levels of concern about the securities markets among our millions of readers worldwide.(For more, see also: 6 Forces That May Push the Stock Market Lower[28].)

The shift to virtual classrooms has made reliable wifi all the more crucial at a time when so many people are teleworking.    My family understood the need for speed when we bought a house this summer in rural Maryland. Virtual work and classes meant that stable internet access was a critical priority. Unfortunately, we did not have many options for providers. Our choices were Comcast or nothing.    Getting started was brutal. Service that was supposed to be ready on move-in day got postponed\u2014again and again\u2014with promises of \u201cnext day\u201d fixes that went on for seven weeks. Instead of working from home, we found ourselves stuck in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot clinging to the free signal or relying on our neighbors\u2019 benevolence by camping on their back porch when they were away.     During that span, my husband and I became experts at navigating the Comcast phone menu. The hack that worked best for us was calling the sales number rather than technical support. Reaching the right person still took at least 20 minutes each time, but Comcast lowers the barriers when it thinks it might have a potential new customer on the line.    Each time we broke through the automated resistance, staff members were friendly but limited in how they could help due to the labyrinth of red tape. To make matters worse, we never could speak to the same person twice, which killed followthrough and accountability.     Ultimately, we encountered processes and systems set up by a company not concerned about rivals coming in and taking their business. Why scramble to be faster, cheaper and better when you have a captive audience?    Many \u201cmonopolies\u201d struggle with the same lethargy, but not all. Amazon, for example, has cornered the market on home delivery of products\u2014another critical priority under Covid-19\u2014without sacrificing quality service. The company has had no trouble meeting our needs in rural Maryland. It delivers consistently with overnight and same-day service. And when we need to return a product, the process is simple with no questions asked.    The different experiences relate to the way monopolies form. Two major categories exist. Companies in the first group tend to move slow, while companies in the second group tend to stay nimble. The key is the role of the government in creating barriers to entry.    Government-Created \u201cNatural Monopolies\u201d    Companies like Comcast do not gain monopoly status by outhustling the competition. Instead, they create agreements with local governments that bar other providers from entering the area. The rationale for such economic protectionism goes back to AT&amp;T, which dominated U.S. telecommunications for most of the 20th century.    Economic law dictates that consumer prices come down and quality goes up with competition. But AT&amp;T executives successfully lobbied for the reverse. In the face of new entrants making inroads in various regions, they convinced regulators that the best way to serve the public was to block duplication of effort. Why build new trenches or lay new lines when perfectly good ones already existed?    Health care, mass transit and utility executives use similar claims to gain special access to government favors. Leaders in all of these industries cite high startup costs, which they say justify the creation of \u201cnatural monopolies\u201d to achieve the necessary economies of scale.    That\u2019s how the argument goes, which rests on the assumption that supply and demand is static, and not affected by innovation over time. But case after case shows that when master planners use their political power to strip away market pressures associated with competition, they achieve the opposite of the stated intentions of creating access and affordability. Research by Adam Thierer at George Mason University highlights how this happened with AT&amp;T.    Companies that rely on government protection quickly lose the incentive to innovate. The first casualty is customer connection, a key component of organizational soul . Instead of worrying more about you and me, these companies focus on keeping their government partners happy in a system that engenders lobbying and cronyism.    The AT&amp;T racket was ultimately broken up in 1982. When it comes to \u201cnatural monopolies,\u201d the government giveth, and the government taketh away. But the day of reckoning has not yet arrived for Comcast, which still enjoys perks such as exclusive rights-of-way on public and private land.    Government regulators not only enable this in the first place, but also deliberately mask the extent of the problem by overstating access in rural and marginalized communities. So, Comcast can rest in knowing people have no option but to wait.    Growing Through Continuous Improvement    Other monopolies carve their niches without government erected barriers, which requires  them to build strong customer connections. What else do they have to prop them up when things get tough? Often these companies circumvent entire industries\u2014inventing new ways of doing things that nobody previously considered\u2014or they leapfrog the competition by improving existing methods.    Amazon combined both techniques. When the company started selling books online in 1995, nobody saw ecommerce as a serious threat to bricks-and-mortar retail. Customers wanted the tactile experience of walking into a store, testing a product and taking it home immediately.    Shoppers did not want to wait six to eight weeks. Even if they had the patience, they worried about sharing their credit card information on the internet. They also worried about return policies.    Amazon solved these problems by reinventing the consumer experience. Rather than relying on government handouts, the company relied on innovation to outcompete Walmart and other retail heavyweights. Founders like Jeff Bezos were pioneers.    History provides ample examples of reconfiguration of business models. In consumer retail, probably the most famous Amazon precursor was the Sears Roebuck Catalogue, which started circulating in 1897. For the next several decades, U.S. families would sit at their kitchen tables, flip the pages and dream\u2014not unlike the people who browse on their smartphones in 2020.    The only things missing were speed, security and crowdsourced reviews. These are the things Amazon added by capitalizing on cutting edge technologies. But just because the company has found success does not mean it can relax. Even if there is no current competitor, the potential threat of entry can keep them from growing complacent.    Many brands have maintained monopoly status for periods of time, only to get outcompeted later by newcomers. Recent examples include MySpace, Blockbuster, Kodak and BlackBerry. Even Walmart, the company that caught Sears from behind, has had to pivot to keep pace with Amazon.    The key for survival is continuous improvement. Companies lose sight of this when they start using regulation as a substitute for innovation. As I discuss in a previous column , Amazon may be moving in this dangerous direction, given its second headquarters in Washington, D.C. If true, Amazon may well lose its Day One mentality , which is all about obsessing over products and services that are faster, cheaper or better.    Regulators claim their intervention helps improve the consumer experience, but the public should be wary of such claims. Policy analysis by Ryan Bourne at the Cato Institute debunks the notion that Big Tech needs a nanny.    Despite all the good intentions, master planning consistently falls short as a substitute for competition. Some people blame the failure on out-of-control capitalism. They say some firms are simply too big to care, but size is not the problem. Many large companies do a good job anticipating consumer needs and responding to them, increasing access and affordability along the way.     When it comes to monopolies, not all are created equal. Some are manufactured and propped up by the government, while others are held together by innovation and commitment to providing customer value.    As the tale of the two monopolies shows, the distinction makes all the difference for universal and affordable access to customers as Covid-19 creates an unprecedented need for teleworking and home

It feels like only yesterday when in August 2018 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">Apple became the world's first company to exceed $1 trillion in value</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the time, it was an achievement that left investors stunned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">The figure seemed dizzying</url>, capping a more than 50,000pc share price surge since the moment when Apple first floated on the stockmarket in 1980.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, despite market gyrations, a trade war and an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">ongoing global pandemic which has ushered in the worst economic crisis for generations</url>, under two years later Apple already stands at $1.68 trillion-and counting.</p><p>Meanwhile, three other companies have grappled their way into the club of trillion dollar companies: Microsoft at $1.58 trillion, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">Amazon at $1.57 trillion</url> and Google-owner Alphabet at $1.06 trillion.</p><p>As Big Tech's biggest beasts prepare to release their results over the coming days, which of them is best placed to cross the $2 trillion threshold first?</p><p>To be sure, the bloated valuations of these companies still feel unfathomable.</p><p>Put together, those four alone are now worth $5.85 trillion-slightly higher than the $5.7 trillion GDP recorded last year by Japan, the world's third biggest economy after the US and China.</p><p>The figure is nearly treble the combined market valuation of all the companies in the FTSE 100 which stands at \u00a31.7 trillion ($2.1 trillion), while Britain's biggest single company, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">AstraZeneca</url>, is worth a piffling \u00a3111bn ($141bn)-a mere pimple on Apple's armpit.</p><p>Justified or otherwise, there is no denying the extraordinary success of these companies, which have thrived during a prolonged period of economic dislocation while many others have struggled to survive.</p><p>Apple, which generated sales of $124bn in the six months ending March 28, may be the Goliath of the global technology industry but it may not be the most obvious candidate to hit $2 trillion first.</p><p>That's because despite efforts to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">reduce its heavy reliance on the iPhone</url>, and a recent focus on services and wearables as the next big growth opportunities, at its heart Apple remains a hardware company which is more exposed to deteriorating relations with China than its peers.</p><p>Apple has enjoyed a recent lift at the expense of Huawei, a key competitor which has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">hammered by US sanctions and restrictions</url> on its use of cutting edge US chip designs.</p><p>Nevertheless, the iPhone still generates roughly half of Apple's sales, while other devices-iPads and Macs-take the share of hardware up to 75pc of overall sales.</p><p>Smartphones remain a stagnant market of course. Global sales of smartphones across the industry fell 20pc in the first quarter of 2020, according to Gartner which also predicts global device shipments-including PCs, tablets and phones-to fall 14pc this year.</p><p>Such figures are distorted by the Covid-19 lockdown, but even a potential boost from the launch of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">Apple's first 5G iPhone</url>, expected in September, is unlikely to significantly move the dial.</p><p>Apple has struggled to develop its next killer product to supplant the Mac, iPad and iPhone of yesteryear, while services income may come under pressure amid anger over the stiff commissions charged to third party developers using its app store.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tim Cook's colossus, which produces most of its devices in China-the world's biggest smartphone market-faces a serious challenge grappling with deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing.</p><p>A comprehensive reordering of its supply chain is in the offing-which won't be easy or cheap.</p><p>                     If not Apple, then who?                   </p><p>Microsoft has been the tech industry's dark horse in recent years. After a rocky period a few years back, under chief executive Satya Nadella the Seattle-based company has overseen a remarkable comeback through a far-sighted pivot into cloud computing and an overhaul of what many viewed as a toxic culture.</p><p>Once written off as a has-been which famously fumbled the rise of the smartphone through an ill-judged acquisition of Nokia, then another has-been, Microsoft has enjoyed a boost from the pandemic through the surging popularity of services like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">Microsoft Teams</url>.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is not Microsoft but its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">cross-town rival, Amazon</url>, which of all of the big tech companies arguably has the greatest shot at hitting the $2 trillion mark first.</p><p>Without Apple's Chinese headaches,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">Jeff Bezos's</url> corporate octopus has so many limbs growing at such a phenomenal pace it sometimes seems hard to keep track of them all.</p><p>Amazon also has a clear runway of growth in the years ahead, not only in its core e-commerce business but across several others.</p><p>Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud computing arm, is still growing at over 33pc per year.</p><p>Amazon Prime Video, its streaming business, is likely to have enjoyed a boost from lockdown viewing, while its often overlooked advertising business, is rapidly emerging as a serious contender to Facebook and Google.</p><p>Amazon is somewhat cagey about the performance of this unit, refusing to break it out. </p><p>But its \"other\" category, which mostly covers the ad division, was up a stunning 44pc in the last quarter to $3.9bn in revenue. </p><p>The company possesses detailed insights into its customers' tastes, their likes and dislikes, and it's increasingly leveraging that information for fresh commercial advantage. </p><p>Then of course there is e-commerce, where Amazon remains hugely dominant and where it has enjoyed a huge advantage during the temporary shutdown of so many bricks and mortar retailers.</p><p>There is also still huge scope for growth, especially in international markets.</p><p>For Jeff Bezos, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/08/02/apple-wins-race-become-first-trillion-dollar-company/\">who will appear before a US Congressional hearing into competition next Monday</url>, the company's biggest threat does not come from its rivals so much as from politicians and regulators.</p><p>From the amount of tax it pays to the impact Amazon is having on the high street and the dominance of its cloud computing arm, as it edges towards $2 trillion in value Bezos's extraordinary creation is facing growing calls to be pruned back.</p><p>Whether or not that pressure yields results, Mr Bezos doesn't have too much to worry about.</p><p>The world's richest man-whose personal stake in the company jumped by $13bn in value on Monday alone to a total of $189bn-is unlikely to feel the pinch any time soon.</p><p>                     What do you think is the reason for Amazon's success?

Predictably, this lofty proclamation has met with both elation and skepticism. But the statement is notable not so much for its content as for what it reveals about how US CEOs think. Apparently, America's corporate leaders believe they can decide freely whom they serve. </p><p>But as agents, rather than principals, that decision really is not theirs to make.The fact that American CEOs think they can choose their own masters attests not just to their own sense of entitlement, but also to the state of corporate America, where power over globe-spanning business empires is concentrated in the hands of just a few men, and far fewer women. As a matter of corporate law, CEOs are appointed by a company's directors, who in turn are elected by that company's shareholders every year. In practical terms, though, most directors remain on the board for years on end, as do the officers they appoint.For example, Jamie Dimon, the chairman of the Business Roundtable's own board of directors, has been at the helm of JPMorgan Chase for over 15 years. During most of that time, he has served as both CEO and chairman of the board of directors, in contravention of corporate-governance principles that recommend separating these two positions.By capturing the process to which they owe their own positions, American CEOs have made a mockery of shareholder control. The Business Roundtable itself has long favoured plurality over majority voting, which means that incumbent board members need only receive more votes than anybody else, rather than a majority. At the same time, the organisation has fought the Securities and Exchange Commission tooth and nail to block a rule that would allow shareholders to write in their own candidates when votes are solicited. And it continues to try to weaken shareholders' ability to propose agenda items for shareholder meetings.In short, for the Business Roundtable and the CEOs it represents, shareholder primacy has never meant shareholder democracy. Instead, the shareholder-value model has given CEOs cover to avoid discussing corporate strategy, especially when it comes to considering alternatives to the share price as a metric for corporate performance. For CEOs, the share price is everything, because it protects the company from takeovers, the greatest threat to incumbent managers, and it increases their own remuneration.Why, then, would CEOs come out against a\u00a0status quo\u00a0that has allowed them to reign almost unchallenged, in favour of a stakeholder-governance model that puts employees and the environment on an equal footing with shareholders? The answer is that revolutions often devour their children. Share-price primacy has not only ceased to protect CEOs in the way it once did; it has become a threat.After all, it is one thing to champion shareholders when they are too dispersed to organise themselves. It is quite a different matter when shareholders have assembled into blocs with effective veto power and the ability to coordinate in pursuit of common goals. Some 74 per cent of JPMorgan Chase's shares are held by institutional investors, five of which, including Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, control one-third of total shares. And JPMorgan is not alone. Recent research in the US shows that the\u00a0same few global asset managers\u00a0are top shareholders at almost all of the largest financial intermediaries, Big Tech firms and airline companies.For CEOs, the emergence of powerful shareholder blocs has changed the corporate-governance game. With trillions of dollars of savings that need to be invested, institutional investors simply cannot be ignored. Even if asset managers do not actively involve themselves in corporate governance, they can still send a powerful signal to the market simply by dumping shares.For years, the shareholder-primacy model led CEOs to eke out profits through outsourcing or labour-force downsising, regulatory and tax arbitrage and stock buybacks that shower cash on shareholders at the expense of investing in their companies' future. But now, they have finally realised that these strategies are better for institutional investors than they are for the sustainability of firms.Confronted with the headwinds they themselves generated, American CEOs seem to have concluded that best defence is a good offense. But if they are serious about abandoning the shareholder-primacy model, public statements will not suffice. They must also support legal reforms, particularly the measures needed to hold corporate directors and officers accountable to the principals they serve. That could mean extending board representation to employees and other stakeholders, or it could take the form of special audits, along the lines of those to which public benefit corporations submit.Either way, if the new stakeholder model is going to amount to more than the old charade of 'shareholder democracy', the principals themselves must be involved in setting up the new regime. If we leave it for the agents to decide for themselves, we will end up right back where we started.\u00a0Katharina Pistor is professor of Comparative Law at Columbia Law School and the author of\u00a0'The Code of Capital: How the Law Creates Wealth and Inequality'\u00a0(Princeton University Press).

Predictably, this lofty proclamation has met with both elation and skepticism. But the statement is notable not so much for its content as for what it reveals about how US CEOs think. Apparently, America's corporate leaders believe they can decide freely whom they serve. But as agents, rather than principals, that decision really isn't theirs to make.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fact that American CEOs think they can choose their own masters attests not just to their own sense of entitlement, but also to the state of corporate America, where power over globe-spanning business empires is concentrated in the hands of just a few men (and far fewer women). As a matter of corporate law, CEOs are appointed by a company's directors, who in turn are elected by that company's shareholders every year. In practical terms, though, most directors remain on the board for years on end, as do the officers they appoint.</p><p>For example, Jamie Dimon, the chairman of the Business Roundtable's own board of directors, has been at the helm of JPMorgan Chase for over 15 years. During most of that time, he has served as both CEO and chairman of the board of directors, in contravention of corporate-governance principles that recommend separating these two positions.</p><p>By capturing the process to which they owe their own positions, American CEOs have made a mockery of shareholder control. The Business Roundtable itself has long favored plurality over majority voting, which means that incumbent board members need only receive more votes than anybody else, rather than a majority. At the same time, the organization has fought the Securities and Exchange Commission tooth and nail to block a rule that would allow shareholders to write in their own candidates when votes are solicited. And it continues to try to weaken shareholders' ability to propose agenda items for shareholder meetings.</p><p>In short, for the Business Roundtable and the CEOs it represents, shareholder primacy has never meant shareholder democracy. Instead, the shareholder-value model has given CEOs cover to avoid discussing corporate strategy, especially when it comes to considering alternatives to the share price as a metric for corporate performance. For CEOs, the share price is everything, because it protects the company from takeovers (the greatest threat to incumbent managers), and it increases their own remuneration.</p><p>Why, then, would CEOs come out against a status quo that has allowed them to reign almost unchallenged, in favor of a stakeholder-governance model that puts employees and the environment on an equal footing with shareholders? The answer is that revolutions often devour their children. Share-price primacy has not only ceased to protect CEOs in the way it once did; it has become a threat.</p><p>After all, it is one thing to champion shareholders when they are too dispersed to organize themselves. It is quite a different matter when shareholders have assembled into blocs with effective veto power and the ability to coordinate in pursuit of common goals. Some 74% of JPMorgan Chase's shares are held by institutional investors, five of which \u2013 including Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street \u2013 control one-third of total shares. And JPMorgan isn't alone. Recent research in the US shows that the same few global asset managers are top shareholders at almost all of the largest financial intermediaries, Big Tech firms, and airline companies.</p><p>For CEOs, the emergence of powerful shareholder blocs has changed the corporate-governance game. With trillions of dollars of savings that need to be invested, institutional investors simply cannot be ignored. Even if asset managers do not actively involve themselves in corporate governance, they can still send a powerful signal to the market simply by dumping shares.</p><p>For years, the shareholder-primacy model led CEOs to eke out profits through outsourcing or labor-force downsizing, regulatory and tax arbitrage, and stock buybacks that shower cash on shareholders at the expense of investing in their companies' future. But now, they have finally realized that these strategies are better for institutional investors than they are for the sustainability of firms.</p><p>Confronted with the headwinds they themselves generated, American CEOs seem to have concluded that best defense is a good offense. But if they are serious about abandoning the shareholder-primacy model, public statements will not suffice. They must also support legal reforms, particularly the measures needed to hold corporate directors and officers accountable to the principals they serve. That could mean extending board representation to employees and other stakeholders, or it could take the form of special audits, along the lines of those to which public benefit corporations submit.</p><p>Either way, if the new stakeholder model is going to amount to more than the old charade of \"shareholder democracy,\" the principals themselves must be involved in setting up the new regime. If we leave it for the agents to decide for themselves, we will end up right back where we started.</p><p>Katharina Pistor is Professor of Comparative Law at Columbia Law School and the author of The Code of Capital: How the Law Creates Wealth and Inequality.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSGHA-152593320</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSGHA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXG-5R41-F11P-X2J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">427903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business and Financial Times.

Predictably, this lofty proclamation has met with both elation and skepticism. But the statement is notable not so much for its content as for what it reveals about how US CEOs think. Apparently, America's corporate leaders believe they can decide freely whom they serve. </p><p>But as agents, rather than principals, that decision really is not theirs to make.The fact that American CEOs think they can choose their own masters attests not just to their own sense of entitlement, but also to the state of corporate America, where power over globe-spanning business empires is concentrated in the hands of just a few men, and far fewer women. As a matter of corporate law, CEOs are appointed by a company's directors, who in turn are elected by that company's shareholders every year. In practical terms, though, most directors remain on the board for years on end, as do the officers they appoint.For example, Jamie Dimon, the chairman of the Business Roundtable's own board of directors, has been at the helm of JPMorgan Chase for over 15 years. During most of that time, he has served as both CEO and chairman of the board of directors, in contravention of corporate-governance principles that recommend separating these two positions.By capturing the process to which they owe their own positions, American CEOs have made a mockery of shareholder control. The Business Roundtable itself has long favoured plurality over majority voting, which means that incumbent board members need only receive more votes than anybody else, rather than a majority. At the same time, the organisation has fought the Securities and Exchange Commission tooth and nail to block a rule that would allow shareholders to write in their own candidates when votes are solicited. And it continues to try to weaken shareholders' ability to propose agenda items for shareholder meetings.In short, for the Business Roundtable and the CEOs it represents, shareholder primacy has never meant shareholder democracy. Instead, the shareholder-value model has given CEOs cover to avoid discussing corporate strategy, especially when it comes to considering alternatives to the share price as a metric for corporate performance. For CEOs, the share price is everything, because it protects the company from takeovers, the greatest threat to incumbent managers, and it increases their own remuneration.Why, then, would CEOs come out against a\u00a0status quo\u00a0that has allowed them to reign almost unchallenged, in favour of a stakeholder-governance model that puts employees and the environment on an equal footing with shareholders? The answer is that revolutions often devour their children. Share-price primacy has not only ceased to protect CEOs in the way it once did; it has become a threat.After all, it is one thing to champion shareholders when they are too dispersed to organise themselves. It is quite a different matter when shareholders have assembled into blocs with effective veto power and the ability to coordinate in pursuit of common goals. Some 74 per cent of JPMorgan Chase's shares are held by institutional investors, five of which, including Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, control one-third of total shares. And JPMorgan is not alone. Recent research in the US shows that the\u00a0same few global asset managers\u00a0are top shareholders at almost all of the largest financial intermediaries, Big Tech firms and airline companies.For CEOs, the emergence of powerful shareholder blocs has changed the corporate-governance game. With trillions of dollars of savings that need to be invested, institutional investors simply cannot be ignored. Even if asset managers do not actively involve themselves in corporate governance, they can still send a powerful signal to the market simply by dumping shares.For years, the shareholder-primacy model led CEOs to eke out profits through outsourcing or labour-force downsising, regulatory and tax arbitrage and stock buybacks that shower cash on shareholders at the expense of investing in their companies' future. But now, they have finally realised that these strategies are better for institutional investors than they are for the sustainability of firms.Confronted with the headwinds they themselves generated, American CEOs seem to have concluded that best defence is a good offense. But if they are serious about abandoning the shareholder-primacy model, public statements will not suffice. They must also support legal reforms, particularly the measures needed to hold corporate directors and officers accountable to the principals they serve. That could mean extending board representation to employees and other stakeholders, or it could take the form of special audits, along the lines of those to which public benefit corporations submit.Either way, if the new stakeholder model is going to amount to more than the old charade of 'shareholder democracy', the principals themselves must be involved in setting up the new regime. If we leave it for the agents to decide for themselves, we will end up right back where we started.\u00a0Katharina Pistor is professor of Comparative Law at Columbia Law School and the author of\u00a0'The Code of Capital: How the Law Creates Wealth and Inequality'\u00a0(Princeton University Press).

Predictably, this lofty proclamation has met with both elation and skepticism. But the statement is notable not so much for its content as for what it reveals about how US CEOs think. Apparently, the U.S.'s corporate leaders believe they can decide freely whom they serve. But as agents, rather than principals, that decision really isn't theirs to make.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fact that American CEOs think they can choose their own masters attests not just to their own sense of entitlement, but also to the state of corporate America, where power over globe-spanning business empires is concentrated in the hands of just a few men (and far fewer women). As a matter of corporate law, CEOs are appointed by a company's directors, who in turn are elected by that company's shareholders every year. In practical terms, though, most directors remain on the board for years on end, as do the officers they appoint.</p><p>For example, Jamie Dimon, the chairman of the Business Roundtable's own board of directors, has been at the helm of JPMorgan Chase for more than 15 years. During most of that time, he has served as both CEO and chairman of the board of directors, in contravention of corporate-governance principles that recommend separating these two positions.</p><p>By capturing the process to which they owe their own positions, American CEOs have made a mockery of shareholder control. The Business Roundtable itself has long favoured plurality over majority voting, which means that incumbent board members need only receive more votes than anybody else, rather than a majority. At the same time, the organization has fought the Securities and Exchange Commission tooth and nail to block a rule that would allow shareholders to write in their own candidates when votes are solicited. And it continues to try to weaken shareholders' ability to propose agenda items for shareholder meetings.</p><p>In short, for the Business Roundtable and the CEOs it represents, shareholder primacy has never meant shareholder democracy. Instead, the shareholder-value model has given CEOs cover to avoid discussing corporate strategy, especially when it comes to considering alternatives to the share price as a metric for corporate performance. For CEOs, the share price is everything, because it protects the company from takeovers (the greatest threat to incumbent managers), and it increases their own remuneration.</p><p>Why, then, would CEOs come out against a status quo that has allowed them to reign almost unchallenged, in favour of a stakeholder-governance model that puts employees and the environment on an equal footing with shareholders? The answer is that revolutions often devour their children. Share-price primacy has not only ceased to protect CEOs in the way it once did; it has become a threat.</p><p>After all, it is one thing to champion shareholders when they are too dispersed to organize themselves. It is quite a different matter when shareholders have assembled into blocs with effective veto power and the ability to coordinate in pursuit of common goals. Some 74 per cent of JPMorgan Chase's shares are held by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/jpm/ownership-summary\">https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/jpm/ownership-summary</url>, five of which - including Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street - control one-third of total shares. And JPMorgan isn't alone. Recent research in the U.S. shows that the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3176696\">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3176696</url> are top shareholders at almost all of the largest financial intermediaries, Big Tech firms and airline companies.</p><p>For CEOs, the emergence of powerful shareholder blocs has changed the corporate-governance game. With trillions of dollars of savings that need to be invested, institutional investors simply cannot be ignored. Even if asset managers do not actively involve themselves in corporate governance, they can still send a powerful signal to the market simply by dumping shares.</p><p>For years, the shareholder-primacy model led CEOs to eke out profits through outsourcing or labour-force downsizing, regulatory and tax arbitrage, and stock buybacks that shower cash on shareholders at the expense of investing in their companies' future. But now, they have finally realized that these strategies are better for institutional investors than they are for the sustainability of firms.</p><p>Confronted with the headwinds they themselves generated, American CEOs seem to have concluded that best defence is a good offence. But if they are serious about abandoning the shareholder-primacy model, public statements will not suffice. They must also support legal reforms, particularly the measures needed to hold corporate directors and officers accountable to the principals they serve. That could mean extending board representation to employees and other stakeholders, or it could take the form of special audits, along the lines of those to which public benefit corporations submit.</p><p>Either way, if the new stakeholder model is going to amount to more than the old charade of \"shareholder democracy,\" the principals themselves must be involved in setting up the new regime. If we leave it for the agents to decide for themselves, we will end up right back where we started.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-why-americas-ceos-have-turned-against-shareholders/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-why-americas-ceos-have-turned-against-shareholders/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20190826ellipsis_B3ZAWDCH7JASTJ4YJ734VLHWSQ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WX7-CF11-F072-J32P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><timeReceived>11:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

But the statement is notable not so much for its content as for what it reveals about how US chief executives think.</p><p>Apparently, America's corporate leaders believe they can decide freely whom they serve. But as agents, rather than principals, that decision really isn't theirs to make.</p><p>The fact that American CEOs think they can choose their own masters attests not just to their own sense of entitlement, but also to the state of corporate America, where power over globe-spanning business empires is concentrated in the hands of just a few men (and far fewer women).</p><p>As a matter of corporate law, CEOs are appointed by a company's directors, who in turn are elected by that company's shareholders every year. In practical terms, though, most directors remain on the board for years on end, as do the officers they appoint.</p><p>For example, Jamie Dimon, the chairman of the Business Roundtable's own board of directors, has been at the helm of JPMorgan Chase for over 15 years. During most of that time, he has served as both CEO and chairman of the board of directors, in contravention of corporate-governance principles that recommend separating these two positions.</p><p>By capturing the process to which they owe their own positions, American CEOs have made a mockery of shareholder control. The Business Roundtable itself has long favoured plurality over majority voting, which means that incumbent board members need only receive more votes than anybody else, rather than a majority. At the same time, the organisation has fought the Securities and Exchange Commission tooth and nail to block a rule that would allow shareholders to write in their own candidates when votes are solicited. And it continues to try to weaken shareholders' ability to propose agenda items for shareholder meetings.</p><p>In short, for the Business Roundtable and the CEOs it represents, shareholder primacy has never meant shareholder democracy. Instead, the shareholder-value model has given CEOs cover to avoid discussing corporate strategy, especially when it comes to considering alternatives to the share price as a metric for corporate performance. For CEOs the share price is everything, because it protects the company from takeovers (the greatest threat to incumbent managers), and it increases their own remuneration.</p><p>Why, then, would CEOs come out against a status quo that has allowed them to reign almost unchallenged, in favour of a stakeholder-governance model that puts employees and the environment on an equal footing with shareholders? The answer is that revolutions often devour their children. Share-price primacy has not only ceased to protect CEOs in the way it once did; it has become a threat.</p><p>After all, it is one thing to champion shareholders when they are too dispersed to organise themselves. It is quite a different matter when shareholders have assembled into blocs with effective veto power and the ability to coordinate in pursuit of common goals. Some 74 per cent of JPMorgan Chase's shares are held by institutional investors, five of which - including Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street - control one-third of total shares. And JPMorgan isn't alone. Recent research in the US shows that the same few global asset managers are top shareholders at almost all of the largest financial intermediaries, Big Tech firms and airline companies.</p><p>For CEOs, the emergence of powerful shareholder blocs has changed the corporate-governance game. With trillions of dollars of savings that need to be invested, institutional investors simply cannot be ignored. Even if asset managers do not actively involve themselves in corporate governance, they can still send a powerful signal to the market simply by dumping shares.</p><p>For years, the shareholder-primacy model led CEOs to eke out profits through outsourcing or labour-force downsizing, regulatory and tax arbitrage, and stock buybacks that shower cash on shareholders at the expense of investing in their companies' future. But now, they have finally realised that these strategies are better for institutional investors than they are for the sustainability of firms.</p><p>CEOs seem to have concluded that best defence is a good offence. But if they are serious about abandoning the shareholder-primacy model, public statements will not suffice. They must also support legal reforms, particularly the measures needed to hold corporate directors and officers accountable to the principals they serve. That could mean extending board representation to employees and other stakeholders, or it could take the form of special audits, along the lines of those to which public benefit corporations submit.</p><p>Either way, if the new stakeholder model is going to amount to more than the old charade of \"shareholder democracy,\" the principals themselves must be involved in setting up the new regime. If we leave it for the agents to decide for themselves, we will end up right back where we started.</p><p>Katharina Pistor is professor of comparative law at Columbia Law School.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc76ucvfvn6agqfdvae4d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WX7-5021-F0J6-J30X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"890\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Subscribe to the newsletter <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton\">here</url>.</p><p>In February, the Washington Post's Tony Romm reported that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/14/us-government-facebook-are-negotiating-record-multi-billion-dollar-fine-companys-privacy-lapses/?utm_term=.53e3f422f976\">Facebook is negotiating a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission</url>. The company signed a consent decree with the FTC in 2011 in which it promised to improve its privacy practices. The settlement, he reported, would include a multibillion-dollar fine. At the time, Facebook had no comment. But in an unusual move today, the company essentially       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514805/facebook-q1-2019-earnings-ftc-record-fine-privacy-violations-3-billion\">confirmed the report as part of its quarterly earnings statement</url>.</p><p>Nick Statt reports:</p><p>The company <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.fb.com/files/doc_financials/2019/Q1/Q1-2019-Press-Release.pdf\">posted first quarter earnings today</url> for 2019, highlighting its continued monthly and daily active user increases and a 26 percent increase in year-over-year sales, up to $15.1 billion and ahead of Wall Street expectations. But Facebook also says it is setting aside $3 billion, or roughly 6 percent of its cash and marketable securities on hand, for the FTC fine that is coming down the pipeline at some point, likely later this year.</p><p> In the first quarter of 2019, we reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded an accrual of $3.0 billion in connection with the inquiry of the FTC into our platform and user data practices, which accrual is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet,  the company writes in its earnings statement.  We estimate that the range of loss in this matter is $3 billion to $5 billion. The matter remains unresolved, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome. </p><p>On an earnings call, the company said the $3 billion figure was at the low end of its expectations for a fine. Ashkan Soltani, who used to work at the FTC, suggested that Facebook might have taken the unusual step of pre-announcing a fine <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ashk4n/status/1121174275568746496\">as a negotiating tactic</url>  anchoring the price at a level that the company finds acceptable, while discouraging regulators from asking for any more.</p><p>In The Information, Ashley Gold <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-facebook-penalty-would-stack-up-against-past-corporate-fines\">compares a potential $3 billion fine</url> to some of the other big speeding tickets issued against tech companies. It would be exponentially bigger than the biggest fine issued by the FTC to date   $22.5 million, against Google in 2012. But it would be smaller than European actions against Big Tech. The EU issued a $15.3 billion fine against Apple in 2016, for tax evasion; and a $5 billion fine against Google last year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust\">for antitrust issues</url>. And it would pale next to fines levied against banks   such as the $16.7 billion fine the Justice Department issued against Bank of America in 2014 for defrauding consumers during the financial crisis.</p><p>Some lawmakers expressed dismay that the proposed fine against Facebook seemed rather low.  A predicted $3 billion seems paltry compared to $15 billion in profits last quarter,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1121183762505662464\">Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) tweeted</url>. Investors, on the other hand, were excited: Facebook stock rose after reporting a very good quarter, and added $40 billion or so to its market capitalization.</p><p>All of which raises the question: what would be an appropriate enforcement action for the US government to take against Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, which precipitated this latest inquiry?  </p><p>As best as I can tell, the FTC rarely lays out a rationale for how it arrives at fines. And the Cambridge Analytica scandal was deeply strange, as I never tire of reminding people. Most of its details had been known for the better part of two years when the story broke; Facebook had long since shut down the API access that Cambridge Analytica abused; and the resulting harm to consumers was unclear. (The idea that Cambridge Analytica's ill-gotten psychographic profiles of voters swayed the election, while explosive, doesn't seem to have swayed many political scientists.)</p><p>But the FTC's inquiry is taking place at a time when a vocal minority of Americans are calling for tech platforms to face real consequences after years of data leaks and breaches. The agency is also facing pressure to act from Congress, who have rightly <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/433514-gop-senator-ftc-response-to-privacy-scandals-has-been-toothless\">slapped the agency for its institutional bias toward inaction</url>.</p><p>On the surface, a $3 billion fine looks like a win to both the FTC and Facebook. For the agency, the move will inspire a round of headlines about its  largest fine ever,  and allow it to push back on the idea that it's an office full of empty suits. For Facebook, those same headlines will convey a welcome sense that the company is being held accountable for its past misdeeds, while simultaneously costing it a meaningless amount of money.</p><p>It's also possible that the fine could come with new restrictions on how Facebook collects or uses data, but I would be surprised if any of them required the company to change how it does business. The 2011 consent decree was, in essence, a pinky promise that the company would do better to protect our privacy. And then predictive technology got so good that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/opinion/computational-inference.html?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">companies can now infer our behavior while knowing almost nothing about us</url>, rendering many 2011-era privacy concerns quaint.</p><p>In such a world, a trivial fine over what is essentially a moot point can't help but look a little ridiculous. Some day, tech companies may face accountability for real. In the meantime, what they're facing looks a lot like theater.</p><p>DEMOCRACY</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://click.revue.email/mpss/c/BgE/cM9xAA/t.2r2/cwFX_StZSvuj3uSIZ8Ez8A/h12/KIdOTumnRYRRiItp8-2F9xuDelCBl6Nz67863kpsVcK8E2xPR2aH3DMiSOgAzMcsB4JUqr1A13D31YzSHE81K-2BryzJ4GLvdeojqkS-2FAqku8aypKPzMd5wBB-2BPv2fANXWNqX7a-2FDPfDhQfaoZdoOWaZJL1LjXQW-2Biwr6E4tPln-2B-2B2U-2FGsVSZokCR5Hvvs9QIQ-2BPhMHrQbFmLfhWQZTCDSDKps5wvpGFCc9tTVERcGGOrUA-3D\">Twitter Is Not America</url></p><p>Alexis Madrigal reports on a new Pew study that identifies differences between the average Twitter user and the average American.</p><p>In the United States, Twitter users are statistically younger, wealthier, and more politically liberal than the general population.

Back in the summer and fall of 2016, one of the recurring bogeyman the liberal media used to try and scare the public into voting for Hillary Clinton - in addition to poll after rigged poll showing Clinton is a 100% guaranteed winner, meant to suppress voter turnout - was that the stock market would instantly crash and never recover. How can one ever forget the blatant idiocy such as the following pablum from Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman who hours after the Trump victory wrote [3]\"It really does now look like President Donald J. Trump, and markets are plunging. When might we expect them to recover? we are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight.\" </p><p> Coming from the person who once said the internet would have the same impact on the world as a fax machine, one wouldn't expect more from the NYT op-ed writer, but his opinion did accurately represent what the mainstream was \"thinking\" at the time.  Which brings us to today and the growing odds that Elizabeth Warren will not only be the Democratic candidate, but may also be the next US president and yes, Hillary Clinton has somehow managed to sneak into 3rd place after Joe Biden.    It will hardly come as a surprise to anyone, that unlike Joe Biden    . Elizabeth Warren is widely seen as the most market unfriendly potential democratic president.    Warren's recent surge in the polls is also why last week Bank of America cautioned [4]that \"investors can't ignore election risk any longer.\"    Commenting on the possible consequences of a Warren victory, BofA said that the most straightforward is higher volatility, although the uniqueness of this scenario \"also implies there is not a readily available trading playbook investors can rely upon.\" The bank also cautioned that financials and health care companies will likely be the biggest \"president Warren\" casualties, as these two sectors stand to lose the most if Warren were to be elected, at least based on her track record and rhetoric.  In particular, Financials are likely to weaken on the risk of an increase in regulation (\"The real cause of the crash was not some inevitable cycle; this crash was the direct consequence of years of deliberate deregulation\", Apr 2014 - Elizabeth Warren). Arguably, Financials would also be hurt by falling yields if markets were spooked and a textbook flight-to-safety type of sell-off played out. The Health Care sector is also at risk given Warren's push for Medicare-for-All (\"I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke. One of the number-one reasons is the cost of health care, medical bills. [..] Medicare for all solves that problem\", Jun 2019 - Elizabeth Warren).  As a reminder, Warren has pitched ideas like 'accountable capitalism,' and advocated for consumers and employees over shareholders and investors. Her recent surge in key state and national polls has stoked concern about sectors such as biotechnology, for-profit schools, health insurance, and even the U.S. dollar. Some market players have voiced unease.  To be sure, we have covered all of this previously[5], and over the weekend JPM also issued a \"Warren warning\" writing that \"Investor concerns about Elizabeth Warren's tax and regulatory policies especially regarding banks, big tech, energy and healthcare are well known. So sustained increases in the likelihood of her running for the Presidency after winning the nomination could unnerve markets.\"  But just like in the case of the Trump warnings in 2016, is it possible that Warren's ascendancy to the presidency won't be such a shocking event for the market as it has been portrayed?  That is the argument made by RBC's head of US equity strategy, Lori Calvasina, who today published \"four thoughts\" on the implications for the US equity market if Warren wins the White House in 2020, in which she writes that \"any pain from a Warren win is likely to be temporary,\" noting that \"most of the sectors at high risk under a Warren presidency from a policy perspective (Financials, Energy, Health Care, Industrials) are already deeply undervalued versus the broader market\" (both Morgan Stanley and Bank of America would wildly disagree with this).  Not only does Calvasina think that the downside is limited, she also believes that there is much more upside for what else, the market's latest virtue signalling darling, ESG investments, noting that the election of a progressive Democrat could be \"supportive of the already growing popularity of ESG as an investment approach.\"  The RBC strategist also predicted that small caps might outperform larger stocks, as they may have less direct risk from policy changes in a time when anti-trust threats are swirling around the tech giants; Indeed, any breakups of big technology companies 'would be a problem' for a few stocks with 'mega' market capitalizations, though it could be a positive for retailers and others that have suffered from the rise of Amazon.com, she wrote. And regional banks might be hurt less than the bigger financials.  In summary RBC is confident that just like with the Trump election, the market response would be far more muted than consensus expects: \"the stock market tends to go up over time, regardless of who occupies the White House. This is true even when Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress.\"    Calvasina ends on an optimistic note: \"ultimately we think Corporate America and U.S. equity investors would learn to adapt to new political leadership, as they always do.\"  Below we represent RBC's \"four thoughts\" on what the implications for the stock market will be if Warren wins in 2020:  1. This risk could play out in the equity market well before Election Day. Though impeachment is pulling some of the impact into 4Q19, we have expected fears of a Warren win to be a headwind for the stock market in the first half of 2020 (particularly 1Q20), and that continues to be our view today. The timeline of events is key. The Iowa caucus takes place on February 3rd. Across all states, forty percent of the Democratic delegates will be assigned by early March, and roughly 2/3's will be assigned by the end of March. If Warren wins the nomination, we expect most of the pain associated with a White House victory to occur well ahead of Election Day.    2. The combination of a Warren White House and Democratic Congress would be extremely challenging for stocks from a bottom-up perspective. So far, Warren has distinguished herself in the primary through policy. The sheer multitude of her plans leaves US equity investors with few safe havens. Interestingly, the participants in our September investor survey highlighted Health Care as the primary sector at risk if Democrats sweep the White House and Congress in 2020.    But our own analysis, which relies heavily on a survey that we conducted of RBC industry analysts in early October plus our review of which sectors have been benefiting the most from lower corporate taxes and share buybacks, tells us that the combination of a Warren White House and Democratic Congress is also an extremely high risk for Energy and Financials. There is also a significant degree of risk for Industrials and Tech (though a bit lower than the three previously mentioned sectors). The implications for Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Materials, and Consumer Staples are mixed, while risks are lowest for Utilities and REITs. See page 15 for our 2020 election sector heat map, in which we outline which Warren policy positions seem likely to affect each of the major GICS sectors, as well as our overall take on the implications of the election for each sector.    3. Despite the myriad challenges at the sector level, we envision a number of investable themes that US equity investors would be able to focus on under this scenario. First, the election of a progressive Democrat seems supportive of the already growing popularity of ESG as an investment approach, since issues like climate change and fair pay could be in the spotlight. Second, dividends seem likely to become a more popular use of cash, since buybacks would be out of favor politically. This benefits the two sectors that we believe have the least direct policy risk (Utilities and REITs) but could also offset some of the pain in Financials and Energy, other major dividend payers which are already deeply undervalued relative to the broader US equity market. Other sectors also seem likely to shift their attention from buybacks to dividends, and we note that dividends were already in greater focus among S...00 companies in 2Q19 reporting season. Third, our initial assessment is that Small Caps may have less direct policy risk than Large Caps. Big Tech break ups would be a problem for a select few Mega Cap Internet names (affecting Large Cap Consumer Discretionary and Communication Services) but could be a positive for other Internet names along with Retailers that have suffered from the dominance of AMZN (many of which are Small Caps). Our SMID cap Banks analyst also sees a Warren presidency as a bit less of a negative for regional names than their big cap counterparts.  4. Any pain from a Warren win is likely to be temporary. While the broader US equity market looks expensive, particularly on non-P/E metrics which have not been pushed down by tax reform, most of the sectors at high risk under a Warren Presidency from a policy perspective (Financials, Energy, Health Care, Industrials) are already deeply undervalued vs. the broader market. More importantly, the stock market tends to go up over time, regardless of who occupies the White House. This is true even when Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Interestingly, the best historical returns in the S...00 have occurred with a Democrat in the White House, when Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress. In the short-term, stocks don't respond well to heightened economic policy uncertainty.    Ultimately we think Corporate America and US equity investors would learn to adapt to new political leadership, as they always do.

Suppose, for example, that you need to know tomorrow's weather. It makes perfect sense to share your location with a weather app so that it can warn you about rainstorms where you actually are.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Only then your data begins to migrate. The weather app outsources its virtual billboard space to an advertising network, which in exchange collects your location logs. The network sells that to a market research firm, or a data broker; maybe it even sprays it out to hundreds of other advertisers as it invites them to bid for the attention of someone just like you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In theory, your data is anonymous, tied together only by an unassuming string of numbers. But the data broker combines it with other, similar dossiers - from a shopping app, from a health app, from an app usage measurement firm - one of which happens to contain your email address. The broker now has a complete picture of who you are, tied to your real name, which would be of great interest to a debt collector, a spam marketer or a police force.</p><p>All this is made possible by your unique advertising number, which clings to your data throughout its strange journey. While theoretically separate from your actual identity, and billed as a way to give advertisers market intelligence without violating privacy, \"ad IDs\" can be connected back to your identity by those who know how.</p><p>That is why Apple's next big iPhone update will abruptly blow them apart - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/06/24/advertisers-claim-iphones-new-anti-tracking-tech-will-lead-dramatic/\">to the alarm of those who make a living from ad tracking</url>.</p><p>\"What they are doing is pulling the rug out from underneath us,\" says Zach Shakked, a 24-year-old software developer in New York City who depends on adverts to attract new users. \"It took me so much time to get this up and running, and the fact that it's all going to be useless in two months just makes me sad.\"</p><p>Big players are worried too. Facebook has told investors to expect a \"pronounced\" effect on its income this year, while a Google-backed lobby group <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/06/24/advertisers-claim-iphones-new-anti-tracking-tech-will-lead-dramatic/\">warned of a \"dramatic decrease\" in free apps</url>.

He expects Apple's crackdown to slash user targeting by between 50pc and 90pc, forcing a mass shift in business strategy which will be \"difficult for many apps\".</p><p>The trigger for this apocalyptic mood is an update to Apple's operating system, iOS, which will curb access to users' unique Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA). Before, apps could freely graze on IDFAs; now, they must seek specific permission, via a stark pop-up message whose format is rigidly dictated by Apple, to \"track you across apps and websites owned by other companies\". Surveys indicate most people will decline.</p><p>On its face, that might make advertisers' protests seem strange. Are they really objecting to having to ask for user consent, however bluntly? And if doing so will lead to most opting out, isn't that an effective admission that they never truly had people's consent in the first place?</p><p>That cuts little mustard with Ashkan Soltani, a former US regulator who helped lead <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/06/24/advertisers-claim-iphones-new-anti-tracking-tech-will-lead-dramatic/\">the successful campaign for California's landmark 2018 digital privacy law</url>. He argues that if people are scared by Apple's pop-up, it is only because they have never been made aware of how modern tracking actually works.</p><p>\"Apple is appropriately responding to concerns consumers had about where their data goes,\" he says. \"[Consumers] are consenting to playing a game of Angry Birds or to use a flashlight app... not to the myriad of third parties, some of whom neither users nor app developers are aware of. To argue that that's actually consent is ludicrous.\"</p><p>Indeed, David Barnard of RevenueCat, a firm that helps app makers manage subscription services, says Apple's main target is probably not Big Tech so much as the ID trade's obscure \"shadow companies\", who provide \"zero accountability, zero tools to opt out, zero visibility to the user whose data is being collected\".</p><p>Yet trade groups say they don't object to Apple's crackdown in principle. \"Of course we would prefer that everything was basically self-regulatory, with high levels of adoption,\" says Dennis Buchheim, president of the technical standards body IAB Tech Lab, which counts Facebook and Google as members.</p><p>But he would be satisfied if the new system was compatible with Tech Lab's voluntary consent framework, which he says enjoys robust adoption in Europe. \"Our take is that we should be moving to a privacy by default world, but it wouldn't just be this black or white,\" he says.</p><p>Specifically, Tech Lab argues that Apple's crude pop-ups lump benign uses of IDFAs - such as stopping users from seeing the same adverts too many times - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/06/24/advertisers-claim-iphones-new-anti-tracking-tech-will-lead-dramatic/\">in with the shadow brokers</url>. Worse, they are too simplistic to serve as legitimate consent under most big privacy laws, meaning users must raid through two consent processes in a row.</p><p>For developers like Shakked the danger is personal. He spends six figures per month on adverts for his latest app - a social media marketing tool called Hashtag Expert - which is only viable as long as he can prove that they bring in more than they cost.</p><p>\"I don't have venture capital money, so I need to know if there is a return,\" he explains. \"It's crucial, especially for bootstrap companies.\"</p><p>While he is sensitive to privacy concerns, and isn't wedded to IDFAs, he says Apple's replacement tracking system is too vague to be of any use.</p><p>The problem is that there are few other ways for Apple to police ad tracking, and self-regulation by definition cannot cover the most unscrupulous. Critics of the ad industry feel it has burned public trust, such as by neutering privacy laws via so-called \"dark patterns\" which make assenting to everything the path of least resistance.</p><p>Jason Kint, head of the online publishers' trade group Digital Content Next, gives the ad industry \"a zero for its efforts\", describing Apple's move as the \"natural outcome\" of ten years of advertiser resistance and chicanery.</p><p>It is also not clear how much killing IDFAs will really hurt the app market. \"If Apple's plan goes through, half of me thinks we're going to see a crazy implosion, an app store recession,\" says David Barnard. \"But then the other half of me realises the efficiency [of targeting] has been overstated... maybe it has a mild impact overall.\"</p><p>Many app makers will work around Apple's changes. Shakked plans to reroute all his adverts to a website where they create an account and pay for his app. That will tell him exactly how many people are convinced by each ad, while allowing him to avoid Apple's 30pc app store fee to boot. Other developers will move to subscriptions or micro-payments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/06/24/advertisers-claim-iphones-new-anti-tracking-tech-will-lead-dramatic/\">There is even evidence</url> that tracking might have been a false profit all along. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/06/24/advertisers-claim-iphones-new-anti-tracking-tech-will-lead-dramatic/\">One report</url> found that 49pc of news publishers' ad revenue was siphoned off by middlemen, with 15pc lost to \"unknown\" parties along the way.</p><p>Some publishers have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/06/24/advertisers-claim-iphones-new-anti-tracking-tech-will-lead-dramatic/\">seen their income rise</url> after they stopped tracking users and moved to old-school \"contextual advertising\" - that is, selling ads based on the page where they appear, like in the old days (though Buchheim contends this is only possible for the largest companies).</p><p>Whatever the result, it is impossible to ignore how Apple gains from what Barnard calls its privacy \"holy wars\". Killing the IDFA hurts Google and Facebook commercially, and Apple's ability to unilaterally plunge an industry into chaos <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/06/24/advertisers-claim-iphones-new-anti-tracking-tech-will-lead-dramatic/\">exemplifies the huge power it wields</url>.</p><p>How unfortunate for the ad trackers that they are about the least likely group to pique regulators' sympathy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-65086175</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JK-JXF1-F021-637S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1318\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Today users can install other apps, but by default these links will open Apple's own programs that are built into iOS.Additionally, the company might also be willing to let Siri directly control Pandora and Spotify on Apple's HomePod speaker. By contrast, Android owners can choose which mail program, photo library or browser is used by default.Flashback: Apple has long been on a different path from its rivals. </p><p>Back in 2003. Apple added its browser for the Mac, Safari, with Mac OS X Panther.At the same time, Microsoft was being attacked by regulators in the U.S. and Europe for wiring Internet Explorer into Windows. It was eventually forced to add a feature in Europe allowing customers to choose a rival browser. Apple's approach didn't irk regulators because the Mac had a tiny market share. But Apple adopted an even tighter approach with the debut of the iPhone in 2007. Apple's iPhone apps (Mail, Maps, Messages) come as defaults and there are no ways to change that. When it comes to the browser, rivals can create their own user interface, but all apps have to use Apple's browsing engine \u2014 the critical piece of software that dictates how a browser turns code into a web experience for users \u2014 limiting the amount of competition.Apps like Chrome and Firefox for iOS may carry bookmarks over from other versions, but at their core they still are all using Apple's browsing engine. Meanwhile: Apple has long had a significant share of the phone market, but not the majority, and regulators have generally allowed the company to set its own terms, despite some grumbling from rivals. Google has faced greater scrutiny over Android even though it generally maintains less strict control. Notably, the EU fined Google $5 billion[2] in 2018, saying Google unfairly tied its various applications together, requiring, for example, device makers that wanted the Google Play store to also install Google's search and browsing apps. Yes, but: While Apple has generally maintained a tight grip on its platforms, especially iOS, it has been known to open things up a bit. The most notable example is the App Store itself. The original plan for the iPhone didn't include third-party apps. Steve Jobs only wanted to support web apps that ran in the browser.Apple has also opened up in recent years to allow third-party keyboard applications as well as expanding Siri to work with some non-Apple applications. Between the lines: Apple has often held up its fussiness as a benefit to consumers. Back in May 2013, CEO Tim Cook said in an onstage interview that he believed Apple customers were paying the company to make choices on their behalf[3].\"I think you will see us open up more in the future,\" he said at the D: All Things Digital conference in 2013. \"But not to the degree that we put the customer at risk of having a bad experience.\" The bottom line: Because it has always had such a tight hold on its platform, Apple appears to have room to appease some critics while still maintaining much of the control it desires.Go deeper: What Apple knows about you[4] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-20/apple-weighs-loosening-restrictions-on-rival-iphone-music-apps\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-20/apple-weighs-loosening-restrictions-on-rival-iphone-music-apps</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/google-record-5-billion-antitrust-fine-eu-android-19fe76ed-11bf-45d9-9b1d-805c48e52060.html\">https://www.axios.com/google-record-5-billion-antitrust-fine-eu-android-19fe76ed-11bf-45d9-9b1d-805c48e52060.html</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130528/could-apple-be-getting-just-a-bit-more-open/\">http://allthingsd.com/20130528/could-apple-be-getting-just-a-bit-more-open/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/what-apple-knows-about-you-fa7fa529-05af-48fa-bc51-54c15a6f5fbc.html\">https://www.axios.com/what-apple-knows-about-you-fa7fa529-05af-48fa-bc51-54c15a6f5fbc.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544158255853846425876100050</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8W-0JH1-F03R-N221-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><timeReceived>3:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 24, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Below is an excerpt from the article: The most obvious acquisition in the [healthcare] space, Mr. Cramer said, is of EHR provider Epic. He noted that Epic and its competitors often engage in information blocking, or the refusal to share data between networks, which can lead to issues with patients' and providers' ability to access health records. However, Mr. Cramer notes that Apple launched its Health Records service last year, which allows iPhone users to access their own medical records from participating hospitals [see: Apple Getting Traction with Its App to Access EHR Records with iPhones;Cleveland Clinic and Apple Make EHR Data More Broadly Accessible via iPhones[3]]. He said Apple has the potential to act as the middleman between providers and hospitals with different EHR systems. \"If Apple wants to become the universal electronic health records provider, to be the handshake between, say, the [Apple] Watch's data and the [EHR] system, they're going to need to break into this market big, and the best way to do that is by acquiring the best [which is Epic]. Here's a list of the major reasons why I personally don't think that Apple would ever consider acquiring Epic: It's highly unlikely that Judith Faulkner[4], the founder of Epic, would ever consider selling the company and certainly not to Apple. I believe that her social and political orientation does not align with those of Big Tech and Apple. </p><p>As I have suggested before, I think that Apple is most interested in doing business in the first tier of health (i.e., primary care) and home health rather than the more complex processes that take place in hospitals (see: Defining and Delineating the Changing First Tier of Healthcare[5]). Moreover, most health systems are relatively unsophisticated from an IT perspective and would be unnerved by interacting with Apple/Epic as a vendor. Apple is already the market leader in the deployment of digital health in the home market with what I have called wearable health ecosystems (see: The Evolution of \"Wearable Health Ecosystems\" and Associated Partnerships[6]). This home health market is exploding whereas hospital inpatient admissions are declining on a year-to-year basis (see: Hospital admissions show glimmers of stability amid long-term decline[7]). The culture of Big Tech is to try to avoid, when possible, highly regulated sectors of the economy -- hospitals and inpatient care are some of the most regulated markets in the U.S. Thus, a no-go from this perspective. Apple has already been quite successful in cutting deals with healthcare systems to acquire access to their patient data which is their primary goal in order to develop financial lucrative predictive health algorithms (see: Points of Contention Between Hospitals and IT Companies Developing Algorithms[8]). What additional benefit would be gained as a an EHR vendor? It borders on bizarre that Cramer thinks that Apple would serve as a white knight to rescue healthcare consumers from \"information blocking\" by Epic. Apple would likely be opposed to EHR interoperability barriers because it militates against their acquiring the medical records of consumers and not in order to serve as an advocate for health consumers. I believe that the EHR monopoly, controlled by companies like Epic and Cerner at present, may be interrupted in the near future by a federal government with an orientation toward helping consumers rather than lining the pockets of big businesses. This could possible entail the development of a public utility in the cloud for all health records, including those generated by consumers at home. In other words, the Epic/health system monopoly might well be broken up in the near future.

Here are some of the reasons behind his warnings:<br/>Unequal regulation<br/>Traditional banks consider bigtech and new digital financial players to be subject to more lax regulation and demand more homogeneity in this regard. AEB President Jos\u00e9 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mar\u00eda Rold\u00e1n</emphasis> demanded yesterday through a \"greater clarity\" statement from the European authorities in the process of opening up to competition in the banking sector, \"so that when new technology operators enter the financial activity do so with the same rules of the game and the same level of demand that is currently required of banks.\" Rold\u00e1n denounced \"unequal\" competition between competitors, \"as there is no reciprocity of obligations and rights, as is the case with the issue of access to customer data\".<br/>Payments policy<br/>As a regulatory factor, the payment services directive known as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PSD2</emphasis>has become particularly important in recent months. This is how the AEB explains the scenario: The rule involves the opening, by banks, of their payment services to third parties, the so-called third party payment service providers (TPP), through the platforms that banks are obliged to create for this purpose (the already famous API or application programming interfaces). In this way, new entrants will have access to the customer data of the banks who authorize it, without reciprocity, that is, without the banks being able to access the customer data of those TPPs. Therefore, banks are calling for them to be allowed access to customer data for these new operators.<br/>\"This asymmetry is not acceptable and should be corrected by allowing banks access to that data. All companies, at least from a certain volume of operations, must be governed by the same rules,\" said Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Rold\u00e1n in his statement.<br/>Trading customers' money<br/>The real purpose of the tech giants in the financial world is not so much to be a bank, but to trade with customers' money. In fact, they lack a bank card - which would allow them to be a bank - because if they had it, they would be forced to submit to central bank regulation and maintain the solvency levels that are required of traditional entities.<br/>Instead, they do have other types of licenses. For example, Facebook and Amazon are licensed in Europe as a payment institution, as is Google, which obtained it in Lithuania and Ireland. These documents allow them to operate transfers, process receipts, make card payments or provide financing to customers. Pretty much everything a bank does except raise deposits.<br/>Data protection<br/>Data is the mostand the main goal of bigtech in their foray into the financial world. With them they can <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">know the consumption habits of customers</emphasis> and adapt in a very personalized way the products they offer.<br/>Traditional banking has a huge amount of information and consumer data, but it has not yet fully developed its potential to exploit it.<br/>By contrast, the tech giants have a huge capacity to handle massive amounts of information, hence their crusade focuses on obtaining data. In addition to profiling products, this data gives you the possibility to monetize the information by selling it to third parties for advertising purposes.<br/>Mastery and oligopoly<br/>\"One of our biggest concerns has to do with the lack of competition and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">level of concentration that could arise from</emphasis> a greater presence of bigtech,\" Said Margarita Delgado, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Spain. While it might be thought in principle that its market presence could introduce greater dynamism, \"you can imagine scenarios in which the consolidation of bigtech's dominance position in financial services threatens the possibility of rivalry effective,\" he explained.<br/>libra<br/>Within the fintech ecosystem, Libra is one of the elements that generates the most instability between authorities and governments of all countries. Delgado listed much of the threats that the Bank of Spain envisions in relation to the Facebook-driven project and almost thirty companies.<br/>\"Consumer protection issues stand out\" and the safeguarding of privacy. \"We cannot forget that the recent history of one of its promoters has not been characterized precisely by careful lytrating personal data,\" he said in clear reference to Facebook and scandals such as that of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cambridge Analytica.</emphasis> At the microeconomic level, it also poses challenges with regard to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.</emphasis><br/>At the macro level, the Bank of Spain conceives Libra as a possible threat to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">stability of the financial system.</emphasis> \"Pound could be a factor that amplifies financial market volatility, also affecting banks' payments business and deposit-taking activity with the consequent erosion of their income statement,\" Delgado said yesterday.<br/>In addition, it could limit the scope and effectiveness of monetary policy measures and, as regards <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">payment systems,</emphasis>it could drive parallel circuits to mobilize financial resources in economies. \"This would weaken the current role of the euro and other strong currencies as a safe liquidation asset and, if adequate supervisory mechanisms are not applied, mortgage the control and intervention capacity that financial authorities have today on infrastructure in the functioning of our economic system,\" warned the bank of Spain head.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8619154</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X39-J291-DY1R-B0KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"991\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Desiree Robinson was driven last Christmas Eve by a pimp to the house of a 32-year-old man who had logged on to backpage.com, a site allegedly responsible for three-quarters of online child sex trafficking in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pimp had posted a picture of Robinson on the site, calling her a \"New Girl in Town Looking to Have Fun\". At the assignation, the pimp fell asleep in his car. When he awoke, he found Robinson's badly beaten body in a garage. Her throat had been cut.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ambrose said: \"She had been beaten, raped, strangled, and if that wasn't bad enough, he slit her throat, all because she said 'no,' she didn't want to do this again.\"</p><p>The grief-stricken mother testified last week in support of a new bill that aims to stamp out online sex trafficking. This would seem an uncomplicated cause to support. But Google, which famously pledged it wouldn't \"be evil\", is fighting tooth and nail to kill the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (Sesta).</p><p>The bill could severely limit the ability of users to post content on the web. This, coincidentally, is the lifeblood of Google's businesses, including YouTube.</p><p>The world's second-largest company allying with sex traffickers - backpage.com is being pursued by several states - has created what could become a defining moment for Big Tech. Once seen as a bright new model of enlightened capitalism, Silicon Valley's giants have lost their sheen.</p><p>Increasingly, they are seen as something darker: frighteningly powerful corporate leviathans who aggressively protect their interests, crush competitors, and suffer from what The New York Times called a \"moral blindness\". This awakening by regulators, politicians and the public may signal the end of the industry's innocence.</p><p>Just four days ago, Mark Zuckerberg announced he would release to government investigators ads that Russian agents placed on Facebook to sway the US presidential campaign. This came just a day after operations boss <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg </nameText></person>issued a mea culpa over how the social media giant has allowed advertisers to place ads against keywords such as \"Hitler did nothing wrong\" and \"jew-hater\". Sandberg said: \"We never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way - and that is on us.\"</p><p>Whether it is due to the rise of \"fake news\", revelations of the gender and racial biases at the big firms, or simply the vast power that these giants have amassed, surprising new common ground has opened up between otherwise bitter rivals.</p><p>Steve Bannon, Donald Trump's former chief adviser and editor of extreme-right website Breitbart, claimed that before his abrupt exit he was leading a White House drive to regulate Google and Facebook like public utilities. In other words, as providers of a public good that would be governed by a thicket of strict regulations, such as a gas or telephone company. Similar positions have been voiced by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, leading senators as far to the other side of the political divide as one could get from Bannon.</p><p>Bill Kristol, a prominent neo-conservative and editor-at-large of The Weekly Standard, tweeted last month that the \"break-up of Big Tech could be a useful joint New Center/liberal/neo-libertarian project\".</p><p>The industry, led mostly by white men with big intellects but lacking EQ (emotional intelligence), reacts with quiet exasperation at such concerns. Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist well-known for backing Tesla and SpaceX, channelled many of the industry's views when asked at a tech conference last week about whether the Big Tech companies should be broken up. \"I think we have to get over the fact that in the technology business there are network effects and natural power laws that are inevitable and inexorable,\" he said.</p><p>The great reach of the internet means each industry will be eventually led by \"one company that matters\". Jurvetson added: \"And if we believe in democracy and capitalism, then we need to think of other ways to deal with the fact that there are going to be ever-increasing scales of inequality that come because of this.\"</p><p>The turning of the tide against tech feels sudden but has been building for years. A sexual harassment scandal here, market abuse allegations there.</p><p>A galvanising moment came this summer when New America, a progressive Washington think tank, fired one of its most prominent academics days after his division published a statement in support of the EU's $2.7bn (\u00a32bn) anti-trust fine of Google. Google and Eric Schmidt, chairman of parent company Alphabet, are New America's key funders. Schmidt is also chairman of New America's board.</p><p>The academic in question, Barry Lynn, has since set up Citizens Against Monopoly. On its website, he urges visitors to sign a letter to Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google. It says: \"Google's attempts to shut down think tanks, journalists, and public interest advocates researching and writing about the dangers of concentrated private power must end.\"</p><p>The Times this year exposed YouTube for running - and charging for - ads served next to extremist content.</p><p>When Brussels handed down its verdict in June - finding that Google ranked its services in search results over those of its competitors - the White House declined to back Google. For industry and Washington insiders it was a critical departure from the Obama administration, when there was a revolving door of senior executives moving between government and the search giant.</p><p>The EU's decision - which Google contests - was welcomed by competitors that claim to have struggled under Google's thumb for years. Yelp, a popular restaurant recommendation app, last year suspended European operations after years of what it claimed was unfair competition. Yelp's corporate communications head Vince Sollitto said: \"By the time we went international, Google was directly competing with us and there is no doubt that they very aggressively prioritised their competitor properties in search results, which severely limited the business.\"</p><p>Facebook, Amazon and Google have created vast funnels that capture traffic and commerce that 10 years ago would have been spread across a menagerie of sites. Facebook and Google together, for example, accounted for nearly 90% of online advertising growth last year. Facebook, which has become the news source of choice for a huge swathe of America, scoops up revenue that once flowed to national and local newspapers, leaving the industry a wasteland.</p><p>Amazon accounts for more than 40% of all online sales in America. That percentage is growing while traditional retail has plunged into crisis. The industry is on course for a record number of bankruptcies this year: the failure last week of Toys R Us was the latest example.</p><p>As they have grown, Amazon, Google's parent Alphabet, and Facebook have all ramped up lobbying efforts, hitting new spending records. In 2017, the trio have paid $6.2m, $9.5m and $5.6m respectively to Washington operatives charged with keeping regulations light and laws favourable.</p><p>The Sesta bill will be something of a litmus test. The bill would allow victims of sex trafficking to sue the websites that facilitate it, such as backpage.com.</p><p>The web giants argue that an unintended consequence would be the dramatic limitation of user-generated content, which, of course, is vital to their businesses. There may indeed be a more elegant way to regulate these new monopolies other than opening up them up to America's armies of ambulance-chasing lawyers. What is clear is that the goodwill in Washington, on which they have long relied, is running out, which will make it hard for even good arguments to be heard.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-37769880</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJF-WKW1-F021-6351-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1287\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 24, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D92S</classCode><className>SEX TRAFFICKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D92R</classCode><className>CHILD TRAFFICKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CET8</classCode><className>GRANDCHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D4OZ</classCode><className>CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTBBQjYwQkYwN0ZGNDQzOTlEMjIyRDEyMkE1RTAwRjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFENzYyRUI3RjFENEUwOEIyN0U0NEZBQjE5RjExMzk</classCode><className>Abuse of Children</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009Y72</classCode><className>CHRISTMAS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DLKC</classCode><className>STABBINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

In recent years, successive governments have admonished the industry for its alleged role in hiding the communications of terrorists[1], its resistance to assisting police[2], its lacklustre efforts to prevent the spread of hate online [3]and the minimal levels of tax it pays in Australia[4]. But these skirmishes over the amount of power big tech holds and the apparent efforts to entrench it have deeper roots, and global dimensions. It wasn't always this way. The dawn of the digital age in the late 1990s and early 2000s was greeted with tremendous optimism about the great promise of the internet. </p><p>Even the dot-com crash at the start of the new millennium did little to slow the ascent of today's tech giants. As their market power grew and they became indispensable tools for consumers and businesses, the cost of 'unplugging' seemed to be far higher than the cost of ceding some control of personal data. Governments around the world increasingly view this new reality as insidious and are beginning to crack down. Enamoured by the customer-centric mantras and the innovation revolution promised by Silicon Valley's darlings, global regulators mythologised big tech and took their collective foot off the brake. That was until a series of privacy scares brought home the realities of unchecked growth and tech monopolies. And while we have grown more sceptical about what personal data the smartphones in our pockets are capturing, dependence on those devices has only accelerated. There are apps that tell us where to go and how to get there, what we should listen to, how much money to save and where to invest it\u2014all driven by our data, either handed over for free or for a small fee. This data, when sold and run through algorithms, can inform advertisers about what we might be persuaded to buy, or, when sold to political campaigns, give insights into what might sway our votes. The Switzerland-based Global Center for Digital Business Transformation tracks how global tech giants' activities have expanded[5], often by using their dominance in data-rich businesses to break into new territory, as Amazon has done by integrating hardware like the Alexa virtual assistant and storefronts like Whole Foods[6] with its e-commerce platform. The prospect of a society driven by data has been explored in popular culture, often with Orwellian overtones. Black Mirror's exploration of the topic in the interactive episode 'Bandersnatch' unnerved viewers, even as Netflix was tracking their consumption habits[7] in real time. But while regular consumers are wary, and generally unwilling to remove themselves from these platforms, governments all over the world have indicated that they're going to step in. At the same time as companies and individuals began to fear their dependency on the tech giants, politicians were facing the same new reality. Political advertising dollars poured onto social media platforms and, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal[8] revealed, it became hard to determine where the platform stopped and the agents of influence began. In Australia, the blowback is most visible in traditional news media. Where once the broadsheets controlled how Australians got their news, today it's largely digital platforms that hold the reins, as an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry[9] found in July. Who has that power matters for consumers because the choice of news content we see\u2014and the data we relinquish in order to do so for free\u2014is increasingly beyond our control. Western governments facing budget deficits and disillusioned voters see an easy political target in the digital giants. The result has been a wave of anti-tax-avoidance measures either implicitly or explicitly aimed at tech multinationals, from the tightening of thin capitalisation rules in Australia, to the newly released OECD-led plan[10] for reaching a multilateral consensus on dealing with the taxation problems posed by the digitalised, globalised economy. The 'techlash[11]' is not unprecedented. Each wave of technological advancement, from the railways in the late 19th century to AT... telephone empire in 20th-century America, has been met with populist opposition and calls to break up monopolies and increase competition. But recent global moves to enact sector-specific regulation shows that policymakers are becoming more circumspect about the impacts of our digital dependency. US presidential candidates like Democrat Elizabeth Warren are using their platforms to call for the breaking up of big tech. Talk of this nature is gaining currency on both sides of the aisle at the congressional and state levels, too. Google, Facebook and Twitter have faced allegations of political bias in their algorithms from conservative figures in the US, including President Donald Trump himself. And last month, a bipartisan coalition of 50 attorneys general of US states and territories (minus California and Alabama) announced[12] their own antitrust probe into Google, in parallel with federal efforts led by the Department of Justice. The EU's competition authority has launched multiple inquiries into alleged anticompetitive conduct over the last decade, probing Google's eBooks platform, shopping search engine and more. With not-too-distant memories of the ineffective attempts in the late 1990s[13] to break up Microsoft, today's tech giants are taking proactive steps. Facebook is instituting concrete measures[14] to tie together its family of social media apps, including WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram. Unlike some of the giants of the past, big tech isn't well suited for the precedents and regulations that do exist. US competition law determines consumer harm based on price, but when consumers pay for services with an intangible currency\u2014their personal data\u2014we have to question whether the regulations are fit for purpose in the digital age. As long as the use of the major tech platforms continues to be free, with no way for users to monetise their own data, these issues are here to stay. And as much as it's woke[15] to bemoan the illusory promise of the internet giants, will millions of Australians still open Facebook or Instagram first thing tomorrow? Probably. And that's the best card that big tech holds.

In recent years, successive governments have admonished the industry for its alleged role in hiding the communications of terrorists, its resistance to assisting police, its lacklustre efforts to prevent the spread of hate online and the minimal levels of tax it pays in Australia. But these skirmishes over the amount of power big tech holds and the apparent efforts to entrench it have deeper roots, and global dimensions.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t always this way. The dawn of the digital age in the late 1990s and early 2000s was greeted with tremendous optimism about the great promise of the internet. Even the dot-com crash at the start of the new millennium did little to slow the ascent of today\u2019s tech giants. As their market power grew and they became indispensable tools for consumers and businesses, the cost of \u2018unplugging\u2019 seemed to be far higher than the cost of ceding some control of personal data.</p><p>Governments around the world increasingly view this new reality as insidious and are beginning to crack down.</p><p>Enamoured by the customer-centric mantras and the innovation revolution promised by Silicon Valley\u2019s darlings, global regulators mythologised big tech and took their collective foot off the brake. That was until a series of privacy scares brought home the realities of unchecked growth and tech monopolies. And while we have grown more sceptical about what personal data the smartphones in our pockets are capturing, dependence on those devices has only accelerated.</p><p>There are apps that tell us where to go and how to get there, what we should listen to, how much money to save and where to invest it\u2014all driven by our data, either handed over for free or for a small fee.</p><p>This data, when sold and run through algorithms, can inform advertisers about what we might be persuaded to buy, or, when sold to political campaigns, give insights into what might sway our votes.</p><p>The Switzerland-based Global Center for Digital Business Transformation tracks how global tech giants\u2019 activities have expanded, often by using their dominance in data-rich businesses to break into new territory, as Amazon has done by integrating hardware like the Alexa virtual assistant and storefronts like Whole Foods with its e-commerce platform.</p><p>The prospect of a society driven by data has been explored in popular culture, often with Orwellian overtones. Black Mirror\u2019s exploration of the topic in the interactive episode \u2018Bandersnatch\u2019 unnerved viewers, even as Netflix was tracking their consumption habits in real time.</p><p>But while regular consumers are wary, and generally unwilling to remove themselves from these platforms, governments all over the world have indicated that they\u2019re going to step in.</p><p>At the same time as companies and individuals began to fear their dependency on the tech giants, politicians were facing the same new reality. Political advertising dollars poured onto social media platforms and, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed, it became hard to determine where the platform stopped and the agents of influence began.</p><p>In Australia, the blowback is most visible in traditional news media. Where once the broadsheets controlled how Australians got their news, today it\u2019s largely digital platforms that hold the reins, as an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry found in July. Who has that power matters for consumers because the choice of news content we see\u2014and the data we relinquish in order to do so for free\u2014is increasingly beyond our control.</p><p>Western governments facing budget deficits and disillusioned voters see an easy political target in the digital giants. The result has been a wave of anti-tax-avoidance measures either implicitly or explicitly aimed at tech multinationals, from the tightening of thin capitalisation rules in Australia, to the newly released OECD-led plan for reaching a multilateral consensus on dealing with the taxation problems posed by the digitalised, globalised economy.</p><p>The \u2018techlash\u2019 is not unprecedented. Each wave of technological advancement, from the railways in the late 19th century to AT&amp;T\u2019s telephone empire in 20th-century America, has been met with populist opposition and calls to break up monopolies and increase competition. But recent global moves to enact sector-specific regulation shows that policymakers are becoming more circumspect about the impacts of our digital dependency.</p><p>US presidential candidates like Democrat Elizabeth Warren are using their platforms to call for the breaking up of big tech. Talk of this nature is gaining currency on both sides of the aisle at the congressional and state levels, too. Google, Facebook and Twitter have faced allegations of political bias in their algorithms from conservative figures in the US, including President Donald Trump himself. And last month, a bipartisan coalition of 50 attorneys general of US states and territories (minus California and Alabama) announced their own antitrust probe into Google, in parallel with federal efforts led by the Department of Justice.</p><p>The EU\u2019s competition authority has launched multiple inquiries into alleged anticompetitive conduct over the last decade, probing Google\u2019s eBooks platform, shopping search engine and more.</p><p>With not-too-distant memories of the ineffective attempts in the late 1990s to break up Microsoft, today\u2019s tech giants are taking proactive steps. Facebook is instituting concrete measures to tie together its family of social media apps, including WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram.</p><p>Unlike some of the giants of the past, big tech isn\u2019t well suited for the precedents and regulations that do exist. US competition law determines consumer harm based on price, but when consumers pay for services with an intangible currency\u2014their personal data\u2014we have to question whether the regulations are fit for purpose in the digital age.</p><p>As long as the use of the major tech platforms continues to be free, with no way for users to monetise their own data, these issues are here to stay. And as much as it\u2019s woke to bemoan the illusory promise of the internet giants, will millions of Australians still open Facebook or Instagram first thing tomorrow? Probably. And that\u2019s the best card that big tech holds.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2540659</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XC0-PJK1-JDG9-Y05F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1055\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 25, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

There are a number of reasons for this.    One is, as McKinsey explains (\u201c How banks can use ecosystems to win in the SME market \u201d), that \u201cfinding the optimal balance between providing a great customer experience and managing the cost to serve has\u2026proven to be difficult\u201d\u2014i.e., small companies can pay only small fees. Another is that the credit quality of SME assets tends to be uneven, so credit losses are potentially high.     What tech knows    Technology can help overcome those difficulties:    First, it allows lenders to analyse companies that do not fit pre-existing credit models by using \u201calternative data\u201d and alternative sources of data. That should broaden the scope and cut costs.    Second, technology can give lenders access to low-cost, real-time data on company performance and outlook, which not only helps support near-instant credit analyses but also advice and networking services.    Third, lenders could use \u201cbig data\u201d to build realistic models of the world in which an SME operates now and might operate in the future. Artificial intelligence and machine learning could then, in principle, be used to help small companies solve problems such as finding new opportunities, being sustainable or hiring the right staff.    What banks know    Really powerful solutions for SMEs are still in the future. This is partly because banks have always had a privileged data position: they know what the financial \u201cground truth\u201d of a company is. Cloud accounting and open banking can now make bank client data available to non-banks. However, they also make it easier for banks to access and use data from any customer in the market.    Alternative data, such as from a payments hub, can be used to see cashflow and, so, to build lending models\u2014but nothing beats the actual numbers. That is why alternative credit-scoring companies such as LendUp, which provides loans to individuals, \u201cseeded\u201d their algorithms by making small loans. That was the only way for them to be sure that non-financial data gave accurate enough insight into likely credit behaviour.    One of the challenges for incumbent banks is that, although they have \u201cground truth\u201d, their systems were not built to expose that data to the analytical tools used now.    \u201cIt can be easier for some banks to access and model their own data via the external facing open banking APIs than it is to access it from their own platforms directly,\u201d said Jonathan Holman, Head of Digital Transformation at Santander.    Why banks are needed    There are some big-tech platforms that look as though they should be better positioned than fintechs\u2014or even small lending banks\u2014when it comes to analysing SME performance. Amazon, for example, has data on cashflow, inventory, website ranking, the speed of response to customer requests and many other parameters. Amazon uses that data to price loans to the merchants on its site. In theory, that should work well. In practice, Amazon Lending struggled\u2014and is set for a relaunch this year.    What went wrong?    There were reports that Amazon couldn\u2019t really assess creditworthiness because its view of an individual SME\u2019s business was too narrow. In its 2018 annual report, Amazon said that the allowances for \u201cdoubtful accounts\u201d in its lending program were US$237 million at the end of 2016, $348 million at the end of 2017 and $495 million at the end of 2018, with additions on top of $48 million, $111 million and $147 million, respectively.    However, Amazon is not leaving the SME market. It announced in its fourth-quarter 2019 results that it will invest US$1 billion in helping MSMEs (micro, small and medium-sized enterprises) in India get online. The aim is to \u201cenable\u201d $10 billion in cumulative Indian exports by 2025. As of early February 2020, there were press reports that it is going to cooperate with Goldman Sachs and other banks on providing SME credit.    What SMEs want    Many SME founders have little more financial knowledge than the general public. That can make wrestling with the intricacies of getting funding or handling accounts a time sink. Ideally, a bank would take that burden away. However, that is not always what has been on offer.    \u201cSMEs need to focus on running their business, doing business day to day. Banks support this best by helping the management do business, not by helping them do banking. For some, this is a mindset shift in the industry,\u201d Holman explained.    That gap in the market, together with the rise of online businesses and \u201calternative data\u201d, has opened up potentially lucrative opportunities for non-bank financial-services firms to offer cost-effective and supportive services for SMEs\u2014including full-service banking. A number of fintechs\u2014including Coconut, Countingup, Mettle and Tide\u2014have launched in the United Kingdom to support SMEs. Big tech is equally interested in the segment, even if players such as Amazon have not done well in the United States and Europe to date.    A better partnership    SMEs can clearly benefit from speedy access to well-priced financing. Back-up support around taxes, accounting and strategy also has obvious value. What may be less beneficial is having to provide a large competitor with details\u2014even in part\u2014of the company\u2019s performance. A company like Amazon could, after all, use the information it has on the performance of small companies on its platform to move against them. It could, in theory, also offer that data to third parties that compete with those SMEs. The core business of big-data platforms is, after all, data\u2014not bookselling or financial services.    Banks, in contrast, are pure financial-services providers. They do not compete with their clients, and keeping data private is central to what they do. They are also large-scale, regulated, deposit-taking institutions. That gives them not only reach but lower cost of funds.    \u201cAlternative finance providers struggle to match the cost of funds of banks and therefore the price of financing they can provide. Thus far they\u2019ve been able to justify this premium in speed of execution, enabled via their often superior technology,\u201d Holman explained.    Banks and Open Banking    But what if all potential lenders had great technology and access to the \u201cground truth\u201d of bank data? Open Banking in the UK and PSD2 (Revised Payment Services Directive) in Europe give SMEs (and individuals) the right to allow providers other than their banks direct access to their bank data. The regulations were designed to spur competition and innovation in financial services. The idea is that those third parties could merge financial and other data to develop completely new services. A strong take-up of Open Banking could, in theory, blunt the edge that financial data currently gives to bank lenders.    As of the end of 2019, there were one million users of Open Banking in the UK, according to UK Open Banking, so the service is still nascent. It might still do great damage to the business models of incumbent banks. However, it is not only fintechs and challenger banks that can benefit from broader access to bank data. Banks can, too.    Big banks are not usually perceived as offering innovative fintech services, but that is changing. Some are setting up stand-alone fintech challengers\u2014as Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has done with B\u00f3\u2014and some are innovating on top of existing platforms. Innovation will be the way forward, according to Holman. \u201cBanks need to offer value-add services, to SMEs, on top of open banking to encourage data permissioning.\u201d    Large banks already have trusted brands, a big customer base and lower funding costs. Access to the bank data of even more companies should enable them to leverage those further. To help banks to do this, we at LIBF have just launched a new qualification\u2014a Level 3 Certificate in SME Lending and Alternative Data.

There are a number of reasons for this.    One is, as McKinsey explains (\u201c How banks can use ecosystems to win in the SME market \u201d), that \u201cfinding the optimal balance between providing a great customer experience and managing the cost to serve has\u2026proven to be difficult\u201d\u2014i.e., small companies can pay only small fees. Another is that the credit quality of SME assets tends to be uneven, so credit losses are potentially high.      What tech knows    Technology can help overcome those difficulties:    First, it allows lenders to analyse companies that do not fit pre-existing credit models by using \u201calternative data\u201d and alternative sources of data. That should broaden the scope and cut costs.    Second, technology can give lenders access to low-cost, real-time data on company performance and outlook, which not only helps support near-instant credit analyses but also advice and networking services.    Third, lenders could use \u201cbig data\u201d to build realistic models of the world in which an SME operates now and might operate in the future. Artificial intelligence and machine learning could then, in principle, be used to help small companies solve problems such as finding new opportunities, being sustainable or hiring the right staff.    What banks know    Really powerful solutions for SMEs are still in the future. This is partly because banks have always had a privileged data position: they know what the financial \u201cground truth\u201d of a company is.

But on Facebook, they trail far behind conservative outlets like Fox News and The Daily Wire, which is spearheaded by commentator Ben Shapiro, when it comes to drawing in readers. The Daily Wire was the top publisher on Facebook in July, the most recent month data is available, according to research shared by data firm NewsWhip. The outlet had 98.9 million engagements for the month, or about 8 million more engagements than CNN, the next closest outlet. </p><p>(Engagement counts all likes, reactions, comments and shares that a post receives.) Those figures easily blew past The New York Times, which had 61.5 million engagements, and The Washington Post's 43.6 million engagements. Further proof that conservative media is thriving on Facebook: Fox News was the third-most-popular publisher in July, with nearly 86 million engagements. That trend carried over to August. Kevin Roose, a tech columnist with The New York Times, recently pointed out that Shapiro's Facebook engagement last month dwarfed the Times, the Post and several other outlets, including NPR and NBC.

More data in my column on how the right is absolutely dominating on Facebook: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/chgpbphair\">https://t.co/chgpbphair</url>[2] pic.twitter.com/yM3sAry4GT[3] \u2014 Kevin Roose (@kevinroose) August 28, 2020[4]So why are right-leaning outlets so wildly popular on Facebook? Some of the gap could be attributable to sites like The Washington Post and The New York Times keeping their articles behind a paywall, unlike The Daily Wire and Fox News; if readers know you must pay to read, they may be less likely to share it. The impact this has on a publisher's overall engagement level is negligible, though, according to Benedict Nicholson, NewsWhip's head of research. Jeremy Boreing, the co-CEO of The Daily Wire, pointed to a few reasons for his site's Facebook success. One key factor, he told TheWrap in a phone interview, is that The Daily Wire has focused on stories other outlets have either shied away from or that he claims they failed to accurately report on \u2014 leaving a void for conservative publishers to fill. He believes mainstream outlets emphasized the 'mostly peaceful' element of widespread protests following George Floyd's death and paid little attention to the rioting and looting. 'We talked about some things that the media did not talk about,' Boreing said. 'The legacy media in July dedicated the bulk of their coverage to COVID, which, while a very important story, is a story that has been going on in a major way in this country since March. We covered the riots that are taking place in American cities.' Fewer conservativevoices at top newspapers is another reason The Daily Wire and Fox News are outperforming The New York Times, according to Stephen Miller, a contributor to Spectator USA and host of the Versus Media podcast. By not offering a conservative flavor, outlets are missing out on engagement from readers who are looking for alternative viewpoints. That's driving Facebook users to publishers thatoffer right-leaning views, he said. 'Mainstream outlets have effectively phased out conservative voices and viewpoints at their networks and newspapers as they have clearly slid further left in ideology. Conservatives viewpoints have also largely been erased from Hollywood, on television programming, as well as academia,' Miller said. 'So they are effectively all pooled into two places: Fox News and Facebook, whereas progressives on the left have several options to get their news so the audience is spread out more.'

But it hasn't always been a healthy relationship. This summer, that same opinion section embroiled in controversywhen staffers said a column published by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, arguing the U.S. military should be used in certain cities to stop rioting[6], put Black staffers 'in danger.' The internal strife over the column led editorial page editor James Bennet to resign. Columnist Bari Weiss \u2014 who many consider a conservative, although she has described herself as a left-leaning centrist \u2014 joined Bennet soon after, saying the Times had grown out-of-touch with readers who aren't on the left. 'The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,' Weiss said in her public resignation letter[7]. Simply from a business perspective, Miller said, it would make sense for top publishers to offer more conservative voices. The Daily Wire has benefited from its ties to Shapiro, one of the biggest names in political media. Shapiro has 3 million followers on Twitter, nearly 6 million on Facebook and hosts the seventh-ranked podcast on Apple's charts. He's a one-man juggernaut on par with Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. But instead of 'looking inward at what they're doing wrong,' Miller said, outlets like CNN have shifted their energy, calling for regulations against Facebook. 'Hire more conservative voices and express more viewpoints on the right,' Miller said. 'Spread the audience out more. But they're not going to do that, so they attack Facebook, where these voices have coalesced instead.' TheWrap reached out to a number of independent media analysts for their opinion on why conservative outlets perform so well on Facebook \u2014 and whether they agree with Boreing and Miller's assessments. Six analysts declined to weigh in; several others did not respond to TheWrap's request for comment. Meanwhile, The Daily Wire's success has led to its own share of criticism. In late June, Popular Information reported the outlet had broken Facebook's rules by having other Facebook pages share their posts in exchange for money[8]. Boreing said The Daily Wire was unaware it was violating Facebook's rules, in part, because it can be hard to keep up with what is and isn't allowed on the platform. After the report came out, he looked into The Daily Wire's affiliate network and found it provided, at most, 3% of the site's monthly Facebook engagement. Boreing said he decided to cancel the entire program immediately, if only to keep sites like Popular Information off The Daily Wire's back. The decision did little to curb the outlet's performance on Facebook, at least in July, as it ranked atop Facebook's publisher leader board. Overall, the market is ripe for non-legacy outlets like The Daily Wire. A recent survey from Gallup and The Knight Foundation found 54% of Americans believe reporters 'intentionally misrepresent facts,'[9] while about 66% said they're worried about bias in their news. (These data points included a wide range of media outlets, including right-leaning outlets like Fox News and The Daily Wire, as well as left-leaning outlets like The Young Turks and Crooked Media.) Miller said one 'turning point' for many Americans, both on the right and the left, came in major outlets' coverage of the high school student from Covington, Kentucky, during a 2019 rally in Washington, D.C.CNN and The Washington Post settled defamation lawsuits with Nicholas Sandmann, the student who was portrayed as an instigator against a Native American man; video later showed the man approached Sandmann at the event, banging a drum, undermining the portrayal of Sandmann as an aggressor. The mishandling of that story, Miller said, has dented the mainstream media's credibility \u2014 and galvanized more people to look for their news from sites like The Daily Wire. Also Read: Facebook Ad Boycott Ushers in a 'New Era' of 'Corporate Activism'[10] Boreing added that readers and Facebook users are 'fed up' with the 'illusion of objectivity.' This has worked in The Daily Wire's favor, he said, because the outlet doesn't hide its slant. 'We own our biases,' Boreing said. 'We are a conservative news organization. We're not hiding it. We don't pretend otherwise.' Still, Boreing doesn't completely write-off outlets like The New York Times. The Times, he said, 'performs an important service,' and simply does reporting The Daily Wire can't do. But that's yet another reason The Daily Wire performs better on Facebook, he said: No one has time to read a 17-minute, 2,000-word article from The Times while scanning Facebook on their lunch break. 'That's not what Facebook is for.' Instead, The Daily Wire will often mine those large stories, pull out the juiciest piece of news and share quick-hit posts with a specific perspective. It's a proven strategy that's helped propel The Daily Wire \u2014 with less than two dozen employees across its editorial and social media teams \u2014 ahead of every legacy media outlet on Facebook. After all, he said, The Daily Wire, which is set to celebrate its five-year anniversary this month, was founded as a digital-first publisher. 'I don't think that it should be surprising that media companies that were founded to compete on the internet and social media outperform on the internet media companies that were created for radio, TV and print,' he said. 'It might be shocking if we suddenly started printing newspapers and were outperforming The New York Times, but that's not what's happening.'Related stories from TheWrap: Facebook Threatens to Block News Sharing in Australia in Response to Proposed Law[11]#DeleteFacebook Trends as Mark Zuckerberg Admits 'Operational Mistake' Over Kenosha Militia Page (Video)[12]Facebook Purges 790 QAnon Groups, Says Movement Has 'Celebrated Violent Acts'[13] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/lessons-learned-from-earnings\">https://www.thewrap.com/lessons-learned-from-earnings</url>/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/chgpbphair\">https://t.co/chgpbphair</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/yM3sAry4GT\">https://t.co/yM3sAry4GT</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1299355731234156544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/kevinroose/status/1299355731234156544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/microsoft-tiktok-antitrust-concerns\">https://www.thewrap.com/microsoft-tiktok-antitrust-concerns</url>/ [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bariweiss.com/resignation-letter\">https://www.bariweiss.com/resignation-letter</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://popular.info/p/facebook-admits-ben-shapiro-is-breaking\">https://popular.info/p/facebook-admits-ben-shapiro-is-breaking</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/poll-shows-growing-distrust-of-media-among-americans\">https://www.courthousenews.com/poll-shows-growing-distrust-of-media-among-americans</url>/ [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/facebook-ad-boycott-new-era\">https://www.thewrap.com/facebook-ad-boycott-new-era</url>/ [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/facebook-threatens-to-block-news-sharing-in-australia-in-response-to-proposed-law\">https://www.thewrap.com/facebook-threatens-to-block-news-sharing-in-australia-in-response-to-proposed-law</url>/ [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/deletefacebook-trends-as-mark-zuckerberg-admits-operational-mistake-over-kenosha-militia-page-video\">https://www.thewrap.com/deletefacebook-trends-as-mark-zuckerberg-admits-operational-mistake-over-kenosha-militia-page-video</url>/ [ 13]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/facebook-purges-790-qanon-accounts\">https://www.thewrap.com/facebook-purges-790-qanon-accounts</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-WRAP105650159957401144275776100178</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRAP-5357</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SW-1TF1-F03R-N2X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1844\"/><timeReceived>2:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Wrap</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002FIF</classCode><className>NEW YORK TIMES CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But we have already done many of the things politicians demand of America\u2019s leading businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cHello, Jay?\u201d The voice on the line was instantly recognizable. \u201cIt\u2019s Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given that Senator Sanders is a frequent critic of Amazon, you might think he was calling to complain about something my company had done \u2014 or wasn\u2019t doing. But on this day, in November 2018, his message was different.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cListen,\u201d he told me, \u201cI just want to congratulate Amazon for raising your minimum wage to $15 an hour. That\u2019s good for your workers. It\u2019s the right thing to do. Please thank Jeff Bezos for me.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To be sure, Senator Sanders\u2019s appreciation for Amazon and our founder, Mr. Bezos, didn\u2019t last long. He and Senator Elizabeth Warren, both candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, regularly attack the company on the campaign trail, other candidates sometimes echo them. Still, his call at least recognized a reality often forgotten or ignored in debates about the role a company like ours can and should play in the economy.</p><p>This year\u2019s elections will center, as they almost always do, on the economy \u2014 specifically, on jobs and how things like health care and training opportunities affect the way American workers feel about their economic circumstances. As the employer that has added more jobs to the American economy over the last decade than any other, we at Amazon have a unique perspective.</p><p>Critics and reporters often categorize Amazon as a big tech company, and it is true that digital technology powers much of our businesses. But in today\u2019s economy, phrases like \u201cbig tech\u201d and the \u201ctech industry\u201d obscure more than they enlighten. Our core business, consumer retail, involves hundreds of thousands of employees who store, ship and deliver billions of physical goods \u2014 not bits of data \u2014 via airplanes, trucks and vans around the world. We are not a social media company, a news aggregator or a forum for political advocacy (or disinformation).</p><p>While we fully agree that a company of Amazon\u2019s size should be scrutinized, we also believe people should know that Amazon is doing exactly what many lawmakers and critics insist the private sector should do. And because Amazon is a large company with hundreds of thousands of employees, as well as contractual relationships with hundreds of thousands of other businesses of all sizes, what we do can generate positive ripple effects across the country.</p><p>When Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour, we made sure that every one of the company\u2019s warehouse workers, known as fulfillment center associates, got a pay increase. But the change wasn\u2019t just good for our associates. We have 500,000 employees in 40 states; when a company our size increases wages, competitors feel pressure to do the same for their own workers, or risk losing them. Indeed, after our wage-increase announcement, we received a record 848,775 applications for hourly positions.</p><p>We know $15 is not a lot. In fact, we believe $15 should be the minimum anyone in the United States is paid for an hour of labor, and in most areas of the country our starting wage is even higher. But while the debate about Amazon\u2019s impact at times focuses on how our hourly jobs compare to jobs of the past, or to an idealized vision of the future, the truth is that more than 40 million Americans earn less than the lowest-paid Amazon associate. For many people, a job at one of our fulfillment centers is by far the best option available in their region. And we are proud of that \u2014 even as we agree that our political and business leaders must work together to create more and better options for all America\u2019s workers.</p><p>One place to start: Raise the federal minimum wage to $15 from its current rate of $7.25 \u2014 something only members of Congress like Senator Sanders can do. If Congress were to follow our lead, all it would take to greatly improve the lives of America\u2019s lowest-paid workers is the president\u2019s signature.</p><p>In keeping with what political leaders say they want to see from companies, Amazon has plowed<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/investing-in-the-u-s\">$270 billion into the domestic economy</url> since 2010. In economically struggling areas like Fall River, Mass., and the Inland Empire in California, our recent investments and hiring have helped to drive down the local unemployment rate and added hundreds of millions of dollars to local economies.</p><p>Improving the lives of American workers is about more than wages. We compete fiercely with Silicon Valley companies to hire the best software engineers, computer science Ph.D.s and data scientists. That means offering generous health care and other benefits on top of highly competitive pay. To cut costs, we could follow the model of some other companies by giving cheaper, basic benefits to our hourly work force. Instead, we not only pay our hourly workers significantly better than most of our consumer retail competitors, we also provide the same comprehensive health insurance and parental leave benefits to our lowest-paid associates as we do our most senior executives.</p><p>While the United States may never restore the manufacturing sector to its 20th-century heights, we can train Americans for the high-paying jobs of tomorrow. With that goal, Amazon offers fulfillment center workers the chance to learn new skills and earn certificates in high-demand fields that offer better-paying job opportunities.</p><p>Our Career Choice program prepays up to 95 percent of tuition and fees \u2014 making it almost free for employees to learn new skills. In most cases, associates who finish Career Choice become eligible for jobs that double or triple their current pay \u2014 either within Amazon or, if they prefer, with another employer. Overall, Amazon is investing $700 million to provide training to 100,000 of our domestic employees by 2025. Once again, the scale of Amazon\u2019s investment in its own work force will influence other major companies to follow suit.</p><p>All big institutions, public and private, merit scrutiny. At Amazon, we welcome it \u2014 from lawmakers, regulators and customers. And we know that our critics will at times have good ideas about how we, and other major companies, can do both more and better.</p><p>But we also hope that, in examining what we already do, those critics at least acknowledge this: When it comes to creating jobs, raising wages, providing benefits and training employees for higher-paying jobs, Amazon is doing many good things \u2014 for the economy, and for American workers.</p><p>Jay Carney, the White House press secretary from 2011 to 2014, is the senior vice president for global corporate affairs at Amazon.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/investing-in-the-u-s\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

Data from other men whose insurers, like that of Lt Col Holmes, had agreed to pay for the medicine, despite guidelines limiting its prescription to \"post-menopausal\" women, proved pivotal in persuading the US medicines regulator to approve its use in men afflicted by the condition.</p><p>Customarily securing permission to prescribe an existing drug to a wider group of patients would have required full-blown clinical trials that might have delayed the change for several years.In a world where big pharma and big tech collide, investors are pouring billions of dollars into companies that offer access to the clinical insights contained in vast troves of anonymised patient records.</p><p> Combined with artificial intelligence, data offer hope of expanding the number of patients who can benefit from existing medicines, or even unearthing entirely new drugs.\"The concentration and the sexiness started in discovery but the digital health world has grown exponentially in the past year,\" says Niven Narain, co-founder of biotech group Berg.</p><p> \"18 months ago if I sat here I couldn't even tell you what a chief digital officer was,\" he adds, reeling off the names of big pharma companies, such as Novartis, Pfizer and Sanofi, that now have digital experts on their leadership teams.Chris Boshoff, chief development officer for Pfizer's oncology division, says that by taking the conventional randomised control trials they had performed in women and supplementing them with data generated by male users  so-called real-world evidence  Pfizer was able to demonstrate to the US Food and Drug Administration as well as authorities in Canada and Egypt that it was safe and effective for both sexes.</p><p>\"To conduct a study in men, because we didn't include them in [the initial studies], would have taken us another three to five years and here we could do all the work within 12 months and get the expansion,\" says Dr Boshoff.For executives preoccupied with improving pharma's poor record on productivity, the power of data to accelerate drug discovery and reduce research costs represents fresh hope for corporate profits as well as patients.</p><p>Taking a drug from bench to bedside can cost $2.6bn, according to the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, and take up to 14 years. Zach Weinberg, co-founder of Flatiron Health, which aggregated and analysed part of the data underpinning Ibrance's label expansion to men, believes two major shifts in the landscape are driving pharma's fascination with data.</p><p>The first is a demand from insurers and other payers for more detailed evidence about the performance of a drug once it is in regular use. The other change, especially evident in cancer treatment, is the increasing complexity of drug discovery, as scientists' greater understanding of individual biology drives the search for more personalised treatments.</p><p>Mr Weinberg, whose company operates from offices in New York's SoHo district, says: \"If you wanted to launch a drug in breast cancer 20 years ago, we would have thought of it as breast cancer. But now we think of it as multiple subtypes of disease, so they need to generate evidence in each individual subtype means there are more questions [to be answered].</p><p>\"These developments have placed a premium on high-quality data, shorn of mistakes and inconsistencies, that will be trusted by regulators such as the FDA and European Medicines Agency.Securing access to data from electronic health records \"is really not that complicated.</p><p> Making that data fit for research, that's the hard part. It's in the data curation,\" he adds.</p><p>It is just over a decade since the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act spurred the widespread take-up of electronic patient records, by allocating almost $20bn to health technology. The Twenty-First Century Cures Act, which endorsed the use of real-world evidence in drug approvals, was passed just over three years ago.</p><p>Medical applications for data and AI have rapidly become attractive to investors. Calculations for the Financial Times by Rock Health, a US venture fund focusing on digital health, suggest that in the five years to the third quarter of 2019 a total of $1.5bn across 69 deals has been invested in companies that use AI or machine learning, and that \"either sell to biopharma or have biopharma as an end-user\".</p><p>The sum represented 25 per cent of all AI funding and 21 per cent of all AI deals in the US. Other recent deals include Merck's $40m investment last year in TriNetX, a clinical data and analytics company, while Roivant Sciences in 2018 committed $40.5m to Datavant, which connects fragmented health data sets to aid researchers.</p><p>Even five or six years ago, only about half, the 20 biggest companies working on cancer drugs were deploying real-world data, says Mr Weinberg. \"Now, when we walk into any of the 20 [businesses], there's a group that has been identified which at least owns the area for that.</p><p>\" Previously, some companies had been uncertain as to where in the business it belonged. \"Is it my drug development team? Is it market access? Is it my biostats group?' Now, there's more organisational maturity,\" he says.</p><p>\"It's about augmenting and complimenting clinical trials where we don't have enough trial data,\" he adds. \"That's really the big idea.</p><p>\"Basel-based Roche has embraced that approach. In 2015 it took a 12.6 per cent stake in Flatiron, going on to buy the company outright in 2018. Flatiron retains operational independence and works with an array of other pharma companies  including Pfizer, with which it has a strategic collaboration.</p><p>The relationship with Flatiron has delivered clear dividends, suggests Bill Anderson, the Swiss company's head of pharma. He cites Rozlytrek, a treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer approved by the FDA in August, which targets genetic mutations seen in only about 1 per cent of all patients with the condition.</p><p> The rarity made it difficult to find participants for a conventional clinical trial, in which one group receives the medicine and the other does not.First, it used Foundation Medicine, a US company which genetically sequences tumours, to identify a group of patients with the right genetic make-up on whom to test the medicine.</p><p>It then created the equivalent of another trial using the Flatiron database to find a group of patients with the same mutations who were taking what had been regarded, up to that point, as the best treatment. The data were submitted to \"regulators so that they could compare what they saw in the single-arm study of Rozlytrek to what they might have seen in a similar patient with that mutation who hadn't received Rozlytrek\".</p><p>Mr Anderson says: \"We needed a 2m-patient Flatiron data set to find approximately 50 patients that had [the relevant] mutation, and it fit the trial criteria.\"Would the medicine ever have come to fruition without access to this database? \"Certainly without the genomic testing, it wouldn't.</p><p> I think, in the case of the Flatiron real-world evidence, some regulators would have probably approved it without that, just based on the compelling benefit in the single-arm study, but it certainly provided important context.\"Such data may also help reassure payers about the value of a new drug, no small advantage at a time when governments and insurers are exercising ever-tighter control of health budgets.</p><p>At Novartis, Switzerland's other global drugmaker, Vas Narasimhan describes his business as \"a data science company\". While identifying molecules that could turn into money-spinning drugs is the traditional business of big pharma, the key insight, on which he has sought to reposition the company since becoming chief executive in 2018, is that the data generated around those molecules is also a core asset.</p><p>Novartis is increasingly looking to integrate anonymised data from clinical trials with other information about patients, such as their genetic make-up, to find the \"super-responders\" most likely to benefit from new treatments.Dr Narasimhan says: \"If you look at the tech companies that's the pivot they made they realised that actually the core asset for them is the data-mining [of] all of that experience.</p><p>\"Take Canakinumab, a medicine for heart disease that had disappointed in initial trials. Rather than writing off hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, Novartis took the data of the 10,000 patients involved in these initial studies and \"discovered that this drug has a significant impact on lung cancer\", he says.</p><p>The company has now embarked on several late-stage trials of the drug among people with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the condition.Recent moves attest to Dr Narasimhan's belief that big pharma must increasingly leverage the skills and approach of tech specialists.</p><p> Bertrand Bodson, an Amazon alumnus appointed as the company's first chief digital officer, has been elevated to the senior executive team. And in September Dr Narasimhan announced a five-year collaboration with Microsoft that aims to apply AI to all areas of the Swiss pharmaceutical company's business, from finance to manufacturing.</p><p>The most profitable outcome for many pharma companies would be to find a brand new drug by applying AI to big data sets  but Dr Narasimhan strikes a note of caution.He says: \"Can we use this technology to find the drug, to actually unlock the underlying science? I still think we're a long way away [from that] because we don't understand so much about human biology.</p><p> And to define how a machine would solve that for us would require significant advancement still.\"Berg's Mr Narain believes this year will deliver a reckoning that could explode some of the hype that has been generated around AI and medicine.</p><p>Founded just over a decade ago, the biotech group has carved out a distinct path by testing hypotheses developed through computer modelling in an experimental laboratory setting. The aim is to produce a biologically-validated finding that can then be further tested in animal and human clinical trials  a process that takes time, he emphasises.</p><p>\"It's not like you pool public data and you're going to cure cancer in three months,\" he says. It has teamed up with several large pharma companies, including AstraZeneca and Sanofi, in work that Mr Narain believes can eventually lead to new drugs by yielding fresh insights into how they produce their effects.</p><p>However, he warns against the notion that AI is a short-cut that can circumvent all the hard work of understanding patient biology. \"AI is not just like a magic wand that dismisses all the iterations of the science that are so necessary to get to a really verifiable answer.</p><p> Because at the end of the day we're dealing with patients,\" he adds.Investors may soon become impatient for tangible results, in the form of stronger RandD pipelines, swifter approvals or drugs repositioned for new categories of patients  with costs cut in the process.</p><p>Mr Narain says: \"We are at a 'come to Jesus' moment because people have put lots of money into this and for the VC community, the [private equity] community, it's been two to three years [of expectation].\"For Lt Col Holmes, in the vanguard of this health data revolution, Ibrance has provided a lifeline.</p><p> More than five years after his cancer first spread, he is leading what he calls \"75 per cent\" of his pre-cancer life.Deploying a phrase that pilots use when they have to adjust the controls for new crosswinds, he adds: \"That's my new normal.</p><p> Sort of like flying [the plane] with something wrong, but you're still OK. I still have control.</p><p>\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSDAY-BUSSDAY27012020001877</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSDAY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2W-6KJ1-F00C-63KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2066\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business Day All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Day</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000214H</classCode><className>PFIZER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00091HA</classCode><className>SANOFI SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002JOI</classCode><className>NOVARTIS AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS325411 MEDICINAL &amp;

The 55-year-old, who flew packages for FedEx after a 28-year career with the US Air Force, appeared a picture of late middle-aged vigour.

Is it my biostats group?\u2019 Now, there\u2019s more organisational maturity,\u201d he says. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about augmenting and complimenting clinical trials where we don\u2019t have enough trial data,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat\u2019s really the big idea.\u201d</p><p>Basel-based Roche has embraced that approach. In 2015 it took a 12.6 per cent stake in Flatiron, going on to buy the company outright in 2018. Flatiron retains operational independence and works with an array of other pharma companies \u2014 including Pfizer, with which it has a strategic collaboration.</p><p>The relationship with Flatiron has delivered clear dividends, suggests Bill Anderson, the Swiss company\u2019s head of pharma. He cites Rozlytrek, a treatment for metastatic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/nice_knocks_back_roches_tecentriq_for_small_cell_lung_cancer_1321187\"> non-small cell lung cancer </url>approved by the FDA in August, which targets genetic mutations seen in only about 1 per cent of all patients with the condition. The rarity made it difficult to find participants for a conventional clinical trial, in which one group receives the medicine and the other does not.</p><p>First it used Foundation Medicine, a US company which genetically sequences tumours, to identify a group of patients with the right genetic make-up on whom to test the medicine.</p><p>It then created the equivalent of another trial using the Flatiron database to find a group of patients with the same mutations who were taking what had been regarded, up to that point, as the best treatment. The data were submitted to \u201cregulators so that they could compare what they saw in the single-arm study of Rozlytrek to what they might have seen in a similar patient with that mutation who hadn\u2019t received Rozlytrek\u201d.</p><p>Mr Anderson says: \u201cWe needed a 2m-patient Flatiron data set to find approximately 50 patients that had [the relevant] mutation, and it fit the trial criteria.\u201d</p><p>Would the medicine ever have come to fruition without access to this database? \u201cCertainly without the genomic testing it wouldn\u2019t. I think, in the case of the Flatiron real-world evidence, some regulators would have probably approved it without that, just based on the compelling benefit in the single-arm study, but it certainly provided important context.\u201d</p><p>Such data may also help reassure payers about the value of a new drug, no small advantage at a time when governments and insurers are exercising ever-tighter control of health budgets. </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">At Novartis, Switzerland\u2019s other</emphasis> global drugmaker, Vas Narasimhan describes his business as \u201ca data science company\u201d. While identifying molecules that could turn into money-spinning drugs is the traditional business of big pharma, the key insight, on which he has sought to reposition the company since becoming chief executive in 2018, is that the data generated around those molecules is also a core asset.<br/></p><p>Novartis is increasingly looking to integrate anonymised data from clinical trials with other information about patients, such as their genetic make-up, to find the \u201csuper-responders\u201d most likely to benefit from new treatments. </p><p>Dr Narasimhan says: \u201cIf you look at the tech companies that\u2019s the pivot they made; they realised that actually the core asset for them is the data-mining [of] all of that experience.\u201d</p><p>Take Canakinumab, a medicine for heart disease that had disappointed in initial trials. Rather than writing off hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, Novartis took the data of the 10,000 patients involved in these initial studies and \u201cdiscovered that this drug has a significant impact on lung cancer\u201d, he says.</p><p>The company has now embarked on several late-stage trials of the drug among people with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the condition. </p><p>Recent moves attest to Dr Narasimhan\u2019s belief that big pharma must increasingly leverage the skills and approach of tech specialists. Bertrand Bodson, an Amazon alumnus appointed as the company\u2019s first chief digital officer, has been elevated to the senior executive team. And in September Dr Narasimhan announced a five-year collaboration with Microsoft that aims to apply AI to all areas of the Swiss pharmaceutical company\u2019s business, from finance to manufacturing. </p><p>The most profitable outcome for many pharma companies would be to find a brand new drug by applying AI to big data sets \u2014 but Dr Narasimhan strikes a note of caution. </p><p>He says: \u201cCan we use this technology to find the drug, to actually unlock the underlying science? I still think we\u2019re a long way away [from that] because we don\u2019t understand so much about human biology. And to define how a machine would solve that for us would require significant advancement still.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Berg\u2019s Mr Narain believes </emphasis>this year will deliver a reckoning that could explode some of the hype that has been generated around AI and medicine. </p><p>Founded just over a decade ago, the biotech group has carved out a distinct path by testing hypotheses developed through computer modelling in an experimental laboratory setting. The aim is to produce a biologically-validated finding that can then be further tested in animal and human clinical trials \u2014 a process that takes time, he emphasises.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you pool public data and you\u2019re going to cure cancer in three months,\u201d he says. It has teamed up with several large pharma companies, including AstraZeneca and Sanofi, in work that Mr Narain believes can eventually lead to new drugs by yielding fresh insights into how they produce their effects. </p><p>However, he warns against the notion that AI is a short-cut that can circumvent all the hard work of understanding patient biology. \u201cAI is not just like a magic wand that dismisses all the iterations of the science that are so necessary to get to a really verifiable answer. Because at the end of the day we\u2019re dealing with patients,\u201d he adds.</p><p>Investors may soon become impatient for tangible results, in the form of stronger R&amp;D pipelines, swifter approvals or drugs repositioned for new categories of patients \u2014 with costs cut in the process. </p><p>Mr Narain says: \u201cWe are at a \u2018come to Jesus\u2019 moment because people have put lots of money into this and for the VC community, the [private equity] community, it\u2019s been two to three years [of expectation].\u201d</p><p>For Lt Col Holmes, in the vanguard of this health data revolution, Ibrance has provided a lifeline. More than five years after his cancer first spread, he is leading what he calls \u201c75 per cent\u201d of his pre-cancer life.</p><p>Deploying a phrase that pilots use when they have to adjust the controls for new crosswinds, he adds: \u201cThat\u2019s my new normal. Sort of like flying [the plane] with something wrong, but you\u2019re still OK. I still have control.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-4743d76caf9b11e98030530adfa879c2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2N-6J21-DXP9-932C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2092\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000214H</classCode><className>PFIZER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00091HA</classCode><className>SANOFI SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002JOI</classCode><className>NOVARTIS AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS325411 MEDICINAL &amp;

And as the tech industry s top lobbying group now flips to support legislation it previously opposed, experts wonder whether other concessions on hot-button issues are still to come.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Friday, the Internet Association the D.C.-based lobbying arm of the most powerful tech firms dropped its opposition to the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, a popular Senate bill that increases the legal liability of online platforms accused of knowingly assisting, facilitating, or supporting sex trafficking. The group framed the move as a compromise consistent with concerns that it raised during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in September.  Important changes made to SESTA will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,  said Internet Association president Michael Beckerman.</p><p>But some experts are less sanguine about the compromise, which they say doesn t do nearly enough to soften the bill s damaging impact on the internet industry. They believe the Internet Association chose to cut its losses instead of continuing to argue over an issue as emotionally laden as sex trafficking. As legislators also weigh a crackdown on tech platforms for their role in spreading Russian disinformation during the 2016 election, experts say the Internet Association is choosing to expend its energy on a fight it can actually win.</p><p> It s a resource-constrained time for tech policy, so you ve got to kind of pick your battles,  said Evan Engstrom, the executive director for Engine Advocacy, a lobbying group for tech start-ups that continues to oppose the sex-trafficking bill.</p><p> There was such a strategic cost to opposing SESTA,  said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University who argued against the bill during September s Senate Commerce hearing.  And if it wasn t going to be winnable anyway, you cut your losses and move on. Because you ve got so many other battles you ve got to fight. </p><p>How big tech s alleged capitulation on SESTA will impact a broader Capitol Hill crackdown remains unclear. Some believe that the legislation will be a precedent to justify new liability requirements on other online content particularly posts promoting terrorism. But others see a special confluence of factors in the SESTA debate, saying it s not necessarily indicative of a full-court press against big tech.</p><p> This is kind of a unique situation,  said Engstrom.  There are very few issues that are going to be seen as compelling as stopping sex trafficking. Even issues related to political ads aren t getting the type of immediate support that you d think they would, in light of how visible that issue has been. </p><p>Even before the Internet Association accepted last week s compromise, SESTA was already a popular bill. The legislation which now has 41 bipartisan cosponsors stemmed from a years-long federal investigation into <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Backpage</emphasis>, an online classified-ad platform accused of knowingly permitting sex trafficking on its website. The bill is expected to sail through a Senate Commerce Committee markup scheduled for Wednesday morning. Even Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, one of the few lawmakers to speak out on the bill s purported negative impact in September, appears to have cooled his opposition.  Right now I m just looking at the changes,  he told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis>.</p><p>Those changes while still less than ideal for Silicon Valley aren t exactly insignificant. The industry feared SESTA s first draft because of the broad leeway it gave state attorneys general to bring criminal cases against online platforms, as well as an unclear definition of when an online platform  knowingly  facilitates trafficking. The new draft, however, requires state prosecutors to conform to federal sex-trafficking statutes and tightens up the  knowing  standard.</p><p> SESTA is still a terrible bill it s bad policy, and it s badly executed,  said Goldman.  The question that I m focused on is whether it poses an existential threat to the internet. And I think it s less likely to kill the internet than the prior draft would have been.  Goldman added, however, that many of those tweaks would likely have happened anyway, as the bill s sponsors found obvious holes in their legislation.</p><p>Alexandra Levy, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame who focuses on sex trafficking, believes the Internet Association was looking for a face-saving way to extricate itself from a losing fight.  I can say from experience that it's not easy to be on the other side of a bill called the  Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act,   she said. Levy opposes SESTA, arguing that it gives platforms a legal incentive to stick their heads in the sand and will drive trafficking to darker corners of the web.</p><p>Levy worries that the legislation is the opening salvo in a campaign to take down Section 230 of the Communications Act, a provision providing tech platforms with immunity from prosecution for content posted by their users. She believes content promoting terrorism is likely the next but by no means the last target.  All of these laws will have the same effect of incentivizing platforms to know less and regulate more a price that will ultimately be paid by users,  she said.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, one of SESTA s strongest proponents and an architect of last week s compromise, has hinted there may be more shoes to drop.  There s an important and profoundly significant recognition of responsibility here,  Blumenthal said Tuesday when asked whether SESTA is the first in a wave of new regulations.  The social-media platforms are more than just a vehicle. They have a responsibility. </p><p>But experts believe that big tech won t submit as readily on other issues. While Silicon Valley has neither an ideological nor a pecuniary interest in defending the free speech rights of sex traffickers, that won t be true in most other cases.</p><p> I do think the internet companies will feel differently with other kinds of regulatory efforts,  Goldman said.  In some cases that will be because they re more ideologically supportive of the content that s being targeted. In other cases it ll be because it ll potentially cut into their revenues in a way they care about. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-660401</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PXB-T601-JBNW-31X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1070\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Rather than relying on sound economic or antitrust reasons, these candidates are appealing to people's political fears. But such policies would be harmful to American consumers in a number of ways. Let's count them: </p><p>1. For decades, antitrust enforcement has focused on costs and benefits to consumers. Many innovation economy companies have provided valuable services to consumers at low cost, frequently driving the prices of goods lower. Some of the most valuable services - such as search engines and access to social media - have been free.</p><p>2. The innovation economy is vibrant and competitive. The economic graveyard is littered with companies that once seemed dominant, but died for failing to keep up with consumer demand. If consumers are not being hurt, the government should let competition decide whether companies rise or fall, succeed or fail.</p><p>3. Sen. Warren has not presented much logic for her <url normalizedValue=\"http://technology proposal\">technology proposal</url> other than she does not like successful innovation economy employers. These companies became big and successful because they were meeting the needs of consumers and customers, including, ironically, those of Sen. Warren.</p><p>4. Regulation of privacy concerns should be addressed with focused legislation that applies to a broader group of companies. Privacy challenges should not be addressed with antitrust regulation of a few, very successful innovation economy companies.</p><p>5. All industries should operate fairly and in a way that allows open competition. We should avoid blanket statements that suggest improper business practices absent clear evidence. </p><p>6. All companies should be viewed on a case-by-case basis. Instead of a one-size-fits-all standard, we should work within existing antitrust laws, which apply to all industries and actively prevent collusion, restraint of trade, and monopolies. </p><p>7. Sen. Warren's proposal assumes that if the government starts breaking up big companies, in the future that process will proceed without purely political motivations. That assumption should not be made.</p><p>8. Companies that Sen. Warren has talked about breaking up have not been in business very long. They have grown rapidly because they have continued to innovate and serve customers while offering many services that did not exist until recently. If they stop meeting customer needs, then customers will select other services. </p><p>9. If the reward for business success in America is destruction of a company - determined through political campaigns and not the marketplace - that's a chilling message for future entrepreneurs. They will believe that the more successful their innovations are, the more likely they are to have politicians and government bureaucrats decide their future, not their customers.</p><p>10. Europe provides an example of many advanced economies that are heavily regulated. These countries do not have the global business leadership of the U.S.</p><p>America's innovation economy is the envy of the Earth. It benefits customers and consumers through innovation and job creation. </p><p>Relentless attacks motivated by polling and politics may gain headlines. In the meantime, innovators and entrepreneurs will continue to make headway in meeting the needs of our customers and consumers.</p><p>We invite you to express your views in a letter to the editor.

The Nasdaq 100 index, made up of technology companies, took a hit and market volatility remains high. Added to that, there are presidential elections in the U.S. in a few weeks.</p><p><br/>So far this has not changed much to the general mood of investors. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fund managers mostly agree that the market needed a \"healthy correction\" to remove some of the foam surrounding the Great Technology and provide a new buying opportunity at more attractive prices.</emphasis><br/>This attitude also indicates that it is a comfortable level for investors. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who bought when the Nasdaq 100 in March recorded its minimum level maintains a profit of nearly 60%, </emphasis>even after the last wave of sales.

It still looks good and will continue for a while, as digital trends in business, education and households have accelerated as a result of the pandemic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The premium paid for owning best-in-class stocks</emphasis>is justified, given that the economic cycle of the coming years will be based on low interest rates and modest inflationary pressure.<br/>Even if a Covid-19 vaccine <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">appears, pandemic-inspired behaviour changes will continue to reward innovation and disruption, attributes that define technology companies.</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prior to the last wave of sales, the price/earning multiples of leading technology and the Nasdaq 100 had been placed in a danger zone reminiscent of the dotcom bubble.</emphasis> For example, the U.S. Citigroup stock team estimates that considering in valuations the lowest corporate tax, the 10 largest American technology companies are trading at a price-to-earning ratio of the last 12 months of 75 times, almost exactly in line with the turn of the century.<br/>It is therefore natural to compare with post-market collapses, particularly those in 2000 and 2007. But those market highs were followed by a prolonged drop in profit growth in the following quarters, while the pandemic blow seems less extensive. Wall Street foresees a recovery for the second half of 2020 that will gain momentum by 2021.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Perhaps from now on it is safest to bet on average performance.</emphasis> Some companies with strong business models may have to deal with increased antitrust regulation in the coming months. There is a possibility that corporate taxes and even levies on unexpected profits may go up.<br/>But there is one thing that keeps the optimism of those who believe that the papers will continue to rise:<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Unless profits decline markedly and show that high valuations are wrong, stocks won't fall consistently,\"</emphasis>said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek.<br/>And, of course, the 2020 interest rate environment is unprecedented. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> It is true that the Nasdaq 100 trades at about 40 times the profits of the next 12 months,</emphasis> according to the CME Group. But if we turn the price/gain ratio we get<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> a profit/price return on these shares of 2.5%. Unlike 2000, this representative measure of yields is well above the current 1.4% offered by 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds.</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This makes it difficult to announce the end of the uptrend for major technology and growth stocks. </emphasis> For there to be a significant decline, there would have to be a profound shift in well-established economic and financial trends. It would also require a change in monetary policy that few consider likely. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Ultimately, other sectors of the stock market will reach the technology industry when there is evidence of a broader economic recovery and greater inflationary pressure. Wait seated.</emphasis><br/>Translation: Mariana Oriolo<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-14419430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V9-1KH1-JBJN-M05K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"708\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 13, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>C (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>C (BMV)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>8710 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Financial Times</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>SECURITIES &amp;

There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In different ways, the companies have conceded some of these fears and have vowed to address them. Taking stock, cleaning up, admitting ''moral responsibility'' for their contributions to society -- these are the buzzwords of a tech ecosystem that is supposedly subsumed by remorse and committed to rehabilitation.</p><p>  Yet there is something deeply incongruous at the heart of the supposed ''techlash'': It is not really making a huge dent in the tech giants' financial performance. Over the last two weeks, each of the five reported earnings that were brimming with mostly fantastic news for its investors. Amazon, which has long conditioned shareholders to expect a lot of growth but not much earnings, reported a record profit. Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, both handily beat Wall Street's projections. On Tuesday, so did Apple; if its price jumps as a result, it could become the first company to reach a market valuation of more than $1 trillion.</p><p>  Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?</p><p>  In a strange way, the social network's troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That's because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.</p><p>  ''This is one of the most profitable business models I've ever seen, and that really hasn't changed,'' said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook's stock now ''may be the single most attractively priced asset across technology.''</p><p>  Together the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren't having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.</p><p>  Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.</p><p>  Software really is eating the world</p><p>  Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon's sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.</p><p>  Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they've reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That's only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.</p><p>  Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon's servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon's site.</p><p>  For rival retailers, Amazon's new profitability constitutes a kind of nightmare scenario. By shuttling profits from software into its retail business, Amazon can keep expanding its store at a breakneck pace.</p><p>  ''These high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin -- and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,'' said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p><p>  But it's not just Amazon that's profiting under the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's thesis that ''software is eating the world.'' Microsoft's surging earnings were also driven by its cloud business, while Apple's software services -- things like sales of apps, music subscriptions, cloud storage and Apple Pay -- are the fastest-growing part of its business.</p><p>  Regulatory pressure isn't having a huge impact</p><p>  The European Union recently fined Google$5.1 billion for abusing its mobile software monopoly, which followed a $2.7 billion fine last year for abuse of its search monopoly. (Googleis appealing both decisions.) Apple agreed last year to pay nearly $16 billion in back taxes to the European Union over its cozy tax deal with Ireland. (The funds will be held in escrow while Ireland appeals the decision; Apple has disputed any wrongdoing.) Facebook, which has been hauled before lawmakers in Europe and the United States for its role in politics, faces threats of increased regulation and possible fines for mishandling private data.</p><p>  But Big Tech's earnings so far don't show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Googlepaid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Googlenor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe's new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook's user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Googleand Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.</p><p>  There is also the possibility that regulatory zeal will abate. Googlewatchers say it's notable that President Trump tweeted criticism of the European Union's fine against Google, suggesting, perhaps, that American regulators won't take up a similar case. (Of course, it is hard these days to really know how much to read into a presidential tweet.)</p><p>  Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Googleand Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon's growing ad business poses a threat to both Googleand Facebook -- which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government's help.</p><p>  ''There's been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Googleand Facebook,'' Mr. Mahaney said. ''Now it's going to be a triopoly -- but if you were worried about the duopoly, you're probably saying, 'Couldn't the third company have been someone besides Amazon?'''</p><p>  The Five still have a lot more ways to make money</p><p>  Finally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the ''green fields'' -- the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties -- Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them -- are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there's a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.</p><p>  And that's just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.</p><p>  ''The one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,'' Mr. Squali said. ''They see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they're not afraid to destroy something that's working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.''</p><p>  In other words: Get used to the Five. They're not going anywhere.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsofthave all reported strong earnings over the past two weeks.

The shifting landscape for delivering primary care services to healthcare consumers is possibly the most visible manifestation of the battle for dominance in the new healthcare marketplace. CVS, with its growing footprint of in-store walk-in clinics, can potentially capitalize on the foot traffic in its stores to grab a big slice of consumer spending on routine and non-emergency care. Amazon and Apple, on the other hand, have taken somewhat different approaches, albeit with the same purpose - to own the primary care experience. Meanwhile, traditional healthcare enterprises and hospitals are stepping up their digital health programs, especially telemedicine and remote monitoring, even as specialized firms like Teladoc and Doctor on Demand, are looking to wrest control of the consumer experience by investing in and expanding on a wide range of virtual care services.</p><p>The new (and virtual) healthcare consumer</p><p>A new study by VC firm Rock Health provides some insights on shifting consumer preferences for telemedicine. Based on a survey of over four thousand respondents, the research indicates that consumers using at least one digital health tool has increased 80%\u00a0 in 2015 to 87% in 2017. There is some nuance to this data point; while consumers are increasingly using digital health tools for online health information and provider reviews, their use of telemedicine for live consultations has actually dropped. The Q2 earnings reports for Teladoc, a \u00a0leading telemedicine provider, indicates that paid visits for virtual consults are increasing; however, their gross margins fell from quarter 1 to quarter 2, and their net losses increased over the same time frame. It may be that the virtual visits pie is stagnant right now and new players are acquiring market share at a significant cost, hoping for a long-term payoff from a permanent shift in healthcare consumption preferences.</p><p>It is precisely this shift in consumer preferences that incumbent players are trying to defend against while trying to avoid cannibalizing their revenue streams. There is ample indication that most health systems have launched some form of telehealth initiative, including urgent care, e-visits, and virtual consultations. On the one hand, telehealth increases access for the consumer while reducing the costs of care. However, physicians are yet to embrace telemedicine fully and set aside more time for virtual visits because it comes with a cost; the reimbursement model for virtual visits is yet to mature, and telehealth, by and large, is compensated at lower rates compared to in-person visits. Tech firms and newer players may operate in an entirely different economic model, one that doesn't care much for CMS reimbursements, and this could reshape the healthcare consumer experience in future.</p><p>Converting the retail consumer to the retail healthcare consumer</p><p>Enter new giants like Apple and Amazon, with vast amounts of resources, technology capability, and a deep understanding of consumer behavior - are trying to shape an entirely new healthcare experience, piloted and refined within the crucible of a captive healthcare consumer population, i.e., employees. The implications for traditional healthcare firms us that consumers who are redirected from their traditional provider relationships to company-owned and operated clinics for primary care will eventually shift the ownership of the experience to their employers, who in turn can refine the user experience while providing financial incentives ( think Amazon Prime for healthcare). As the focal point of the healthcare consumer experience shifts away from the traditional doctor-patient encounter in a clinic, traditional players will need to come up with ways to retain and strengthen their current relationships.</p><p>How serious is this shift and how far can it go? While Apple and Amazon may be able to wean away their employees at their corporate headquarters from their traditional primary care providers to their owned and operated clinics, they will need a vast network of clinics over time if they have to cover a national or global population of workers.\u00a0 Current licensure restrictions make it difficult to practice any medicine across state lines, a limitation that traditional and emerging healthcare firms will have to work with. It's too soon to tell if consumers will abandon their traditional provider relationships en masse and shift to employer-run clinics. Even if they do, they will still need to turn for their acute care needs to health systems with strong brands and deep roots in their communities.</p><p>A collaborative equilibrium to float all boats</p><p>The reality of the current situation is that technology firms don't know medicine as well as traditional health systems (though Amazon is making a long bet to change this with the launch of the new venture headed by renowned physician Dr. Atul Gawande), just as the reverse is true. Some partnership model will have to eventually emerge since it's hard to visualize an Amazon or Apple getting into the tertiary care business. Even in primary care, success is far from foretold for technology firms, since healthcare experiences are far more personal and carry far higher consequences for consumers ( no use for free return shipping for a poor healthcare experience). For their part, health systems who are at risk of losing control over the primary care experience will need to find ways to remain the preferred destination for acute and in-patient care. We have seen some version of this play out in the health insurance sector with employers increasingly underwriting medical costs and retaining the services of the insurers for administrative services.</p><p>The biggest unknown in all this is the healthcare consumer and their preferences. Indications are positive that consumers are getting more comfortable with digital health technologies, indicated by the growing use of remote monitoring devices, wearables and the like. The breakneck pace of funding for digital health startups points to continued confidence in the potential of technology to alter healthcare preferences ($ 6.9 Bn in the first half of the year, compared to $ 5.6 billion for the same period last year). We don't think twice about getting our prescriptions filled electronically anymore, and we're increasingly trolling the web for medical information. However, \u00a0we are still in the early stages of a definite shift towards virtual care, and big challenges around free access to patient medical information are yet to be overcome. Apple has started addressing some of these challenges by building collaborative networks with leading health systems for data sharing and for delivering personalized health experiences over the iPhone.</p><p>Regardless of how the future shapes up, the rising tide of healthcare delivery options will lift all consumers to a better healthcare experience with more choices and hopefully much lower costs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOMAG-3305038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7P-XWJ1-JBP6-P4MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258373</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1262\"/><timeReceived>01:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 IDG Communications, Inc.

This outcome could then be portrayed as a one-off result of regulatory duress. In comparison, the alternative - a negotiated revenue-sharing deal with traditional media - would set a more damaging and costly international precedent.</p><p>So far, and predictably, there has been little or no response by big tech on the merits of the argument. The main line of argument seems to be the leviathans don't make much money out of aggregating and publishing the news of others so it would not be a big deal to simply close it down.</p><p>This is almost certainly disingenuous.</p><p>As well as depriving its multitude of users of ready access to quality journalism it would enable disinformation and conspiracy theories to flourish - hardly a good look.</p><p>These concerns were heightened during last summer's bushfires, when false and misleading information about the cause of the flames and various conspiracy theories were rife.</p><p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority has established that there are significant public concerns about misinformation on digital platforms - a key source of news and information for many Australians. Hence the authority has concluded the digital platforms should share considerable responsibility for providing readers with a safe and user-friendly environment in which to digest news and information.</p><p>Sharing revenue is key</p><p>Despite the fury, Facebook has said it is still committed to supporting Australian news.</p><p>But it is not the decision to introduce new disclosure standards and higher levels of accountability that is big tech's real concern; rather it is the decision to force them to share advertising revenue that has Facebook and Google up in arms.</p><p>It has become increasingly clear in recent years that the high tech new entrants are eating into the revenue of traditional media players, leading to a serious crisis of survival for many.</p><p>A mandatory code was the inevitable next step when it became clear that voluntary negotiations on a fair price for the digital platforms' aggregation and dissemination of the creative work of news creators and publishers were going nowhere.</p><p>The ACCC calculates that Google and Facebook take more than two-thirds of digital advertising revenue. Normally the creators of innovative material reap the bulk of the rewards but in this case it's the distributors who get the lion's share.</p><p>Aggregation and distribution</p><p>This is precisely because of the grotesque imbalance in bargaining power between trillion-dollar tech companies going from strength to strength and traditional media companies going out backwards.</p><p>Content creation is a lot more difficult and more expensive than aggregation and distribution.</p><p>Facebook already pays some media for news content so the principle has already been established, even though such payments are made on an essentially discretionary basis, given the very one-sided power imbalance.</p><p>Henry Kissinger always regarded leverage as a key element in successful negotiations and, as Donald Trump's Art of the Deal makes clear, in order to strike a good bargain you need bargaining power.</p><p>That is why the ACCC's implied threat to impose a blanket 10 per cent tax on digital revenue is an important weapon in the fight, as such an impost would be a horror outcome for big tech.</p><p>This makes it highly likely they will come to the table, especially as there will be substantial penalties for not engaging in negotiations.</p><p>The relatively new concept of Final-Offer Arbitration should also help to concentrate the mind.</p><p>Under this model the tribunal is obliged to render an award by selecting in its entirety one of the parties' final proposal. The arbitrator cannot split the difference, as decision makers are often inclined to do. This raises the stakes as each party faces the prospect of losing its entire case and is therefore motivated to make a more realistic proposal.</p><p>Normally in a commercial negotiation affordability is an important factor. However, when dealing with the big tech companies, capacity to pay is not an issue. What concerns the digital platforms much more is the knock-on effect to other jurisdictions, where a reasonable compromise in one country simply becomes the starting point for negotiations in others.</p><p>The ACCC recently signed an arrangement with fellow regulators in the anglosphere to coordinate activities in dealing with anticompetitive issues. In the same way, counterparties in other countries that have to deal with big tech would be immediately aware of the market opportunity that would arise from a negotiated settlement in Australia.</p><p>This makes it more likely that big tech would prefer an arbitrated outcome, which they can then argue is simply a one-off and not a product of their preparedness to compromise elsewhere.</p><p>The coronavirus has had a serious impact upon newspaper companies, especially in regional Australia, where the threat is increasingly existential. Even the biggest media companies have required staff to take a pay cut or stand down because of lost revenue.</p><p>A standout exception is \"Your ABC\", whose employees are completely immune from such mundane concerns, thanks to its government-guaranteed, billion-dollar budget.</p><p>So clearly the stakes are high, and not just for the players involved. All Australians have a vital interest in having ready access to a diversity of high-quality, accurate and reliable news and information services.</p><p>This race has a long way to run.</p><p>Richard Alston was Communications Minister from 1996-2003 and is chairman of National Advisory.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520324702</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TT-VG61-JBJ7-N360-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"999\"/><timeReceived>05:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And the ultimate goal of any business is to make a profit. That means that despite all of its outspoken support for climate change mitigation initiatives and renewable energy, Big Tech is openly working to make Big Oil's life easier and its output greater.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a recent example, Schneider Electric listed the benefits of Microsoft's machine learning and its internet of things products for oil and gas companies. These tech products make the oil and gas industry a better managed, safer industry through remote monitoring of production and infrastructure assets and predictive capabilities allowing for pre-emptive action before something breaks down.</p><p>This actually doesn't sound that bad. Who wouldn't want a safer oil industry? In the meantime, Microsoft is also utilizing its artificial intelligence and machine learning expertise to help\u00a0advance climate research\u00a0aimed at tackling the environmental challenges we are facing, as the company puts it.</p><p>The software giant is not hiding its affiliations with oil and gas either. Last year it became the first Big Tech company to join the Climate Leadership Council, which, among its other goals, aims at ensuring legal immunity for oil and gas companies for their contribution to global emissions.</p><p>Google is another Big Tech major that feels perfectly fine with doing business with the oil and gas industry while setting itself ambitious emissions goals. It has a Google Cloud product specially tailored to the needs of oil and gas. As the company says, \"oil and gas companies like Schlumberger rely on Google Cloud to scale workloads, such as seismic interpretation, regression analysis and classification, and fast basin modeling and simulation. With Google Cloud Platform, these workloads scale up in minutes, including clusters with several hundred (or thousand) cores and are billed based on the compute seconds used.\"</p><p>Last year, Google made headlines when The Guardian reported it had made donations to conservative think-tanks that deny climate change. The company defended itself by saying it was not unique.</p><p>\"We're hardly alone among companies that contribute to organisations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy,\" a spokesperson for the company told The Verge in October.</p><p>Indeed, there is nothing particularly unusual about doing business with companies or funding organizations, with which you disagree on some topics, if there is some mutual benefit somewhere. With oil and gas, this mutual benefit is obvious: Big Tech provides the products, Big Oil pays for them. With think-tanks, it's pro-Big Tech regulation that is motivating the donations.</p><p>Amazon is yet another case in point. Like its peers, it has a line-up of products specifically targeting the oil industry. These, Amazon says, \"can help Oil and Gas companies can accelerate digital transformation, unleash innovation to optimize production and profitability, and improve cost and operational efficiencies necessary to compete under the pressures of today's global energy market.\"</p><p>Like Google, Amazon is under pressure from critics, but while for Google these come from inside the company, Amazon is being criticized by outsiders for the environmental impact of its services, which, it turns out, is pretty sizeable. Just last week the Washington Post reported that the company had threatened to fire two employees who had voiced environmental criticism against their employer. This will no doubt be added to Amazon's negative score in environmental protection by those inclined to keep scores, right next to its doing business with Big Oil.</p><p>However, the marriage of Big Tech and Big Oil is not necessarily an evil one. On the contrary. While a lot of new technology products and services for the oil industry seek to improve production, they do not seek to do that through more drilling. In fact,\u00a0machine learning and AI help Big Oil\u00a0drill less and extract more as they make exploration results more accurate and reliable and improve drilling efficiencies.</p><p>Besides that, technology is helping the oil industry become safer. Smart tech for oil field workers and site inspectors and drone deployment for pipeline monitoring are but a couple of the ways in which technology can be good not just for the oil industry but for the environment.</p><p>So, on the face of it, Big\u00a0Tech is being hypocritical, not least because it doesn't seem as willing to advertise its business with Big Oil as it is its renewable energy purchasing plans. Yet, it's worth noting it again: Big Tech companies are businesses and as such they will look for opportunities to sell their products and services to those who need them and can pay for them.</p><p>There is no pragmatic reason for Big Oil to be an exception to this rule and despite what many might imagine in these climate panic-fraught times, pragmatism is how business is done, not ideology. Whatever Goldman Sachs says, it didn't pull out of Arctic drilling because of its ideological beliefs. It is a lot more likely it pulled out of Arctic drilling because for now, Arctic drilling is not really a profitable investment area in the places where Goldman can invest in it. Selling cloud services and AI capabilities to Big Oil is a profitable business for Big Tech. There is no pragmatic reason they should stop doing it just as there is no respectable reason they should be that shy about it.</p><p>Crude Oil</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/64/157838125781.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/488/1468/64/157838125781.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-163938097</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXJ-HGC1-F11P-X22V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Yerepouni Daily News.

In 1996, legendary Silicon Valley entrepreneur Jim Clark launched his third startup, Healtheon, which was focused on what he called the 'Magic Diamond'. The diamond represented the $1.5 healthcare market in the U.S. and its shape came from the doctors, providers, payers, and consumers slotted into the four outer points. In the middle of the diamond, Clark had placed his new company Healtheon, which he expected to profit immensely from connecting the healthcare world together with the internet. </p><p>BEFORE ITS TIME? Healtheon had a successful IPO in the middle of the Dotcom bubble, but it never was able to truly achieve its bold and original vision. As signals mounted that Dotcom stocks would implode, the fledgling company merged with WebMD in 1999. Despite the fate of Healtheon, the dream of tech invading the healthcare market lives on - and today, big tech companies like Amazon, IBM, Alphabet, and Apple all have plans to enter the sector in a big way. Today's infographic fromKoeppel Direct[4]shows how this is all playing out, as well as the specific initiatives that big technology companies are using to gain a foothold in a market that's ripe for change.  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.visualcapitalist.com/big-tech-invading-healthcare-market\">http://www.visualcapitalist.com/big-tech-invading-healthcare-market</url>/ Courtesy of: Visual Capitalist[5]  The story is no longer about the startups coming in to 'disrupt' healthcare - unfortunately, the industry seems to have too much red tape, regulation, and bureaucracy for this to be possible in the conventional way. Instead, it's the big companies like Amazon, Apple, IBM, and Alphabet that are eyeing to invade the space. And for technology companies focused on big data, the healthcare market is a compelling opportunity. HEALTHCARE MARKET POTENTIAL By the numbers, here is a snapshot of the healthcare market, and why big tech wants in: Global healthcare spending is expected to reach $8.7 trillion by 2020  In the U.S., there will be 98.2 million people aged 65+ years by 2060  Diabetes will affect 642 million people globally by 2040  70% of healthcare firms are investing in consumer-facing tech, like apps, remote monitoring, and virtual care  Wearable tech could drop hospital costs by 16% over the course of five years  Remote patient monitoring tech could save the healthcare system $200 billion over the next 25 years  Over 80% of consumers say that wearable tech has the potential to make healthcare more convenient  88% of physicians want patients to monitor health parameters at home  Scientific advancements and technology have already been responsible forsaving billions of lives[6]through history, and now it's time to see if big tech can step up to the plate using AI, augmented reality, big data, and other technologies to do more of the same - especially if it helps move these companies closer to the center of the 'diamond'.

Despite the fate of Healtheon, the dream of tech invading the healthcare market lives on - and today, big tech companies like Amazon, IBM, Alphabet, and Apple all have plans to enter the sector in a big way. Today's infographic from Koeppel Direct[2] shows how this is all playing out, as well as the specific initiatives that big technology companies are using to gain a foothold in a market that's ripe for change. <url normalizedValue=\"https://mk0valuewalkgcar7lmc.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Big-Tech-Healthcare-Market-IG.png\">https://mk0valuewalkgcar7lmc.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Big-Tech-Healthcare-Market-IG.png</url> The story is no longer about the startups coming in to 'disrupt' healthcare - unfortunately, the industry seems to have too much red tape, regulation, and bureaucracy for this to be possible in the conventional way. Instead, it's the big companies like Amazon, Apple, IBM, and Alphabet that are eyeing to invade the space. And for technology companies focused on big data, the healthcare market is a compelling opportunity.Healthcare Market PotentialBy the numbers, here is a snapshot of the healthcare market, and why big tech wants in: Global healthcare spending is expected to reach $8.7 trillion by 2020 In the U.S., there will be 98.2 million people aged 65+ years by 2060 Diabetes will affect 642 million people globally by 2040 70% of healthcare firms are investing in consumer-facing tech, like apps, remote monitoring, and virtual care Wearable tech could drop hospital costs by 16% over the course of five years Remote patient monitoring tech could save the healthcare system $200 billion over the next 25 years Over 80% of consumers say that wearable tech has the potential to make healthcare more convenient 88% of physicians want patients to monitor health parameters at home Scientific advancements and technology have already been responsible for saving billions of lives[3] through history, and now it's time to see if big tech can step up to the plate using AI, augmented reality, big data, and other technologies to do more of the same - especially if it helps move these companies closer to the center of the 'diamond'.

Here at last was confirmation of our worst fears about the Darth Vader-ish ambitions of Jeff Bezos (it's impossible to watch the video without hearing the Imperial March from Star Wars playing in the back of your mind). \"What the last human alive will see,\" one viewer suggested.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The video turned out to be fake: a CGI mock-up based loosely on the company's (as yet unrealised) plans to develop an \"aerial fulfilment centre\". But it was a believable symbol of the imperial power of Silicon Valley. Rana Foroohar's Don't Be Evil is a readable and well-marshalled indictment of the sins of these new corporate empires.</p><p>Previous anti-tech polemics, such as Shoshana Zuboff's The Age of Surveillance Capitalism or Franklin Foer's World Without Mind, have looked at the way that Silicon Valley is changing our minds and our culture. If Foroohar's book has a sheer, blimp-like reat tech monoposents 88 per cent of ine market and 95 bile searches. not just a search es smartphones, s, an email al reality s archismart engioped theme, it's the vastness of the great monopolies. Google represents the US search engine per cent of all mobile But Google is engine: it makes self-driving cars, service and virtual headsets. Google's architects design \"smart cities\" and its engineers have developed the first quantum computer in the world. Whenever Facebook feels threatened by competitor Mark Zuckerberg simply buys it: Instagram, WhatsApp and the virtual reality company Oculus, for example. Google does the same thing: in the past decade has purchased 120 companies.</p><p>um he er ls a k y ly mesn it 20 capideered This is colonial capitalism and Bezos, Amazon's founder, is its Cecil Rhodes. Even the smallest commercial statelets and tribes must be crushed. In the early 2000s an aluminium laptop stand produced by a company called Rain Design became a surprise bestseller on Amazon. Shortly after, Amazon released its own nearly identical stand for half the price. Sales of the Rain Design model crashed. Amazon's critics allege that the company trawls the mass of data generated by its website to predict which products are about to become successful before producing copies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon's fleet of \"thousands of container ships, planes and drones\" is rolling into the territory of mail companies such as UPS and FedEx. Former employees say that the company plans to supplant \"all delivery services\". Already, Amazon has commandeered the cloud's global track of its vast operations.</p><p>industry will be the next tech imperialism. In vehicles software and much more important hardware.

That's why Google Street View can take a picture of l G cameras ca your house, match it to your address and, courtesy of the small print, use the data to sell more ads. And it's why Google never bothered to ask publishers if they could smash millions of copyright agreements in their quest to scan every book published and instead relied on fair-use exemptions.</p><p>Resistance is futile. The tech companies colonise minds too - a strategy they politely call \"social and intellectual capture\". In practice this means paying for mountains of sympathetic academic research, including hundreds of papers arguing against regulatory control. Academics on the Google gravy train can earn anywhere from $5,000 to $400,000 in funding.</p><p>Sometimes almost all the academics in a field are hoovered up by tech companies. Data is the lifeblood of Silicon Valley, but there are no reliable estimates of how much it is worth because Google employs most of the world's top data scientists. By tempting so many of the world's academics into gilded cages, Google has made it difficult to rally an intellectual assault on its business model.</p><p>Big tech lobbyists have helped to bring about an overhaul in the American patent system, which makes patents harder to secure and harder to defend - especially for companies without huge legal and lobbying power. That means that there's less incentive for small tech businesses to innovate and for venture capitalists to invest in them: why bother if a tech giant will immediately muscle in on your idea? The result is a decline in innovation that may prove dangerous to the future of the American economy. That's not to mention the \"dearth of startups, declining job creation, falling demand\" and other consequences of the monopolistic business model.</p><p>Silicon Valley sharks are in danger of accidentally draining the economy in which they swim. Foroohar, a global business columnist at the Financial Times, notes that Facebook and Google have destroyed the business model of newspapers so effectively that they find themselves in the ironic position of running out of content to monetise. National newspaper print circulations are in a death spiral and more than 300 local newspapers in the UK have closed since 2007. This selfinflicted crisis means that the companies have to fund some local news out of their own pockets.</p><p>On a grander scale Foroohar believes that tech companies could precipitate the next financial crisis. Apple and Google have vast cash reserves and nothing to spend the money on. So they have started acting like banks, issuing cheap debt and using the money to buy higher-yielding corporate debt - the sort of thing that JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs might do. But the tech world is not nearly as closely regulated as banking. The vast sums of money held overseas by tech companies in the form of corporate bonds could \"if sold or downgraded \u2026 topple the markets themselves\".</p><p>The world has never witnessed monopolies this powerful or this diverse. Like many commentators, Foroohar has concluded that the tech giants must be broken up, like the rail monopolies of America's Gilded Age. Whether this is possible in the face of the political, commercial, legal and intellectual power of Silicon Valley remains to be seen. I'm not optimistic. Bezos's next ambition is to conquer space. Cue the Imperial March.</p><p>Academics on the Google gravy train can earn $5,000 to $400,000 in funding</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>dread zeppelin A still from a hoax video of an Amazon blimp over Japan.

US technology firms have traditionally opposed regulation, and scorned the efforts of European countries to bring them to heel. Yet here was Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, telling a data protection conference in Brussels last year: \"It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Granted, Apple is famously pro-privacy, at least outside China (where it follows local laws mandating government access to user data). Yet Cook is not alone in singing the praises of the European Union. Brad Smith of Microsoft, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Aaron Levie of the cloud storage firm Box are all on record stating the US should follow in the EU's footsteps.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even Mark Zuckerberg, who had said last year that he was not sure whether Facebook should be regulated, has very publicly changed his tune, writing, in an op-ed in The Washington Post: \"People around the world have called for comprehensive privacy regulation in line with the EU's \u2026 and I agree.\"</p><p>Why are tech companies suddenly so keen to be told what to do? And why are they looking to Europe specifically? The answer, in part, lies in the influence that European efforts are having on the rest of the world - particularly in the US, which has the power to shape internet usage around the world because so many tech firms are headquartered there.</p><p>\"[The EU] won in the market of ideas,\" says Prof Paul Schwartz, director of the Berkeley Centre for Law and Technology in California. \"Brad Smith [of Microsoft] and Tim Cook, they're speaking the language of data protection law. What they're saying is - it's a human right. It's really quite noticeable \u2026 think about French ideas of liberty and freedom jumping over the Atlantic and influencing the American Revolution.\"</p><p>The EU's most influential move has been the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a wide-reaching privacy law that finally came into effect last year after almost a decade of methodical work by Martin Selmayr, the head of the EU's civil service.</p><p>But tech giants have also faced action from Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, who has earned the wrath of Donald Trump by levying $9.4bn (\u00a37.5bn) in fines against Google alone. Other commissioners have corralled Facebook, YouTube and Twitter into voluntary codes of conduct on fake news, political advertising and hate speech, increasing the share of illegal content deleted within 24 hours from 28pc in 2016 to 72pc this February.</p><p>In Germany, Angela Merkel's government passed a \"Network Enforcement Act\", popularly called the NetzDG, setting deadlines for the deletion of illegal content. In France, Emmanuel Macron and his new digital minister C\u00e9dric O have convinced Facebook to agree to an audit of its algorithms and to give French courts information about hate speech suspects. In Britain, after a campaign by The Daily Telegraph, the Government has announced plans to give tech firms a duty of care towards under-18s, possibly to be enforced by a regulator.</p><p>\"The EU has certainly led the way in developing a strong, comprehensive approach to privacy protection,\" says Eleni Kyriakides, international counsel for the Washington DC-based Electronic Privacy Information Centre. \"The US is one of the few advanced democracies without comprehensive privacy legislation. GDPR-style legislation is, simply put, long overdue.\" James P Steyer, founder of the US lobby group Common Sense, likewise says that \"momentum\" is now on the side of \"citizens who are calling for privacy protections and digital well-being as an industry standard\".</p><p>American politicians have taken notice. In a series of US senate hearings on how to regulate Big Tech, GDPR has been a constant touchstone for senators' interrogation of executives. The state of California has passed its own privacy bill, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), explicitly inspired by GDPR. Beyond North America, Brazil, Thailand and Japan have also passed data privacy laws closely modelled on GDPR, while France, Australia and New Zealand are following similar paths on hate speech and terrorism.</p><p>According to Steve Weber, a professor at the Berkeley School of Information, GDPR has served \"as a big signal that governments can do this, and as a lodestar\" for how it can be done. He says the CCPA was \"clearly inspired\" by European laws.</p><p>Schwartz adds that the EU has benefited from being \"flexible\", allowing different countries to implement its ideas in their own way and extending its reach via negotiation and influence rather than by the sheer force of its market power.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission is reportedly mulling a fine against Facebook that would be bigger than any it has ever levied - but comparable to those already levied by the EU. American politicians are talking more openly than ever before about breaking up tech giants, or at least restraining their market power.</p><p>Elements of the NetzDG have also become visible in global discussions about online hate speech. Both Facebook and YouTube now publish regular statistics on how much content they have taken down.</p><p>Zuckerberg has said that other companies should follow suit, and that nation states should \"set baselines\" for content moderation. This global wave is ultimately why tech giants have changed their tune. \"These folks are past the point of believing they can continue to exist in this splendid, permission-less isolation,\" says Weber. \"Maybe two years ago people would say: 'Look, we're in a short-term storm and if we can just ride that out, we can do whatever we want to do.' That train has left the station, and now the sense is that if there's going to be meaningful regulation then let's shape that regulation in a way that helps us.\"</p><p>But Europe's battle is not finished yet. To start with, GDPR itself has not yet led to that much change, with many companies simply adding more permission checklists to their services.</p><p>Whether anyone is even behaving differently is still an open question, says Schwartz. Indeed, most observers of Capitol Hill now believe that attempts to create such a law have stalled, with no legislation expected until after 2020. Some experts have argued before Congress that GDPR would be the wrong model because users are not capable of meaningfully consenting to the dizzying array of data collection practices that tech companies employ. Meanwhile, the CCPA has become bogged down in a sludge of amendments, backed by tech industry lobbyists. There are other reasons to doubt Silicon Valley's embrace of regulation. In Germany, Facebook has been fined (EURO)2m (\u00a31.8m) for not making its transparency report transparent enough.</p><p>Zuckerberg's op-ed also avoided mention of any deadlines for taking down content - arguably the NetzDG's most important component, but one that Facebook has persistently lobbied against. Similarly, on GDPR, tech companies have been supportive of watered-down versions, laws which look a lot like the EU's but which are missing fundamental clauses, like the need for a lawful basis for processing someone's information.</p><p>One such bill failed to pass in Washington state earlier this year. Ultimately, Weber believes European tech laws will continue to influence American politics - but not necessarily in the way Martin Selmayr might hope. \"Europe plays this weird shadow reality role in American thinking,\" he says. \"Two years ago we were saying that the Europeans were going to hamstring themselves with GDPR, they're going to set back development of AI by years; they don't understand the digital economy. Now that we have come around to the idea that we should do something, we idealise the Europeans: 'Wow, they've figured it out!'\" In his view, the US has arrived at this regulatory moment for its own reasons (such as liberal backlash against the role of Facebook in the election of Trump), and the European example is an easily available crutch.</p><p>In fact, Weber argues that even though US politicians have more power to regulate tech giants than the EU, they might be less willing to do so because they depend on Silicon Valley - for job creation, economic growth, a buoyant stock market and, naturally, campaign contributions.</p><p>The EU, however, seems happy to press forward alone. Its member states have just nominated Ursula von der Leyen, a German defence minister, as the new head of the European Commission. She has long called for greater regulation of Big Tech, and is expected to keep Vestager in her post. If that happens, it probably won't matter whether Silicon Valley's smiles are sincere.</p><p>'Two years ago we were saying the Europeans were going to hamstring themselves with GDPR \u2026 now we realise we should do something, we idealise them'</p><p>'It's really quite noticeable. Think about French ideas of liberty and freedom jumping over the Atlantic and influencing the American Revolution'</p><p>$9.4bn The amount levied in fines against Google alone by Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUTELE-150854529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUTELE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WH9-3H41-DYTY-C4TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334988</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1506\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58170\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 7, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Nowhere is that truer than in the tech industry. America is home to 15 of the world's 20 most valuable tech firms; Europe has one. Silicon Valley is where the brainiest ideas meet the smartest money. America is also where the debate rages loudly over how to tame the tech giants, so that they act in the public interest. Tech tycoons face roastings by Congress for their firms' privacy lapses. Elizabeth Warren, a senator who is running for president in 2020, wants Facebook to be broken up.</p><p>Yet if you want to understand where the world's most powerful industry is heading, look not to Washington and California, but to Brussels and Berlin. In an inversion of the rule of thumb, while America dithers the European Union is acting. This week Google was fined $1.7bn for strangling competition in the advertising market. Europe could soon pass new digital copyright laws. Spotify has complained to the EU about Apple's alleged antitrust abuses. And, as our briefing explains, the EU is pioneering a distinct tech doctrine that aims to give individuals control over their own information and the profits from it, and to prise open tech firms to competition. If the doctrine works, it could benefit millions of users, boost the economy and constrain tech giants that have gathered immense power without a commensurate sense of responsibility.</p><p>Western regulators have had showdowns over antitrust with tech firms before, including IBM in the 1960s and Microsoft in the 1990s. But today's giants are accused not just of capturing huge rents and stifling competition, but also of worse sins, such as destabilising democracy (through misinformation) and abusing individual rights (by invading privacy). As AI takes off, demand for information is exploding, making data a new and valuable resource. Yet vital questions remain: who controls the data? How should the profits be distributed? The only thing almost everyone can agree on is that the person deciding cannot be Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's scandal-swamped boss.</p><p>The idea of the EU taking the lead on these questions will seem bizarre to many executives who view it as an entrepreneurial wasteland and the spiritual home of bureaucracy. In fact, Europe has clout and new ideas. The big five tech giants, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, make on average a quarter of their sales there. And as the world's biggest economic bloc, the EU's standards are often copied in the emerging world. Europe's experience of dictatorship makes it vigilant about privacy. Its regulators are less captured by lobbying than America's and its courts have a more up-to-date view of the economy. Europe's lack of tech firms helps it take a more objective stance.</p><p>A key part of Europe's approach is deciding what not to do. For now it has dismissed the option of capping tech firms' profits and regulating them like utilities, which would make them stodgy, permanent monopolies. It has also rejected break-ups: thanks to network effects, one of the Facebabies or Googlettes might simply become dominant again. Instead the EU's doctrine marries two approaches. One draws on its members' cultures, which, for all their differences, tend to protect individual privacy. The other uses the EU's legal powers to boost competition.</p><p>The first leads to the assertion that you have sovereignty over data about you: you should have the right to access them, amend them and determine who can use them. This is the essence of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), whose principles are already being copied by many countries across the world. The next step is to allow interoperability between services, so that users can easily switch between providers, shifting to firms that offer better financial terms or treat customers more ethically. (Imagine if you could move all your friends and posts to Acebook, a firm with higher privacy standards than Facebook and which gave you a cut of its advertising revenues.) One model is a scheme in Britain called Open Banking, which lets bank customers share their data on their spending habits, regular payments and so on with other providers. A new report for Britain's government says that tech firms must open up in the same way.</p><p>Europe's second principle is that firms cannot lock out competition. That means equal treatment for rivals who use their platforms. The EU has blocked Google from competing unfairly with shopping sites that appear in its search results or with rival browsers that use its Android operating system. A German proposal says that a dominant firm must share bulk, anonymised data with competitors, so that the economy can function properly instead of being ruled by a few data-hoarding giants. (For example, all transport firms should have access to Uber's information about traffic patterns.) Germany has changed its laws to stop tech giants buying up scores of startups that might one day pose a threat.</p><p>Europe's approach offers a new vision, in which consumers control their privacy and how their data are monetised. Their ability to switch creates competition that should boost choice and raise standards. The result should be an economy in which consumers are king and information and power are dispersed. It would be less cosy for the tech giants. They might have to offer a slice of their profits (the big five made $150bn last year) to their users, invest more or lose market share.</p><p>The European approach has risks. It may prove hard to achieve true interoperability between firms. So far, GDPR has proved clunky. The open flow of data should not cut across the concern for privacy. Here Europe's bureaucrats will have to rely on entrepreneurs, many of them American, to come up with answers. The other big risk is that Europe's approach is not adopted elsewhere, and the continent becomes a tech Galapagos, cut off from the mainstream. But the big firms will be loth to split their businesses into two continental silos. And there are signs that America is turning more European on tech: California has adopted a law that is similar to GDPR. Europe is edging towards cracking the big-tech puzzle in a way that empowers consumers, not the state or secretive monopolies. If it finds the answer, Americans should not hesitate to copy it\u2014even if that means looking to the lands their ancestors left behind.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-FE7RU63</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPB-S0S1-DY2R-2194-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1093\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Around April 2018, Google\u2019s code of conduct was changed to reflect a vaguer commitment to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d while merely \u201cmeasuring themselves against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct,\u201d i.e. in effect, business as usual.    Last week, the House Antitrust Subcommittee had summoned the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google to grill them on how their companies maintain, enhance and abuse their monopoly power. In the six-hour session, members cross-examined the CEOs on alleged misstep after misstep, often not waiting for an explanation in response to their yes/no questions. In addition to the announced topic of antitrust violations, members also diverged into other issues of abuse of privacy, political bias and Republican conspiracy theories.   A Wake-Up Call For The Four   The session should be a wake-up call for the CEOs of firms that have long bathed in the positive glow from the vast array of benefits that they have showered on users and customers and the unprecedented market capitalization that Wall Street has bestowed on them. They had also benefited from the suggestion that Silicon Valley companies were somehow different from big business with their espousal of \u201cdoing no evil.\u201d Yet these four firms are now bigger than big. Together with Microsoft, they are now valued at more than $6 trillion, equivalent to more than a quarter of the entire U.S. economy\u2014far bigger than the industrial giants of the 20 th Century.     What was most striking about the hearing was the bipartisan animosity towards the four. Both Democrats and Republicans argued relentlessly that the four\u2014Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google\u2014are doing bad things. The venom was bipartisan. The hearing showed that these firms are now facing brutal political scrutiny.   Diverging Preparedness   The preparedness of the lawmakers was also striking. The members had done their homework and were engaged in a coordinated set of attacks, no holds barred. Each member had selected a particular area to examine and was ready with detailed examples, with question after question, often not staying for a detailed answer, interrupting the CEO\u2019s explanation  with a statement, \u201cI will take that to be a yes, and we need to move on.\u201d    By comparison, the CEOs seemed unprepared for the venom. They presented themselves as being unaware of some of the most famous cases (for example, Amazon and diapers) or recent Wall Street Journal articles about their supposed wrongdoing. They promised to \u201clook into issues\u201d and \u201cget back to the committee.\u201d Tactically, that looked as though they weren\u2019t taking the hearing seriously, and counting on lobbying and the Senate to block any basic change.    The tech titans no doubt sought to avoid appearing contentious. While never actually admitting wrongdoing, Amazon\u2019s Bezos for instance said that he couldn\u2019t guarantee that wrongdoing had never happened and assured the committee that he was looking into it. By maintaining ignorance, the CEOs at least postponed the day of reckoning.    As noted by technology columnist Geoffrey Fowler , the CEOs also tried to get by with their usual subterfuges, such as \u201cYou are in control of your data,\u201d \u201cYou have lots of choice,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re  really that big,\u201d \u201cWe provide relevant information,\u201d and \u201cWe are apolitical,\u201d even as the members continued to poke gaping holes in these half-truths.    Perhaps the CEOs were not expecting the preparedness of the committee members or the virulence of the attacks. They could have been lulled into nonchalance by the extraordinary financial gains that they were to announce the following day. These extraordinary profits and unprecedented market capitalizations reflect the fact that digital technologies have enabled workers to do their jobs from home, students to continue their classes while schools are closed, and people to stay in touch with loved ones and entertain themselves while sheltering in place. Tech companies have been reaping enormous benefits from this shift. In essence, through Agile management and network effects, these firms reliably deliver benefits to customers and customers love the benefits they receive. For example, Bezos noted that trust in Amazon is around 80%, while politely refraining from noting that trust in Congress is less than 20%.   The Failure To Make An Antitrust Case   Despite their preparation, the lawmakers however failed to come to grips with the underlying antitrust issue. Antitrust law is currently based on damage to customers. Few if any of the many examples showed damage to customers. They were almost all about damage to other businesses and possible competitors. So, on a strict legal basis, the case for wrongdoing on current antitrust law was never made.    The Democratic members cited example after example where other businesses being hurt, including for example those businesses that had signed on Amazon\u2019s platform as potential partners. Implicitly the lawmakers were making an argument for changing the antitrust law.   A Change In Antitrust Law   It will however be tricky to come up with a definition of \u201cunfair competition\u201d, given that the very driver of capitalism is competition. What is needed, according to columnist Steven Pearlstein is a major rewrite of the industrial-era antitrust statutes to bring the tech titans to heel.\u201d That\u2019s because \u201ccurrent antitrust doctrines are too limited to adequately protect competition \u2026 or stop anticompetitive conduct.\u201d  A rewrite is needed to prevent \u201cover-consolidation in virtually every sector of the economy, nowhere more so than in tech, where there is a natural tendency of customers to want use the same software, communicate on the same network or transact business on the same platform as everyone else.\u201d    Google\u2019s purchase of YouTube and Waze, Facebook\u2019s purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon\u2019s purchase of Zappos and Ring \u2014 all of these were given the green light by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission\u2014were cited as examples of inappropriate attempts by de facto monopolists to neutralize competition.    According to Bill Baer, who headed the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division during the Obama administration, \u201cWe went from an antitrust culture [in the 1970s] where \u201cthe government always wins\u201d to one where enforcers almost always lost, or where fear of losing caused the government not to act at all.\u201d    Pearlstein makes the case for a 21st century antitrust law that would \u201cprotect and enhance competition not only because it lowers prices, increases choice and improves quality for consumers, but also because it stimulates innovation, reduces income inequality and reduces the concentration of economic and political power.\u201d    \u201cThis would not be the first time,\u201d writes Pearlstein, \u201cthat Congress has been needed to step in to revive and update the antitrust law \u2014 it happened in 1914, 1936, 1950 and 1976.\u201d   The Problem With Big Tech   There is thus a growing political and analytic consensus is that these firms do present a substantive problem. They grew very big because of Agile management and network effects that ended up conferring huge benefits on customers and the firms themselves.  Now they are de facto monopolies and like all monopolies they have started doing bad things.    The wrongdoing has taken an aggravated form given that these firms have become so dominant that they have become de facto utilities. There are some behaviors in utilities that would be acceptable if they were just one path among many, but not acceptable when they have become in effect the main public highway.    It is likely government action will happen, particularly if Democrats gain control of the three branches of government. In any event, Europe is already well along this path with GDPR , with substantial fines already levied. The U.S. is now just playing catch-up.   The Options For Big Tech   Big Tech faces two main options. They can go on acting as if nothing is amiss and hope that government action will take a long time to become a reality. Or they can take proactive steps to recognize the legitimacy of the issues and regulate themselves with a commitment to reengage with \u201cacting honorably\u201d and \u201cdoing no evil\u201d. The latter course of action will be the smarter and less painful one.    We have seen this movie before. In 2001, an American antitrust law case accused Microsoft of illegally maintaining its monopoly position in the PC market The case was eventually settled but the result was almost the same as if Microsoft had lost. Lawyers started appearing in every internal meeting in Microsoft, raising questions about how any particular statement or decision would look in an antitrust hearing. It took more than a decade for Microsoft to recover its entrepreneurial spirit.    Microsoft was notable for its absence from last week\u2019s Congressional hearing. Microsoft seems to have learned that moderating its own conduct is preferable to attempting to extract the last drop of profit in a world in which they are already swimming in unprecedented profits.    Google had it right the first time, when it proudly embraced a code of conduct in which \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d and \u201cacting honorably\u201d were front and center of Google\u2019s code of conduct. The Big Four have grown big by creating great workplaces that end up doing the right thing by customers. Now they need to raise the sights and take a further step: do the right thing by society by not abusing their market power.    Regulation is coming: the only question is whether the big four will do it themselves or have it done to them.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has taken a hit and measures of market volatility remain elevated. A further shake-out of option trades means stocks are likely to remain choppy. To add to the mix, US presidential and congressional elections are just weeks away.</p><p>So far this has not rattled broader investor sentiment too badly. Fund managers largely agree that the market had been in need of a \u201chealthy correction\u201d to blow some of the froth off Big Tech and provide a fresh buying opportunity at more attractive prices. </p><p>This attitude also reflects a level of comfort among tech investors. A buyer of the March low in the Nasdaq 100 \u2014 a bet which appears to have been led by hedge funds at the expense of other traditional managers \u2014 holds a gain of nearly 60 per cent, even after the latest bout of selling. Investment portfolios that have ridden the tech and growth stock juggernaut for much of the past decade, and particularly from early 2016, have a far bigger cushion to soften short-term blows. </p><p>One big problem for those keen to bet on a bigger tech correction: what is the alternative? Tech still offers solid growth prospects and the potential for a significant return on equity. It still looks good for a while yet, reflecting the acceleration of digital trends for business, education and households in the wake of the pandemic. The premium for owning best-in-class stocks is arguably justified, given a business cycle supported by low interest rates and modest inflation pressure over the next few years. </p><p>Even in the event of a vaccine for Covid-19 arriving, shifts in behaviour inspired by the pandemic will keep rewarding innovation and disruption \u2014 qualities that define tech companies. </p><p>Still, elevated valuations require vindication in the form of robust earnings growth over the coming quarters.</p><p>Before the latest wave of selling, the tech herd had effortlessly propelled price-to-earnings multiples \u2014 a common valuation measure \u2014 for equity leaders and the Nasdaq 100 into the danger zone associated with the dotcom bubble. For example, the US equity team at Citigroup calculates that once lower corporate tax rates are factored into valuations, the top 10 US tech companies are trading at a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 75 times, almost precisely in line with the turn of the century.</p><p>It is natural, therefore, to draw comparisons with the crashes that followed other market peaks, particularly those of 2000 and 2007. But those market heights were followed by a protracted decline in earnings growth over ensuing quarters, whereas the hit from the pandemic appears less extensive. Wall Street analysts expect a recovery during the second half of 2020 that gains momentum into 2021.</p><p>The safest bet, perhaps, is for a middling performance from here. Aside from valuation concerns, certain tech names with strong business models may have to contend with a stronger antitrust regulatory line from governments in the coming months. The prospect of higher corporate taxes and even levies on windfall profits is serious. </p><p>But here is what keeps Wall Street bulls going: \u201cUnless earnings decline noticeably and prove high valuations wrong, stocks do not drop in any persistent way,\u201d observes Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek.</p><p>And of course, the interest-rate environment of 2020 is unprecedented. True, the Nasdaq 100 trades around a hefty 40 times earnings for the next 12 months, according to the CME Group. But turn that PE ratio upside down to get the earnings yield for these stocks, at 2.5 per cent. Unlike 2000, this proxy measure of returns sits well above the current 1.4 per cent on offer from the 30-year Treasury bond.\u00a0</p><p>That makes it hard to call time on big tech and the equity growth bull run. A meaningful decline would require a profound shift in well-established economic and financial trends. It would also require a break in monetary policy that few consider to be realistic. Ultimately, other sectors of the stock market will play catch-up with tech only when there is evidence of a broader economic recovery and the rekindling of inflation pressure.

The twelve include Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[3]), Facebook Inc. (FB[4]), Google parent Alphabet Inc.</p><p>(GOOGL[5]), Apple Inc. (AAPL[6]), Alibaba Group Ltd. (BABA[7]), Tencent Holdings, Baidu, Kakao, Samsung, Mercado Libre, and Rakuten.\"The entry of large technology firms ('big techs') into financial services holds the promise of efficiency gains and can enhance financial inclusion,\" the report states, while warning that regulators face challenges in dealing with them. \"Big techs' entry presents new and complex trade-offs between financial stability, competition and data protection,\" the BIS states, adding that \"Regulators need to ensure a level playing field between big techs and banks, taking into account big techs' wide customer base, access to information and broad-ranging business models.\" Significance For Investors  As a key player in the international financial system, often described as the central bank[8] for central banks, the BIS has an obvious concern with how big techs may change the competitive and regulatory landscape in banking and finance. The report notes that its advance into financial services has been most pronounced in China, the home country of Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu.Payment services were an initial point of entry into financial services for many of these firms, with offerings such as PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and AliPay (from Alibaba). The report indicates that overcoming a lack of trust between buyers and sellers on e-commerce[9] platforms was a primary motivation for developing these services.Facebook, meanwhile, has a digital currency under development that has been called Project Libra or GlobalCoin[10], in various press reports. Morgan Stanley has observed in a recent note that this holds the potential to place Facebook and its partners into competition with existing central banks such as the Federal Reserve[11], Barron's[12] reports. However, the BIS appears to be less concerned, having relegated this project to a footnote in its report.On the other hand, the BIS observes that big techs may have a huge advantage over other players in financial services, both existing and potential, given their control of key technical infrastructure and vast amounts of user data. This could lead to monopolistic or discriminatory pricing, as well as the ability to shut out competition, if not regulated properly.Data analytics, network externalities[13], and interwoven activities, abbreviated as \"DNA,\" are key aspects of these companies' business models that tend to reinforce each other, the BIS says. Network externalities, which represent the benefits associated with using a given platform, increase as the number of users rises for a given platform and as more services are available through it.More users and more services mean more data and better analytics, allowing for yet more improvement in the platform and the functions delivered through it, as well as more targeted advertising and service offers, the report notes. While big banks have large numbers of clients and large arrays of services, \"so far they have not been as effective as big techs at harnessing the DNA feedback loop,\" the BIS concludes. Looking Ahead  \"Big techs' DNA can lower the barriers to provision of financial services by reducing information and transaction costs, and thereby enhance financial inclusion. However, these gains vary by financial service and could come with new risks and market failures,\" the report asserts.

Now, it seems to be driving dealmaking and regulatory decisions, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consider Disney's $US66 billion ($86.2 billion) agreement to buy 21st Century Fox assets, or AT&amp;T's bid for Time Warner, which are reactions to the power of Netflix and Amazon. Or the CVS-Aetna deal, which aims to counter Amazon's growth in the drug market as well as Google's likely entry into healthcare.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consider also the US Federal Communication Commission's decision last week to roll back \"net neutrality\" rules, the principles that stipulate that internet service providers must treat all online traffic the same. While FCC chair Ajit Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, says this is about moving back towards \"light touch\" regulation, it is also about changing the balance of power between tech and telecoms.</p><p>It does this by allowing the largest internet service providers such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile to charge the cash-rich platform companies fees to move their traffic to the front of the digital queue.</p><p>All of it speaks to the huge power of the Fangs - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google - which now dominate not just the digital business, but the entire economy. Eighty per cent of corporate wealth resides in 10 per cent of companies rich in intellectual property, of which the platform companies are the richest, according to the McKinsey Global Institute.</p><p>It is a power that has grown so quickly, and changed so much, that it is forcing a fundamental rethink of everything from antitrust policy to the rules that have governed the internet for more than 20 years. It is also forcing both liberals and conservatives to bump up uncomfortably against their traditional policy positions.</p><p>Many of the monopoly battles being waged are not confrontations between David and Goliath, but rather Goliath and Goliath.</p><p>Take net neutrality. The term was coined in the early 2000s by the academic Tim Wu, author of The Attention Merchants. It has come to be understood as shorthand for the idea that everyone - rich and poor, the start-up and the multinational conglomerate - should be able to use the internet on a level playing field.</p><p>Liberals in the US have supported the idea for reasons of social equity. But some conservatives, as well as some members of the business community, have argued that it is a distorting regulation that prevents the ISPs from properly monetising their investment in broadband.</p><p>It's a fair point. After all, the telecoms companies building the 21st century digital highway have single-digit profit margins, while the likes of Google and Facebook - which simply has to wait for someone to upload a cat video and then sell hyper-targeted advertising - have high double-digit profit margins.</p><p>Big tech platform companies, which have been the largest corporate beneficiaries of net neutrality, have until now worked both the social and economic arguments to their own advantage. They and many other supporters of net neutrality - including start-ups worried about being winnowed out by larger players with deeper pockets that can pay to have their data delivered faster - have argued that more power for the ISPs would squash innovation on the internet and penalise small businesses.</p><p>Yet a number of critics would argue that the Fangs themselves are a bigger risk to innovation than the telecoms companies, in large part because of the network effects that make them natural monopolies. The currency of the digital age is data, and its value grows exponentially. This allows the biggest players to become ever more dominant and able to squash competition in myriad ways - be it snapping up any firm that comes close to their core business model, or via \"efficient infringement\" on competitors' IP.</p><p>Other industries complain that the Fangs still enjoy unfair regulatory exemptions thanks to loopholes in section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. Economic power begets political power, which is why the Fangs have fought hard, and so far successfully, in Washington against efforts to repeal those loopholes, as well as other attempts to make their business models fairer and more transparent.</p><p>All this serves as a reminder that many of the monopoly battles being waged these days are not confrontations between David and Goliath, but rather Goliath and Goliath. It is hard to argue that a vertical merger between content and pipe owners such as Time Warner and AT&amp;T is a good thing for competition, or for the little guy, even if you buy the idea that the goal of antitrust policy should be \"consumer welfare\".</p><p>(For the record I don't; we need to think about new business creation and workers, too.) But it seems inconsistent to go after AT&amp;T without also going after the Fangs.</p><p>What is lost in all of this debate may well be the American consumer. Even if the US had an administration that cared about enforcing antitrust - beyond US President Donald Trump's politicised battles over whether Time Warner should divest itself of his arch media enemy CNN - policies predicated on outdated models that do not address the problems of the digital age will not even out the playing field.</p><p>Meanwhile, a rollback of net neutrality will not really hurt the Fangs - they can easily pay whatever fees the ISPs decide to charge. But it could create a premium and economy class internet for consumers. What we need is equal and consistent application of competition rules. That will probably mean coming up with new rules.</p><p>Critics would argue that the Fangs are a bigger risk to innovation than the telecoms companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6y1azc17ytvrzd3sjj2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R6M-WS61-F0J6-J0XS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The marketing professor is a self-professed fan of companies like Facebook, Apple, Google, and Amazon. He's made a bundle from owning their stocks, some are clients of his, and even wrote a book last year called, 'The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.'[1] Over the past two years, annual talks that Galloway gave at the DLD Conference in Munich that analyzed their prowess and success have gone viral on YouTube. (See his 2015 and 2016 talks embedded below.) </p><p>This week, however, Galloway returned to DLD to give a talk about the four with a very different flavor: 'The Break Up Of Big Tech.' 'This started out as a love affair. I want to be clear,' he said. 'I love these companiesAfter spending the majority of the last two years of my life really trying to understand them and the relationship of the ecosystem, I've become 100 percent convinced that it's time to break these companies up.' It's an audacious claim from anyone, made even more startling coming from someone who has been such a close and bullish observer of these tech giants. Yet for Galloway, it has been clear that the four companies have simply become too big, and too powerful. 'The premise of my book is that Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are our new gods, our new source of love, our consumptive gods,' he said. 'And as a result of their ability to tap into these very basic instincts, they've aggregated more market cap than the majority of nation's GDPI think these entities are more powerful than any entity with maybe the exception of China and the US.' Galloway said he wasn't making his argument based on many of the current emotional outcries against the companies, though they are important to note. And he proceeded to list what he considers to be their numerous sins. 'There are reasons to be angry at them,' he said. 'They basically power fake newsSo the notion that our platforms have been weaponized by the intelligence unit of a foreign adversary was initially responded to by Facebook as crazy, that we were crazy for thinking that. Then we found out it was millions of people, and now we're finding out it was hundreds of millions of people who were exposed.' He argued that given emerging research on the impact of social and digital media, no teens should be allowed on social media before they are 18 years old. 'Here's a ranking of the most powerful people by Forbes,' he said. 'This an insult to Americans. The most powerful person hands down in the world is Mark Zuckerberg. He can turn off or on your mood. He can take any product up or down. He can pretty much kill any company in the tech space. We're now finding that teens are more prone to depression because of their time on social media. If there was an ice cream company that was making teens more depressed or more susceptible to suicide, we wouldn't be seating that person next to the president at meetings in Silicon Valley.' These companies attempt to mask their problems behind empty rhetoric, such as claiming they are simply neutral platforms, saying they can't do anything about such issues, or that sometimes innovation can be challenging. 'When you hear 'innovation' at events like this it means 'elegant theft,'' he said. 'That means we know we're wrong, but we have no intention of doing anything about it.' He added, 'My other favorite: 'We need to do better.'' While such behavior has clearly infuriated Galloway, he said much of the blame lies with users, and not the companies. By not electing politicians who would scrutinize and correct such behavior, citizens have given their tacit endorsement. Even when companies are caught, mostly by European regulators, for violating antitrust rules or taxes or privacy laws, the fines that come with numbers that sound big are in fact miniscule given the wealth accumulated by the four giants. 'We are telling these companies that the smart thing to do is lie and break the law,' he said.\u00a0'They are doing their job, which is to make more profits. Who screwed up here? The man in the mirror.' All this, however is not a reason to break them up. The real reason to break them up is because they have made too many markets anti-competitive. 'The markets are failing,' he said. 'The key to competitive markets is that no one company has too much power. And we have blown way by that.' Galloway said power can't just be measured by market share alone, citing the frenzy created around Amazon's search for a second headquarters. 'The most egregious example of a society where we no longer worship at the altar of kindness and character but of innovation and money is the shitshow called HQ2 going on with Amazon, where basically governments have decided to turnover their civic responsibilities and taxation authority to the Seattle Giant,' he said. He pointed to other stats around Amazon, such as its stock price which seems to indicate investors believe it will attain monopoly pricing power, or its large market share in e-commerce, cloud computing, smart speakers. Galloway said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos likely knows his power is going to eventually provoke greater scrutiny, which is why he bought the Washington Post and has dramatically expanded Amazon's lobbying team in D.C. Meanwhile, Google now controls around 90 percent of search in some places, and has been accused by European regulators of using that power to send traffic to its own services over other competitors. Facebook, by controlling most of the top apps, now 'owns mobile. Your mobile phone is delivery vehicle for Facebook.' And that, in turn, is allowing it smother competitors like Snap, he said. He's not surprised by the growing backlash against these companies, given these concerns and how they conflict with our notions of the role technology should play. 'So why are we so angry?' he said. 'I think we've gotten spoiled with technology. We've come to believe that technology is about the betterment of man.' In previous eras, that meant harvesting the minds of the best and brightest to do things like put a man on the moon. But despite having far more powerful technology at their hands, the best and brightest in Silicon Valley today have far different priorities. 'And why has the greatest collection of creativity, IQ and capital been brought together?' Galloway said. 'One collective mission. I've studied these companies, they've all been brought together not to create comit\u00e9 of man, not to solve world hunger, they've been brought together simply sell another fucking Nissan.' Breaking them up, in Galloway's view, will unleash greater competition, which would create more jobs, a broader tax base, and more innovation. He pointed to the U.S. Department of Justice's case against Microsoft in the late 1990s, which even if it was a mixed result, delivered a message to 'stop killing small companies.' 'Otherwise, Google would never have been born, he said. He knows Silicon Valley and the tech giants will resist forcefully, and try to paint break-up advocates as liberals, and weak, and afraid of competition and innovation. That's why it's important to remember the truth is just the opposite. 'The reasons we break them up is because we are capitalists,' he said. 'These markets are no longer competitive. They can no longer resist abusing their market power. 'We don't break these guys up because they are evil,' he added. 'That's bullshit. They are no less or more evil than us. We don't break them up because they avoid taxes. It's our job to hold them accountable. We don't break them up because they destroy jobsWe break these guys ups up because we are capitalists and it is time.

Apple Inc. (AAPL[2]), Alphabet Inc.</p><p>(GOOGL[3]), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[4]) and Facebook Inc. (FB[5]) lost a combined total of $140 billion inmarket capitalization[6] on Monday, as the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC[7]) get set to begin their investigations. But contrary to the pessimism of the markets, New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway believes that breaking up Big Tech could be a boon for shareholders, according toBarron's[8].'DoJ and the FTC are slowly but steadily getting it right,' says Galloway. 'But the market on Monday got it wrong. Break them up and the spinoffs will be accretive to shareholders. There's an opportunity for enormous value creation.' Big Tech Breakup: Stronger Apart Big Tech conglomerates are less competitive;Big Tech conglomerates are less innovative;Spinoffs would create more value for shareholders. Source: Scott Galloway, Barron's, Bloomberg  What It Means for Investors  Galloway's been making the case for a number of years now that Alphabet, Facebook, and Google in particular should be broken up\u2014Alphabet should spin off YouTube, Facebook should spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, and Amazon should spin off its vast cloud computing operation, Amazon Web Services (AWS). These big conglomerates are less innovative and create less value for shareholders than they otherwise could as much smaller entities.He cites the breakup of AT...nc. (T[9]) and thespinoff[10] of PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL[11]) from eBay Inc. (EBAY[12]) as past examples in which, after being broken up, the individual components of the former conglomerates created more value for shareholders rather than destroyed it. 'In almost every instance, maybe not in the short term, but in the medium and long term, the aggregate value of the spun companies is much greater than the original conglomerates,' Galloway toldBloomberg[13].Some recent valuation analyses from Wall Street analysts suggest Galloway might be on to something. Cowen analyst John Blackledge and his team issued a report that pins the value ofAWS alone at $506 billion[14], 56% of Amazon's total market capitalization of $905.6 billion. AWS as a stand-alone business might be among the 10 most highly valued companies in the world.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson and his team used a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP[15]) analysis for Apple at the end of March. They found that the most valuable segment of the iPhone maker's business was not its products but its services segment. Olson cited a value of$500 billion for Apple services[16] and $400 billion for Apple products, which combines to a total that is a little over $6 billion higher than the company's current market valuation of $893.8 billion.UBS analyst Eric J. Sheridan thinks that a break up of Google parent Alphabet would also lead to anaccretion[17] of value to shareholders, rather than dilution. 'In the case of any company breakup (even if a possible outcome that would be years away), we actually see unlocked value as the various pieces within [Alphabet's] conglomerate would likely warrant a higher valuation,' hesaid[18]. Looking Ahead  Interestingly, the decision to begin investigating the power wielded by Big Tech companies comes as the U.S. ramps up its trade war with China, whose technological prowess is growing every day. U.S. regulators may be able to limit the power wielded by America's tech giants by breaking them up, but that won't be an option for China's increasingly dominant tech companies.

That seemed to change a few days ago when the Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a $5 billion fine. And there are promises of more to come, if not from the FTC, then perhaps from some other part of the federal government. Overseas, the specter of other action, from other capitals, also looms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this anti-big tech moment, the slogan \"break them up\" is simple, catchy and has been adopted by some politicians and other observers to capture the emotion of the era. Unfortunately, \"breaking up\" large tech platforms is often not a good solution to the economic harms created by large firms in this sector. There are usually more effective ways to create competition.</p><p>The break-them-up sloganeering fails to recognize that \"big\" is not, under the law, an antitrust violation. New products can achieve huge market share because consumers love them: consider Rollerblade's dominance in the inline-skating market in the late 1980s, AOL's high share of Internet access in the 1990s or how Apple owned the tablet market in 2011. If a product gets a big share because it is good and popular - but its maker has not behaved anti-competitively toward its rivals - it has not violated our antitrust laws. Without new laws giving the government the power to take a different approach, Washington cannot just break up big tech, or any company, solely because it is large or has a high market share.</p><p>Which means antitrust enforcers must determine whether, and exactly how, each tech platform violated U.S. antitrust laws. And because these platforms have totally different business models, with different degrees of market share - Google runs ad-supported search and content, Apple sells devices, Amazon engages in e-commerce, Facebook runs ad-supported social media - one would expect the tactics that might work to suppress rivals would be very different for each company.</p><p>An agency should analyze each platform individually and determine whether it acted in a way that was anticompetitive. Public information already sheds light on some possibilities for such an antitrust case. Perhaps (as a Facebook executive said) an independent Instagram would have become a serious competitor to Facebook. The Clayton Act permits the FTC to bring a case against Facebook after the fact for anticompetitive acquisitions that lessened competition. If the government were to win such a case, it would then be enabled to impose a remedy to restore the lost competition.</p><p>That bring us to the second question: Will a breakup prompt a remedy that will increase competition? In the old days of the Standard Oil monopoly, enforcers often broke up large entities by geography. But there is no sense in which it's useful to a have a search engine or social network for a small section of the country. Rather, an agency must think carefully about the source of each platform's market power and figure out what remedy - antitrust or otherwise - would create competition in that market. If used indiscriminately, a breakup can actually harm consumers and workers and reduce innovation.</p><p>Simply divesting Instagram from Facebook is unlikely to work. For one thing, everyone wants to be on the same site as their friends, so a divested division with no links to Facebook would likely lose its customers quickly - back to Facebook.</p><p>Secondly, Facebook began integrating the backends of Instagram and WhatsApp in January 2019. By the time any antitrust verdict is rendered, there will be one coherent Facebook and no divisions to divest. However, competition could be restored by requiring that Facebook enable open interconnection between itself and any new market entrant. As a result of the interconnection, a consumer could switch to a new social media platform based on a better user experience or privacy, without sacrificing the connection to other Facebook and Instagram friends. Mandatory interconnection would largely defeat the strong network effects that protect incumbent platforms. Facebook could be required to facilitate interconnections for a period of time long enough to give competition a chance to take hold.</p><p>Third, and more generally, the government can go beyond antitrust and increase competition by establishing a more muscular regulator to level the playing field between incumbents and entrants. Regulations that lower entry barriers will help reduce the entrenched market power of dominant platforms. Today it is very difficult for a consumer to switch platform providers because her data are not under her control. What if a consumer could port her shopping data from Amazon.com to Jet.com with a few clicks? (Amazon's founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Post.) Or her favorite playlists between Spotify and Pandora? Data portability could allow new competitors to attract customers more easily.</p><p>Finally, a regulator could establish open standards for micro-payments from digital businesses to consumers. Platforms would then have to compete not just on quality but also on price - by paying consumers to use their search engines or social media sites. Regulations such as these and others could erode barriers to entry and give more opportunities for competition to manifest itself to the benefit of consumers.</p><p>Just \"break them up\" is an oversimplified sound bite, not a real policy that would restore competition in digital markets and benefit consumers.</p><p>             Read more:          </p><p>             Megan McArdle: Why 'break up big tech' will work better as a Warren campaign theme than as an actual policy          </p><p>             The Post's View: The Supreme Court's Apple ruling gives tech titans reason to be nervous          </p><p>             Mark Zuckerberg: The Internet needs new rules.
