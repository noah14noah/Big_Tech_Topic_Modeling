That's 33 percent higher than last week's bid of $18 a share by Texas-based Dell Computer Inc. 3PAR's shares rocketed nearly 45 percent higher Monday, jumping $8.05 to finish at $26.09. That's a possible hint that investors speculate an even higher bid could emerge -- or that both HP and Dell might have to sweeten their original bids.</p><p>\"3PAR provides a clearly significant competitive advantage for either HP or Dell, whichever company wins the bidding,\" said Rob Enderle, a San Jose-based industry analyst.</p><p>Both HP and Dell have maneuvered lately to extend their product offerings beyond their traditional business of personal computers into more profitable endeavors.</p><p>\"HP's proposal offers superior value to 3PAR's shareholders. Our global reach, strong routes to market and commitment to innovation uniquely position HP as the ideal fit for 3PAR,\" said Dave Donatelli, an executive vice president with HP.</p><p>Dell and 3PAR did not provide comment Monday about the fresh bid.</p><p>\"Half the reason these companies want 3PAR is to have an advantage in getting the technology,\" Enderle said. \"The other half of the reason is they want to prevent the other guy from having 3PAR.\"</p><p>This enables data management to become more efficient.</p><p>\"3PAR could become a big player in all this stuff and help these companies take market share,\" Enderle said.</p><p>During the most recent 12 months that ended in June, 3PAR lost $3.2 million on revenues of $204.1 million.

So let's dive right into what can only be described as the most interesting year for tech news in a long while.          HP Drops a Grenade in Room, Runs          PC giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) made several blockbuster revelations in mid-August, and attached them, for some reason, to its otherwise decent quarterly financial results announcement. The firm said it would purchase corporate search software maker Autonomy for $10.3 billion, would stop selling its webOS-based smartphones and TouchPad tablet, and was examining whether to sell or spin off its PC business. HP, in other words, is following in the footsteps of IBM. </p><p>        Curiously, the webOS piece of the announcement got the most press. But the other two revelations are far more important. HP is attempting to do what IBM did before it, which is to reinvent itself as a purely corporate-focused provider of software and services.         That HP would drop its PC business is, perhaps, the most shocking. At the time of the announcement, HP was the number one PC maker in the world, selling far more units per quarter than its closest rival, Dell. (According to IDC, HP controls 18 percent of the worldwide market for PCs, compared to 11 percent for number-two Dell.)         So why the exit strategy? HP, like the old General Motors, is a big company that brings a lot of overhead to every physical product it sells. But the PC market is a low-end, cut-rate commodity market, except for Apple, which has nicely established itself as the only high-end PC maker that customers actually consider. And HP's strategy to play in Apple's territory has failed on two counts: Its expensive MacBook Pro knock-offs, the Envy line of PCs, have been ignored by consumers. And its attempt to copy the success of the iPhone and iPad via its blockbuster purchase of Palm a year ago has been even less successful: Smartphones based on Palm webOS fall into the \u201cOther\u201d category in smartphone market share reports and haven't dented the market in the slightest. Even Windows Phone looks like a powerhouse by comparison.         Looking just at HP's PC business, there are heady revenues ($40.7 billion for its previous fiscal year) but relatively tiny profits ($2 billion for the same time frame). And while smaller PC makers like ASUS, Acer, and Samsung may be able to flourish in such a market, this just isn't HP's forte. One wonders if Dell, which today offers a similar mix of PCs and corporate services, is next. Though let's be honest here: A month ago, few people were wondering about such things. That the top PC maker would simply give up is nothing short of a bombshell.         Which leads naturally to Microsoft. HP wasn't just Microsoft's biggest PC maker partner, it was also the software giant's closet companion, the one company that would follow wherever Microsoft led. Anytime a Microsoft product came to market, HP was there with the corresponding hardware. It reads like a Who's-Who list of forgotten Microsoft products, from the Pocket PC and Windows Mobile to Media Center and the Tablet PC. It was corporate codependency as its most obvious.         In the finest traditions of Monday morning quarterbacking, however, we should have seen this one coming. HP, of all companies, purchased ailing Palm and promised to unleash its webOS platform not just on smartphones, but on tablets and, get this, even on its PCs. That's right: HP's plan was to deliver PCs to consumers and businesses that would dual-boot between Windows and Palm webOS, offering a choice, yes, but also a not-so-subtle shiv in the side of Microsoft's decades-long strategy.         This plan seemed curious at the time, but it never came to fruition, seeming more fantastical than real. But we should now see HP's webOS experiment \u2014 failed along with the poor-selling webOS-based TouchPad tablet that no one seemed to want \u2014 as the wake-up call that it is. Here was Microsoft's biggest and closest partner buying its own platform so it could step out of Microsoft's shadow and provide complete, HP-based software and hardware solutions to customers. Clearly, the company had been planning something for a long time now, some seismic strategy shift. That it moved so quickly to kill off both webOS and its PC business \u2014 the TouchPad was barely on the market two months \u2014 is interesting. HP is clearly serious about remaking itself.         For HP's customers, there are many questions and few answers. Both webOS and the HP PC business could be spun off, together or separately, or sold to other parties. Samsung allegedly was in talks to purchase the PC business earlier this year, for example. I expect HP, like IBM, to continue to support its PC products, and like IBM, to resell PCs from whatever company does walk away with this business.         That said, HP's exit from the PC business and from the broader consumer market changes everything, not just for Microsoft, but for the many other companies that are trying to compete in these markets. For entrenched successes like Google, with its Android-based products and services, and Apple, with iOS (iPhone, iPad), HP's exit is confirmation that their focus on \u201cpost-PC\u201d products and services is the right one. For other big PC makers \u2014 Dell, and possibly Lenovo \u2014 HP's move is perhaps something they've considered themselves. And for the smaller PC players, HP is providing them with a chance to make new moves in this post-netbook PC market.         Besides my GM comparison previously, the parallels with the car market are everywhere. Just as today's Hyundais, Kias, and Smart Cars would have been inconceivable to American car buyers 30 years ago, the notion that the Acers, ASUSes, and Samsungs of the PC world could be major players today would have been inconceivable to buyers of the first PCs. The times they are a-changing.          Google, Android, and Motorola          Previous to the HP late-summer blockbuster, the big tech news of the year involved escalating mobile industry patent skirmishes, which seemed destined to drag Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM, and other players into full-blown warfare. Then Google simply purchased handset maker Motorola Mobility, not for its phones but its patents. With that move, the mobile industry suddenly seemed destined for more of a quiet, Cold War-style, barely-disguised animosity between these companies.         How we got to this point is convoluted, but the short version goes like this: With the tech industry's seemingly inevitable move from traditional computers to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, those who wish to play in this new market \u2014 platform makers like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, but also the hardware makers (HTC, LG, Samsung) that resell those platforms \u2014 are jockeying for position. And as Apple CEO Steve Jobs noted when he announced the first iPhone \u2014 \u201cwe've patented the hell out of it\u201d \u2014 the prime bargaining chip that any of these companies has is often the patents that protect their inventions.         These patents are used in different ways, but the most common is cross-licensing, where two companies each license the others' patents. When companies refuse to license another's patents, they are threatened then sued. Oddly, few of these cases have gone to court, and indeed, there's a subset of the tech punditry that argues (without really knowing one way or the other) that many of these patents could ultimately be found invalid if they were tested in a legal setting. But such issues, as with a general call for patent reform, are beside the point: Patents are part of the business, so this is the environment in which these companies must compete.         Enter Google: The online giant has a nearly unlimited supply of cash thanks to its successful advertising efforts, which feed off the company's near-monopoly search engine. To jumpstart its mobile efforts, Google elected to give away its Android mobile OS rather than charge a per-unit licensing fee as, say, Microsoft does. This strategy comes with various pros and cons \u2014 again, a topic for another discussion \u2014 but the result is not debatable: Google now owns 43 percent market share for smartphones, a heady leap over the 17 percent it commanded a year ago. And its lead over Apple and the other smartphone makers is growing day by day.         Some \u2014 including yours truly \u2014 have argued that Google is following in Microsoft's antitrust footsteps by using its dominance in one market (in this case, search/advertising) to dump another no-cost product (in this case, Android) in a new market. More to the point, however, Google never established a portfolio of patents related to its mobile industry products. Until this year, however, the other companies in the smartphone industry \u2014 the companies that would like to license their own technologies to others, like Google \u2014 never really threatened Google with patent violation claims, even though Android is clearly infringing on numerous mobile patents.         Instead, these companies went after the smaller companies \u2014 like HTC, Motorola, and Samsung \u2014 that sell Android-based phones. This makes sense from a strategic sense, since these smaller companies can't afford to be held up in court for years at a stretch, as Google could. But it also allowed Google to continue dumping Android and establishing itself, arguably unfairly, as the market leader.         So this year, Google became the target. And when Apple, Microsoft, RIM, and other companies purchased a Nortel patent portfolio for $4.5 billion, Google cried foul, complaining to the US government that this cabal was allying against it and would use those patents as a club in order to get Google to pay.         That was exactly their plan, of course. So in August, Google announced a blockbuster purchase of its own: The company will purchase Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, picking up an Android hardware maker (and somewhat souring its relationship with other partners in the process). But Motorola is most interesting because of its 17,000 patents, many of which are related to the mobile industry.         And with this purchase, Google finally has purchased the patent protection that Android requires. This gives Google the defense it needs when Apple, Microsoft, or other companies come complaining about Android's patent infringements. Because it's highly likely that these companies' mobile products are themselves infringing on Motorola's patents. And heck, why go to court when you can simply cross-license?         What this means to potential customers of these devices is that a cloud that once loomed over Android is now removed. Yes, Android has other issues around OS version fragmentation and so on. But it's now highly unlikely \u2014 impossible, really \u2014 for Apple to try and block the sale of Android devices generally. (This is a strategy Apple is currently using against Android licensee Samsung in Europe.) Which means, going forward, Android and iPhone will likely continue to carve up the top 60 percent of the market or so for themselves, leaving the rest of the market to also-rans like RIM BlackBerry and Microsoft/Nokia Windows Phone.         I don't believe that Google intends to do anything interesting or exciting with Motorola's handset business or other hardware (the company also makes cable TV set top boxes). That would create too much of a strain on Google's partners and could lead to a diminished role for Android. Thus, I expect Google to spin or sell Motorola's hardware business as soon as possible. (Note that the Motorola sale, if approved by regulators, won't happen until 2012.)<br/>InstantDoc ID 139895                                            PAUL THURROTT (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:paul@windowsitpro.com\">paul@windowsitpro.com</email>) is the senior technical analyst for Windows IT Pro.

But some said the persistence of corruption in some parts of the world underscores why U.S. companies must act aggressively to ensure that employees aren't paying bribes or kickbacks overseas.</p><p>Both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice reportedly are looking into the HP case, initiated by German authorities who suspect HP employees paid up to $11 million in kickbacks connected with a 2003 contract to provide computer systems to a Russian government agency.</p><p>Palo Alto-based HP says it is cooperating with authorities and conducting an internal review. In a statement Friday, the company said no senior executives \"then or now\" had knowledge of what it called \"alleged activities that took place seven years ago in Germany and Russia by regional employees.\"</p><p>The Wall Street Journal, however, said German court records show the payments continued until 2006. The newspaper identified two suspects as former HP regional officials in Germany and Russia, and a third as a current HP marketing executive in Germany, now on administrative leave. The payments allegedly were made through middlemen and shell companies that submitted seemingly legitimate invoices.</p><p>But even if the suspects acted without the knowledge of HP's top management, legal experts say the company could still be liable under a U.S. law known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The law prohibits U.S. corporations, or their representatives, from paying bribes to foreign officials.</p><p>\"Even if senior management doesn't know about it, that doesn't give the company a pass,\" said John Davis, an FCPA expert at the Miller Chevalier law firm in Washington, D.C.</p><p>In the last five years, authorities in the United States and Western Europe have assigned a higher priority to bribery cases, as some business groups have argued that enforcement helps level the competitive playing field. The volume of investigations, prosecutions and multimillion-dollar fines have all increased.</p><p>As a result, many big corporations realize they need more than written policies against bribes. Regulators have urged companies to provide employee training, conduct audits and take other steps to prevent illicit deals, said attorney William Barry, an FCPA expert at Richards Kibbe &amp; Orbe in Washington. He said authorities weigh those efforts when considering criminal charges or financial penalties for violations.</p><p>Overseas corruption is a particular concern to Silicon Valley companies that have factories and suppliers in Asia and sales operations around the world. HP, like other big tech vendors, draws much of its revenue from outside the United States.</p><p>Singapore attorney Richard Cassin, who writes a blog about the FCPA and overseas graft, said HP is known for a strong anti-corruption stance.</p><p>HP's ethics policies, listed on the company's website, include employee training and other measures. \"We do not bribe,\" says one document. \"In countries where ethics issues are more likely to arise, we conduct additional training and audits to ensure our standards are met.\"</p><p>Still, overseas business experts say demands for bribes are a recurring problem for multinational companies, particularly in developing countries. Russia frequently scores near the bottom of surveys in which corporate executives rank countries on whether their government and business climate are free from corruption.</p><p>\"Russia is a very difficult place to do business,\" said Kenn Kurtz, CEO of a San Francisco risk management consulting firm called STEELE.</p><p>Frustrated executives at Ikea, the Swedish retailer, have complained publicly that officials at Moscow's electric utility demanded bribes to provide power for newly opened stores. Rather than bow to those demands, Ikea rented diesel generators to produce its own power.</p><p>Even that effort ran into trouble: Ikea said it learned last year that one of its Russian executives accepted kickbacks from the generator supplier, which overcharged Ikea by almost $200 million.</p><p>\"These companies are huge global enterprises and sometimes an individual overseas just goes off the rails,\" Cassin said. \"It happens, but the company is still responsible for that behavior.\"</p><p>Contact Brandon Bailey at 408-920-5022 or follow his reporting at<url normalizedValue=\"'http://twitter.com/BrandonBailey'\"> twitter.com/BrandonBailey </url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-14912006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANJOSEMNG2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7Y8J-R7W0-Y9NC-P3YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>San Jose Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>April 18, 2010 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

It's the first major tech company to produce hardware for the marijuana industry. The computer industry pioneer is partnering with marijuana startup Flowhub to sell point-of-sale solutions that come installed with marijuana-specific software. The goal with this technology is to make it easy for marijuana stores, called dispensaries, to be compliant with state law and federal guidelines. </p><p>Hewlett-Packard[1], a computer industry pioneer, is cashing in on the marijuana \"green rush.\" In a first for the fledgling marijuana industry, HP Inc. will start providing point-of-sale retail solutions, or registers, that come installed with software made for marijuana businesses. The $35 billion[2] enterprise company, whose business is built on selling and installing complex tech products for other companies, is partnering with marijuana startup Flowhub[3] on the first-of-its-kind retail offering. HP will manufacture the hardware, while Flowhub will handle the software side and sell the machines. These new registers are designed for stores where marijuana is sold (called dispensaries), and their software aims to help licensed business owners track sales and inventory, create reports, and stay compliant with state regulatory agencies by sending reports to them automatically.Times are changingThere was a time not too long ago when a medical marijuana patient could only buy their legal cannabis with cash, because federal law prohibits banks and credit unions from taking marijuana money. Even when dispensaries started accepting debit and credit cards, some people still paid with cash or refused receipts[4] because they didn't want to create a paper trail. But times are changing. With nine states and the District of Columbia having fully legalized marijuana, more than one in five Americans[5] live in a state where they can legally enjoy the drug for recreational use. Legal marijuana sales[6] hit $9.7 billion in 2017, a 33% increase over 2016. As marijuana legalization sweeps the nation and the stigma against the drug decreases, tech companies have set out to solve one of the biggest problems facing the industry: compliance.HP saw the legitimacy of the marijuana industryIn addition to making laptops and printers, HP is one of the world's leading providers[7] of point-of-sale retail solutions. The global point-of-sale market size[8] reached nearly $48 billion in 2016. The marijuana industry opens up an entirely new revenue stream for the PC giant.Kyle Sherman, who founded Flowhub in Denver, Colorado, the year after legal marijuana sales began, said HP approached his company about working together sometime in 2017. \"They read about us,\" Sherman told Business Insider. \"Obviously we knew about them.\" In December, Flowhub welcomed representatives from HP's Retail Solutions Department to Denver for a tour of some large-scale marijuana dispensaries. Sherman said that the experience showed HP employees how regulated and \"really legit\" the marijuana industry has become. Earlier this year, HP started manufacturing the hardware for these point-of-sale systems. Flowhub installs its software and sells the machines to marijuana business owners. A handful of HP's systems have been in beta testing at select dispensaries since the start of the year. Aaron Weiss, HP's vice president and general manager for Retail Solutions, said in a statement, \"HP is delighted to be a key part of the solution in this exciting new regulated industry.\"The machine is metal and built to last, according to Sherman. His hope is that the system could someday replace iPads and computers that some marijuana businesses use as registers. IPads and computers might be cheaper solutions than some point-of-sale systems, but, Sherman said: \"You're getting a device that's going to break after six months or a year.\" He added: \"These machines are doing a big job \u2014 an important job \u2014 so you want quality.\"How Flowhub worksFounded in 2015, Flowhub makes software for marijuana growers and sellers that allows them to monitor marijuana from \"seed to sale[9].\" It collects and crunches data to ensure every leafy bud and marijuana product is handled in compliance with state law and federal guidelines. In practical terms, Flowhub helps marijuana businesses show the government that product isn't coming in from illegal cultivation sites or disappearing into the black market. During a typical transaction at a dispensary that uses Flowhub software, customers place their order with an employee and pay in cash, credit, or debit at the register. The point-of-sale system logs the transaction and tracks what inventory comes in and leaves the store. If there's a discrepancy in what inventory has been recorded and what's actually there \u2014 a problem known as shrinkage \u2014 a business owner can search the seed-to-sale platform to figure out a product's last known position in the supply chain and which employees handled it. Flowhub creates a sort of audit trail for all the product managed, which a business owner can provide if they're ever questioned by government authorities seeking proof of compliance. When business owners sync their registers to the cloud, the Flowhub platform sends sales reports automatically to Metrc, a database company that works with government agencies that regulate legalized marijuana. Flowhub currently serves marijuana businesses in Colorado, Oregon, Alaska, California, Michigan, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Nevada, which all use Metrc.Flowhub processes over one million transactions every month, according to the company. With help from California's recreational marijuana market[10], Flowhub projects revenue will top $5 million in 2018.Big Tech is taking the leap into legal marijuanaHP is the first major tech company to produce hardware for the marijuana industry. It joins another computer industry pioneer in tapping into the \"green rush.\" In June 2016, Microsoft revealed it would start making seed-to-sale software[11] from marijuana startup Kind Financial available through a cloud-based software suite that it distributes to state, county, and municipal governments. Kind's software helps regulatory agencies keep tabs on sales and commerce and gives entrepreneurs the comfort that comes with compliance. David Dinenberg, founder and CEO of Kind, told Business Insider that it wasn't easy convincing Microsoft, a 41-year-old company, to foray into marijuana. Kind appealed to Microsoft because it doesn't \"touch the plant,\" or have direct ties to growing or selling marijuana, according to Dinenberg. There's less risk involved for companies that provide ancillary products and services, even when the end-user deals in marijuana. \"At the end of the day, we are a technology company that provides services. We happen to cater to the marijuana industry, but we don't grow marijuana,\" Dinenberg said. The same thinking applies with the deal that HP struck with Flowhub. HP The hulking enteprise company is getting involved with the marijuana industry in a tangential way, but the event still marks a major milestone for both the technology and marijuana industries.NOW

The Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P -- all the major markets are at record.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are the reasons why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A mega merger on Monday. LVMH and Tiffany get married while HP tells Xerox we're over. Xeros says not quite so fast.</p><p>London kicks Uber to the curb saying the company puts passengers at risk.</p><p>And Mike Bloomberg now in the presidential race. He is outspending all but one of his rivals.</p><p>We are live in the world's financial capital, New York City. Glorious, autumnal winter day. It is Monday. It is November the 25th. I'm Richard Quest, and of course. I mean business.</p><p>Darling, I'd marry you for your money in a moment. Well, that was Holly Golightly and she said it in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" And tonight, Tiffany's is marrying LVMH for $16 billion.</p><p>Now, many of you will be well-familiar with a distinctive look and feel of the LVMH bag. This is a couple of grands' worth. It makes these iconic Louis Vuitton bags.</p><p>But of course, Tiffany sells their jewelry and baubles in these instantly recognizable blue boxes.</p><p>Now, can a marriage of blue box and luxurious bag -- can these capture the imagination of investors as they have individually for decades?</p><p>[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]</p><p>QUEST: Don't you just love it Tiffany's? Why does LVMH want the turquoise box?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's jewelry and watches, Richard. So this is a segment that they are competing fiercely with Richemont, which has the likes of Montblanc and Cartier. They want to beef up that division. That's only nine percent of their sales so far. And of course, the history, the brand. This is one of the biggest and most kind of iconic jewelers in the world. It's got a big presence of course in the United States, about 41 percent of their sales there.</p><p>LVMH, don't forget a French company. They want more access to the U.S. consumer.</p><p>QUEST: It's also got branches in just about airport.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right, right.</p><p>QUEST: Seemingly major airports in the world. All of the major cities, but how is it doing?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, that's -- that is the key question because they have had a few issues in the last few years. They had to replace their CEO in 2017 because of flagging sales, and they have been really working to try to appeal to millennial customers, Richard. That has been the big challenge for them.</p><p>They've had to -- they are kind of on a multi-year investment drive to revamp their stores and this is why it makes sense with LVMH because they have a track record in you know, appealing to millennials.</p><p>Here are some of their 75 brands.</p><p>QUEST: How many?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Seventy five brands they have all in all.</p><p>QUEST: Seventy five brands. All right. Excuse me while I go through this. All right, the Celine --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Celine is a luxury French fashion house. You know something from there will probably set you back a couple of grand.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Fendi, another very expensive store. Bags in particular and shoes.</p><p>QUEST: What's the significance of Fendi for them?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The Fendi has been under LVMH since 2001. One of their kind of key luxury brands there. This is Dior. This is significant. This is their last big acquisition when they took full control in 2017 for $13 billion. We will put that down there.</p><p>So until now, this was the biggest acquisition to date, Dior.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Kenzo is interesting. That was the Japanese brand, still is, but it's under LVMH now. Slightly cheaper, so they don't -- it's not just the $2,000.00 bags there.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Givenchy, another iconic French brand.</p><p>QUEST: But does it make sense to have all of these things and put them -- yes.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: This is interesting because this is Fenty. This is Rihanna's beauty brand. This just shows how LVMH is trying to appeal to millennials and doing it quite successfully. They acquired this earlier this year. Sephora has been under LVMH since 1997.</p><p>QUEST: Really?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So it's a wide variety of different price ranges and different brands.</p><p>QUEST: But it's the bags.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Those are the iconic bags.</p><p>QUEST: This one set us back, how much?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: A couple of grand.</p><p>QUEST: A couple of grand.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Two thousand dollars.</p><p>QUEST: For a bag.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, so in all of this, clearly a behemoth of luxury, an extravaganza of excess. But does Tiffany fit well into it?</p><p>[15:05:06]</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, I think what you're seeing with these luxury brands, Richard is not so much them trying to consolidate and getting more of the same, but them trying to diversify.</p><p>LVMH, don't forget was also -- it's not just got clothing and shoes and luxury kind of wearable items. It's also got, you know Moet and Hennessy and it's just bought a hotel chain, Belmont Hospitality, so they are diversifying, and you're seeing the same thing from the other big luxury companies.</p><p>QUEST: Well, I do have a little something for you for Christmas. But you'll have to wait. Thank you. Fascinating stuff.</p><p>All right. Now there is a real shopping spree going on in the market. Move out of Tiffany's and do join me in the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS Mall of the Mergers where there's always a billion dollar bargain to be had in the basement.</p><p>Now, the LVMH deal that you can see in green here is not even the biggest of the day. Charles Schwab is buying TD Ameritrade and that's a deal that's creating $26 billion worth of brokerage behemoth in its own right, and that's all to do with no fees brokeraging.</p><p>But if you go to the other floors, you'll see Stub, you also see Novartis. Now there you have Novartis, which has bought the Medicines Company. That's about cholesterol drugs -- $9.7 billion.</p><p>eBay is selling StubHub to Switzerland's Viagogo. And StubHub dominates of course, the reselling of tickets in the United States, but here, it is the international market.</p><p>And then in the ground floor though, oh dear, well, here is a transaction - - HP and Xerox that's not got even off the ground floor.</p><p>There is no way so far -- HP again rejected the Xerox offer worth $33 billion. Xerox threatening to go hostile. The mall as you can see it, so many deals. Charles Schwab-TD Ameritrade.</p><p>With me is Matt Egan. We'll talk generally in a moment, let's focus on that particular deal and why it makes sense. If they're doing no fee trades, how are they making their money?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER: That's a good question. I think that the fact that there's been this fee war that has broken out as a result of Robinhood and the popularity of their free trading app, it really spooked investors. Stocks all plunged. People were really worried about this big hit to the revenue. So that's why we've seen now a shift to consolidation.</p><p>QUEST: But Charles Schwab and Ameritrade both overnight saying they are going no fee.</p><p>EGAN: That's right. They announced that I believe, it was last month.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>EGAN: And they decided that in order to really thrive in this industry, they need to team up and join forces.</p><p>QUEST: So first of all, in terms of them, where will they make their money? Besides savings on back room stuff, where do they make money in the future if they've gone no fee?</p><p>EGAN: I think that that's the challenge. They do have some of these more sophisticated products that they hope to sell to people, but their bread and butter for the longest time was on selling a piece of these trades.</p><p>Now this is obviously great news for you and I, the retail investor. Now we can go online and buy shares of Tiffany or what have you and it doesn't really cost us anything at all. That's why it's great for us, but investors have been worried about the long term future of this space.</p><p>And now it has set off some speculation about whether or not there might have to do more deals.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, so the other players in the business and by the way, it's worth saying, when you look at the fee costs elsewhere in the rest of the world. The U.S. is clearly leading in terms of no fee. What about JPMorgan, big broker in its own right with a retail business? Morgan Stanley, certainly?</p><p>EGAN: Goldman Sachs as well. I mean, there's been some speculation that maybe some of these Wall Street players could actually come in and swoop and buy the likes of an E-Trade. Maybe Fidelity goes and buys an E-Trade because now these companies are all trying to gather scale.</p><p>I mean, you talked about a luxury goods behemoth with LVMH and Tiffany, this is a brokers' behemoth. We're talking about 24 million customer accounts between Schwab and TD Ameritrade, $5 trillion in client assets. That gives them some real leverage in this space.</p><p>QUEST: Okay, but now talking about the day overall. Novartis, not today, but I mean, these deals. Tiffany's.</p><p>EGAN: Right. StubHub.</p><p>QUEST: StubHub.</p><p>EGAN: We've seen a flurry of deals which --</p><p>QUEST: Why?</p><p>EGAN: Well, I think that there's a couple of things at play. We've seen some surveys suggesting that CEOs are very depressed right now about the outlook. Well, they're not really showing because they're actually going out and they're buying a whole bunch of companies.</p><p>Now, perhaps that's a reflection of the fact that we've seen U.S. stock prices at record highs. Now the record high stocks that gives people some confidence. It also gives them some added currency because the TD Ameritrade-Schwab deal, that's a stock deal.</p><p>And then the other factor I think is low interest rates. I mean, we're talking about near zero borrowing costs. A lot of these companies are figuring why not go out, borrow some money and get bigger.</p><p>QUEST: But isn't it -- isn't it a sort of the last refuge of the bankrupt mind to go and buy something rather than grow yourself organically? A strategic -- a strategic deal such as, for example, the Tiffany-LVMH is in a different category?</p><p>[15:10:21]</p><p>EGAN: Well, you can argue that some of these are strategic deals. StubHub and Viagogo as well. But you're right that we have seen in the past. It is a sign of confidence, but it can also be a sign of hubris.</p><p>Sometimes companies have so much money, they look at record high stock prices. They just want to get into it. And some of those had been failed deals later on.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you.</p><p>EGAN: Thank you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed. The beautiful sea of green on the U.S. markets records. Investors are reacting to renewed optimism that China and the U.S. will reach a Phase 1 trade deal.</p><p>The Dow is up some 150 points, it's not at -- we've got records on the S&amp;P and we've got a record on the NASDAQ as well.</p><p>Uber is fighting for survival. One of its biggest markets, saying it will appeal against the decision by London Transit officials to revoke its license. It calls the decision extraordinary and wrong.</p><p>Uber shares are only off one percent. Hadas Gold with this report?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER (voice over): Red buses, black cabs and Uber drivers, a familiar sight on London's roads, but that could soon come to an end as the Regulator Transport for London says it will not renew Uber's license after an independent assessment found a pattern of regulatory breaches.</p><p>GOLD (on camera): London authority say unauthorized Uber drivers were able to drive around using others accounts simply by uploading their own photos. Others they say were able to create accounts even after they had been dismissed or suspended.</p><p>As a result, Transport for London says as many as 14,000 trips were uninsured.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SADIQ KHAN, MAYOR OF LONDON: TFL's job as the regulator is to make sure operators and drivers are fit and proper and I stand by TFL because our part has got to be the safety and security of Londoners is a must. It is clear to me is that's been compromised by the way Uber is operating.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLD (voice over): It's been a year's long battle between the city and the ride hailing platform. In 2017, TFL revoked the license over safety concerns, but granted the company a 15-month extension. Uber is important to the millions of passengers who rely on the service every year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Definitely, it would be damaging if there was no Uber because it's such a great service, you know what I mean? Like all over the world, you can use it and it is just like, a click of a button, you know, I mean, so that'd be terrible if they ceased to exist.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLD (voice over): But in a city renowned for its black cabs, some are pleased with the crackdown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC, TAXI DRIVER: I spent three years studying in London to become a taxi driver, to be able to wear this, to be a public service of transportation for London. They've come in on the back of Uber and they pay 300 for a license, but I sat there and look at what they've done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLD (voice over): Losing London would cost the company. It's one of the top five revenue generating cities for Uber and the biggest outside of the Americas.</p><p>Uber called Monday's decision extraordinary and wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMIE HEYWOOD, REGIONAL GENERAL MANAGER FOR NORTHERN AND EASTERN EUROPE, UBER: Uber has been on a process of change. We've changed very fundamentally since Dara came in as CEO, as a company. And if I look at the way that we're prioritizing safety, the way that we're making our processes and systems better, today's decision by TFL isn't taken on the basis of an Uber that I recognize.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLD (voice over): London Transport says Uber has made some positive changes. The company now has 21 days to appeal the decision during which they can operate as normal.</p><p>For now, it looks like Uber will have at least one more Christmas in London. Hadas Gold, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: You had there Uber's General Manager in that report and there are many more questions that had be asked about how the company is changing safety as a priority. He spoke to Hadas earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEYWOOD: Today's news from TFL that they decided not to renew your license in London is both exceptional and wrong and it's -- it's a decision we intend to appeal.</p><p>It's important to note that, as of today, nothing actually changes. So riders in London who use the app, and there are three and a half million riders in London who do on a regular basis will continue to be able to use the service as normal. And drivers, there are over 40,000 drivers in London will continue to be able to use the app to earn as well.</p><p>So Uber has been on a process of change. We've changed very fundamentally since Dara came in as CEO, as a company. And if I look at the way that we're prioritizing safety, the way that we're making our processes and systems better, today's decision by TFL isn't taken on the basis of an Uber that I recognize.</p><p>[15:15:05]</p><p>HEYWOOD: So we have 21 days to decide whether we appeal and we've taken that decision already, which is that we will appeal. And then after that, it's up to the courts how long it takes.</p><p>When this happened previously, in 2017, it took a few months to actually go to hearing but the important thing to note is that during that period, we can continue to operate as usual. So the service tomorrow, or in one month's time or in two months' time whilst this process is going on is exactly as it was yesterday.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: As we continue, China has offered the U.S. an olive branch in the trade war. It may help settle one of President Trump's biggest concerns.</p><p>And also, some companies came to agreements where others were unable to seal the deal. In a moment.</p><p>QUEST: Now stocks are at record highs after China took a step forward in resolving the trade war. China unveiled new guidelines for protecting intellectual property. It is the issue that's at the bottom of course of the concerns from the United States and the U.S. Trade Representative said IP theft costs the U.S. between $225 billion and $600 billion each year in one form or another.</p><p>Kevin Hassett is the former Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. He joins me now from Washington. Good to see you Kevin, as always.</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, FORMER CHAIR OF THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: Thanks, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Lovely to have you with us. On this, I'm confused as to where we are on the trade -- not just a trade dispute, but that we're waiting for Phase 1 to be concluded and signed. Is there any indication that's going to happen before the end of the year?</p><p>HASSETT: Yes, that would be my expectation. And I think that really, the news today, which has markets moving forward and recall, Richard, before I left the White House I was in the middle of all this is that the Chinese agreed that they were going to ramp up penalties for people who did steal IP.</p><p>That was a key conflict that we had with them what back in the spring where they really didn't want to take that extra step of committing on paper to ramping up penalties and maybe even changing their laws in order to make sure that Chinese firms respected U.S. intellectual property.</p><p>So I think it's a quite a big move by the Chinese and I would expect that there are a lot of other things like us agreeing to rollback tariffs to some extent, that will be cut out in the next few days. But clearly, we're very, very close to a deal again.</p><p>QUEST: Right, a Phase 1 deal.</p><p>HASSETT: A Phase 1 deal, that's right.</p><p>QUEST: I mean, Phase 2 and Phase 3, probably -- well, I mean are some way off?</p><p>HASSETT: Yes, that would be my expectation. You know, I think that if you look at it that there are a number of phases of tariffs, then I would guess that the first couple will probably still be in effect by the next election, because the President's going to want to make sure that the Chinese really behave.</p><p>[15:20:16]</p><p>HASSETT: You know, I think one of the things I was briefed on when I first came into the White House a while ago, was that President Obama had, you know, exactly the same intentions as President Trump and they made a pretty firm deal with China that involved us taking a lot of steps and them taking a lot of steps that it looked like when we got there when I was briefed on it, that we did everything. The U.S. did everything that President Obama promised, but the Chinese did nothing whatsoever.</p><p>So I think Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin and you know, President Trump's team, they've been trying to get the Chinese to commit in a credible way to making the changes that we need them to make and it looks like they've made a lot of progress.</p><p>QUEST: Kevin, I'm looking at markets and I'm looking at the markets at the moment. The Dow is up in a record, S&amp;P and the NASDAQ, and when one -- I mean that the growth is okay. Growth is okay. Unemployment is down. Inflation is high, but relative -- relative -- but not yet a trend.</p><p>So what's your feeling? The underlying strength at the moment when many have been saying slowdown, not recession, but a serious slowdown.</p><p>HASSETT: Right. Well, definitely there's a global slowdown if you look at say German GDP, it's pretty very close to a recession level. And in the U.S., I think we're looking at fourth quarter GDP growth right now that's going to be like in the one percent range, maybe a little bit more. So for sure, the whole global economy has downshifted.</p><p>But the point is that it looks like there are a lot of signs that maybe we're about to upshift again. And so the job market in the U.S. has stayed strong. Income growth in the U.S. is strong and Boeing is about to, you know, turn on their assembly line again. And that's a really big deal, worth almost a percent of GDP into that.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, but we -- I'll put Boeing to one side, if I may, sir. Because that one percent of GDP gain is only predicated by a one percent plus loss. So that's really -- that's not --</p><p>HASSETT: Which we already have, right?</p><p>QUEST: Right, that's what I am saying. But that's netting out in a sense. But what I don't understand --</p><p>HASSETT: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: For the most of the latter parts of the year, we've been talking about worries, problems. I mean, people even use the R word in other parts of the world. But what's changed? What's changed? Corporate profitability hasn't changed. The U.S. deficit is humongous and getting bigger. Interest rates have probably reached the low point in the cycle. So what's changed?</p><p>HASSETT: Well, you know, I think that the things that I see in the U.S. sector, the two big changes since last summer, is that first of all, income growth has accelerated, especially at the bottom.</p><p>And second, the housing market in the U.S., perhaps in response to Fed policy is starting to pick up and don't forget that this is a really unusual sort of boom time under, you know, past couple of years for President Trump, where the economy has been doing very, very well, but the residential real estate sector has been totally in the tubes.</p><p>And so having that residential sector start to turn around means that this recovery could probably have some more legs.</p><p>QUEST: Which do you prefer? Life in the White House, life out of the White House?</p><p>HASSETT: You know, I had a blast. It was a great pleasure to serve the country and it's nice to have a chance to sleep in now and then as well.</p><p>QUEST: Kevin, we're always glad when you come on the program.</p><p>HASSETT: Thanks. It's great to be here, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: It is appreciated. Thank you very much. Micron is monitoring developments between U.S. and China. They are monitoring them closely.</p><p>The chip maker is being caught in the middle of the trade war we had just didn't talk about and the Chief Executive tell CNN's Kristie Lu Stout what he is hoping for in a resolution.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SANJAY MEHROTRA, CEO, MICRON TECHNOLOGY: We want overall, a free market based economy. We want respect for intellectual property. We want to be able to absolutely engage with the customer ecosystem here in China across -- as well as all across the globe.</p><p>And we -- you know, continue to monitor the world trends today in terms of enabling a system that will allow us to do that and allow our semiconductor industry to do that as well. It's important for the entire semiconductor industry to be able to engage with customers worldwide.</p><p>And I'm certainly hopeful that U.S. and China will be able to address their issues, their differences, and that we will have opportunity to be able to do the business based on level playing field, fair market principles, as well as respect for intellectual property.</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and given the lack of a resolution for the trade war and a political environment that's getting increasingly fraught, are you making adjustments in terms of your relationships with customers, in terms of your supply chain, in the event that this is not going to be resolved anytime soon?</p><p>MEHROTRA: So we have, as I said, very well-diversified set of customers across the globe, exciting part for our businesses that memory and storage, DRAM and flash are absolutely at the heart of all of the technology trends today. AI to IoT to autonomous.</p><p>We have a manufacturing supply chain that is well-diversified across the globe. We have manufacturing operations in 10 different countries, and so we have a very diversified footprint that really enables us to be very resilient, very adaptive, very agile.</p><p>[15:25:04]</p><p>MEHROTRA: And of course, we remain extremely focused in this exciting time of more need for more memory and storage and continuing to keep our eye on the ball with respect to technology innovation, product development, and engagement with customers to bring the full value of our portfolio to the customer.</p><p>This is what we remain focused on, and this is what I think, you know, regardless of some of the ups and downs that may occur due to macroeconomic conditions or geopolitical issues, I think, you know, technology has a way of powering through that and memory and storage will absolutely be key in that regard in the future.</p><p>LU STOUT: The Chinese tech giant, Huawei has long been an important and a significant customer of yours. How are you managing that relationship during the ongoing trade, war and tech war?</p><p>MEHROTRA: We have excellent relationship with customers across the globe, including our relationship with Huawei and we have publicly stated before that we, of course will abide by all the laws and regulations in all countries where we do business.</p><p>So with the entity listing of Huawei, of course, we have been able to ship under lawful means certain products to Huawei and our relationship with Huawei continues to be very good and we of course, you know, certainly hope that you know, that we will have opportunity to continue to do business in a fashion to bring the full value of our innovation portfolio to all our customers worldwide, including Huawei here.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: There is still more of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS on this Monday merger mania. Xerox tried to take over HP, failed or not at least hasn't succeeded, and is now warning if it happens or goes again, it might not be friendly.</p><p>QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment. HP is printing off a rejection letter for Xerox. Now, Xerox could try and copy by during a hostile takeover.</p><p>[15:30:10]</p><p>And thieves have stolen more than a billion dollars worth of jewels from a German museum. A jeweler expert tells me what do thieves do next. This is CNN, and here, the facts always come first.</p><p>Priceless treasures have been stolen in an early morning heist at the Green Vault Museum in Dresden, Germany. Look at this surveillance footage, shows thieves in action. They said they took the jewelry dating back to the 18th century including diamonds, pearls and rubies. A taskforce of 20 detectives are trying to break the case.</p><p>U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper says he fired the Navy Secretary Richard Spencer for going outside his chain of command and losing his trust. Spencer in his resignation letter suggested U.S. president was undermining the key principle of good order and discipline of the U.S. military when he intervened in the case of a controversial Navy SEAL.</p><p>There's still no response from Beijing to the landslide win by pro- democracy candidates in Hong Kong's local elections. China's Foreign Minister emphasized Hong Kong will always remain part of China's territory, and warned that any attempt to destabilize the city will never succeed.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister's Likud Party is to hold leadership primaries within the next six weeks. The news follows Benjamin Netanyahu hearing that he'll be charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. And Netanyahu is unlikely to receive parliamentary immunity after the former Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman indicated his party would not support it.</p><p>And police investigating the death of K-pop star Goo Hara says they found a note in the living room. The 20-year-old -- 28-year-old South Korean singer and actress was found dead on Sunday. Her death once again turns the spotlight onto a debate over the intense pressure of K-pop stardom.</p><p>Amid all the deal making of the day, one match was not made. HP rejected a takeover offer from Xerox, saying in a letter it significantly undervalues the company. It was not the first offer that HP has rejected. Paul La Monica, guru La Monica is with me.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Thank you, sir.</p><p>QUEST: Now, when they rejected this, was this a sort of a -- this is not enough, but if you come back with more, we might be nicer or was this a go?</p><p>LA MONICA: This second rejection seems to be a go away and don't let the door hit you on the way out type of response because it was pretty hostile from HP to note that they think in addition to Xerox's offer undervaluing HP, they pointed out that Xerox is a company that has routinely missed revenue estimates for several quarters in the past few years, and whose stock and revenue has gone down as well.</p><p>So, it wasn't the type of response you'd expect from a company that just was basically saying we're willing, wink-wink, nod-nod, if you raise the price because again, HP is worth nearly four times as much as Xerox, so if anything, HP could turn the tables around and say, hey, we're going to go after you and buy you instead, but they don't seem to think that this deal makes sense.</p><p>QUEST: So, is it likely that Xerox will go hostile?</p><p>LA MONICA: It sounds as if Xerox is going to take this to shareholders of HP. So, I think, yes, Richard, they are going to go hostile, but even if they do, the question remains how do they finance this deal when they are the smaller company they presumably would have to add some debt to get it done and --</p><p>QUEST: No, you LBO it.</p><p>LA MONICA: You LBO it, but this doesn't strike me as the type of combination that would get people excited. It's too slow growth printing companies that maybe would merge and have some economies at scale. Which unfortunately probably means layoffs. I just don't see how --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LA MONICA: To struggle the company's --</p><p>QUEST: And also since HP is already halved itself from the solutions --</p><p>LA MONICA: And solutions --</p><p>QUEST: That's the word, thank you, and solutions, and Xerox has lost a bit, but it's not as if you can LBO and then pay down the debt with their asset sales.</p><p>LA MONICA: Right. There really would not be any conceivable --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LA MONICA: Asset sales that would come from this merger. I think cost- cutting would be the main appeal to get --</p><p>QUEST: So --</p><p>LA MONICA: Earnings back on track.</p><p>QUEST: So a look at the share price because that usually tells us a lot. Xerox is down, HP is up quite healthily at 1.3, what's the market telling us about what they think is the next direction on this?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think the market doesn't really believe a deal is going to happen. Is that HP price right now --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LA MONICA: Is at $20 a share, the offer from Xerox is 22, so you're still about 10 percent below that price, and also HP hit 24 earlier this year, so I think that is another reason why they've been resistant.</p><p>That they don't want to do a deal that's going to really undervalue where they were not that long ago.</p><p>[15:35:00]</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. The inventor of the World Wide Web is now warning about the dangers of disinformation. Tim Burton fears a digital dystopia may soon be upon us, and Facebook, Google and Microsoft have all signed his new contract for the web.</p><p>I spoke to Adrian Lovett who is the president and CEO of the World Wide Web Foundation, and Adrian says this is more of companies who have signed on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADRIAN LOVETT, PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WORLD WIDE WEB FOUNDATION: It's also about governments who need to play their part, and it's about all of us as citizens taking our share of responsibility for building the web we want. So, it involves those different stakeholders in a concerted plan for the first time.</p><p>Secondly, this is about both the huge challenge of getting people online in the first place. Only half the world is online --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LOVETT: As you know as well as fixing the problems we see with the web today, and it's a joined up approach to that. And then thirdly, it's about combining both key principles that we've all agreed on. There's nine principles at the heart of this contract for the web with practical commitments, real concrete steps that those governments, those companies and citizens can take to build the web we want.</p><p>QUEST: Is this fake information, this masquerading on the web, this government activism or is government-sponsored activity of fake news? Is this as big a problem as the U.S. media would suggest?</p><p>LOVETT: It's a real problem, there's no doubt about that. And it's one of the key things that we want the contract for the web to address. And one of the ways that we think that can be done is to ask those big tech companies to make human rights assessments of their products and their thinking upstream in the process.</p><p>And that can sound a little abstract, but what that means is really testing their products before they come to market and as they go to market to see exactly what the impact will be on people's fundamental rights. And that includes the right to information, clear, accurate information, and the right to be protected from hate speech and harassment and violence online. So, I think that is one of the key things that needs to be addressed, it's a big problem.</p><p>QUEST: So within that, briefly and finally, should you be optimistic that signing up to your contract actually does any good and why?</p><p>LOVETT: Well, we are optimistic, and I think the reason for that is, this is the first time that a single plan has been brought together involving all those different stakeholder groups, companies, citizens and governments. And also because there's a huge amount of work that's gone into this. We've had eight or nine months of about 80 experts from across different sectors putting their heads together, thrashing out options, negotiating, compromising, having to give up on things as well as secure really important pieces.</p><p>And I think it all now comes down to delivery of course. You know, we're launching this today with 160 --</p><p>QUEST: Thank you --</p><p>LOVETT: Or more organizations on board, and we'll see whether people are willing to live up to it. We hope they are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York, multi-billionaire is well and truly into the race for the presidency. He's wasting no time and he's spending plenty of money inside his campaign trail debut in just a moment. Cristina Alesci is with Mr. Bloomberg.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>QUEST: The former New York City Mayor and multi-billionaire many times over, Michael Bloomberg is now a candidate for race for the U.S. President. He's wasting no time making his campaign trail debut. Today in Norfolk, Virginia, his spending already puts him near the top of the pile. Thirty seven million dollars worth of campaign ads behind only fellow billionaire Tom Steyer and far ahead of the rest.</p><p>If you remove the staff from the mix, Bloomberg is spending more on advertising than every other Democrat in the field combined. He's approaching this race in the same way he built his business, looking at the numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN SHEEKEY, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, BLOOMBERG 2020: And listen, you can say it's never been done before, but you also have to say no one's tried it before. What we're going to do is launch a national political campaign where we're not going to talk to people in one state and then a second state, and then a third state.</p><p>We're going to talk to everyone in the country at once, and we're particularly going to over talk to those people who need to vote in those swing states, ultimately to vote against Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Cristina Alesci has just come from Bloomberg's first campaign stop in Norfolk, Virginia. She's with me now. First, give me a flavor of what it was like?</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, he first met with a state delegate that he actually supported in the last election cycle at a local coffee shop, which was basically a photo-op, and then he took hard questions from reporters at the hotel next door.</p><p>He was asked everything from about his apology on the police tactic called stop and frisk. He was asked about why he was running and why he's qualified to do the job as president. He said look, I've taken on Donald Trump before and I've beat him. I'm probably one of the few people in the race who's qualified and experienced enough to hit the ground running. Here's the rest of what Michael Bloomberg had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BLOOMBERG L.P: Yes, I know how to take on the powerful special interest that corrupt Washington. I know how to win because I've done it time and again. We need a president who is ready to lead us where we need to go in a ways that we can be proud of.</p><p>Someone with the experience to hit the ground ready to go. I am that person, and that's why I'm running.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The question of course is, I mean, Michael Bloomberg is a prickly character who does not suffer fools gladly. He's being very successful in New York where they perhaps will put up with that, but will middle America? Will the rest of the country where he needs delegates for the primary, will they?</p><p>ALESCI: Well, I think he's trying to make himself more accessible for one in these campaign stops. And secondarily, he's going to run as sort of the anti-Trump. You know, Trump is very emotional, plays on people's fears. Mike Bloomberg is data-driven, and he perhaps doesn't have the kind of personal appeal that Donald Trump would.</p><p>But he would say, listen, that's who I am, take it or leave it, but I will run the country with a steady hand. That's his perspective. That's where he's coming at it. Look, that said --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ALESCI: He's going to face some serious challenges first on the technical side. It's just very late in the primary cycle at this point. No one has ever been able to pull off the win of a nomination, getting into the race this late in modern U.S. history. So, that's going to be a huge --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ALESCI: Challenge, and then he has substantive challenges as well.</p><p>QUEST: One final thought though, you've been following -- you and I spoke a few times earlier in the year that you were following Michael Bloomberg, you are the designated correspondent who will be with him. But back in March or whenever it was, he said he wasn't running. So what happened then to change his mind to now?</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>ALESCI: He's watched how the race has unfolded, and he was not happy with the way that it was unfolding. He didn't think that the Democrats had a candidate strong enough to take on Donald Trump. And in large part, he was disappointed with Joe Biden's performance. He saw him, you know, fade in some of the polls, obviously nationally, Joe Biden is still very strong.</p><p>But there were some instances where he didn't perform well in debates and Michael Bloomberg saw that as perhaps a risk of Donald -- of opening up the possibility that Donald Trump may win again. So Michael Bloomberg saying - -</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ALESCI: He's got the -- he's got the money, he's got the --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ALESCI: Time, and he is willing to put in the effort to try and beat Trump.</p><p>QUEST: But in a party like -- of the Democrats at the moment, that is trending I would venture to say -- I wouldn't say fully-left wing, but certainly center-leaning left, about you know, a right wing, middle to road to right conservative candidate on the right of the Democratic Party is not the flavor of the party du jour.</p><p>ALESCI: I agree, and I think that's a substantive challenge for him. You have progressive candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren taking shots at him ever since he announced the large ad buy that you referenced in your introduction. And they're going to continue to do that because they know it plays well to their base. But again, Michael Bloomberg will try and move away from that --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ALESCI: Specific topic by redirecting attention to the fact that he spent hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions on liberal causes like gun control, like climate change. So what he's going to say is, yes, I'm a billionaire, I made a lot of money, but I've used that money --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ALESCI: For good, from the progressive end of the spectrum.</p><p>QUEST: Well, I guess you've got lots of grits fried chicken, scrambled eggs to eat on a campaign trail that's going to take you to large parts of -- beautiful parts of America. Try and eat well, we'll follow your diet closely. Good to see you, Cristina Alesci --</p><p>ALESCI: All right, thank you --</p><p>QUEST: On the campaign trail. It's not just LVMH doing deals, someone else got their hands on invaluable jewels, only they didn't do it the legal way. In a moment.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>QUEST: The \"Pink Panther\" just got its latest plot unfolding right now in Germany. Serious effort indeed, in fact. A manhunt is on after brazen heist at Dresden Castle where thieves broke into the Green Vault on Monday morning. It's home to one of Europe's largest collection of treasuries and making off with the jewels, including diamonds, pearls and rubies, possibly worth a billion dollars, probably absolutely priceless. Phil Black with our report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The target, one of Europe's most valuable collections of treasure suggest that technically complex, professionally planned and executed movie-style heist. The reality, it was far less sophisticated. The thieves even triggered the alarm.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The culprits as you were able to see, evidently got in through a window facing the palace square. There, they cut through the gratings and then smashed the glass of the case.</p><p>BLACK: The museum's interactive tour shows the contents of that case. They escaped with three sets of jewelry including finely crafted necklaces. Together, the sets were made up of around 100 individual diamonds, pearls and rubies. The Green Vault is famous for its extraordinary priceless collection from the early 1700s.</p><p>The incredibly ornate rooms were first built by local leader Augustus the Strong when he was keen to turn the region into a Florence-like hub of art and culture. The collections survived World War II, but the Vault's rooms like much of Dresden were rebuilt. The museum says the value of the stolen pieces can't be calculated accurately because they're too well-known to ever be sold on the open market.</p><p>But news of the Green Vault raid inspired shock among local officials who say the collection is invaluable as part of the region's culture, history and identity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not just about the material value, but also the immaterial value which is inestimable for the state of Saxon. As our state Premier has said, overnight, the whole of Saxon was stolen from.</p><p>BLACK: Police don't know if the thieves had hoped to get away with more, but one extraordinary piece of treasure was well beyond their reach. The famous 41 karat Dresden green diamond. It's currently on loan to the Met Museum in New York. Phil Black, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Kormind with me, is the online diamond jeweler, 77Diamonds.com and he's with me from London. The point here is of course, the real risk is that they're not -- they don't try and sell the jewels as they are, they break them up. That's the sort of travesty, isn't it?</p><p>TOBIAS KORMIND, MANAGING DIRECTOR, 77DIAMONDS.COM: Yes, I know, unfortunately, that does look like what's going to happen. So, if we look at history, with some of the great jewelry heists, a lot of them have never been found again. And so we're highly likely -- I mean, it's an absolute travesty because obviously within the kind of the piece, ornate piece that's been created by some of the great craftsmen of history, they are worth so much as a piece in their own rights, and also in terms of what they represent for the Saxon region, for Germany --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>KORMIND: As a whole, but the thieves are going to grab these, and they're going to strip them apart. They're going to re-cut them.</p><p>QUEST: Even if they re-cut them, and you've got some jewels there, haven't you? And you've got a couple of jewels --</p><p>KORMIND: I do --</p><p>QUEST: You're going to show me a million bucks worth. But even if they re-cut them, is there something likely to be part of them that you'd still be able, potentially, to identify even if they're re-cut.</p><p>KORMIND: Yes, so let's separate it. So, if we look at the diamonds, they're absolutely untraceable. Once they've been re-cut, there's absolutely no way of being able. So, they literally disappear into the market, that's why something like the 2013 Colton heist for the live gems which was almost a 100 million pounds worth, none of those diamonds have ever been found anywhere.</p><p>They literally disappear into the -- you know, into thin air and that we caught they reappear as different stones. With gem stones like rubies and sapphires and emeralds, there's some traceability in terms of leading them --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>KORMIND: Back to the mine, if they're left with certain types inclusions inside, then they could be traced, it has happened in the past, but once they've been re-cut, if they cut out the inclusions, they again disappear completely.</p><p>QUEST: Come on, show me the jewels. Show me just one, what have you got? Hold it up!</p><p>KORMIND: You know, I can't compare to it, so what I've got here, I've got a 5 karat cushion, and obviously on the camera, it looks relatively small. But you know the -- one of the -- the really interesting question is -- and this is about 200,000 pounds worth is, there's a 49 karat, the Dresden white. Was that part of the heist? Was that part of the three sets, and also there's largest blue sapphire which the rumor are that it's between 571 karats and 648 --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>KORMIND: So, it's the largest blue sapphire in the world. Was that also part of the set? They went into one display case. They must really have thought this through and considered which -- you know, what were they going to do --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>KORMIND: Because the police attended to the scene very quickly, but you know, they were gone --</p><p>QUEST: Tobias make sure, be very careful that when you leave it -- that you don't sort of leave anything behind, knowing my colleagues, they'll have picked your pockets before you can say it. Thank you for joining us, thank you. Last few minutes of trading --</p><p>KORMIND: Thank you, thank you for having me --</p><p>QUEST: On Wall Street -- now, we're talking about the jewels there, it's a bit of a jewel in its own right. A record on the Dow, you have good gains from United Health Group at the top, down at the bottom, you've got ExxonMobil. But frankly, I mean, you've got the turn of the day, the losses are just minor, .73 compared to some good gains.</p><p>And those gains, those 1 percent-plus gains go right the way through pretty much half the Dow. Disney doing well of course on \"Frozen II\", results -- Boeing on the prospects of better trade talks coming along. You've got Cisco and encouraging -- all in all, this is a very strong session that takes us to a record, and we'll have our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, it was very profitable for those who - - Tiffany's, the share price rose sharply on the back doing the best it's done in a long time, up 30 odd percent over the last few months because LVMH is now buying it. It tells us so much about the mood of the market that deals like this are being done.</p><p>LVMH strategically buying Tiffany's, Novartis and the medicine companies. You've got a range of deals, except of course, HP and Xerox. A range of deals, people spotting opportunities and determined to take advantage of cheap loans and high value paper. But what's interesting is how many of these deals make sense?</p><p>LVMH and Tiffany's, absolutely a strategic deal which puts a new part into LVMH's already bursting shopping bag. Make -- watch this one, it's going to run for some time. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York, whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. Record on the Dow, records on the Nasdaq, records on the S&amp;P, we have got records around!</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019112501cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKM-CY41-JB20-G1FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0001PN0</classCode><className>XEROX CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001PNE</classCode><className>LVMH MOET HENNESSY LOUIS VUITTON SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq), Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq), Sun (SUNW:Nasdaq) and EMC (EMC:NYSE) are all on the list.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then there's Ford (F:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What's a 96-year-old automaker doing at what is perhaps the premier technology conference? Stressing how e-enabled it is, of course, and expressing confidence that its big tech plans won't run afoul of regulators. And using surfing metaphors. Cool.</p><p>Point Break\u00a0</p><p>\"We want to inject e-technology into every vehicle we produce,\" said James C. Gouin, chief financial officer for Ford's ConsumerConnect e-business division.\u00a0</p><p>During the 1970s and 1980s, Gouin said, the Big Three automakers stood transfixed before a tidal wave of imports from the Japanese. That failure to react resulted in a 30% loss in market share. Now, he said, the automakers aren't about to be blindsided again by another sea change -- the surge in commerce technology.\u00a0</p><p>\"The wave is coming again,\" he said. \"And we want to be riding the curl this time.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>Just Swell\u00a0</p><p>Ford's ride on that technology swell is predicated, largely, on its participation in a business-to-business auto exchange with General Motors (GM:NYSE) and DaimlerChrysler (DCX:NYSE). Through that exchange, which will allow the companies to procure materials over the Internet, Ford will be able to cut the cost of a purchase order to between $5 and $15 from $150, Gouin said.\u00a0</p><p>But before that happens, Ford and its partners will have to get the go-ahead from the Federal Trade Commission. While the exchange was announced to much fanfare in February, that enthusiasm was somewhat muted when the FTC said it is conducting an inquiry into the possible antitrust issues that a partnership involving the world's largest automakers presents. Since then, antitrust concerns have steadily gained attention around this and other exchanges.\u00a0</p><p>Wednesday, Gouin said neither Ford nor its partners expect any trouble from the FTC's inquiry, which auto executives have said should be wrapped up by September. He said the companies knew what they were getting themselves into when they went down the B2B road.\u00a0</p><p>\"You know, people ask, 'Did you guys anticipate that the FTC was going to get into your shorts on this?' \" Gouin said. \"Absolutely. Any time you get three companies like Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler together in anything, you're going to get a call from the FTC.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>Beating Their Brains Out\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps as a way to allay those concerns, Gouin described how the exchange would have different advisory councils, comprising both buyers and suppliers, to govern its operations. One of the FTC's concerns about B2B exchanges, antitrust experts say, is the possibility of major buyers actually exerting pricing pressure on the companies they buy supplies from. Another is that companies would collude to set prices.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's no way that we could do that,\" Gouin said. \"There's no way we would do that, or even want to do that. At the end of the day, we three companies are all still competitors, and we all want to beat each other's brains out.\"\u00a0</p><p>When they haven't been beating each other's brains out, though, Gouin said some progress has been made on the exchange. For example, he said, an underlying technology to run it has been agreed upon. That could be significant, as many analysts have wondered how archrivals Oracle and CommerceOne (CMRC:Nasdaq), technology partners in the exchange, would be able to bundle their technologies together. Gouin didn't provide details on the technology before he ducked into a restricted breakout session with investors.\u00a0</p><p>Still, being all about tech didn't help Ford today. With the Dow slipping 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite Index plunging some 5% Wednesday, Ford slid 13/16, or 1.5%, to close at 52 1/4.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#937187#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:407M-6DW0-00MP-T121-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2000 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>May 10, 2000 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FORD MOTOR CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>\u00a0ORACLE CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>\u00a0MICROSOFT CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0DAIMLER AG\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>\u00a0EMC CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0CHASE H &amp;

Instead, the bank would increase unsecured consumer lending and seek to add more internationally focused US customers.</p><p>\"We think the right answer is to grow all segments including retail [in the US],\" he said.</p><p>Iain Mackay, finance director, said two-thirds of the $15bn-$17bn investment plan would be focused on technology, digitisation and process improvement and the remainder on improving its compliance, anti-money laundering and cyber-security systems.</p><p>Big banks are stepping up their investments in technology in response to the digital disruption sweeping the industry, particularly as big tech groups such as Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba and Tencent encroach on the financial services sector.</p><p>Overall, Flint said the bank's return on tangible equity would be greater than 11% by 2020, targeting mid-single digit growth in annual revenue and low to mid-single digit growth in operating expenses.</p><p>It will maintain its common equity tier one ratio above 14%.</p><p><url

The Dow might have barely eked out a gain, but the NASDAQ is at a new all-time high. It is Friday, the 24th of April.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Getting away from it all -- the tax, the regulation, all of that uncertainty over Europe --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(AUDIO GAP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARLOW: -- to distress from Apple.</p><p>I'm Poppy Harlow and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening and welcome to the program. Tonight, one of the world's biggest banks is threatening to leave British shores and leave a political hornets' nest behind it. HSBC is blaming tough regulation, uncertainty over UK -- over the UK's future in the European Union as the two driving factors for this</p><p>You are looking at footage of the banking giant's current headquarters at London's Canary Wharf. It is HSBC's biggest office in the world, and that means thousands upon thousands of jobs.</p><p>An obvious choice for a new headquarters would be, of course, Hong Kong, where HSBC already has a very strong presence. And Hong Kong's monetary authority says it, of course, would welcome the bank with open arms. After all, that is what the H stands for in HSBC.</p><p>The bank moved from Hong Kong to the UK as its headquarters back in 1993. Now, the bank's chairman, Douglas Flint, has real concerns over changes in regulations in the UK since the financial crisis. Also, HSBC cannot sidestep fears over the uncertainty that lies ahead for Britain and its place within the European Union.</p><p>With a general election less than two weeks away, this announcement has become highly, highly political. The leaders of Britain's two main parties have been trading insults as to who is to blame for HSBC potentially wanting to just walk away.</p><p>The Labour Party argues that businesses like HSBC are scared of the Conservatives' promise to offer up a referendum on the future of Britain in the EU.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED MILIBAND, LABOUR PARTY LEADER: I think the intervention from HSBC is very significant today. They say it's a number one economic uncertainty that our country faces, withdrawal from the European Union. This does go to a question of priorities and what is the in the interests of our country.</p><p>I think the last thing our country needs is two years of an internal debate about whether we should leave the European Union or not, but that isn't what I want to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But Conservatives point out it isn't only Europe that HSBC is worried about. <person><nameText>Prime Minister David Cameron </nameText></person>says regulation is the key concern for the banking giant. He argues banks would be worse off under a Labour government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID CAMERON, PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN: Well, London is, I think the world's leading financial center. We've improved London as a financial center not least by changing the way we regulate banks so that we wouldn't have to bail them out with taxpayers' money in future, as the last Labour government had to do.</p><p>But it is an important reminder of how vital it is that we keep a pro- enterprise, pro-business, pro-employment policy in our country, of keeping taxes low, making us an attractive place to invest.</p><p>And all the time I've been prime minister, that is what we've been doing, which is why we see record levels of inward investment coming here to Britain. We must keep on that approach and not put it at risk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: And I've been speaking with Britain's shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, who is in full-swing election mode. I started by asking him about those regulations that are causing so much head-shaking in the halls of HSBC and Britain's corridors of power. He was very keen to discuss the views of the HSBC chairman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHUKA UMUNNA, UK SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY: Well actually, the statement that Douglas Flint read out at the annual general meeting there was actually very candid. He acknowledged that there were major reputational issues for his own bank coming out of recent revelations into the activities of the Swiss arm, the Swiss private bank.</p><p>But he also acknowledged some of the major problems that were exposed in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, 9, and some of those have still been carrying to recently, with the ethics scandal and, of course, libor rigging before that. And there was a general acknowledgment in his comments that the center needed to get its own house in order, and that the regulatory environment needed to be improved.</p><p>So, it wasn't actually in that sense so critical of the reforms as really just saying given that those reforms have happened and the field on which we're playing has slightly altered, of course you take stock, and I don't think that's unreasonable.</p><p>[16:04:55] HARLOW: Well, let me point this out: he did make very clear that the bank believes that the levies that it pays are too high in the UK, right? Looking at last year alone, HSBC paid the government the highest levy of $1.1 billion and said 58 percent of that charge did not relate to the UK banking activities of the bank.</p><p>UMUNNA: Well, I think that we have global banks here. The global financial crash cost the UK around 1.3 trillion pounds. I don't think in that context it is unreasonable to ask those in the sector to pay a bit of a bigger contribution into the UK exchequer.</p><p>Now, I accept -- I can hear, maybe, there'll be market makers and others watching this program who will say, well, look, HSBC didn't take public funds in the way that the Royal Bank of Scotland did, or Lloyd's Banking Group did. That's true.</p><p>But they did benefit from the measures that the UK government -- and of course, the US and others took measures, too -- took to prevent the entire system collapsing upon itself. And of course, HSBC would have benefited from that, too.</p><p>So, I don't think it is unreasonable to ask for these universal and other investment banks to make a bit of a bigger contribution.</p><p>HARLOW: But here's the thing: 80 percent of HSBC's profit in 2014 came from Asia, 80 percent of that $12 billion. And when you look at how these levies are decided on, they're decided on the size of the balance sheets.</p><p>So, does HSBC have a point there that it wants less cumbersome, as it would call them, levies and regulation? And you've got Conservatives who would say, look, it's the Labour Party who's actually planning to regulate these banks even further.</p><p>UMUNNA: Well, here's the thing: there is consensus on the need to tighten up regulation. And in fact, in terms of the bank levy, that was actually introduced by a Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne. So, there is a degree of political consensus on that in the UK.</p><p>But hey, look, if I was the chairman of a big universal banking corporation like HSBC, of course you're not going to be arguing A, for the institution of a levy, or B for it to be increased. Of course you're going to argue for it to be reduced. In some senses, that is what your shareholders would have expected of you.</p><p>But we as policymakers have to weigh all the different interests in society and ensure we've got a policy matrix that works for everyone and not just a few people.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: Let's discuss the political row in the UK over HSBC with Gillian Tett. She's the US managing editor of the \"Financial Times.\" She joins me live right here in New York City. Thank you so much for being with me. I appreciate it. It is good to have you on the program. And let's be --</p><p>GILLIAN TETT, US MANAGING EDITOR, \"FINANCIAL TIMES\": Great to be here.</p><p>HARLOW: Let's begin with this. We have heard, look, clearly he was in full election mode. You hear it from Labour, you hear it from Conservatives so close to the election. But who do you think has a stronger argument at this point in time when it comes to HSBC and why they're threatening to leave.</p><p>TETT: Well, I think the reality is that HSBC is engaged in saber- rattling right now. That's how we described it in the \"Financial Times\" tonight. And it is not the first time that HSBC has dropped these hints. It's indicated that it's pretty unhappy about the regulatory climate over and over again.</p><p>But it also has a business reason for wanting to look further east, which is that most Western markets are pretty mature. Asia is really where the growth is. So, it has made these hints before. It's been very clever in terms of blaming both the European issue and the tax issue --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>TETT: -- equally, so it managed to steer a line between the two sides. But you just have to look at one number, which is 750 million. That's the amount of eventually extra tax that HSBC had to pay last year because of the one-off bank levy. And that's a very large number. And there was a feeling that the governments are clamping down too aggressively on banks.</p><p>HARLOW: It's a very important point, because when you look at the levy that they paid last year, something like $1.1 billion based on the size of their balance sheet, but 80 percent of their profit came from Asia.</p><p>So -- but clearly they haven't made up their mind, because if HSBC had made up its mind, they wouldn't even need to threaten. Do you see this as a threat to get the government to back away from some of these regulations?</p><p>TETT: Absolutely it's a threat. It's also an attempt to show shareholders that they're not being negligent by ignoring these costs. The 750 million figure I cited was 750 million pounds sterling.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>TETT: Which is a big number for a levy to be actually imposed on a bank. And what really concerns HSBC and many of its shareholders is that although this was originally presented as a one-off measure, the government's now indicating it may anything but. So, they're looking potentially a long regulatory tunnel.</p><p>The problem, though, is that if HSBC was to move to Hong Kong, while the Hong Kong regulators are pretty widely respected around the world and by many HSBC shareholders, having China as, essentially, the dominant power overseeing you potentially in the future is not something that many shareholders would be very excited about.</p><p>[16:10:03] So, it's a lot of saber-rattling right now. Who knows whether it will actually lead to anything concrete?</p><p>HARLOW: That's a very important point you make, and certainly one they're considering in the C Suite at HSBC.</p><p>Let me ask you this: looking outside of HSBC at other big banks that call London their headquarters, at least in Europe, do you believe that they are more concerned right now about the levies they're paying because of this increased regulation or possibly more regulation coming from the Labour Party if they win, if you listen to the Conservatives.</p><p>Or do you think that they are really unnerved by the uncertainty of the UK's position within Europe as a whole?</p><p>TETT: Well, there are two things to notice here. The first thing, as far as the banks are concerned, right now -- and I was talking to a senior banker the other day -- what's going on is really not a beauty contest in geographical terms, in terms of different centers competing for bank business.</p><p>It's more like an ugly contest. Where is the worst of all worlds or the worst possible place to be? Because there are big problems in the UK right now with London, as far as the banks are concerned. But New York is not entirely welcoming either. And while Switzerland or Singapore might have some advantages, they also have big drawbacks, too.</p><p>So, the banks are thinking hard about geographical location. The other big question, though, is London as a haven or a center for the internationally-mobile elite. Because the Labour government has indicated that it does plan to crack down quite strongly on those internationally- mobile wealthy people. And that in many ways is an even bigger reason for banks like HSBC to be rethinking where they're based.</p><p>HARLOW: Gillian Tett, US managing editor for the \"Financial Times,\" joining us this Friday evening. Thank you so much, we appreciate it.</p><p>TETT: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: European indexes were up Friday, finishing the week with gains. Markets backed off from those midweek highs that we saw after inconclusive talks, to say the least, about Greece.</p><p>In Athens, Greek stocks rose more than 3 percent on hopes of positive talks between Merkel and Tsipras. Meanwhile, HSBC shares are up nearly 3 percent.</p><p>US markets closed the day higher. The Dow posted a modest gain. The NASDAQ -- the NASDAQ is what it is all about, hitting an all-time record high. CNN Money's Paul La Monica here to talk with us about it. The NASDAQ is on fire. Not only a 15-year-high, as we were saying yesterday, but an all-time high.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: All-time high was briefly above 5100 this morning and it didn't close above that. So, we're still waiting for it to get that intra-day record of 5132, March of 2000. Good chance we'll probably get there sometime soon the way these earnings have been.</p><p>You had strong results from Amazon and Microsoft. They really led the way. Amazon was up 14 percent today, all-time high. Microsoft up 10.5 percent. Google was the laggard, it was only up 3 percent.</p><p>HARLOW: And we have Apple coming Monday?</p><p>LA MONICA: We have Apple coming Monday after the bell. That is obviously the next big tech stock to be reporting, and the next big test, I think, for the NASDAQ. Clearly, a lot of high expectations for Apple.</p><p>All the hype about the watch, but that just went on sale, so we're not going to get any numbers about that yet, but iPhone sales will probably be big again.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. And we'll talk about the Apple Watch a little bit later in the program. Have a great weekend, Paul La Monica.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you, Poppy, you, too.</p><p>HARLOW: And thank you so much.</p><p>Well, talks to resolve Greece's debt troubled and with no progress. Not only that, but officials have heaped criticism on the Greek finance minister. We'll discuss, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:15:03] HARLOW: Talks to resolve Greece's economic future have ended with really no progress at all. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis met with eurozone finance ministers this week. Eurozone officials are reportedly very critical of him, calling him a, quote, \"time- waster\" and a \"gambler.\"</p><p>Varoufakis, on the other hand, said the talks are actually going pretty well and making progress. So, where's the disconnect? The head of the eurogroup said that things did not end so well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROEN DIJSSELBLOEM, PRESIDENT OF THE EUROGROUP: It was a very critical discussion. We came to an agreement two months ago, and today, of course, we had hoped to hear a positive results and an agreement on which we could then take a decision. And we are still far from that. So, yes, it was a very critical discussion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: And European officials now say time is, indeed, running out for Greece. There are three key issues that Varoufakis is supposedly gambling on. The first, the Greek budget. Europe has set various budget targets in exchange for bailout money, but Varoufakis says Greece cannot be expected to meet them all because all the austerity is making the economy too weak.</p><p>Europe agreed back in February that the bailout deal could be rejiggered, basically, but won't make any promises until the next issue is sorted. And that is Greece's reform program. Europe doesn't just want budget cuts, it also wants long-lasting structural reforms on things like taxation and corruption in Greece.</p><p>Right now, it says it simply is not seeing enough progress on that front, and until it's happy with Greece's overall plan, it will not hand over any more bailout money.</p><p>And that brings us to the biggest problem of all, Greek funding. The current bailout money stops flowing at the end of June. Beyond that, there is no guarantee that Greece can pay all of its bills, and it has $4 billion worth of payments that are due in June.</p><p>Before Varoufakis was finance minister, he was an academic specializing in game theory. Our Clare Sebastian looks at how this strategy can shed light on the negotiations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER (voice-over): At the heart of game theory, conflict, cooperation, and eventually, a mathematical solution. At least, that's how it works in theory.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For Greece, there is certainty --</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was still no firm common ground.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But it can't possibly be business as usual in Greece.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: In 2004, the now Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, published this academic text on game theory. His co-author was Shaun Hargreaves Heap.</p><p>SHAUN HARGREAVES HEAP, CO-AUTHOR, \"GAME THEORY: A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION\": Marketing games of the sort that Yanis and the Greek government are involved in don't have unique solutions in that sense.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Hargreaves Heap says that while game theory won't solve the Greek crisis, it does offer some useful principles.</p><p>HARGREAVES HEAP: Where there is a genuine, as it were, insight from game theory, notes the people who are likely to concede the most in a negotiation are those who have the most to fear from if you fail to make the agreement.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: In the case of Greece and Europe, both sides have plenty to fear if Greece defaults and leaves the eurozone. And both are putting on an optimistic face.</p><p>DIJSSELBLOEM: Grexit is simply not on the table, it's not discussed.</p><p>VAROUFAKIS: We are intent --</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>VAROUFAKIS: -- people.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Game theory is about principles, not specifics. Solving the Greek crisis requires both.</p><p>HARGREAVES HEAP: What the terms of the agreement are, games theory doesn't tell us what it should be. But what they say is both sides will be -- both lose if they leave the table with the cake still on it, because they've failed to agree how to cut it up.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: One thing we do know, it will test even the most experienced of game theorists.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): What was he like as a thinker? What was your experience working with him?</p><p>HARGREAVES HEAP: He was lots of fun to work with. We had lots of good arguments, lots of good discussions. We're both academics who believe in the positive value of dispute.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: With cash running out, the Greek government has issued an emergency decree asking state agencies and municipal coffers to hand over their reserves. I spoke with the mayor of Athens, George Kaminis, about how local governments and the public are responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GEORGE KAMINIS, MAYOR OF ATHENS: Well, things all those last years have been very bad for my country. OK that today's meeting was a disappointment, let's say. But we are still confident, and I'm optimistic. I firmly believe that we're going to arrive to an agreement with the European Union.</p><p>HARLOW: What makes you so confident? Because as the weeks go by, I think more and more people think that a Greek exit could happen.</p><p>[16:19:57] KAMINIS: There's a very solid basis to be confident in that 80 percent of Greek people, they want to remain in the euro, they want our country in the European Union. We belong to the court of the European Union, and those people are determined to work for that.</p><p>HARLOW: You have been the mayor of Athens for nearly five years, now --</p><p>KAMINIS: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: -- since 2010. Can you give me a sense of what it is like day-to-day for the average citizen living there? Just their concern level and the real-world impact on them?</p><p>KAMINIS: Of course, it's for many people, not only marginalized people, as it was in the past, many people who used to have their jobs only a few months ago, they are in difficulty, very severe difficulties.</p><p>But at the same time, there are people who are like tourists, who arrive in Athens. They stay for a week, and they say, where is the crisis? Because it's a lovely city, a vibrant --</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>KAMINIS: At night, the capacity restaurants are full with people. You don't realize very well if you remain as a tourist.</p><p>HARLOW: And I understand that, and I understand you want the tourism to continue, as it has. It's very important for the economy, but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KAMINIS: And this year, we have a new record on tourism arrivals.</p><p>HARLOW: But for the people, the people of your city, of Athens, you still have 26 percent unemployment. How are they getting by?</p><p>KAMINIS: Well, in a great difficulty and among young people, it's almost 60 percent.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>KAMINIS: So, that is one supplementary or even the most important reason to insist on remaining in the eurozone, and we have to foster entrepreneurship, create new business and create jobs for the people.</p><p>HARLOW: So it's not -- it sounds like it's not necessarily about bringing the old jobs back. You're talking about entrepreneurship, starting new businesses, opening new doors for citizens.</p><p>KAMINIS: Oh, yes, of course. We have to modernize the economy. Because for so many years, things didn't go well, but we used to live well on the loans, on the bank loans. Now, we are facing the reality, and the reality can be very, very cruel. So, we have be innovative in every, every aspect.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: Well, the Apple Watch makes its first highly-anticipated appearance in select stores worldwide, and guess who has one. Our Samuel Burke got his hands on one. We'll show you the goods next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: Apple Watches made their debut on store shelves, but do not try to buy the new smart watch in the Apple Store. They will be on display there, but just a handful of high-end shops around the world are selling the device for now. CNN technology correspondent Samuel Burke somehow got one -- why am I not surprised you got one --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: -- some way, somehow? -- and has an assessment. How does it feel? How does it operate? Do you like it?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Right away when I put it on, I liked the feel of it. If you want to get a lot of \"likes\" on Facebook, take a picture with an Apple Watch. Everywhere I'm going, everybody wants to see it. People are looking at it, they want to just view it.</p><p>It was pretty easy to use, not quite as intuitive as an iPhone. But one thing that I already don't like about it is the audio quality. Because don't forget, you can actually make phone calls on this thing.</p><p>And so, someone called me, and I was listening to it, and I almost had to kind of put my ear up to it to be able to hear, and it's not -- I think they tried to make it so it wasn't loud enough to disturb my colleagues, but I just couldn't hear from it.</p><p>HARLOW: Can you show me, how would you make a -- put it up to your ear, is that how you would do it? You have to put it all the way up to your ear?</p><p>[16:25:03] BURKE: In theory. Right now, I'm just clicking the CNN app, because I still don't quite remember the phone call app. So, I just want to show off the CNN app for company's sake. But someone calls you, you just click a button, and you should -- they want you to be able to hear like this, just from the way I'm sitting right now.</p><p>But I actually couldn't hear, so I kind of had to do this type of thing to hear it. And even then, the audio quality wasn't great.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>BURKE: So --</p><p>HARLOW: All right.</p><p>BURKE: -- hold off, use your iPhone for the phone calls for now.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>BURKE: This is the $400 model.</p><p>HARLOW: Pretty snazzy. Oh, that's not the $17,000 model? I was wondering which one.</p><p>BURKE: I decided to keep that at home.</p><p>HARLOW: I was wondering which one you had. Samuel Burke, have a great weekend. Thank you so much.</p><p>Well, the much-anticipated smart watch poses a big threat, frankly, to Switzerland's age-old watch industry. That is according to Elmar Mock, who helped revive the business as co-inventor of Swatch. He joins me now from Switzerland. Thank you for being with me, sir. I appreciate it.</p><p>ELMAR MOCK, CO-INVENTOR, SWATCH: Hello.</p><p>HARLOW: Hello. Let's begin with this. Your initial assessment of the Apple Watch. How much do you think the traditional watch industry should be worried?</p><p>MOCK: I think it's a fantastic opportunity also for the normal watch industry who meets a new world which opened now, and they are going in the right direction. So, I appreciate very much the Apple Watch. And I think it's a chance for the watch industry to also join this movement.</p><p>HARLOW: But can Swiss watchmakers who are putting out their own smart watches, do you think they can compete with the technology of the Apple smart watch?</p><p>MOCK: It will not be exactly the same technology. But I think they can seriously compete. So, I think it's really an opportunity, and they have a solution, and I know a solution.</p><p>HARLOW: Think about the Apple Watch, I think about charging it. Because you do, you have to plug it in, you have to charge it. Do you people -- think people are going to want to take their watch off at night and charge it like their phone?</p><p>MOCK: I think the functions are really great, and I think it makes life also easier. So why don't charge during the night? I think we charge also our phone. For ten years ago, I was charging my phone every week. Now I have to charge it every night.</p><p>I don't say that is the only way, but I don't think it's very great. I may be more afraid about the fact that she's not tight today. But I think that she will become more and more better. So, we have a chance, and it's the first one, and they will have other ones, and it's really going in the right direction.</p><p>HARLOW: It's interesting. You've said that Apple will really hurt companies operating at the mid-price level, like a Swatch, for example, right? So this initial one is below $400, they go all the way up to $17,000. I wonder if you think, though, Apple is maybe making a mistake trying to compete at the high end with those high-end watches?</p><p>MOCK: I don't think they've made a mistake. I'm not sure that the really high-end are affected. But the middle range, of course they are affected. You must imagine that Apple and the other competition -- I think, Samsung is at present, (inaudible) are present, Sony also. So, I think they will be maybe 50 million pieces a year who will be sold out through this new channel.</p><p>What is fantastic, it's also a new distribution. It's a new way to go on the market. I think it's a fantastic opportunity, and these 50 million watches who are sold out sell with this price. It will compete with the middle segment, of course. But it's not -- every competition is also something very healthy.</p><p>HARLOW: How many people, sir, do you believe are going to make the mistake of getting in the shower with their Apple Watch on?</p><p>MOCK: A lot. A lot, of course.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MOCK: That they will recognize they made a mistake. I was also wearing some electronic item with me, and I will go in under the shower. So, it's -- you make it once or twice, and after, you can make progress yourself. Of course, waterproof will have to become once.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>MOCK: But if your life is coming easier, and if you have pleasure with this product, you will also accept a little bit of disadvantage. But of course that will change.</p><p>HARLOW: I am certainly fascinated by it and can't wait to try one myself. Thank you so much for joining us. Especially as a Swatch fan, I appreciate all you've done for the watch industry. Sir, have a wonderful weekend.</p><p>MOCK: OK, thank you very much, and have a good time, too.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you.</p><p>Well, switching gears here. It has now been two years to the day since that horrific, horrific factory collapse in Bangladesh where 1100 people were killed, thousands more injured. We're going to find out if workers' conditions have improved.</p><p>[16:29:42] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:32:00] HARLOW: Hello, I'm Poppy Harlow. Coming up on the next half hour of \"Quest Means Business,\" The CEO of Heathrow Airport tells me what he's hoping to see from the upcoming U.K. election.</p><p>Also, two years ago since the Rana Plaza building collapsed, how much is really changed for Bangladesh's factory workers?</p><p>Before that though, here are your top business headlines this hour.</p><p>Armenia is marking 100 years since the mass killings of Armenians during the First World War. Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Francois Hollande condemned the deaths at a ceremony today. But the issue remains politically sensitive as Turkey and others insist that the killings should not be considered genocide as Armenians considers them.</p><p>In Italy, authorities say that they have broken up a terror cell with links to al-Qaeda, and the Vatican may have been one of its targets. At least nine people have been arrested. Some of the 18 suspects are accused of involvement in a bombing in Pakistan that left more than 300 people dead or wounded.</p><p>Authorities say they expect more activity from a volcano in Chile. This coming in the coming hours. Calbuco has already erupted twice this week, spewing some 60 centimeters of ash in some places. Some 4,500 people have now had to evacuate the region. The ash has now spread to neighboring Argentina which is not surprising considering Chile's slender geography. Look at those images - wow.</p><p>And the captain of a migrant boat that capsized in the Mediterranean last weekend has appeared in court. The 27-year-old Tunisia national is accused of causing the tragedy that killed hundreds. He has been detained and he has been - he has denied being in charge of that vessel.</p><p>It has been two years since the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh. More than 1,100 people lost their lives that day when the eight-story building collapsed. It was the deadliest disaster the world's garment industry has ever seen and it sparked outrage about dangerous conditions for hundreds and hundreds of workers.</p><p>Since the collapse, brands and retailers have contributed millions of dollars to a compensation fund for injured workers and their families. Still, campaigners say much more needs to be done. Maggie Lake reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL: More than 1,100 people dead, thousands injured, livelihoods destroyed. Two years after the Rana Plaza disaster, the wounds are still not healed. And despite stepped-up inspections, rights groups say conditions in many Bangladesh factories remain perilous.</p><p>[16:35:01] JOHN SIFTON, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: There could another Rana Plaza tomorrow. It's less likely, but it's still possible.</p><p>The residential buildings have been converted into factories. A lot of them have had floors added - they're very unsafe.</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL: Today there is only rubble where Rana Plaza once stood amid a continued push to win more compensation for disaster victims. More than two dozen Western clothing brands including Benetton, Children's Place, The Gap and Walmart have paid some $24 million to a compensation fund.</p><p>But labor groups say brands collectively must to more. The needs of former Rana Plaza workers are just too great</p><p>ABBY MCGILL, INTERNATIONAL LABOR RIGHTS FORUM: This tragedy has left very severe physical and psychological wounds on many of the people who survived it. And it's making it difficult for those people to find jobs.</p><p>LAKE: Aid groups hope to raise at least $30 million from these brands which used contractors based in Rana Plaza to manufacture clothes. Human rights officials say brands must use their influence because garment (AUDIO GAP) stilled denied basic rights that could save lives.</p><p>SIFTON: We're simply asking the Bangladesh government to allow them to organize in the union so that they can address their grievances to factory owners. The brands could do a big thing by simply telling the Bangladeshi government to make that a reality.</p><p>LAKE: But as pressure to hold down clothing costs persists, labor groups fear new disasters to come.</p><p>MCGILL: Western retailers and brands are setting prices for clothing that squeeze the producers in developing countries to the point where these kinds of accidents are absolutely inevitable.</p><p>LAKE: On the second anniversary of the worst workplace disaster in modern history, (AUDIO GAP) in Bangladesh remains intense. Maggie Lake, CNN New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Well the Bangladesh ambassador to the United Nations says Western companies and consumers have to be willing to pay a little bit more to benefit the workers and clearly to keep them safe. Last week Richard asked him if the situation has even improved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ABDUL MOMEN, BANGLADESH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: There has been short-term, medium-term, long-term efforts. The government was - it is a wakening call. Whole nation get into it. This shows -- this what I'll talk to you -this shows one thing - that if people are committed and partners also help, we can achieve goals and we did.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW: Buy no one doubts that people have got desires and goodwill to do it. The question is whether or not government has the wherewithal to enforce it and private industry now is determined to spend the money and invest?</p><p>MOMEN: Yes, see the government has imposed so many new rules. For example, we had only five - only few numbers - counted number inspectors. Now we have almost 300 inspectors and we increased the bill - government has increased the budget for it - 300 times.</p><p>Now do our workers they paid law (ph)? Well, we have increased 219 percent. There are 3,200 factories, more than half has been inspected. And not by government alone -- it by Western countries, the supplier and buyers - both Accord and Alliance -- and out of those they have done almost 1,800 inspections. Out of that only 2 percent appeared to be non- (inaudible) and they're closed down.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Now do you think that although there's obviously work to be done from the Bangladeshi side, does the consumer in the West has to recognize they have to pay more? Because obviously if the downward price pressure comes, it's going to hit at the weakest point, which is the laborer in the factory in Bangladesh.</p><p>MOMEN: I agree with you. This is an area we have not achieved much. We hope that because this wait is very long, companies increased 219 percent and the varieties of instruments. But we expected that the global community will rise to the occasions and they will pay extra few cents so that, you know, those people who suffers most, they could be benefitting.</p><p>QUEST: So who needs to do more?</p><p>MOMEN: I think we have to do a more job (ph) in the sense that we have to create a global consciousness that we must help together.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, that's easy to same, Ambassador, but tell me in practical terms - do the companies - the H&amp;Ms, the Prime Arts, the stores - do they need to charge consumers more so they can pay more?</p><p>MOMEN: I think they make enormous amount of profit as you know. One tie to do in Bangladesh, it costs - you can buy it, let's say, $1.00. But when they sell it here, it's $75.00. The marketeers they're making all the profit - huge corporate profit. So I think these big companies should come forward and pay a little extra. I' m not asking for too much - little extra - 25 cents, 50 cents. It can do magic for all.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:40:11] HARLOW: Jryki Raine is the general secretary for IndustriaLL Global Union. He joins me now from Geneva. Thank you for being with me this evening, sir. We just heard what he said - that people will pay more - saying the global community will rise to the occasion, they will pay more.</p><p>Maybe, maybe I'm a skeptic but I'm not so sure about that. Are you?</p><p>JRYKI RAINE, GENERAL SECRETARY, INDUSTRIALL GLOBAL UNION: No, not at all, Poppy. In Australia in a poll, 80 percent of the respondents said that they are prepared to pay more for their clothes if they know that they are made in decent conditions with living wages and safe work places which are still not the case today.</p><p>HARLOW: So they will. I'm very glad to hear that. I would hope that it would play out like that in practice. When you look at more than 1,100 people died - thousands were injured in that collapse.</p><p>When you look at some of these companies that your union has called out and called on a collective responsibility for brands like Benetton, Mango, Walmart, Carrefour to contribute more. Why specifically call out those companies?</p><p>RAINE: Because we feel that the brands who are producing in Bangladesh, they share a collective responsibility of profoundly flawed production model which was not safe, it was not sustainable. The good news today is that we are only $2.7 million short of the $30 million target in the compensation fund which is defined by the ILO experts. So now it's the time for the brands to do the right thing and close one of the most shameful chapters in the history of the global garment industry.</p><p>HARLOW: Well especially when you think about how much money these corporations bring in, you have three and a half million people in Bangladesh that work in the garment industry. The minimum wage that they are paid is about 25 pounds a month. Why do you think it is that we haven't seen an improvement on that front in terms of the wage front to where it needs to be, which is about double that just for a living wage?</p><p>RAINE: Well the reality is that the minimum wage in Bangladesh is $68 a month and that is the reason why all the workers are working at least 60 hours a week. It's a question of pressure, Poppy. So now IndustriALL, Unit (ph) and the Clean Clothes Campaign have been campaigning for a living wage.</p><p>So my challenge tonight is to H&amp;M, to Zara, to Walmart and to Gap to work together within IndustriALL. Let's go to Bangladesh, let's go to Cambodia, let's put in place bargaining structures where the brands also pay a bit more to enable living wages for all these millions of workers.</p><p>HARLOW: You have said that not a single factory can be called 100 percent safe yet. And some companies have responded that - like Disney right after the collapse pulling out completely. Others would say that is not the answer because then the jobs go away.</p><p>RAINE: And that is also our line. And Bangladesh is a poor developing country. They desperately need these millions of jobs for the workers. But they have to be sustainable jobs with living wages safe conditions and reasonable working hours.</p><p>We know that these brands were making tens of billions of dollars of profit every year can afford to pay a bit more to the factory owners and be part of the solutions where we make sure that part of that price also goes to the workers. So that is something that we want to work together with the brands.</p><p>HARLOW: Jyrki Raine live with us in Geneva this evening. Thank you, sir, for being with us and for the important work you're doing. We appreciate it very much. Quick break - we're back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:46:13] HARLOW: \"We will work with all parties. We will work with any government.\" That is a declaration from the chief executive of Heathrow Airport not far from London. John Holland-Kaye spoke with me a short time ago and covered plenty of ground from the contentious third runway proposal to Heathrow's strong results.</p><p>Airport revenues and passenger traffic were up in the first quarter of this year. Passengers voted Heathrow the best airport in Western Europe. But the first question I asked him has to do with the upcoming U.K. election and whether he's concerned Britain may eventually leave the European Union.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JOHN HOLLAND-KAYE, CEO, HEATHROW AIRPORT HOLDINGS: I think we have many benefits that come from membership with the European Union just within the aviation sector. We can see the growth that has been in low-cost carriers through the easy access they have to European markets.</p><p>That's benefitted all consumers and businesses and I think that's something that we should protect. And in the future we're going to see a new single European sky coming in which reduce emissions, reduce costs, it'll allow more capacity on the air roofs that's so vital to trading around the world and that's a real benefit to being part of the E.U. So I hope we won't make it a hasty decision on this. We do need certainty for business so that we can investments.</p><p>I think that Heathrow is not going to change things, particularly we're a very successful and stable business. We have a good international base, we have over 80 carriers from all over the world flying into Heathrow. So we will continue to do well, regardless of the decision. But there are many benefits from being part of the European Union.</p><p>HARLOW: What's driving the traffic increase? Is this more of your traditional carriers or is this about new carriers that are popping up and benefiting from lower oil prices and just bringing in more capacity, more travelers?</p><p>KAYE: Well at Heathrow we are operating at capacity. We can't have any more flights coming in and out. So what we're seeing is more routes being introduced by largely existing carriers to the growth markets of the world. So since last year we've had Avianca flying to Bogota in Colombia. That's a route that's doling very well.</p><p>We just had Vietnam Airlines start a new service. They've moved up from Gatwick flying to Vietnam. That's a really important service to one of the highest-growing markets in the world.</p><p>So we're seeing that happening. We're also seeing carriers putting on more seats to European markets. So BA's been very busy and we're seeing a lot more transfer passengers coming through Heathrow.</p><p>HARLOW: Heathrow is trying to persuade regulators to allow Heathrow to build a third runway. How is that going? Where does it stand?</p><p>KAYE: Well it's going very well in terms of winning support for expansion at Heathrow. I think it's been clear for a long time that Heathrow is the best solution economically. We'll create 180,000 jobs in the U.K. all across the country -- over 200 billion pounds for the British economy.</p><p>But we're also seeing growing support locally because people want the jobs that will come - 40,000 jobs for local communities, tackling youth unemployment. That's a really big price.</p><p>But we've also been listening to the local community and we've announced a big noise insulation program which will be world leading -- 160,000 homes and schools being insulated from noise and that means that more people are now saying Heathrow's the right solution - it can be delivered sustainably, it can be delivered within climate targets with lower emissions and Heathrow's the right answer for the local communities and the right solution nationally.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Well the U.S. secretary of defense has launched a national security initiative in Silicon Valley. We'll tell you more about that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:51:20:] The U.S. Department of Defense is partnering with tech companies to boost its capability to fight cybercrime. Video (ph) D (ph) aims to harness the latest innovations to fight cyberattacks, secure its networks and support military operations.</p><p>Well the U.S. defense secretary was in Silicon Valley on Friday as part of a two-day visit to try to woo some of those executives in Silicon Valley.</p><p>I spoke with the CEO of Accenture, a huge worldwide consulting and technology services firm and I asked him how much the chief executive that he works with are really focusing on cybersecurity and how concerned he is about the threat.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>PIERRE NANTERME, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, ACCENTURE: It is a huge challenge. If you're talking with a CEO, it's clearly security is now in their top three priority concern and challenges that need to get right. And is similar for a company like Accenture, if you will.</p><p>So we're watching all the evolutions from a situated standpoint extremely carefully.</p><p>We are operating in this business and we have a great practice to advise our clients how to deal with security issues, especially around the data privacy, data integrity, data protection and many bills and many regulations as well and policies are figured out around the world in the United States but as well in Europe.</p><p>We are participating to many of the forum in order to create a world which is going to be more secure and where security is going to be center stage.</p><p>HARLOW: You have predicted that a digital revolution is coming in three ways and that this is going to be huge for the way the businesses around the world are run. How is it going to impact them and where is it going to create opportunity?</p><p>NANTERME: I mean it's an amazing revolution we are facing with the digital revolution enabled by what we are calling the Smagda (ph) to show the mobile, the analytic and the Cloud technologies. And indeed the three ways you are referring to are going to be first, the digital consumer with everything (ph) like you know interact between the companies and the consumer.</p><p>The digital enterprise of course -- how you digitalize all the operations of a company, but the most important way in which it's going to start - and it's starting recently - they're about the digital operations, what we are calling the Internet of Things.</p><p>HARLOW: You say these companies need to take risks to be successful. I wonder what you would compare this digital revolution to in past history in terms of big shifts that companies have had to live through and try to thrive through?</p><p>NANTERME: Yes, I mean the common wisdom today is to compare the digital revolution with the electricity. You'll remember this revolution long ago totally changed the way the business operated at the time and I guess it's probably the best proxy for what's happening with the digital -</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>NANTERME: It's a - it's an incredible rethink in the way you're addressing your client's need and the way you think of your operation, but as well in the way you can create global businesses extremely rapidly in a nimble and a fast way.</p><p>HARLOW: Do you think that especially the millennial generation is focused on what a company they are possibly going to work for actually stands for? Where they stand on gun rights, where they stand on gay marriage - issues like that? Do you believe people are now considering that before they take a job?</p><p>NANTERME: I'm sure they are, and at Accenture this year we're going to work with 95,000 people. But I think we have a great experience on recruiting people, attracting people, but as well reading their minds, if you will - understanding their motivation. We're working on this every minute of every day.</p><p>Again, they want to come and work for a company with a purpose, they want to fulfill a goal which is going far beyond career and very importantly they want to make a contribution and it's going to be very important for companies like us to provide an environment which could fulfilling that goal.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:55:13] HARLOW: In a moment here on \"Quest Means Business,\" if you missed out on tickets to the Mayweather versus Pacquiao huge boxing match coming up, we have your solution. I'll tell you what it is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: So if you cannot afford the heavyweight prices like most of us for next week's hugely-anticipated boxing match, we've got a way you still might be able to see Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in person.</p><p>In an unusual step for a boxing match, tickets for the prefight weigh- in - those just went on sale, the price obviously much more affordable than the fight itself. They're just ten bucks. Promoters say proceeds from the weigh-in tickets will be donated to charity.</p><p>This comes after tickets for the fight itself sold out in about one minute on Thursday. The cheapest seat you can find on the secondary market for the fight -- $5,000. Some of those floor seats went for up to $50,000.</p><p>All the hype about this fight has done wonders for Johnny Dagami's profile. He is a former factory worker in the Philippines who just happens to look exactly like Manny Pacquiao. Now, he's even found someone to dress up as Pacquiao's trainer and he says they're going to take their show on the road.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROMEO JAMERO, FREDDIE ROACH IMPERSONATOR: We've become a duo - you know, duo? Seeing comedian. What is that? I told (ph) practice (ph) training Cantanny (ph) Manny and then the comedy Freddie (ph) to any kind of a stage.</p><p>HARLOW: So I think if Pacquiao wins, he needs to give half of his winnings to that guy. All right, that is \"Quest Means Business.\" Thanks so much for being with us this Friday evening. I'm Poppy Harlow in New York. The CNN U.K. election debate is next.

The Dow might have barely eked  out a gain, but the NASDAQ is at a new all-time high.  It is Friday, the  24th of April.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Getting away from it all -- the tax, the regulation, all of that  uncertainty over Europe --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  (AUDIO GAP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  HARLOW:  -- to distress from Apple.</p><p>  I'm Poppy Harlow and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>  Good evening and welcome to the program.  Tonight, one of the world's  biggest banks is threatening to leave British shores and leave a political  hornets' nest behind it.  HSBC is blaming tough regulation, uncertainty  over UK -- over the UK's future in the European Union as the two driving  factors for this</p><p>  You are looking at footage of the banking giant's current headquarters  at London's Canary Wharf.  It is HSBC's biggest office in the world, and  that means thousands upon thousands of jobs.  </p><p>  An obvious choice for a new headquarters would be, of course, Hong  Kong, where HSBC already has a very strong presence.  And Hong Kong's  monetary authority says it, of course, would welcome the bank with open  arms.  After all, that is what the H stands for in HSBC.</p><p>  The bank moved from Hong Kong to the UK as its headquarters back in  1993.  Now, the bank's chairman, Douglas Flint, has real concerns over  changes in regulations in the UK since the financial crisis.  Also, HSBC  cannot sidestep fears over the uncertainty that lies ahead for Britain and  its place within the European Union.  </p><p>  With a general election less than two weeks away, this announcement  has become highly, highly political.  The leaders of Britain's two main  parties have been trading insults as to who is to blame for HSBC  potentially wanting to just walk away.</p><p>  The Labour Party argues that businesses like HSBC are scared of the  Conservatives' promise to offer up a referendum on the future of Britain in  the EU.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  ED MILIBAND, LABOUR PARTY LEADER:  I think the intervention from HSBC  is very significant today.  They say it's a number one economic uncertainty  that our country faces, withdrawal from the European Union.  This does go  to a question of priorities and what is the in the interests of our  country.  </p><p>  I think the last thing our country needs is two years of an internal  debate about whether we should leave the European Union or not, but that  isn't what I want to happen.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  HARLOW:  But Conservatives point out it isn't only Europe that HSBC is  worried about.  Prime Minister David Cameron says regulation is the key  concern for the banking giant.  He argues banks would be worse off under a  Labour government.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  DAVID CAMERON, PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN:  Well, London is, I think  the world's leading financial center.  We've improved London as a financial  center not least by changing the way we regulate banks so that we wouldn't  have to bail them out with taxpayers' money in future, as the last Labour  government had to do.  </p><p>  But it is an important reminder of how vital it is that we keep a pro- enterprise, pro-business, pro-employment policy in our country, of keeping  taxes low, making us an attractive place to invest.  </p><p>  And all the time I've been prime minister, that is what we've been  doing, which is why we see record levels of inward investment coming here  to Britain.  We must keep on that approach and not put it at risk.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  HARLOW:  And I've been speaking with Britain's shadow business  secretary, Chuka Umunna, who is in full-swing election mode.  I started by  asking him about those regulations that are causing so much head-shaking in  the halls of HSBC and Britain's corridors of power.  He was very keen to  discuss the views of the HSBC chairman.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  CHUKA UMUNNA, UK SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY:  Well actually, the  statement that Douglas Flint read out at the annual general meeting there  was actually very candid.  He acknowledged that there were major  reputational issues for his own bank coming out of recent revelations into  the activities of the Swiss arm, the Swiss private bank.</p><p>  But he also acknowledged some of the major problems that were exposed  in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, 9, and some of those  have still been carrying to recently, with the ethics scandal and, of  course, libor rigging before that.  And there was a general acknowledgment  in his comments that the center needed to get its own house in order, and  that the regulatory environment needed to be improved.  </p><p>  So, it wasn't actually in that sense so critical of the reforms as  really just saying given that those reforms have happened and the field on  which we're playing has slightly altered, of course you take stock, and I  don't think that's unreasonable.</p><p>  [16:04:55]  HARLOW:  Well, let me point this out:  he did make very  clear that the bank believes that the levies that it pays are too high in  the UK, right?  Looking at last year alone, HSBC paid the government the  highest levy of $1.1 billion and said 58 percent of that charge did not  relate to the UK banking activities of the bank.</p><p>  UMUNNA:  Well, I think that we have global banks here.  The global  financial crash cost the UK around 1.3 trillion pounds.  I don't think in  that context it is unreasonable to ask those in the sector to pay a bit of  a bigger contribution into the UK exchequer.  </p><p>  Now, I accept -- I can hear, maybe, there'll be market makers and  others watching this program who will say, well, look, HSBC didn't take  public funds in the way that the Royal Bank of Scotland did, or Lloyd's  Banking Group did.  That's true.  </p><p>  But they did benefit from the measures that the UK government -- and  of course, the US and others took measures, too -- took to prevent the  entire system collapsing upon itself.  And of course, HSBC would have  benefited from that, too.</p><p>  So, I don't think it is unreasonable to ask for these universal and  other investment banks to make a bit of a bigger contribution.</p><p>  HARLOW:  But here's the thing:  80 percent of HSBC's profit in 2014  came from Asia, 80 percent of that $12 billion.  And when you look at how  these levies are decided on, they're decided on the size of the balance  sheets.  </p><p>  So, does HSBC have a point there that it wants less cumbersome, as it  would call them, levies and regulation?  And you've got Conservatives who  would say, look, it's the Labour Party who's actually planning to regulate  these banks even further.</p><p>  UMUNNA:  Well, here's the thing:  there is consensus on the need to  tighten up regulation.  And in fact, in terms of the bank levy, that was  actually introduced by a Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, George  Osborne.  So, there is a degree of political consensus on that in the UK.</p><p>  But hey, look, if I was the chairman of a big universal banking  corporation like HSBC, of course you're not going to be arguing A, for the  institution of a levy, or B for it to be increased.  Of course you're going  to argue for it to be reduced.  In some senses, that is what your  shareholders would have expected of you.</p><p>  But we as policymakers have to weigh all the different interests in  society and ensure we've got a policy matrix that works for everyone and  not just a few people.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HARLOW:  Let's discuss the political row in the UK over HSBC with  Gillian Tett.  She's the US managing editor of the \"Financial Times.\"  She  joins me live right here in New York City.  Thank you so much for being  with me.  I appreciate it.  It is good to have you on the program.  And  let's be --</p><p>  GILLIAN TETT, US MANAGING EDITOR, \"FINANCIAL TIMES\":  Great to be  here.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Let's begin with this.  We have heard, look, clearly he was  in full election mode.  You hear it from Labour, you hear it from  Conservatives so close to the election.  But who do you think has a  stronger argument at this point in time when it comes to HSBC and why  they're threatening to leave.</p><p>  TETT:  Well, I think the reality is that HSBC is engaged in saber- rattling right now.  That's how we described it in the \"Financial Times\"  tonight.  And it is not the first time that HSBC has dropped these hints.   It's indicated that it's pretty unhappy about the regulatory climate over  and over again.</p><p>  But it also has a business reason for wanting to look further east,  which is that most Western markets are pretty mature.  Asia is really where  the growth is.  So, it has made these hints before.  It's been very clever  in terms of blaming both the European issue and the tax issue --</p><p>  HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>  TETT:  -- equally, so it managed to steer a line between the two  sides.  But you just have to look at one number, which is 750 million.   That's the amount of eventually extra tax that HSBC had to pay last year  because of the one-off bank levy.  And that's a very large number.  And  there was a feeling that the governments are clamping down too aggressively  on banks.</p><p>  HARLOW:  It's a very important point, because when you look at the  levy that they paid last year, something like $1.1 billion based on the  size of their balance sheet, but 80 percent of their profit came from Asia.  </p><p>  So -- but clearly they haven't made up their mind, because if HSBC had  made up its mind, they wouldn't even need to threaten.  Do you see this as  a threat to get the government to back away from some of these regulations?</p><p>  TETT:  Absolutely it's a threat.  It's also an attempt to show  shareholders that they're not being negligent by ignoring these costs.  The  750 million figure I cited was 750 million pounds sterling.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>  TETT:  Which is a big number for a levy to be actually imposed on a  bank.  And what really concerns HSBC and many of its shareholders is that  although this was originally presented as a one-off measure, the  government's now indicating it may anything but.  So, they're looking  potentially a long regulatory tunnel.  </p><p>  The problem, though, is that if HSBC was to move to Hong Kong, while  the Hong Kong regulators are pretty widely respected around the world and  by many HSBC shareholders, having China as, essentially, the dominant power  overseeing you potentially in the future is not something that many  shareholders would be very excited about.</p><p>  [16:10:03]  So, it's a lot of saber-rattling right now.  Who knows  whether it will actually lead to anything concrete?</p><p>  HARLOW:  That's a very important point you make, and certainly one  they're considering in the C Suite at HSBC.  </p><p>  Let me ask you this:  looking outside of HSBC at other big banks that  call London their headquarters, at least in Europe, do you believe that  they are more concerned right now about the levies they're paying because  of this increased regulation or possibly more regulation coming from the  Labour Party if they win, if you listen to the Conservatives.</p><p>  Or do you think that they are really unnerved by the uncertainty of  the UK's position within Europe as a whole?</p><p>  TETT:  Well, there are two things to notice here.  The first thing, as  far as the banks are concerned, right now -- and I was talking to a senior  banker the other day -- what's going on is really not a beauty contest in  geographical terms, in terms of different centers competing for bank  business.</p><p>  It's more like an ugly contest.  Where is the worst of all worlds or  the worst possible place to be?  Because there are big problems in the UK  right now with London, as far as the banks are concerned.  But New York is  not entirely welcoming either.  And while Switzerland or Singapore might  have some advantages, they also have big drawbacks, too.</p><p>  So, the banks are thinking hard about geographical location.  The  other big question, though, is London as a haven or a center for the  internationally-mobile elite.  Because the Labour government has indicated  that it does plan to crack down quite strongly on those internationally- mobile wealthy people.  And that in many ways is an even bigger reason for  banks like HSBC to be rethinking where they're based.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Gillian Tett, US managing editor for the \"Financial Times,\"  joining us this Friday evening.  Thank you so much, we appreciate it.</p><p>  TETT:  Thank you.</p><p>  HARLOW:  European indexes were up Friday, finishing the week with  gains.  Markets backed off from those midweek highs that we saw after  inconclusive talks, to say the least, about Greece.</p><p>  In Athens, Greek stocks rose more than 3 percent on hopes of positive  talks between Merkel and Tsipras.  Meanwhile, HSBC shares are up nearly 3  percent.</p><p>  US markets closed the day higher.  The Dow posted a modest gain.  The  NASDAQ -- the NASDAQ is what it is all about, hitting an all-time record  high.  CNN Money's Paul La Monica here to talk with us about it.  The  NASDAQ is on fire.  Not only a 15-year-high, as we were saying yesterday,  but an all-time high.</p><p>  PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  All-time high was  briefly above 5100 this morning and it didn't close above that.  So, we're  still waiting for it to get that intra-day record of 5132, March of 2000.   Good chance we'll probably get there sometime soon the way these earnings  have been.</p><p>  You had strong results from Amazon and Microsoft.  They really led the  way.  Amazon was up 14 percent today, all-time high.  Microsoft up 10.5  percent.  Google was the laggard, it was only up 3 percent.</p><p>  HARLOW:  And we have Apple coming Monday?</p><p>  LA MONICA:  We have Apple coming Monday after the bell.  That is  obviously the next big tech stock to be reporting, and the next big test, I  think, for the NASDAQ.  Clearly, a lot of high expectations for Apple.</p><p>  All the hype about the watch, but that just went on sale, so we're not  going to get any numbers about that yet, but iPhone sales will probably be  big again.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Yes.  And we'll talk about the Apple Watch a little bit later  in the program.  Have a great weekend, Paul La Monica.</p><p>  LA MONICA:  Thank you, Poppy, you, too.</p><p>  HARLOW:  And thank you so much.  </p><p>  Well, talks to resolve Greece's debt troubled and with no progress.   Not only that, but officials have heaped criticism on the Greek finance  minister.  We'll discuss, next.</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  [16:15:03]  HARLOW:  Talks to resolve Greece's economic future have  ended with really no progress at all.  Greek finance minister Yanis  Varoufakis met with eurozone finance ministers this week.  Eurozone  officials are reportedly very critical of him, calling him a, quote, \"time- waster\" and a \"gambler.\"  </p><p>  Varoufakis, on the other hand, said the talks are actually going  pretty well and making progress.  So, where's the disconnect?  The head of  the eurogroup said that things did not end so well.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  JEROEN DIJSSELBLOEM, PRESIDENT OF THE EUROGROUP:  It was a very  critical discussion.  We came to an agreement two months ago, and today, of  course, we had hoped to hear a positive results and an agreement on which  we could then take a decision.  And we are still far from that.  So, yes,  it was a very critical discussion.</p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  HARLOW:  And European officials now say time is, indeed, running out  for Greece.  There are three key issues that Varoufakis is supposedly  gambling on.  The first, the Greek budget.  Europe has set various budget  targets in exchange for bailout money, but Varoufakis says Greece cannot be  expected to meet them all because all the austerity is making the economy  too weak.</p><p>  Europe agreed back in February that the bailout deal could be  rejiggered, basically, but won't make any promises until the next issue is  sorted.  And that is Greece's reform program.  Europe doesn't just want  budget cuts, it also wants long-lasting structural reforms on things like  taxation and corruption in Greece.  </p><p>  Right now, it says it simply is not seeing enough progress on that  front, and until it's happy with Greece's overall plan, it will not hand  over any more bailout money.</p><p>  And that brings us to the biggest problem of all, Greek funding.  The  current bailout money stops flowing at the end of June.  Beyond that, there  is no guarantee that Greece can pay all of its bills, and it has $4 billion  worth of payments that are due in June.</p><p>  Before Varoufakis was finance minister, he was an academic  specializing in game theory.  Our Clare Sebastian looks at how this  strategy can shed light on the negotiations.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER (voice-over):  At the heart of game  theory, conflict, cooperation, and eventually, a mathematical solution.  At  least, that's how it works in theory.</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For Greece, there is certainty -- </p><p>  (AUDIO GAP)</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was still no firm common ground.</p><p>  UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But it can't possibly be business as usual in  Greece.</p><p>  SEBASTIAN:  In 2004, the now Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis,  published this academic text on game theory.  His co-author was Shaun  Hargreaves Heap.</p><p>  SHAUN HARGREAVES HEAP, CO-AUTHOR, \"GAME THEORY:  A CRITICAL  INTRODUCTION\":  Marketing games of the sort that Yanis and the Greek  government are involved in don't have unique solutions in that sense.</p><p>  SEBASTIAN:  Hargreaves Heap says that while game theory won't solve  the Greek crisis, it does offer some useful principles.</p><p>  HARGREAVES HEAP:  Where there is a genuine, as it were, insight from  game theory, notes the people who are likely to concede the most in a  negotiation are those who have the most to fear from if you fail to make  the agreement.</p><p>  SEBASTIAN:  In the case of Greece and Europe, both sides have plenty  to fear if Greece defaults and leaves the eurozone.  And both are putting  on an optimistic face.</p><p>  DIJSSELBLOEM:  Grexit is simply not on the table, it's not discussed.</p><p>  VAROUFAKIS:  We are intent -- </p><p>  (AUDIO GAP)</p><p>  VAROUFAKIS:  -- people.</p><p>  SEBASTIAN:  Game theory is about principles, not specifics.  Solving  the Greek crisis requires both.</p><p>  HARGREAVES HEAP:  What the terms of the agreement are, games theory  doesn't tell us what it should be.  But what they say is both sides will be  -- both lose if they leave the table with the cake still on it, because  they've failed to agree how to cut it up.</p><p>  SEBASTIAN:  One thing we do know, it will test even the most  experienced of game theorists.</p><p>  SEBASTIAN (on camera):  What was he like as a thinker?  What was your  experience working with him?</p><p>  HARGREAVES HEAP:  He was lots of fun to work with.  We had lots of  good arguments, lots of good discussions.  We're both academics who believe  in the positive value of dispute.</p><p>  SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HARLOW:  With cash running out, the Greek government has issued an  emergency decree asking state agencies and municipal coffers to hand over  their reserves.  I spoke with the mayor of Athens, George Kaminis, about  how local governments and the public are responding.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  GEORGE KAMINIS, MAYOR OF ATHENS:  Well, things all those last years  have been very bad for my country.  OK that today's meeting was a  disappointment, let's say.  But we are still confident, and I'm optimistic.   I firmly believe that we're going to arrive to an agreement with the  European Union.</p><p>  HARLOW:  What makes you so confident?  Because as the weeks go by, I  think more and more people think that a Greek exit could happen.</p><p>  [16:19:57]  KAMINIS:  There's a very solid basis to be confident in  that 80 percent of Greek people, they want to remain in the euro, they want  our country in the European Union.  We belong to the court of the European  Union, and those people are determined to work for that.</p><p>  HARLOW:  You have been the mayor of Athens for nearly five years, now  --</p><p>  KAMINIS:  Yes.</p><p>  HARLOW:  -- since 2010.  Can you give me a sense of what it is like  day-to-day for the average citizen living there?  Just their concern level  and the real-world impact on them?</p><p>  KAMINIS:  Of course, it's for many people, not only marginalized  people, as it was in the past, many people who used to have their jobs only  a few months ago, they are in difficulty, very severe difficulties.  </p><p>  But at the same time, there are people who are like tourists, who  arrive in Athens.  They stay for a week, and they say, where is the crisis?   Because it's a lovely city, a vibrant -- </p><p>  (AUDIO GAP)</p><p>  KAMINIS:  At night, the capacity restaurants are full with people.   You don't realize very well if you remain as a tourist.</p><p>  HARLOW:  And I understand that, and I understand you want the tourism  to continue, as it has.  It's very important for the economy, but --</p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  KAMINIS:  And this year, we have a new record on tourism arrivals.</p><p>  HARLOW:  But for the people, the people of your city, of Athens, you  still have 26 percent unemployment.  How are they getting by?</p><p>  KAMINIS:  Well, in a great difficulty and among young people, it's  almost 60 percent.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>  KAMINIS:  So, that is one supplementary or even the most important  reason to insist on remaining in the eurozone, and we have to foster  entrepreneurship, create new business and create jobs for the people.</p><p>  HARLOW:  So it's not -- it sounds like it's not necessarily about  bringing the old jobs back.  You're talking about entrepreneurship,  starting new businesses, opening new doors for citizens.</p><p>  KAMINIS:  Oh, yes, of course.  We have to modernize the economy.   Because for so many years, things didn't go well, but we used to live well  on the loans, on the bank loans.  Now, we are facing the reality, and the  reality can be very, very cruel.  So, we have be innovative in every, every  aspect.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HARLOW:  Well, the Apple Watch makes its first highly-anticipated  appearance in select stores worldwide, and guess who has one.  Our Samuel  Burke got his hands on one.  We'll show you the goods next.</p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  HARLOW:  Apple Watches made their debut on store shelves, but do not  try to buy the new smart watch in the Apple Store.  They will be on display  there, but just a handful of high-end shops around the world are selling  the device for now.  CNN technology correspondent Samuel Burke somehow got  one -- why am I not surprised you got one --</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  HARLOW:  -- some way, somehow? -- and has an assessment.  How does it  feel?  How does it operate?  Do you like it?</p><p>  SAMUEL BURKE, CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Right away when I put it  on, I liked the feel of it.  If you want to get a lot of \"likes\" on  Facebook, take a picture with an Apple Watch.  Everywhere I'm going,  everybody wants to see it.  People are looking at it, they want to just  view it.</p><p>  It was pretty easy to use, not quite as intuitive as an iPhone.  But  one thing that I already don't like about it is the audio quality.  Because  don't forget, you can actually make phone calls on this thing.  </p><p>  And so, someone called me, and I was listening to it, and I almost had  to kind of put my ear up to it to be able to hear, and it's not -- I think  they tried to make it so it wasn't loud enough to disturb my colleagues,  but I just couldn't hear from it.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Can you show me, how would you make a -- put it up to your  ear, is that how you would do it?  You have to put it all the way up to  your ear?</p><p>  [16:25:03]  BURKE:  In theory.  Right now, I'm just clicking the CNN  app, because I still don't quite remember the phone call app.  So, I just  want to show off the CNN app for company's sake.  But someone calls you,  you just click a button, and you should -- they want you to be able to hear  like this, just from the way I'm sitting right now.  </p><p>  But I actually couldn't hear, so I kind of had to do this type of  thing to hear it.  And even then, the audio quality wasn't great.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>  BURKE:  So --</p><p>  HARLOW:  All right.</p><p>  BURKE:  -- hold off, use your iPhone for the phone calls for now.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>  BURKE:  This is the $400 model.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Pretty snazzy.  Oh, that's not the $17,000 model?  I was  wondering which one.</p><p>  BURKE:  I decided to keep that at home.</p><p>  HARLOW:  I was wondering which one you had.  Samuel Burke, have a  great weekend.  Thank you so much.</p><p>  Well, the much-anticipated smart watch poses a big threat, frankly, to  Switzerland's age-old watch industry.  That is according to Elmar Mock, who  helped revive the business as co-inventor of Swatch.  He joins me now from  Switzerland.  Thank you for being with me, sir.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>  ELMAR MOCK, CO-INVENTOR, SWATCH:  Hello.  </p><p>  HARLOW:  Hello.  Let's begin with this.  Your initial assessment of  the Apple Watch.  How much do you think the traditional watch industry  should be worried?</p><p>  MOCK:  I think it's a fantastic opportunity also for the normal watch  industry who meets a new world which opened now, and they are going in the  right direction.  So, I appreciate very much the Apple Watch.  And I think  it's a chance for the watch industry to also join this movement.</p><p>  HARLOW:  But can Swiss watchmakers who are putting out their own smart  watches, do you think they can compete with the technology of the Apple  smart watch?</p><p>  MOCK:  It will not be exactly the same technology.  But I think they  can seriously compete.  So, I think it's really an opportunity, and they  have a solution, and I know a solution.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Think about the Apple Watch, I think about charging it.   Because you do, you have to plug it in, you have to charge it.  Do you  people -- think people are going to want to take their watch off at night  and charge it like their phone?</p><p>  MOCK:  I think the functions are really great, and I think it makes  life also easier.   So why don't charge during the night?  I think we  charge also our phone.  For ten years ago, I was charging my phone every  week.  Now I have to charge it every night.</p><p>  I don't say that is the only way, but I don't think it's very great.   I may be more afraid about the fact that she's not tight today.  But I  think that she will become more and more better.  So, we have a chance, and  it's the first one, and they will have other ones, and it's really going in  the right direction.</p><p>  HARLOW:  It's interesting.  You've said that Apple will really hurt  companies operating at the mid-price level, like a Swatch, for example,  right?  So this initial one is below $400, they go all the way up to  $17,000.  I wonder if you think, though, Apple is maybe making a mistake  trying to compete at the high end with those high-end watches?</p><p>  MOCK:  I don't think they've made a mistake.  I'm not sure that the  really high-end are affected.  But the middle range, of course they are  affected.  You must imagine that Apple and the other competition -- I  think, Samsung is at present, (inaudible) are present, Sony also.  So, I  think they will be maybe 50 million pieces a year who will be sold out  through this new channel.</p><p>  What is fantastic, it's also a new distribution.  It's a new way to go  on the market.  I think it's a fantastic opportunity, and these 50 million  watches who are sold out sell with this price.  It will compete with the  middle segment, of course.  But it's not -- every competition is also  something very healthy.</p><p>  HARLOW:  How many people, sir, do you believe are going to make the  mistake of getting in the shower with their Apple Watch on?</p><p>  MOCK:  A lot.  A lot, of course.</p><p>  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>  MOCK:  That they will recognize they made a mistake.  I was also  wearing some electronic item with me, and I will go in under the shower.   So, it's -- you make it once or twice, and after, you can make progress  yourself.  Of course, waterproof will have to become once.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>  MOCK:  But if your life is coming easier, and if you have pleasure  with this product, you will also accept a little bit of disadvantage.  But  of course that will change.</p><p>  HARLOW:  I am certainly fascinated by it and can't wait to try one  myself.  Thank you so much for joining us.  Especially as a Swatch fan, I  appreciate all you've done for the watch industry.  Sir, have a wonderful  weekend.</p><p>  MOCK:  OK, thank you very much, and have a good time, too.</p><p>  HARLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>  Well, switching gears here.  It has now been two years to the day  since that horrific, horrific factory collapse in Bangladesh where 1100  people were killed, thousands more injured.  We're going to find out if  workers' conditions have improved.</p><p>  [16:29:42]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  [16:32:00] HARLOW:  Hello, I'm Poppy Harlow.  Coming up on the next  half hour of \"Quest Means Business,\" The CEO of Heathrow Airport tells me  what he's hoping to see from the upcoming U.K. election.  </p><p>  Also, two years ago since the Rana Plaza building collapsed, how much  is really changed for Bangladesh's factory workers?  </p><p>  Before that though, here are your top business headlines this hour.</p><p>Armenia is marking 100 years since the mass killings of Armenians  during the First World War.  Russian President Vladimir Putin and French  President Francois Hollande condemned the deaths at a ceremony today.  But  the issue remains politically sensitive as Turkey and others insist that  the killings should not be considered genocide as Armenians considers them.</p><p>  In Italy, authorities say that they have broken up a terror cell with  links to al-Qaeda, and the Vatican may have been one of its targets.  At  least nine people have been arrested.  Some of the 18 suspects are accused  of involvement in a bombing in Pakistan that left more than 300 people dead  or wounded.  </p><p>  Authorities say they expect more activity from a volcano in Chile.   This coming in the coming hours.  Calbuco has already erupted twice this  week, spewing some 60 centimeters of ash in some places.  Some 4,500 people  have now had to evacuate the region.  The ash has now spread to neighboring  Argentina which is not surprising considering Chile's slender geography.   Look at those images - wow. </p><p>  And the captain of a migrant boat that capsized in the Mediterranean  last weekend has appeared in court.  The 27-year-old Tunisia national is  accused of causing the tragedy that killed hundreds.  He has been detained  and he has been - he has denied being in charge of that vessel.  </p><p>  It has been two years since the Rana Plaza factory collapse in  Bangladesh.  More than 1,100 people lost their lives that day when the  eight-story building collapsed.  It was the deadliest disaster the world's  garment industry has ever seen and it sparked outrage about dangerous  conditions for hundreds and hundreds of workers.  </p><p>  Since the collapse, brands and retailers have contributed millions of  dollars to a compensation fund for injured workers and their families.   Still, campaigners say much more needs to be done.  Maggie Lake reports.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  MAGGIE LAKE, BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL:   More than 1,100 people dead, thousands injured, livelihoods destroyed.  Two  years after the Rana Plaza disaster, the wounds are still not healed.  And  despite stepped-up inspections, rights groups say conditions in many  Bangladesh factories remain perilous.  </p><p>  [16:35:01] JOHN SIFTON, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH:  There could another Rana  Plaza tomorrow.  It's less likely, but it's still possible.  </p><p>  The residential buildings have been converted into factories.  A lot  of them have had floors added - they're very unsafe.  </p><p>  MAGGIE LAKE, BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL:   Today there is only rubble where Rana Plaza once stood amid a continued  push to win more compensation for disaster victims.  More than two dozen  Western clothing brands including Benetton, Children's Place, The Gap and  Walmart have paid some $24 million to a compensation fund.  </p><p>  But labor groups say brands collectively must to more.  The needs of  former Rana Plaza workers are just too great  </p><p>  ABBY MCGILL, INTERNATIONAL LABOR RIGHTS FORUM:  This tragedy has left  very severe physical and psychological wounds on many of the people who  survived it.  And it's making it difficult for those people to find jobs.</p><p>  LAKE:  Aid groups hope to raise at least $30 million from these brands  which used contractors based in Rana Plaza to manufacture clothes.  Human  rights officials say brands must use their influence because garment (AUDIO  GAP) stilled denied basic rights that could save lives.  </p><p>  SIFTON:  We're simply asking the Bangladesh government to allow them  to organize in the union so that they can address their grievances to  factory owners.  The brands could do a big thing by simply telling the  Bangladeshi government to make that a reality.  </p><p>  LAKE:  But as pressure to hold down clothing costs persists, labor  groups fear new disasters to come.  </p><p>  MCGILL:  Western retailers and brands are setting prices for clothing  that squeeze the producers in developing countries to the point where these  kinds of accidents are absolutely inevitable.  </p><p>  LAKE:  On the second anniversary of the worst workplace disaster in  modern history, (AUDIO GAP) in Bangladesh remains intense.  Maggie Lake,  CNN New York.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  HARLOW:  Well the Bangladesh ambassador to the United Nations says  Western companies and consumers have to be willing to pay a little bit more  to benefit the workers and clearly to keep them safe.  Last week Richard  asked him if the situation has even improved.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  ABDUL MOMEN, BANGLADESH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  There has  been short-term, medium-term, long-term efforts.  The government was - it  is a wakening call.  Whole nation get into it.  This shows -- this what  I'll talk to you -this shows one thing - that if people are committed and  partners also help, we can achieve goals and we did.  </p><p>  RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW:  Buy no one doubts that people have got desires and  goodwill to do it.  The question is whether or not government has the  wherewithal to enforce it and private industry now is determined to spend  the money and invest?  </p><p>  MOMEN:  Yes, see the government has imposed so many new rules.  For  example, we had only five - only few numbers - counted number inspectors.   Now we have almost 300 inspectors and we increased the bill - government  has increased the budget for it - 300 times.  </p><p>  Now do our workers they paid law (ph)? Well, we have increased 219  percent.  There are 3,200 factories, more than half has been inspected.   And not by government alone -- it by Western countries, the supplier and  buyers - both Accord and Alliance -- and out of those they have done almost  1,800 inspections.  Out of that only 2 percent appeared to be non- (inaudible) and they're closed down.  </p><p>  QUEST:  Right.  Now do you think that although there's obviously work  to be done from the Bangladeshi side, does the consumer in the West has to  recognize they have to pay more?  Because obviously if the downward price  pressure comes, it's going to hit at the weakest point, which is the  laborer in the factory in Bangladesh.  </p><p>  MOMEN:  I agree with you.  This is an area we have not achieved much.   We hope that because this wait is very long, companies increased 219  percent and the varieties of instruments.  But we expected that the global  community will rise to the occasions and they will pay extra few cents so  that, you know, those people who suffers most, they could be benefitting.  </p><p>  QUEST:  So who needs to do more?  </p><p>  MOMEN:  I think we have to do a more job (ph) in the sense that we  have to create a global consciousness that we must help together.  </p><p>  QUEST:  Oh, that's easy to same, Ambassador, but tell me in practical  terms - do the companies - the H&amp;Ms, the Prime Arts, the stores - do they  need to charge consumers more so they can pay more?  </p><p>  MOMEN:  I think they make enormous amount of profit as you know.  One  tie to do in Bangladesh, it costs - you can buy it, let's say, $1.00.  But  when they sell it here, it's $75.00.  The marketeers they're making all the  profit - huge corporate profit.  So I think these big companies should come  forward and pay a little extra.  I' m not asking for too much - little  extra - 25 cents, 50 cents.  It can do magic for all.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  [16:40:11] HARLOW:  Jryki Raine is the general secretary for  IndustriaLL Global Union.  He joins me now from Geneva. Thank you for being  with me this evening, sir.  We just heard what he said - that people will  pay more - saying the global community will rise to the occasion, they will  pay more.  </p><p>  Maybe, maybe I'm a skeptic but I'm not so sure about that.  Are you?  </p><p>  JRYKI RAINE, GENERAL SECRETARY, INDUSTRIALL GLOBAL UNION:  No, not at  all, Poppy.  In Australia in a poll, 80 percent of the respondents said  that they are prepared to pay more for their clothes if they know that they  are made in decent conditions with living wages and safe work places which  are still not the case today.  </p><p>  HARLOW:  So they will.  I'm very glad to hear that.  I would hope that  it would play out like that in practice.  When you look at more than 1,100  people died - thousands were injured in that collapse.  </p><p>  When you look at some of these companies that your union has called  out and called on a collective responsibility for brands like Benetton,  Mango, Walmart, Carrefour to contribute more.  Why specifically call out  those companies?  </p><p>  RAINE:  Because we feel that the brands who are producing in  Bangladesh, they share a collective responsibility of profoundly flawed  production model which was not safe, it was not sustainable.  The good news  today is that we are only $2.7 million short of the $30 million target in  the compensation fund which is defined by the ILO experts.  So now it's the  time for the brands to do the right thing and close one of the most  shameful chapters in the history of the global garment industry.  </p><p>  HARLOW:  Well especially when you think about how much money these  corporations bring in, you have three and a half million people in  Bangladesh that work in the garment industry.  The minimum wage that they  are paid is about 25 pounds a month.  Why do you think it is that we  haven't seen an improvement on that front in terms of the wage front to  where it needs to be, which is about double that just for a living wage?  </p><p>  RAINE:  Well the reality is that the minimum wage in Bangladesh is $68  a month and that is the reason why all the workers are working at least 60  hours a week.  It's a question of pressure, Poppy.  So now IndustriALL,  Unit (ph) and the Clean Clothes Campaign have been campaigning for a living  wage.  </p><p>  So my challenge tonight is to H&amp;M, to Zara, to Walmart and to Gap to  work together within IndustriALL.  Let's go to Bangladesh, let's go to  Cambodia, let's put in place bargaining structures where the brands also  pay a bit more to enable living wages for all these millions of workers.</p><p>  HARLOW:  You have said that not a single factory can be called 100  percent safe yet.  And some companies have responded that - like Disney  right after the collapse pulling out completely.  Others would say that is  not the answer because then the jobs go away.  </p><p>  RAINE:  And that is also our line.  And Bangladesh is a poor  developing country.  They desperately need these millions of jobs for the  workers.  But they have to be sustainable jobs with living wages safe  conditions and reasonable working hours.</p><p>  We know that these brands were making tens of billions of dollars of  profit every year can afford to pay a bit more to the factory owners and be  part of the solutions where we make sure that part of that price also goes  to the workers.  So that is something that we want to work together with  the brands.  </p><p>  HARLOW:  Jyrki Raine live with us in Geneva this evening.  Thank you,  sir, for being with us and for the important work you're doing.  We  appreciate it very much.  Quick break - we're back in a minute.  </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  [16:46:13] HARLOW:  \"We will work with all parties.  We will work with  any government.\"  That is a declaration from the chief executive of  Heathrow Airport not far from London.  John Holland-Kaye spoke with me a  short time ago and covered plenty of ground from the contentious third  runway proposal to Heathrow's strong results. </p><p>  Airport revenues and passenger traffic were up in the first quarter of  this year.  Passengers voted Heathrow the best airport in Western Europe.   But the first question I asked him has to do with the upcoming U.K.  election and whether he's concerned Britain may eventually leave the  European Union.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  JOHN HOLLAND-KAYE, CEO, HEATHROW AIRPORT HOLDINGS:  I think we have  many benefits that come from membership with the European Union just within  the aviation sector.  We can see the growth that has been in low-cost  carriers through the easy access they have to European markets.  </p><p>  That's benefitted all consumers and businesses and I think that's  something that we should protect.  And in the future we're going to see a  new single European sky coming in which reduce emissions, reduce costs,  it'll allow more capacity on the air roofs that's so vital to trading  around the world and that's a real benefit to being part of the E.U. So I  hope we won't make it a hasty decision on this.  We do need certainty for  business so that we can investments.  </p><p>  I think that Heathrow is not going to change things, particularly  we're a very successful and stable business. We have a good international  base, we have over 80 carriers from all over the world flying into  Heathrow.  So we will continue to do well, regardless of the decision.  But  there are many benefits from being part of the European Union.</p><p>  HARLOW:  What's driving the traffic increase?  Is this more of your  traditional carriers or is this about new carriers that are popping up and  benefiting from lower oil prices and just bringing in more capacity, more  travelers?  </p><p>  KAYE:  Well at Heathrow we are operating at capacity.  We can't have  any more flights coming in and out.  So what we're seeing is more routes  being introduced by largely existing carriers to the growth markets of the  world.  So since last year we've had Avianca flying to Bogota in Colombia.   That's a route that's doling very well.  </p><p>  We just had Vietnam Airlines start a new service.  They've moved up  from Gatwick flying to Vietnam.  That's a really important service to one  of the highest-growing markets in the world.  </p><p>  So we're seeing that happening.  We're also seeing carriers putting on  more seats to European markets.  So BA's been very busy and we're seeing a  lot more transfer passengers coming through Heathrow.  </p><p>  HARLOW:  Heathrow is trying to persuade regulators to allow Heathrow  to build a third runway.  How is that going?  Where does it stand?  </p><p>  KAYE:  Well it's going very well in terms of winning support for  expansion at Heathrow.  I think it's been clear for a long time that  Heathrow is the best solution economically.  We'll create 180,000 jobs in  the U.K. all across the country -- over 200 billion pounds for the British  economy.  </p><p>  But we're also seeing growing support locally because people want the  jobs that will come - 40,000 jobs for local communities, tackling youth  unemployment.  That's a really big price.  </p><p>  But we've also been listening to the local community and we've  announced a big noise insulation program which will be world leading -- 160,000 homes and schools being insulated from noise and that means that  more people are now saying Heathrow's the right solution - it can be  delivered sustainably, it can be delivered within climate targets with  lower emissions and Heathrow's the right answer for the local communities  and the right solution nationally.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  HARLOW:  Well the U.S. secretary of defense has launched a national  security initiative in Silicon Valley.  We'll tell you more about that  next.  </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  [16:51:20:]  The U.S. Department of Defense is partnering with tech  companies to boost its capability to fight cybercrime.  Video (ph) D (ph)  aims to harness the latest innovations to fight cyberattacks, secure its  networks and support military operations.  </p><p>  Well the U.S. defense secretary was in Silicon Valley on Friday as  part of a two-day visit to try to woo some of those executives in Silicon  Valley.</p><p>  I spoke with the CEO of Accenture, a huge worldwide consulting and  technology services firm and I asked him how much the chief executive that  he works with are really focusing on cybersecurity and how concerned he is  about the threat.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  PIERRE NANTERME, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, ACCENTURE:  It is a huge challenge.   If you're talking with a CEO, it's clearly security is now in their top  three priority concern and challenges that need to get right.  And is  similar for a company like Accenture, if you will.  </p><p>  So we're watching all the evolutions from a situated standpoint  extremely carefully.  </p><p>  We are operating in this business and we have a great practice to  advise our clients how to deal with security issues, especially around the  data privacy, data integrity, data protection and many bills and many  regulations as well and policies are figured out around the world in the  United States but as well in Europe.  </p><p>  We are participating to many of the forum in order to create a world  which is going to be more secure and where security is going to be center  stage. </p><p>  HARLOW:  You have predicted that a digital revolution is coming in  three ways and that this is going to be huge for the way the businesses  around the world are run.  How is it going to impact them and where is it  going to create opportunity?  </p><p>  NANTERME:  I mean it's an amazing revolution we are facing with the  digital revolution enabled by what we are calling the Smagda (ph) to show  the mobile, the analytic and the Cloud technologies.  And indeed the three  ways you are referring to are going to be first, the digital consumer with  everything (ph) like you know interact between the companies and the  consumer.</p><p>  The digital enterprise of course -- how you digitalize all the  operations of a company, but the most important way in which it's going to  start - and it's starting recently - they're about the digital operations,  what we are calling the Internet of Things.  </p><p>  HARLOW:  You say these companies need to take risks to be successful.   I wonder what you would compare this digital revolution to in past history  in terms of big shifts that companies have had to live through and try to  thrive through?  </p><p>  NANTERME:  Yes, I mean the common wisdom today is to compare the  digital revolution with the electricity.  You'll remember this revolution  long ago totally changed the way the business operated at the time and I  guess it's probably the best proxy for what's happening with the digital - </p><p>  HARLOW:  Wow.  </p><p>  NANTERME:  It's a - it's an incredible rethink in the way you're  addressing your client's need and the way you think of your operation, but  as well in the way you can create global businesses extremely rapidly in a  nimble and a fast way.  </p><p>  HARLOW:  Do you think that especially the millennial generation is  focused on what a company they are possibly going to work for actually  stands for?  Where they stand on gun rights, where they stand on gay  marriage - issues like that?  Do you believe people are now considering  that before they take a job?  </p><p>  NANTERME:  I'm sure they are, and at Accenture this year we're going  to work with 95,000 people.  But I think we have a great experience on  recruiting people, attracting people, but as well reading their minds, if  you will - understanding their motivation.  We're working on this every  minute of every day.  </p><p>  Again, they want to come and work for a company with a purpose, they  want to fulfill a goal which is going far beyond career and very  importantly they want to make a contribution and it's going to be very  important for companies like us to provide an environment which could  fulfilling that goal.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  [16:55:13] HARLOW:  In a moment here on \"Quest Means Business,\" if you  missed out on tickets to the Mayweather versus Pacquiao huge boxing match  coming up, we have your solution.  I'll tell you what it is next.  </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  HARLOW:  So if you cannot afford the heavyweight prices like most of  us for next week's hugely-anticipated boxing match, we've got a way you  still might be able to see Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in person. </p><p>  In an unusual step for a boxing match, tickets for the prefight weigh- in - those just went on sale, the price obviously much more affordable than  the fight itself.  They're just ten bucks.  Promoters say proceeds from the  weigh-in tickets will be donated to charity.  </p><p>  This comes after tickets for the fight itself sold out in about one  minute on Thursday.  The cheapest seat you can find on the secondary market  for the fight -- $5,000.  Some of those floor seats went for up to $50,000.  </p><p>  All the hype about this fight has done wonders for Johnny Dagami's  profile.  He is a former factory worker in the Philippines who just happens  to look exactly like Manny Pacquiao.  Now, he's even found someone to dress  up as Pacquiao's trainer and he says they're going to take their show on  the road.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>  ROMEO JAMERO, FREDDIE ROACH IMPERSONATOR:  We've become a duo - you  know, duo?  Seeing comedian.  What is that?  I told (ph) practice (ph)  training Cantanny (ph) Manny and then the comedy Freddie (ph) to any kind  of a stage.  </p><p>  HARLOW:  So I think if Pacquiao wins, he needs to give half of his  winnings to that guy.  All right, that is \"Quest Means Business.\"  Thanks  so much for being with us this Friday evening.  I'm Poppy Harlow in New  York.  The CNN U.K. election debate is next.  Stay right here.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2015 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

The Dow might have barely eked out a gain, but the NASDAQ is at a new all-time high. It is Friday, the 24th of April.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Getting away from it all -- the tax, the regulation, all of that uncertainty over Europe --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(AUDIO GAP)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: -- to distress from Apple.</p><p/><p>I'm Poppy Harlow and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p/><p>Good evening and welcome to the program. Tonight, one of the world's biggest banks is threatening to leave British shores and leave a political hornets' nest behind it. HSBC is blaming tough regulation, uncertainty over UK -- over the UK's future in the European Union as the two driving factors for this</p><p/><p>You are looking at footage of the banking giant's current headquarters at London's Canary Wharf. It is HSBC's biggest office in the world, and that means thousands upon thousands of jobs.</p><p/><p>An obvious choice for a new headquarters would be, of course, Hong Kong, where HSBC already has a very strong presence. And Hong Kong's monetary authority says it, of course, would welcome the bank with open arms. After all, that is what the H stands for in HSBC.</p><p/><p>The bank moved from Hong Kong to the UK as its headquarters back in 1993. Now, the bank's chairman, Douglas Flint, has real concerns over changes in regulations in the UK since the financial crisis. Also, HSBC cannot sidestep fears over the uncertainty that lies ahead for Britain and its place within the European Union.</p><p/><p>With a general election less than two weeks away, this announcement has become highly, highly political. The leaders of Britain's two main parties have been trading insults as to who is to blame for HSBC potentially wanting to just walk away.</p><p/><p>The Labour Party argues that businesses like HSBC are scared of the Conservatives' promise to offer up a referendum on the future of Britain in the EU.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>ED MILIBAND, LABOUR PARTY LEADER: I think the intervention from HSBC is very significant today. They say it's a number one economic uncertainty that our country faces, withdrawal from the European Union. This does go to a question of priorities and what is the in the interests of our country.</p><p/><p>I think the last thing our country needs is two years of an internal debate about whether we should leave the European Union or not, but that isn't what I want to happen.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: But Conservatives point out it isn't only Europe that HSBC is worried about. <person><nameText>Prime Minister David Cameron </nameText></person>says regulation is the key concern for the banking giant. He argues banks would be worse off under a Labour government.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>DAVID CAMERON, PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN: Well, London is, I think the world's leading financial center. We've improved London as a financial center not least by changing the way we regulate banks so that we wouldn't have to bail them out with taxpayers' money in future, as the last Labour government had to do.</p><p/><p>But it is an important reminder of how vital it is that we keep a pro- enterprise, pro-business, pro-employment policy in our country, of keeping taxes low, making us an attractive place to invest.</p><p/><p>And all the time I've been prime minister, that is what we've been doing, which is why we see record levels of inward investment coming here to Britain. We must keep on that approach and not put it at risk.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: And I've been speaking with Britain's shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, who is in full-swing election mode. I started by asking him about those regulations that are causing so much head-shaking in the halls of HSBC and Britain's corridors of power. He was very keen to discuss the views of the HSBC chairman.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>CHUKA UMUNNA, UK SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY: Well actually, the statement that Douglas Flint read out at the annual general meeting there was actually very candid. He acknowledged that there were major reputational issues for his own bank coming out of recent revelations into the activities of the Swiss arm, the Swiss private bank.</p><p/><p>But he also acknowledged some of the major problems that were exposed in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, 9, and some of those have still been carrying to recently, with the ethics scandal and, of course, libor rigging before that. And there was a general acknowledgment in his comments that the center needed to get its own house in order, and that the regulatory environment needed to be improved.</p><p/><p>So, it wasn't actually in that sense so critical of the reforms as really just saying given that those reforms have happened and the field on which we're playing has slightly altered, of course you take stock, and I don't think that's unreasonable.</p><p/><p>[16:04:55] HARLOW: Well, let me point this out: he did make very clear that the bank believes that the levies that it pays are too high in the UK, right? Looking at last year alone, HSBC paid the government the highest levy of $1.1 billion and said 58 percent of that charge did not relate to the UK banking activities of the bank.</p><p/><p>UMUNNA: Well, I think that we have global banks here. The global financial crash cost the UK around 1.3 trillion pounds. I don't think in that context it is unreasonable to ask those in the sector to pay a bit of a bigger contribution into the UK exchequer.</p><p/><p>Now, I accept -- I can hear, maybe, there'll be market makers and others watching this program who will say, well, look, HSBC didn't take public funds in the way that the Royal Bank of Scotland did, or Lloyd's Banking Group did. That's true.</p><p/><p>But they did benefit from the measures that the UK government -- and of course, the US and others took measures, too -- took to prevent the entire system collapsing upon itself. And of course, HSBC would have benefited from that, too.</p><p/><p>So, I don't think it is unreasonable to ask for these universal and other investment banks to make a bit of a bigger contribution.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: But here's the thing: 80 percent of HSBC's profit in 2014 came from Asia, 80 percent of that $12 billion. And when you look at how these levies are decided on, they're decided on the size of the balance sheets.</p><p/><p>So, does HSBC have a point there that it wants less cumbersome, as it would call them, levies and regulation? And you've got Conservatives who would say, look, it's the Labour Party who's actually planning to regulate these banks even further.</p><p/><p>UMUNNA: Well, here's the thing: there is consensus on the need to tighten up regulation. And in fact, in terms of the bank levy, that was actually introduced by a Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne. So, there is a degree of political consensus on that in the UK.</p><p/><p>But hey, look, if I was the chairman of a big universal banking corporation like HSBC, of course you're not going to be arguing A, for the institution of a levy, or B for it to be increased. Of course you're going to argue for it to be reduced. In some senses, that is what your shareholders would have expected of you.</p><p/><p>But we as policymakers have to weigh all the different interests in society and ensure we've got a policy matrix that works for everyone and not just a few people.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Let's discuss the political row in the UK over HSBC with Gillian Tett. She's the US managing editor of the \"Financial Times.\" She joins me live right here in New York City. Thank you so much for being with me. I appreciate it. It is good to have you on the program. And let's be --</p><p/><p>GILLIAN TETT, US MANAGING EDITOR, \"FINANCIAL TIMES\": Great to be here.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Let's begin with this. We have heard, look, clearly he was in full election mode. You hear it from Labour, you hear it from Conservatives so close to the election. But who do you think has a stronger argument at this point in time when it comes to HSBC and why they're threatening to leave.</p><p/><p>TETT: Well, I think the reality is that HSBC is engaged in saber- rattling right now. That's how we described it in the \"Financial Times\" tonight. And it is not the first time that HSBC has dropped these hints. It's indicated that it's pretty unhappy about the regulatory climate over and over again.</p><p/><p>But it also has a business reason for wanting to look further east, which is that most Western markets are pretty mature. Asia is really where the growth is. So, it has made these hints before. It's been very clever in terms of blaming both the European issue and the tax issue --</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p/><p>TETT: -- equally, so it managed to steer a line between the two sides. But you just have to look at one number, which is 750 million. That's the amount of eventually extra tax that HSBC had to pay last year because of the one-off bank levy. And that's a very large number. And there was a feeling that the governments are clamping down too aggressively on banks.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: It's a very important point, because when you look at the levy that they paid last year, something like $1.1 billion based on the size of their balance sheet, but 80 percent of their profit came from Asia.</p><p/><p>So -- but clearly they haven't made up their mind, because if HSBC had made up its mind, they wouldn't even need to threaten. Do you see this as a threat to get the government to back away from some of these regulations?</p><p/><p>TETT: Absolutely it's a threat. It's also an attempt to show shareholders that they're not being negligent by ignoring these costs. The 750 million figure I cited was 750 million pounds sterling.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p/><p>TETT: Which is a big number for a levy to be actually imposed on a bank. And what really concerns HSBC and many of its shareholders is that although this was originally presented as a one-off measure, the government's now indicating it may anything but. So, they're looking potentially a long regulatory tunnel.</p><p/><p>The problem, though, is that if HSBC was to move to Hong Kong, while the Hong Kong regulators are pretty widely respected around the world and by many HSBC shareholders, having China as, essentially, the dominant power overseeing you potentially in the future is not something that many shareholders would be very excited about.</p><p/><p>[16:10:03] So, it's a lot of saber-rattling right now. Who knows whether it will actually lead to anything concrete?</p><p/><p>HARLOW: That's a very important point you make, and certainly one they're considering in the C Suite at HSBC.</p><p/><p>Let me ask you this: looking outside of HSBC at other big banks that call London their headquarters, at least in Europe, do you believe that they are more concerned right now about the levies they're paying because of this increased regulation or possibly more regulation coming from the Labour Party if they win, if you listen to the Conservatives.</p><p/><p>Or do you think that they are really unnerved by the uncertainty of the UK's position within Europe as a whole?</p><p/><p>TETT: Well, there are two things to notice here. The first thing, as far as the banks are concerned, right now -- and I was talking to a senior banker the other day -- what's going on is really not a beauty contest in geographical terms, in terms of different centers competing for bank business.</p><p/><p>It's more like an ugly contest. Where is the worst of all worlds or the worst possible place to be? Because there are big problems in the UK right now with London, as far as the banks are concerned. But New York is not entirely welcoming either. And while Switzerland or Singapore might have some advantages, they also have big drawbacks, too.</p><p/><p>So, the banks are thinking hard about geographical location. The other big question, though, is London as a haven or a center for the internationally-mobile elite. Because the Labour government has indicated that it does plan to crack down quite strongly on those internationally- mobile wealthy people. And that in many ways is an even bigger reason for banks like HSBC to be rethinking where they're based.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Gillian Tett, US managing editor for the \"Financial Times,\" joining us this Friday evening. Thank you so much, we appreciate it.</p><p/><p>TETT: Thank you.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: European indexes were up Friday, finishing the week with gains. Markets backed off from those midweek highs that we saw after inconclusive talks, to say the least, about Greece.</p><p/><p>In Athens, Greek stocks rose more than 3 percent on hopes of positive talks between Merkel and Tsipras. Meanwhile, HSBC shares are up nearly 3 percent.</p><p/><p>US markets closed the day higher. The Dow posted a modest gain. The NASDAQ -- the NASDAQ is what it is all about, hitting an all-time record high. CNN Money's Paul La Monica here to talk with us about it. The NASDAQ is on fire. Not only a 15-year-high, as we were saying yesterday, but an all-time high.</p><p/><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: All-time high was briefly above 5100 this morning and it didn't close above that. So, we're still waiting for it to get that intra-day record of 5132, March of 2000. Good chance we'll probably get there sometime soon the way these earnings have been.</p><p/><p>You had strong results from Amazon and Microsoft. They really led the way. Amazon was up 14 percent today, all-time high. Microsoft up 10.5 percent. Google was the laggard, it was only up 3 percent.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: And we have Apple coming Monday?</p><p/><p>LA MONICA: We have Apple coming Monday after the bell. That is obviously the next big tech stock to be reporting, and the next big test, I think, for the NASDAQ. Clearly, a lot of high expectations for Apple.</p><p/><p>All the hype about the watch, but that just went on sale, so we're not going to get any numbers about that yet, but iPhone sales will probably be big again.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Yes. And we'll talk about the Apple Watch a little bit later in the program. Have a great weekend, Paul La Monica.</p><p/><p>LA MONICA: Thank you, Poppy, you, too.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: And thank you so much.</p><p/><p>Well, talks to resolve Greece's debt troubled and with no progress. Not only that, but officials have heaped criticism on the Greek finance minister. We'll discuss, next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[16:15:03] HARLOW: Talks to resolve Greece's economic future have ended with really no progress at all. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis met with eurozone finance ministers this week. Eurozone officials are reportedly very critical of him, calling him a, quote, \"time- waster\" and a \"gambler.\"</p><p/><p>Varoufakis, on the other hand, said the talks are actually going pretty well and making progress. So, where's the disconnect? The head of the eurogroup said that things did not end so well.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JEROEN DIJSSELBLOEM, PRESIDENT OF THE EUROGROUP: It was a very critical discussion. We came to an agreement two months ago, and today, of course, we had hoped to hear a positive results and an agreement on which we could then take a decision. And we are still far from that. So, yes, it was a very critical discussion.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: And European officials now say time is, indeed, running out for Greece. There are three key issues that Varoufakis is supposedly gambling on. The first, the Greek budget. Europe has set various budget targets in exchange for bailout money, but Varoufakis says Greece cannot be expected to meet them all because all the austerity is making the economy too weak.</p><p/><p>Europe agreed back in February that the bailout deal could be rejiggered, basically, but won't make any promises until the next issue is sorted. And that is Greece's reform program. Europe doesn't just want budget cuts, it also wants long-lasting structural reforms on things like taxation and corruption in Greece.</p><p/><p>Right now, it says it simply is not seeing enough progress on that front, and until it's happy with Greece's overall plan, it will not hand over any more bailout money.</p><p/><p>And that brings us to the biggest problem of all, Greek funding. The current bailout money stops flowing at the end of June. Beyond that, there is no guarantee that Greece can pay all of its bills, and it has $4 billion worth of payments that are due in June.</p><p/><p>Before Varoufakis was finance minister, he was an academic specializing in game theory. Our Clare Sebastian looks at how this strategy can shed light on the negotiations.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER (voice-over): At the heart of game theory, conflict, cooperation, and eventually, a mathematical solution. At least, that's how it works in theory.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For Greece, there is certainty --</p><p/><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was still no firm common ground.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But it can't possibly be business as usual in Greece.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN: In 2004, the now Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, published this academic text on game theory. His co-author was Shaun Hargreaves Heap.</p><p/><p>SHAUN HARGREAVES HEAP, CO-AUTHOR, \"GAME THEORY: A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION\": Marketing games of the sort that Yanis and the Greek government are involved in don't have unique solutions in that sense.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN: Hargreaves Heap says that while game theory won't solve the Greek crisis, it does offer some useful principles.</p><p/><p>HARGREAVES HEAP: Where there is a genuine, as it were, insight from game theory, notes the people who are likely to concede the most in a negotiation are those who have the most to fear from if you fail to make the agreement.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN: In the case of Greece and Europe, both sides have plenty to fear if Greece defaults and leaves the eurozone. And both are putting on an optimistic face.</p><p/><p>DIJSSELBLOEM: Grexit is simply not on the table, it's not discussed.</p><p/><p>VAROUFAKIS: We are intent --</p><p/><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p/><p>VAROUFAKIS: -- people.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN: Game theory is about principles, not specifics. Solving the Greek crisis requires both.</p><p/><p>HARGREAVES HEAP: What the terms of the agreement are, games theory doesn't tell us what it should be. But what they say is both sides will be -- both lose if they leave the table with the cake still on it, because they've failed to agree how to cut it up.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN: One thing we do know, it will test even the most experienced of game theorists.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): What was he like as a thinker? What was your experience working with him?</p><p/><p>HARGREAVES HEAP: He was lots of fun to work with. We had lots of good arguments, lots of good discussions. We're both academics who believe in the positive value of dispute.</p><p/><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: With cash running out, the Greek government has issued an emergency decree asking state agencies and municipal coffers to hand over their reserves. I spoke with the mayor of Athens, George Kaminis, about how local governments and the public are responding.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>GEORGE KAMINIS, MAYOR OF ATHENS: Well, things all those last years have been very bad for my country. OK that today's meeting was a disappointment, let's say. But we are still confident, and I'm optimistic. I firmly believe that we're going to arrive to an agreement with the European Union.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: What makes you so confident? Because as the weeks go by, I think more and more people think that a Greek exit could happen.</p><p/><p>[16:19:57] KAMINIS: There's a very solid basis to be confident in that 80 percent of Greek people, they want to remain in the euro, they want our country in the European Union. We belong to the court of the European Union, and those people are determined to work for that.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: You have been the mayor of Athens for nearly five years, now --</p><p/><p>KAMINIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: -- since 2010. Can you give me a sense of what it is like day-to-day for the average citizen living there? Just their concern level and the real-world impact on them?</p><p/><p>KAMINIS: Of course, it's for many people, not only marginalized people, as it was in the past, many people who used to have their jobs only a few months ago, they are in difficulty, very severe difficulties.</p><p/><p>But at the same time, there are people who are like tourists, who arrive in Athens. They stay for a week, and they say, where is the crisis? Because it's a lovely city, a vibrant --</p><p/><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p/><p>KAMINIS: At night, the capacity restaurants are full with people. You don't realize very well if you remain as a tourist.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: And I understand that, and I understand you want the tourism to continue, as it has. It's very important for the economy, but --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>KAMINIS: And this year, we have a new record on tourism arrivals.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: But for the people, the people of your city, of Athens, you still have 26 percent unemployment. How are they getting by?</p><p/><p>KAMINIS: Well, in a great difficulty and among young people, it's almost 60 percent.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p/><p>KAMINIS: So, that is one supplementary or even the most important reason to insist on remaining in the eurozone, and we have to foster entrepreneurship, create new business and create jobs for the people.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: So it's not -- it sounds like it's not necessarily about bringing the old jobs back. You're talking about entrepreneurship, starting new businesses, opening new doors for citizens.</p><p/><p>KAMINIS: Oh, yes, of course. We have to modernize the economy. Because for so many years, things didn't go well, but we used to live well on the loans, on the bank loans. Now, we are facing the reality, and the reality can be very, very cruel. So, we have be innovative in every, every aspect.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Well, the Apple Watch makes its first highly-anticipated appearance in select stores worldwide, and guess who has one. Our Samuel Burke got his hands on one. We'll show you the goods next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Apple Watches made their debut on store shelves, but do not try to buy the new smart watch in the Apple Store. They will be on display there, but just a handful of high-end shops around the world are selling the device for now. CNN technology correspondent Samuel Burke somehow got one -- why am I not surprised you got one --</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: -- some way, somehow? -- and has an assessment. How does it feel? How does it operate? Do you like it?</p><p/><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Right away when I put it on, I liked the feel of it. If you want to get a lot of \"likes\" on Facebook, take a picture with an Apple Watch. Everywhere I'm going, everybody wants to see it. People are looking at it, they want to just view it.</p><p/><p>It was pretty easy to use, not quite as intuitive as an iPhone. But one thing that I already don't like about it is the audio quality. Because don't forget, you can actually make phone calls on this thing.</p><p/><p>And so, someone called me, and I was listening to it, and I almost had to kind of put my ear up to it to be able to hear, and it's not -- I think they tried to make it so it wasn't loud enough to disturb my colleagues, but I just couldn't hear from it.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Can you show me, how would you make a -- put it up to your ear, is that how you would do it? You have to put it all the way up to your ear?</p><p/><p>[16:25:03] BURKE: In theory. Right now, I'm just clicking the CNN app, because I still don't quite remember the phone call app. So, I just want to show off the CNN app for company's sake. But someone calls you, you just click a button, and you should -- they want you to be able to hear like this, just from the way I'm sitting right now.</p><p/><p>But I actually couldn't hear, so I kind of had to do this type of thing to hear it. And even then, the audio quality wasn't great.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p/><p>BURKE: So --</p><p/><p>HARLOW: All right.</p><p/><p>BURKE: -- hold off, use your iPhone for the phone calls for now.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p/><p>BURKE: This is the $400 model.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Pretty snazzy. Oh, that's not the $17,000 model? I was wondering which one.</p><p/><p>BURKE: I decided to keep that at home.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: I was wondering which one you had. Samuel Burke, have a great weekend. Thank you so much.</p><p/><p>Well, the much-anticipated smart watch poses a big threat, frankly, to Switzerland's age-old watch industry. That is according to Elmar Mock, who helped revive the business as co-inventor of Swatch. He joins me now from Switzerland. Thank you for being with me, sir. I appreciate it.</p><p/><p>ELMAR MOCK, CO-INVENTOR, SWATCH: Hello.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Hello. Let's begin with this. Your initial assessment of the Apple Watch. How much do you think the traditional watch industry should be worried?</p><p/><p>MOCK: I think it's a fantastic opportunity also for the normal watch industry who meets a new world which opened now, and they are going in the right direction. So, I appreciate very much the Apple Watch. And I think it's a chance for the watch industry to also join this movement.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: But can Swiss watchmakers who are putting out their own smart watches, do you think they can compete with the technology of the Apple smart watch?</p><p/><p>MOCK: It will not be exactly the same technology. But I think they can seriously compete. So, I think it's really an opportunity, and they have a solution, and I know a solution.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Think about the Apple Watch, I think about charging it. Because you do, you have to plug it in, you have to charge it. Do you people -- think people are going to want to take their watch off at night and charge it like their phone?</p><p/><p>MOCK: I think the functions are really great, and I think it makes life also easier. So why don't charge during the night? I think we charge also our phone. For ten years ago, I was charging my phone every week. Now I have to charge it every night.</p><p/><p>I don't say that is the only way, but I don't think it's very great. I may be more afraid about the fact that she's not tight today. But I think that she will become more and more better. So, we have a chance, and it's the first one, and they will have other ones, and it's really going in the right direction.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: It's interesting. You've said that Apple will really hurt companies operating at the mid-price level, like a Swatch, for example, right? So this initial one is below $400, they go all the way up to $17,000. I wonder if you think, though, Apple is maybe making a mistake trying to compete at the high end with those high-end watches?</p><p/><p>MOCK: I don't think they've made a mistake. I'm not sure that the really high-end are affected. But the middle range, of course they are affected. You must imagine that Apple and the other competition -- I think, Samsung is at present, (inaudible) are present, Sony also. So, I think they will be maybe 50 million pieces a year who will be sold out through this new channel.</p><p/><p>What is fantastic, it's also a new distribution. It's a new way to go on the market. I think it's a fantastic opportunity, and these 50 million watches who are sold out sell with this price. It will compete with the middle segment, of course. But it's not -- every competition is also something very healthy.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: How many people, sir, do you believe are going to make the mistake of getting in the shower with their Apple Watch on?</p><p/><p>MOCK: A lot. A lot, of course.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>MOCK: That they will recognize they made a mistake. I was also wearing some electronic item with me, and I will go in under the shower. So, it's -- you make it once or twice, and after, you can make progress yourself. Of course, waterproof will have to become once.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p/><p>MOCK: But if your life is coming easier, and if you have pleasure with this product, you will also accept a little bit of disadvantage. But of course that will change.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: I am certainly fascinated by it and can't wait to try one myself. Thank you so much for joining us. Especially as a Swatch fan, I appreciate all you've done for the watch industry. Sir, have a wonderful weekend.</p><p/><p>MOCK: OK, thank you very much, and have a good time, too.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Thank you.</p><p/><p>Well, switching gears here. It has now been two years to the day since that horrific, horrific factory collapse in Bangladesh where 1100 people were killed, thousands more injured. We're going to find out if workers' conditions have improved.</p><p/><p>[16:29:42] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[16:32:00] HARLOW: Hello, I'm Poppy Harlow. Coming up on the next half hour of \"Quest Means Business,\" The CEO of Heathrow Airport tells me what he's hoping to see from the upcoming U.K. election.</p><p/><p>Also, two years ago since the Rana Plaza building collapsed, how much is really changed for Bangladesh's factory workers?</p><p/><p>Before that though, here are your top business headlines this hour.</p><p/><p>Armenia is marking 100 years since the mass killings of Armenians during the First World War. Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Francois Hollande condemned the deaths at a ceremony today. But the issue remains politically sensitive as Turkey and others insist that the killings should not be considered genocide as Armenians considers them.</p><p/><p>In Italy, authorities say that they have broken up a terror cell with links to al-Qaeda, and the Vatican may have been one of its targets. At least nine people have been arrested. Some of the 18 suspects are accused of involvement in a bombing in Pakistan that left more than 300 people dead or wounded.</p><p/><p>Authorities say they expect more activity from a volcano in Chile. This coming in the coming hours. Calbuco has already erupted twice this week, spewing some 60 centimeters of ash in some places. Some 4,500 people have now had to evacuate the region. The ash has now spread to neighboring Argentina which is not surprising considering Chile's slender geography. Look at those images - wow.</p><p/><p>And the captain of a migrant boat that capsized in the Mediterranean last weekend has appeared in court. The 27-year-old Tunisia national is accused of causing the tragedy that killed hundreds. He has been detained and he has been - he has denied being in charge of that vessel.</p><p/><p>It has been two years since the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh. More than 1,100 people lost their lives that day when the eight-story building collapsed. It was the deadliest disaster the world's garment industry has ever seen and it sparked outrage about dangerous conditions for hundreds and hundreds of workers.</p><p/><p>Since the collapse, brands and retailers have contributed millions of dollars to a compensation fund for injured workers and their families. Still, campaigners say much more needs to be done. Maggie Lake reports.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>MAGGIE LAKE, BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL: More than 1,100 people dead, thousands injured, livelihoods destroyed. Two years after the Rana Plaza disaster, the wounds are still not healed. And despite stepped-up inspections, rights groups say conditions in many Bangladesh factories remain perilous.</p><p/><p>[16:35:01] JOHN SIFTON, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: There could another Rana Plaza tomorrow. It's less likely, but it's still possible.</p><p/><p>The residential buildings have been converted into factories. A lot of them have had floors added - they're very unsafe.</p><p/><p>MAGGIE LAKE, BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL: Today there is only rubble where Rana Plaza once stood amid a continued push to win more compensation for disaster victims. More than two dozen Western clothing brands including Benetton, Children's Place, The Gap and Walmart have paid some $24 million to a compensation fund.</p><p/><p>But labor groups say brands collectively must to more. The needs of former Rana Plaza workers are just too great</p><p/><p>ABBY MCGILL, INTERNATIONAL LABOR RIGHTS FORUM: This tragedy has left very severe physical and psychological wounds on many of the people who survived it. And it's making it difficult for those people to find jobs.</p><p/><p>LAKE: Aid groups hope to raise at least $30 million from these brands which used contractors based in Rana Plaza to manufacture clothes. Human rights officials say brands must use their influence because garment (AUDIO GAP) stilled denied basic rights that could save lives.</p><p/><p>SIFTON: We're simply asking the Bangladesh government to allow them to organize in the union so that they can address their grievances to factory owners. The brands could do a big thing by simply telling the Bangladeshi government to make that a reality.</p><p/><p>LAKE: But as pressure to hold down clothing costs persists, labor groups fear new disasters to come.</p><p/><p>MCGILL: Western retailers and brands are setting prices for clothing that squeeze the producers in developing countries to the point where these kinds of accidents are absolutely inevitable.</p><p/><p>LAKE: On the second anniversary of the worst workplace disaster in modern history, (AUDIO GAP) in Bangladesh remains intense. Maggie Lake, CNNNew York.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Well the Bangladesh ambassador to the United Nations says Western companies and consumers have to be willing to pay a little bit more to benefit the workers and clearly to keep them safe. Last week Richard asked him if the situation has even improved.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>ABDUL MOMEN, BANGLADESH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: There has been short-term, medium-term, long-term efforts. The government was - it is a wakening call. Whole nation get into it. This shows -- this what I'll talk to you -this shows one thing - that if people are committed and partners also help, we can achieve goals and we did.</p><p/><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW: Buy no one doubts that people have got desires and goodwill to do it. The question is whether or not government has the wherewithal to enforce it and private industry now is determined to spend the money and invest?</p><p/><p>MOMEN: Yes, see the government has imposed so many new rules. For example, we had only five - only few numbers - counted number inspectors. Now we have almost 300 inspectors and we increased the bill - government has increased the budget for it - 300 times.</p><p/><p>Now do our workers they paid law (ph)? Well, we have increased 219 percent. There are 3,200 factories, more than half has been inspected. And not by government alone -- it by Western countries, the supplier and buyers - both Accord and Alliance -- and out of those they have done almost 1,800 inspections. Out of that only 2 percent appeared to be non- (inaudible) and they're closed down.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Right. Now do you think that although there's obviously work to be done from the Bangladeshi side, does the consumer in the West has to recognize they have to pay more? Because obviously if the downward price pressure comes, it's going to hit at the weakest point, which is the laborer in the factory in Bangladesh.</p><p/><p>MOMEN: I agree with you. This is an area we have not achieved much. We hope that because this wait is very long, companies increased 219 percent and the varieties of instruments. But we expected that the global community will rise to the occasions and they will pay extra few cents so that, you know, those people who suffers most, they could be benefitting.</p><p/><p>QUEST: So who needs to do more?</p><p/><p>MOMEN: I think we have to do a more job (ph) in the sense that we have to create a global consciousness that we must help together.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Oh, that's easy to same, Ambassador, but tell me in practical terms - do the companies - the H&amp;Ms, the Prime Arts, the stores - do they need to charge consumers more so they can pay more?</p><p/><p>MOMEN: I think they make enormous amount of profit as you know. One tie to do in Bangladesh, it costs - you can buy it, let's say, $1.00. But when they sell it here, it's $75.00. The marketeers they're making all the profit - huge corporate profit. So I think these big companies should come forward and pay a little extra. I' m not asking for too much - little extra - 25 cents, 50 cents. It can do magic for all.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>[16:40:11] HARLOW: Jryki Raine is the general secretary for IndustriaLL Global Union. He joins me now from Geneva. Thank you for being with me this evening, sir. We just heard what he said - that people will pay more - saying the global community will rise to the occasion, they will pay more.</p><p/><p>Maybe, maybe I'm a skeptic but I'm not so sure about that. Are you?</p><p/><p>JRYKI RAINE, GENERAL SECRETARY, INDUSTRIALL GLOBAL UNION: No, not at all, Poppy. In Australia in a poll, 80 percent of the respondents said that they are prepared to pay more for their clothes if they know that they are made in decent conditions with living wages and safe work places which are still not the case today.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: So they will. I'm very glad to hear that. I would hope that it would play out like that in practice. When you look at more than 1,100 people died - thousands were injured in that collapse.</p><p/><p>When you look at some of these companies that your union has called out and called on a collective responsibility for brands like Benetton, Mango, Walmart, Carrefour to contribute more. Why specifically call out those companies?</p><p/><p>RAINE: Because we feel that the brands who are producing in Bangladesh, they share a collective responsibility of profoundly flawed production model which was not safe, it was not sustainable. The good news today is that we are only $2.7 million short of the $30 million target in the compensation fund which is defined by the ILO experts. So now it's the time for the brands to do the right thing and close one of the most shameful chapters in the history of the global garment industry.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Well especially when you think about how much money these corporations bring in, you have three and a half million people in Bangladesh that work in the garment industry. The minimum wage that they are paid is about 25 pounds a month. Why do you think it is that we haven't seen an improvement on that front in terms of the wage front to where it needs to be, which is about double that just for a living wage?</p><p/><p>RAINE: Well the reality is that the minimum wage in Bangladesh is $68 a month and that is the reason why all the workers are working at least 60 hours a week. It's a question of pressure, Poppy. So now IndustriALL, Unit (ph) and the Clean Clothes Campaign have been campaigning for a living wage.</p><p/><p>So my challenge tonight is to H&amp;M, to Zara, to Walmart and to Gap to work together within IndustriALL. Let's go to Bangladesh, let's go to Cambodia, let's put in place bargaining structures where the brands also pay a bit more to enable living wages for all these millions of workers.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: You have said that not a single factory can be called 100 percent safe yet. And some companies have responded that - like Disney right after the collapse pulling out completely. Others would say that is not the answer because then the jobs go away.</p><p/><p>RAINE: And that is also our line. And Bangladesh is a poor developing country. They desperately need these millions of jobs for the workers. But they have to be sustainable jobs with living wages safe conditions and reasonable working hours.</p><p/><p>We know that these brands were making tens of billions of dollars of profit every year can afford to pay a bit more to the factory owners and be part of the solutions where we make sure that part of that price also goes to the workers. So that is something that we want to work together with the brands.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Jyrki Raine live with us in Geneva this evening. Thank you, sir, for being with us and for the important work you're doing. We appreciate it very much. Quick break - we're back in a minute.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[16:46:13] HARLOW: \"We will work with all parties. We will work with any government.\" That is a declaration from the chief executive of Heathrow Airport not far from London. John Holland-Kaye spoke with me a short time ago and covered plenty of ground from the contentious third runway proposal to Heathrow's strong results.</p><p/><p>Airport revenues and passenger traffic were up in the first quarter of this year. Passengers voted Heathrow the best airport in Western Europe. But the first question I asked him has to do with the upcoming U.K. election and whether he's concerned Britain may eventually leave the European Union.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>JOHN HOLLAND-KAYE, CEO, HEATHROW AIRPORT HOLDINGS: I think we have many benefits that come from membership with the European Union just within the aviation sector. We can see the growth that has been in low-cost carriers through the easy access they have to European markets.</p><p/><p>That's benefitted all consumers and businesses and I think that's something that we should protect. And in the future we're going to see a new single European sky coming in which reduce emissions, reduce costs, it'll allow more capacity on the air roofs that's so vital to trading around the world and that's a real benefit to being part of the E.U. So I hope we won't make it a hasty decision on this. We do need certainty for business so that we can investments.</p><p/><p>I think that Heathrow is not going to change things, particularly we're a very successful and stable business. We have a good international base, we have over 80 carriers from all over the world flying into Heathrow. So we will continue to do well, regardless of the decision. But there are many benefits from being part of the European Union.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: What's driving the traffic increase? Is this more of your traditional carriers or is this about new carriers that are popping up and benefiting from lower oil prices and just bringing in more capacity, more travelers?</p><p/><p>KAYE: Well at Heathrow we are operating at capacity. We can't have any more flights coming in and out. So what we're seeing is more routes being introduced by largely existing carriers to the growth markets of the world. So since last year we've had Avianca flying to Bogota in Colombia. That's a route that's doling very well.</p><p/><p>We just had Vietnam Airlines start a new service. They've moved up from Gatwick flying to Vietnam. That's a really important service to one of the highest-growing markets in the world.</p><p/><p>So we're seeing that happening. We're also seeing carriers putting on more seats to European markets. So BA's been very busy and we're seeing a lot more transfer passengers coming through Heathrow.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Heathrow is trying to persuade regulators to allow Heathrow to build a third runway. How is that going? Where does it stand?</p><p/><p>KAYE: Well it's going very well in terms of winning support for expansion at Heathrow. I think it's been clear for a long time that Heathrow is the best solution economically. We'll create 180,000 jobs in the U.K. all across the country -- over 200 billion pounds for the British economy.</p><p/><p>But we're also seeing growing support locally because people want the jobs that will come - 40,000 jobs for local communities, tackling youth unemployment. That's a really big price.</p><p/><p>But we've also been listening to the local community and we've announced a big noise insulation program which will be world leading -- 160,000 homes and schools being insulated from noise and that means that more people are now saying Heathrow's the right solution - it can be delivered sustainably, it can be delivered within climate targets with lower emissions and Heathrow's the right answer for the local communities and the right solution nationally.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Well the U.S. secretary of defense has launched a national security initiative in Silicon Valley. We'll tell you more about that next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>[16:51:20:] The U.S. Department of Defense is partnering with tech companies to boost its capability to fight cybercrime. Video (ph) D (ph) aims to harness the latest innovations to fight cyberattacks, secure its networks and support military operations.</p><p/><p>Well the U.S. defense secretary was in Silicon Valley on Friday as part of a two-day visit to try to woo some of those executives in Silicon Valley.</p><p/><p>I spoke with the CEO of Accenture, a huge worldwide consulting and technology services firm and I asked him how much the chief executive that he works with are really focusing on cybersecurity and how concerned he is about the threat.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>PIERRE NANTERME, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, ACCENTURE: It is a huge challenge. If you're talking with a CEO, it's clearly security is now in their top three priority concern and challenges that need to get right. And is similar for a company like Accenture, if you will.</p><p/><p>So we're watching all the evolutions from a situated standpoint extremely carefully.</p><p/><p>We are operating in this business and we have a great practice to advise our clients how to deal with security issues, especially around the data privacy, data integrity, data protection and many bills and many regulations as well and policies are figured out around the world in the United States but as well in Europe.</p><p/><p>We are participating to many of the forum in order to create a world which is going to be more secure and where security is going to be center stage.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: You have predicted that a digital revolution is coming in three ways and that this is going to be huge for the way the businesses around the world are run. How is it going to impact them and where is it going to create opportunity?</p><p/><p>NANTERME: I mean it's an amazing revolution we are facing with the digital revolution enabled by what we are calling the Smagda (ph) to show the mobile, the analytic and the Cloud technologies. And indeed the three ways you are referring to are going to be first, the digital consumer with everything (ph) like you know interact between the companies and the consumer.</p><p/><p>The digital enterprise of course -- how you digitalize all the operations of a company, but the most important way in which it's going to start - and it's starting recently - they're about the digital operations, what we are calling the Internet of Things.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: You say these companies need to take risks to be successful. I wonder what you would compare this digital revolution to in past history in terms of big shifts that companies have had to live through and try to thrive through?</p><p/><p>NANTERME: Yes, I mean the common wisdom today is to compare the digital revolution with the electricity. You'll remember this revolution long ago totally changed the way the business operated at the time and I guess it's probably the best proxy for what's happening with the digital -</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p/><p>NANTERME: It's a - it's an incredible rethink in the way you're addressing your client's need and the way you think of your operation, but as well in the way you can create global businesses extremely rapidly in a nimble and a fast way.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: Do you think that especially the millennial generation is focused on what a company they are possibly going to work for actually stands for? Where they stand on gun rights, where they stand on gay marriage - issues like that? Do you believe people are now considering that before they take a job?</p><p/><p>NANTERME: I'm sure they are, and at Accenture this year we're going to work with 95,000 people. But I think we have a great experience on recruiting people, attracting people, but as well reading their minds, if you will - understanding their motivation. We're working on this every minute of every day.</p><p/><p>Again, they want to come and work for a company with a purpose, they want to fulfill a goal which is going far beyond career and very importantly they want to make a contribution and it's going to be very important for companies like us to provide an environment which could fulfilling that goal.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>[16:55:13] HARLOW: In a moment here on \"Quest Means Business,\" if you missed out on tickets to the Mayweather versus Pacquiao huge boxing match coming up, we have your solution. I'll tell you what it is next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>HARLOW: So if you cannot afford the heavyweight prices like most of us for next week's hugely-anticipated boxing match, we've got a way you still might be able to see Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in person.</p><p/><p>In an unusual step for a boxing match, tickets for the prefight weigh- in - those just went on sale, the price obviously much more affordable than the fight itself. They're just ten bucks. Promoters say proceeds from the weigh-in tickets will be donated to charity.</p><p/><p>This comes after tickets for the fight itself sold out in about one minute on Thursday. The cheapest seat you can find on the secondary market for the fight -- $5,000. Some of those floor seats went for up to $50,000.</p><p/><p>All the hype about this fight has done wonders for Johnny Dagami's profile. He is a former factory worker in the Philippines who just happens to look exactly like Manny Pacquiao. Now, he's even found someone to dress up as Pacquiao's trainer and he says they're going to take their show on the road.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>ROMEO JAMERO, FREDDIE ROACH IMPERSONATOR: We've become a duo - you know, duo? Seeing comedian. What is that? I told (ph) practice (ph) training Cantanny (ph) Manny and then the comedy Freddie (ph) to any kind of a stage.</p><p/><p>HARLOW: So I think if Pacquiao wins, he needs to give half of his winnings to that guy. All right, that is \"Quest Means Business.\" Thanks so much for being with us this Friday evening. I'm Poppy Harlow in New York. The CNN U.K. election debate is next.

The Dow might have barely eked  out a gain, but the NASDAQ is at a new all-time high.  It is Friday, the  24th of April.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Getting away from it all -- the tax, the regulation, all of that  uncertainty over Europe --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(AUDIO GAP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARLOW:  -- to distress from Apple.</p><p>I'm Poppy Harlow and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening and welcome to the program.  Tonight, one of the world's  biggest banks is threatening to leave British shores and leave a political  hornets' nest behind it.  HSBC is blaming tough regulation, uncertainty  over UK -- over the UK's future in the European Union as the two driving  factors for this</p><p>You are looking at footage of the banking giant's current headquarters  at London's Canary Wharf.  It is HSBC's biggest office in the world, and  that means thousands upon thousands of jobs.  </p><p>An obvious choice for a new headquarters would be, of course, Hong  Kong, where HSBC already has a very strong presence.  And Hong Kong's  monetary authority says it, of course, would welcome the bank with open  arms.  After all, that is what the H stands for in HSBC.</p><p>The bank moved from Hong Kong to the UK as its headquarters back in  1993.  Now, the bank's chairman, Douglas Flint, has real concerns over  changes in regulations in the UK since the financial crisis.  Also, HSBC  cannot sidestep fears over the uncertainty that lies ahead for Britain and  its place within the European Union.  </p><p>With a general election less than two weeks away, this announcement  has become highly, highly political.  The leaders of Britain's two main  parties have been trading insults as to who is to blame for HSBC  potentially wanting to just walk away.</p><p>The Labour Party argues that businesses like HSBC are scared of the  Conservatives' promise to offer up a referendum on the future of Britain in  the EU.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED MILIBAND, LABOUR PARTY LEADER:  I think the intervention from HSBC  is very significant today.  They say it's a number one economic uncertainty  that our country faces, withdrawal from the European Union.  This does go  to a question of priorities and what is the in the interests of our  country.  </p><p>I think the last thing our country needs is two years of an internal  debate about whether we should leave the European Union or not, but that  isn't what I want to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  But Conservatives point out it isn't only Europe that HSBC is  worried about.  Prime Minister David Cameron says regulation is the key  concern for the banking giant.  He argues banks would be worse off under a  Labour government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID CAMERON, PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN:  Well, London is, I think  the world's leading financial center.  We've improved London as a financial  center not least by changing the way we regulate banks so that we wouldn't  have to bail them out with taxpayers' money in future, as the last Labour  government had to do.  </p><p>But it is an important reminder of how vital it is that we keep a pro- enterprise, pro-business, pro-employment policy in our country, of keeping  taxes low, making us an attractive place to invest.  </p><p>And all the time I've been prime minister, that is what we've been  doing, which is why we see record levels of inward investment coming here  to Britain.  We must keep on that approach and not put it at risk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  And I've been speaking with Britain's shadow business  secretary, Chuka Umunna, who is in full-swing election mode.  I started by  asking him about those regulations that are causing so much head-shaking in  the halls of HSBC and Britain's corridors of power.  He was very keen to  discuss the views of the HSBC chairman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHUKA UMUNNA, UK SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY:  Well actually, the  statement that Douglas Flint read out at the annual general meeting there  was actually very candid.  He acknowledged that there were major  reputational issues for his own bank coming out of recent revelations into  the activities of the Swiss arm, the Swiss private bank.</p><p>But he also acknowledged some of the major problems that were exposed  in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, 9, and some of those  have still been carrying to recently, with the ethics scandal and, of  course, libor rigging before that.  And there was a general acknowledgment  in his comments that the center needed to get its own house in order, and  that the regulatory environment needed to be improved.  </p><p>So, it wasn't actually in that sense so critical of the reforms as  really just saying given that those reforms have happened and the field on  which we're playing has slightly altered, of course you take stock, and I  don't think that's unreasonable.</p><p>[16:04:55]  HARLOW:  Well, let me point this out:  he did make very  clear that the bank believes that the levies that it pays are too high in  the UK, right?  Looking at last year alone, HSBC paid the government the  highest levy of $1.1 billion and said 58 percent of that charge did not  relate to the UK banking activities of the bank.</p><p>UMUNNA:  Well, I think that we have global banks here.  The global  financial crash cost the UK around 1.3 trillion pounds.  I don't think in  that context it is unreasonable to ask those in the sector to pay a bit of  a bigger contribution into the UK exchequer.  </p><p>Now, I accept -- I can hear, maybe, there'll be market makers and  others watching this program who will say, well, look, HSBC didn't take  public funds in the way that the Royal Bank of Scotland did, or Lloyd's  Banking Group did.  That's true.  </p><p>But they did benefit from the measures that the UK government -- and  of course, the US and others took measures, too -- took to prevent the  entire system collapsing upon itself.  And of course, HSBC would have  benefited from that, too.</p><p>So, I don't think it is unreasonable to ask for these universal and  other investment banks to make a bit of a bigger contribution.</p><p>HARLOW:  But here's the thing:  80 percent of HSBC's profit in 2014  came from Asia, 80 percent of that $12 billion.  And when you look at how  these levies are decided on, they're decided on the size of the balance  sheets.  </p><p>So, does HSBC have a point there that it wants less cumbersome, as it  would call them, levies and regulation?  And you've got Conservatives who  would say, look, it's the Labour Party who's actually planning to regulate  these banks even further.</p><p>UMUNNA:  Well, here's the thing:  there is consensus on the need to  tighten up regulation.  And in fact, in terms of the bank levy, that was  actually introduced by a Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, George  Osborne.  So, there is a degree of political consensus on that in the UK.</p><p>But hey, look, if I was the chairman of a big universal banking  corporation like HSBC, of course you're not going to be arguing A, for the  institution of a levy, or B for it to be increased.  Of course you're going  to argue for it to be reduced.  In some senses, that is what your  shareholders would have expected of you.</p><p>But we as policymakers have to weigh all the different interests in  society and ensure we've got a policy matrix that works for everyone and  not just a few people.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW:  Let's discuss the political row in the UK over HSBC with  Gillian Tett.  She's the US managing editor of the \"Financial Times.\"  She  joins me live right here in New York City.  Thank you so much for being  with me.  I appreciate it.  It is good to have you on the program.  And  let's be --</p><p>GILLIAN TETT, US MANAGING EDITOR, \"FINANCIAL TIMES\":  Great to be  here.</p><p>HARLOW:  Let's begin with this.  We have heard, look, clearly he was  in full election mode.  You hear it from Labour, you hear it from  Conservatives so close to the election.  But who do you think has a  stronger argument at this point in time when it comes to HSBC and why  they're threatening to leave.</p><p>TETT:  Well, I think the reality is that HSBC is engaged in saber- rattling right now.  That's how we described it in the \"Financial Times\"  tonight.  And it is not the first time that HSBC has dropped these hints.   It's indicated that it's pretty unhappy about the regulatory climate over  and over again.</p><p>But it also has a business reason for wanting to look further east,  which is that most Western markets are pretty mature.  Asia is really where  the growth is.  So, it has made these hints before.  It's been very clever  in terms of blaming both the European issue and the tax issue --</p><p>HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>TETT:  -- equally, so it managed to steer a line between the two  sides.  But you just have to look at one number, which is 750 million.   That's the amount of eventually extra tax that HSBC had to pay last year  because of the one-off bank levy.  And that's a very large number.  And  there was a feeling that the governments are clamping down too aggressively  on banks.</p><p>HARLOW:  It's a very important point, because when you look at the  levy that they paid last year, something like $1.1 billion based on the  size of their balance sheet, but 80 percent of their profit came from Asia.  </p><p>So -- but clearly they haven't made up their mind, because if HSBC had  made up its mind, they wouldn't even need to threaten.  Do you see this as  a threat to get the government to back away from some of these regulations?</p><p>TETT:  Absolutely it's a threat.  It's also an attempt to show  shareholders that they're not being negligent by ignoring these costs.  The  750 million figure I cited was 750 million pounds sterling.</p><p>HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>TETT:  Which is a big number for a levy to be actually imposed on a  bank.  And what really concerns HSBC and many of its shareholders is that  although this was originally presented as a one-off measure, the  government's now indicating it may anything but.  So, they're looking  potentially a long regulatory tunnel.  </p><p>The problem, though, is that if HSBC was to move to Hong Kong, while  the Hong Kong regulators are pretty widely respected around the world and  by many HSBC shareholders, having China as, essentially, the dominant power  overseeing you potentially in the future is not something that many  shareholders would be very excited about.</p><p>[16:10:03]  So, it's a lot of saber-rattling right now.  Who knows  whether it will actually lead to anything concrete?</p><p>HARLOW:  That's a very important point you make, and certainly one  they're considering in the C Suite at HSBC.  </p><p>Let me ask you this:  looking outside of HSBC at other big banks that  call London their headquarters, at least in Europe, do you believe that  they are more concerned right now about the levies they're paying because  of this increased regulation or possibly more regulation coming from the  Labour Party if they win, if you listen to the Conservatives.</p><p>Or do you think that they are really unnerved by the uncertainty of  the UK's position within Europe as a whole?</p><p>TETT:  Well, there are two things to notice here.  The first thing, as  far as the banks are concerned, right now -- and I was talking to a senior  banker the other day -- what's going on is really not a beauty contest in  geographical terms, in terms of different centers competing for bank  business.</p><p>It's more like an ugly contest.  Where is the worst of all worlds or  the worst possible place to be?  Because there are big problems in the UK  right now with London, as far as the banks are concerned.  But New York is  not entirely welcoming either.  And while Switzerland or Singapore might  have some advantages, they also have big drawbacks, too.</p><p>So, the banks are thinking hard about geographical location.  The  other big question, though, is London as a haven or a center for the  internationally-mobile elite.  Because the Labour government has indicated  that it does plan to crack down quite strongly on those internationally- mobile wealthy people.  And that in many ways is an even bigger reason for  banks like HSBC to be rethinking where they're based.</p><p>HARLOW:  Gillian Tett, US managing editor for the \"Financial Times,\"  joining us this Friday evening.  Thank you so much, we appreciate it.</p><p>TETT:  Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW:  European indexes were up Friday, finishing the week with  gains.  Markets backed off from those midweek highs that we saw after  inconclusive talks, to say the least, about Greece.</p><p>In Athens, Greek stocks rose more than 3 percent on hopes of positive  talks between Merkel and Tsipras.  Meanwhile, HSBC shares are up nearly 3  percent.</p><p>US markets closed the day higher.  The Dow posted a modest gain.  The  NASDAQ -- the NASDAQ is what it is all about, hitting an all-time record  high.  CNN Money's Paul La Monica here to talk with us about it.  The  NASDAQ is on fire.  Not only a 15-year-high, as we were saying yesterday,  but an all-time high.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  All-time high was  briefly above 5100 this morning and it didn't close above that.  So, we're  still waiting for it to get that intra-day record of 5132, March of 2000.   Good chance we'll probably get there sometime soon the way these earnings  have been.</p><p>You had strong results from Amazon and Microsoft.  They really led the  way.  Amazon was up 14 percent today, all-time high.  Microsoft up 10.5  percent.  Google was the laggard, it was only up 3 percent.</p><p>HARLOW:  And we have Apple coming Monday?</p><p>LA MONICA:  We have Apple coming Monday after the bell.  That is  obviously the next big tech stock to be reporting, and the next big test, I  think, for the NASDAQ.  Clearly, a lot of high expectations for Apple.</p><p>All the hype about the watch, but that just went on sale, so we're not  going to get any numbers about that yet, but iPhone sales will probably be  big again.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.  And we'll talk about the Apple Watch a little bit later  in the program.  Have a great weekend, Paul La Monica.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you, Poppy, you, too.</p><p>HARLOW:  And thank you so much.  </p><p>Well, talks to resolve Greece's debt troubled and with no progress.   Not only that, but officials have heaped criticism on the Greek finance  minister.  We'll discuss, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:15:03]  HARLOW:  Talks to resolve Greece's economic future have  ended with really no progress at all.  Greek finance minister Yanis  Varoufakis met with eurozone finance ministers this week.  Eurozone  officials are reportedly very critical of him, calling him a, quote, \"time- waster\" and a \"gambler.\"  </p><p>Varoufakis, on the other hand, said the talks are actually going  pretty well and making progress.  So, where's the disconnect?  The head of  the eurogroup said that things did not end so well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROEN DIJSSELBLOEM, PRESIDENT OF THE EUROGROUP:  It was a very  critical discussion.  We came to an agreement two months ago, and today, of  course, we had hoped to hear a positive results and an agreement on which  we could then take a decision.  And we are still far from that.  So, yes,  it was a very critical discussion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  And European officials now say time is, indeed, running out  for Greece.  There are three key issues that Varoufakis is supposedly  gambling on.  The first, the Greek budget.  Europe has set various budget  targets in exchange for bailout money, but Varoufakis says Greece cannot be  expected to meet them all because all the austerity is making the economy  too weak.</p><p>Europe agreed back in February that the bailout deal could be  rejiggered, basically, but won't make any promises until the next issue is  sorted.  And that is Greece's reform program.  Europe doesn't just want  budget cuts, it also wants long-lasting structural reforms on things like  taxation and corruption in Greece.  </p><p>Right now, it says it simply is not seeing enough progress on that  front, and until it's happy with Greece's overall plan, it will not hand  over any more bailout money.</p><p>And that brings us to the biggest problem of all, Greek funding.  The  current bailout money stops flowing at the end of June.  Beyond that, there  is no guarantee that Greece can pay all of its bills, and it has $4 billion  worth of payments that are due in June.</p><p>Before Varoufakis was finance minister, he was an academic  specializing in game theory.  Our Clare Sebastian looks at how this  strategy can shed light on the negotiations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER (voice-over):  At the heart of game  theory, conflict, cooperation, and eventually, a mathematical solution.  At  least, that's how it works in theory.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  For Greece, there is certainty -- </p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There was still no firm common ground.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But it can't possibly be business as usual in  Greece.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  In 2004, the now Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis,  published this academic text on game theory.  His co-author was Shaun  Hargreaves Heap.</p><p>SHAUN HARGREAVES HEAP, CO-AUTHOR, \"GAME THEORY:  A CRITICAL  INTRODUCTION\":  Marketing games of the sort that Yanis and the Greek  government are involved in don't have unique solutions in that sense.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Hargreaves Heap says that while game theory won't solve  the Greek crisis, it does offer some useful principles.</p><p>HARGREAVES HEAP:  Where there is a genuine, as it were, insight from  game theory, notes the people who are likely to concede the most in a  negotiation are those who have the most to fear from if you fail to make  the agreement.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  In the case of Greece and Europe, both sides have plenty  to fear if Greece defaults and leaves the eurozone.  And both are putting  on an optimistic face.</p><p>DIJSSELBLOEM:  Grexit is simply not on the table, it's not discussed.</p><p>VAROUFAKIS:  We are intent -- </p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>VAROUFAKIS:  -- people.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Game theory is about principles, not specifics.  Solving  the Greek crisis requires both.</p><p>HARGREAVES HEAP:  What the terms of the agreement are, games theory  doesn't tell us what it should be.  But what they say is both sides will be  -- both lose if they leave the table with the cake still on it, because  they've failed to agree how to cut it up.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  One thing we do know, it will test even the most  experienced of game theorists.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera):  What was he like as a thinker?  What was your  experience working with him?</p><p>HARGREAVES HEAP:  He was lots of fun to work with.  We had lots of  good arguments, lots of good discussions.  We're both academics who believe  in the positive value of dispute.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW:  With cash running out, the Greek government has issued an  emergency decree asking state agencies and municipal coffers to hand over  their reserves.  I spoke with the mayor of Athens, George Kaminis, about  how local governments and the public are responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GEORGE KAMINIS, MAYOR OF ATHENS:  Well, things all those last years  have been very bad for my country.  OK that today's meeting was a  disappointment, let's say.  But we are still confident, and I'm optimistic.   I firmly believe that we're going to arrive to an agreement with the  European Union.</p><p>HARLOW:  What makes you so confident?  Because as the weeks go by, I  think more and more people think that a Greek exit could happen.</p><p>[16:19:57]  KAMINIS:  There's a very solid basis to be confident in  that 80 percent of Greek people, they want to remain in the euro, they want  our country in the European Union.  We belong to the court of the European  Union, and those people are determined to work for that.</p><p>HARLOW:  You have been the mayor of Athens for nearly five years, now  --</p><p>KAMINIS:  Yes.</p><p>HARLOW:  -- since 2010.  Can you give me a sense of what it is like  day-to-day for the average citizen living there?  Just their concern level  and the real-world impact on them?</p><p>KAMINIS:  Of course, it's for many people, not only marginalized  people, as it was in the past, many people who used to have their jobs only  a few months ago, they are in difficulty, very severe difficulties.  </p><p>But at the same time, there are people who are like tourists, who  arrive in Athens.  They stay for a week, and they say, where is the crisis?   Because it's a lovely city, a vibrant -- </p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>KAMINIS:  At night, the capacity restaurants are full with people.   You don't realize very well if you remain as a tourist.</p><p>HARLOW:  And I understand that, and I understand you want the tourism  to continue, as it has.  It's very important for the economy, but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KAMINIS:  And this year, we have a new record on tourism arrivals.</p><p>HARLOW:  But for the people, the people of your city, of Athens, you  still have 26 percent unemployment.  How are they getting by?</p><p>KAMINIS:  Well, in a great difficulty and among young people, it's  almost 60 percent.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>KAMINIS:  So, that is one supplementary or even the most important  reason to insist on remaining in the eurozone, and we have to foster  entrepreneurship, create new business and create jobs for the people.</p><p>HARLOW:  So it's not -- it sounds like it's not necessarily about  bringing the old jobs back.  You're talking about entrepreneurship,  starting new businesses, opening new doors for citizens.</p><p>KAMINIS:  Oh, yes, of course.  We have to modernize the economy.   Because for so many years, things didn't go well, but we used to live well  on the loans, on the bank loans.  Now, we are facing the reality, and the  reality can be very, very cruel.  So, we have be innovative in every, every  aspect.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW:  Well, the Apple Watch makes its first highly-anticipated  appearance in select stores worldwide, and guess who has one.  Our Samuel  Burke got his hands on one.  We'll show you the goods next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW:  Apple Watches made their debut on store shelves, but do not  try to buy the new smart watch in the Apple Store.  They will be on display  there, but just a handful of high-end shops around the world are selling  the device for now.  CNN technology correspondent Samuel Burke somehow got  one -- why am I not surprised you got one --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW:  -- some way, somehow? -- and has an assessment.  How does it  feel?  How does it operate?  Do you like it?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Right away when I put it  on, I liked the feel of it.  If you want to get a lot of \"likes\" on  Facebook, take a picture with an Apple Watch.  Everywhere I'm going,  everybody wants to see it.  People are looking at it, they want to just  view it.</p><p>It was pretty easy to use, not quite as intuitive as an iPhone.  But  one thing that I already don't like about it is the audio quality.  Because  don't forget, you can actually make phone calls on this thing.  </p><p>And so, someone called me, and I was listening to it, and I almost had  to kind of put my ear up to it to be able to hear, and it's not -- I think  they tried to make it so it wasn't loud enough to disturb my colleagues,  but I just couldn't hear from it.</p><p>HARLOW:  Can you show me, how would you make a -- put it up to your  ear, is that how you would do it?  You have to put it all the way up to  your ear?</p><p>[16:25:03]  BURKE:  In theory.  Right now, I'm just clicking the CNN  app, because I still don't quite remember the phone call app.  So, I just  want to show off the CNN app for company's sake.  But someone calls you,  you just click a button, and you should -- they want you to be able to hear  like this, just from the way I'm sitting right now.  </p><p>But I actually couldn't hear, so I kind of had to do this type of  thing to hear it.  And even then, the audio quality wasn't great.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>BURKE:  So --</p><p>HARLOW:  All right.</p><p>BURKE:  -- hold off, use your iPhone for the phone calls for now.</p><p>HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>BURKE:  This is the $400 model.</p><p>HARLOW:  Pretty snazzy.  Oh, that's not the $17,000 model?  I was  wondering which one.</p><p>BURKE:  I decided to keep that at home.</p><p>HARLOW:  I was wondering which one you had.  Samuel Burke, have a  great weekend.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Well, the much-anticipated smart watch poses a big threat, frankly, to  Switzerland's age-old watch industry.  That is according to Elmar Mock, who  helped revive the business as co-inventor of Swatch.  He joins me now from  Switzerland.  Thank you for being with me, sir.  I appreciate it.  </p><p>ELMAR MOCK, CO-INVENTOR, SWATCH:  Hello.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Hello.  Let's begin with this.  Your initial assessment of  the Apple Watch.  How much do you think the traditional watch industry  should be worried?</p><p>MOCK:  I think it's a fantastic opportunity also for the normal watch  industry who meets a new world which opened now, and they are going in the  right direction.  So, I appreciate very much the Apple Watch.  And I think  it's a chance for the watch industry to also join this movement.</p><p>HARLOW:  But can Swiss watchmakers who are putting out their own smart  watches, do you think they can compete with the technology of the Apple  smart watch?</p><p>MOCK:  It will not be exactly the same technology.  But I think they  can seriously compete.  So, I think it's really an opportunity, and they  have a solution, and I know a solution.</p><p>HARLOW:  Think about the Apple Watch, I think about charging it.   Because you do, you have to plug it in, you have to charge it.  Do you  people -- think people are going to want to take their watch off at night  and charge it like their phone?</p><p>MOCK:  I think the functions are really great, and I think it makes  life also easier.   So why don't charge during the night?  I think we  charge also our phone.  For ten years ago, I was charging my phone every  week.  Now I have to charge it every night.</p><p>I don't say that is the only way, but I don't think it's very great.   I may be more afraid about the fact that she's not tight today.  But I  think that she will become more and more better.  So, we have a chance, and  it's the first one, and they will have other ones, and it's really going in  the right direction.</p><p>HARLOW:  It's interesting.  You've said that Apple will really hurt  companies operating at the mid-price level, like a Swatch, for example,  right?  So this initial one is below $400, they go all the way up to  $17,000.  I wonder if you think, though, Apple is maybe making a mistake  trying to compete at the high end with those high-end watches?</p><p>MOCK:  I don't think they've made a mistake.  I'm not sure that the  really high-end are affected.  But the middle range, of course they are  affected.  You must imagine that Apple and the other competition -- I  think, Samsung is at present, (inaudible) are present, Sony also.  So, I  think they will be maybe 50 million pieces a year who will be sold out  through this new channel.</p><p>What is fantastic, it's also a new distribution.  It's a new way to go  on the market.  I think it's a fantastic opportunity, and these 50 million  watches who are sold out sell with this price.  It will compete with the  middle segment, of course.  But it's not -- every competition is also  something very healthy.</p><p>HARLOW:  How many people, sir, do you believe are going to make the  mistake of getting in the shower with their Apple Watch on?</p><p>MOCK:  A lot.  A lot, of course.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MOCK:  That they will recognize they made a mistake.  I was also  wearing some electronic item with me, and I will go in under the shower.   So, it's -- you make it once or twice, and after, you can make progress  yourself.  Of course, waterproof will have to become once.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes.</p><p>MOCK:  But if your life is coming easier, and if you have pleasure  with this product, you will also accept a little bit of disadvantage.  But  of course that will change.</p><p>HARLOW:  I am certainly fascinated by it and can't wait to try one  myself.  Thank you so much for joining us.  Especially as a Swatch fan, I  appreciate all you've done for the watch industry.  Sir, have a wonderful  weekend.</p><p>MOCK:  OK, thank you very much, and have a good time, too.</p><p>HARLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>Well, switching gears here.  It has now been two years to the day  since that horrific, horrific factory collapse in Bangladesh where 1100  people were killed, thousands more injured.  We're going to find out if  workers' conditions have improved.</p><p>[16:29:42]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:32:00] HARLOW:  Hello, I'm Poppy Harlow.  Coming up on the next  half hour of \"Quest Means Business,\" The CEO of Heathrow Airport tells me  what he's hoping to see from the upcoming U.K. election.  </p><p>Also, two years ago since the Rana Plaza building collapsed, how much  is really changed for Bangladesh's factory workers?  </p><p>Before that though, here are your top business headlines this hour.</p><p>Armenia is marking 100 years since the mass killings of Armenians  during the First World War.  Russian President Vladimir Putin and French  President Francois Hollande condemned the deaths at a ceremony today.  But  the issue remains politically sensitive as Turkey and others insist that  the killings should not be considered genocide as Armenians considers them.</p><p>In Italy, authorities say that they have broken up a terror cell with  links to al-Qaeda, and the Vatican may have been one of its targets.  At  least nine people have been arrested.  Some of the 18 suspects are accused  of involvement in a bombing in Pakistan that left more than 300 people dead  or wounded.  </p><p>Authorities say they expect more activity from a volcano in Chile.   This coming in the coming hours.  Calbuco has already erupted twice this  week, spewing some 60 centimeters of ash in some places.  Some 4,500 people  have now had to evacuate the region.  The ash has now spread to neighboring  Argentina which is not surprising considering Chile's slender geography.   Look at those images - wow. </p><p>And the captain of a migrant boat that capsized in the Mediterranean  last weekend has appeared in court.  The 27-year-old Tunisia national is  accused of causing the tragedy that killed hundreds.  He has been detained  and he has been - he has denied being in charge of that vessel.  </p><p>It has been two years since the Rana Plaza factory collapse in  Bangladesh.  More than 1,100 people lost their lives that day when the  eight-story building collapsed.  It was the deadliest disaster the world's  garment industry has ever seen and it sparked outrage about dangerous  conditions for hundreds and hundreds of workers.  </p><p>Since the collapse, brands and retailers have contributed millions of  dollars to a compensation fund for injured workers and their families.   Still, campaigners say much more needs to be done.  Maggie Lake reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL:   More than 1,100 people dead, thousands injured, livelihoods destroyed.  Two  years after the Rana Plaza disaster, the wounds are still not healed.  And  despite stepped-up inspections, rights groups say conditions in many  Bangladesh factories remain perilous.  </p><p>[16:35:01] JOHN SIFTON, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH:  There could another Rana  Plaza tomorrow.  It's less likely, but it's still possible.  </p><p>The residential buildings have been converted into factories.  A lot  of them have had floors added - they're very unsafe.  </p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL:   Today there is only rubble where Rana Plaza once stood amid a continued  push to win more compensation for disaster victims.  More than two dozen  Western clothing brands including Benetton, Children's Place, The Gap and  Walmart have paid some $24 million to a compensation fund.  </p><p>But labor groups say brands collectively must to more.  The needs of  former Rana Plaza workers are just too great  </p><p>ABBY MCGILL, INTERNATIONAL LABOR RIGHTS FORUM:  This tragedy has left  very severe physical and psychological wounds on many of the people who  survived it.  And it's making it difficult for those people to find jobs.</p><p>LAKE:  Aid groups hope to raise at least $30 million from these brands  which used contractors based in Rana Plaza to manufacture clothes.  Human  rights officials say brands must use their influence because garment (AUDIO  GAP) stilled denied basic rights that could save lives.  </p><p>SIFTON:  We're simply asking the Bangladesh government to allow them  to organize in the union so that they can address their grievances to  factory owners.  The brands could do a big thing by simply telling the  Bangladeshi government to make that a reality.  </p><p>LAKE:  But as pressure to hold down clothing costs persists, labor  groups fear new disasters to come.  </p><p>MCGILL:  Western retailers and brands are setting prices for clothing  that squeeze the producers in developing countries to the point where these  kinds of accidents are absolutely inevitable.  </p><p>LAKE:  On the second anniversary of the worst workplace disaster in  modern history, (AUDIO GAP) in Bangladesh remains intense.  Maggie Lake,  CNN New York.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  Well the Bangladesh ambassador to the United Nations says  Western companies and consumers have to be willing to pay a little bit more  to benefit the workers and clearly to keep them safe.  Last week Richard  asked him if the situation has even improved.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ABDUL MOMEN, BANGLADESH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  There has  been short-term, medium-term, long-term efforts.  The government was - it  is a wakening call.  Whole nation get into it.  This shows -- this what  I'll talk to you -this shows one thing - that if people are committed and  partners also help, we can achieve goals and we did.  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW:  Buy no one doubts that people have got desires and  goodwill to do it.  The question is whether or not government has the  wherewithal to enforce it and private industry now is determined to spend  the money and invest?  </p><p>MOMEN:  Yes, see the government has imposed so many new rules.  For  example, we had only five - only few numbers - counted number inspectors.   Now we have almost 300 inspectors and we increased the bill - government  has increased the budget for it - 300 times.  </p><p>Now do our workers they paid law (ph)? Well, we have increased 219  percent.  There are 3,200 factories, more than half has been inspected.   And not by government alone -- it by Western countries, the supplier and  buyers - both Accord and Alliance -- and out of those they have done almost  1,800 inspections.  Out of that only 2 percent appeared to be non- (inaudible) and they're closed down.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  Now do you think that although there's obviously work  to be done from the Bangladeshi side, does the consumer in the West has to  recognize they have to pay more?  Because obviously if the downward price  pressure comes, it's going to hit at the weakest point, which is the  laborer in the factory in Bangladesh.  </p><p>MOMEN:  I agree with you.  This is an area we have not achieved much.   We hope that because this wait is very long, companies increased 219  percent and the varieties of instruments.  But we expected that the global  community will rise to the occasions and they will pay extra few cents so  that, you know, those people who suffers most, they could be benefitting.  </p><p>QUEST:  So who needs to do more?  </p><p>MOMEN:  I think we have to do a more job (ph) in the sense that we  have to create a global consciousness that we must help together.  </p><p>QUEST:  Oh, that's easy to same, Ambassador, but tell me in practical  terms - do the companies - the H&amp;Ms, the Prime Arts, the stores - do they  need to charge consumers more so they can pay more?  </p><p>MOMEN:  I think they make enormous amount of profit as you know.  One  tie to do in Bangladesh, it costs - you can buy it, let's say, $1.00.  But  when they sell it here, it's $75.00.  The marketeers they're making all the  profit - huge corporate profit.  So I think these big companies should come  forward and pay a little extra.  I' m not asking for too much - little  extra - 25 cents, 50 cents.  It can do magic for all.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:40:11] HARLOW:  Jryki Raine is the general secretary for  IndustriaLL Global Union.  He joins me now from Geneva. Thank you for being  with me this evening, sir.  We just heard what he said - that people will  pay more - saying the global community will rise to the occasion, they will  pay more.  </p><p>Maybe, maybe I'm a skeptic but I'm not so sure about that.  Are you?  </p><p>JRYKI RAINE, GENERAL SECRETARY, INDUSTRIALL GLOBAL UNION:  No, not at  all, Poppy.  In Australia in a poll, 80 percent of the respondents said  that they are prepared to pay more for their clothes if they know that they  are made in decent conditions with living wages and safe work places which  are still not the case today.  </p><p>HARLOW:  So they will.  I'm very glad to hear that.  I would hope that  it would play out like that in practice.  When you look at more than 1,100  people died - thousands were injured in that collapse.  </p><p>When you look at some of these companies that your union has called  out and called on a collective responsibility for brands like Benetton,  Mango, Walmart, Carrefour to contribute more.  Why specifically call out  those companies?  </p><p>RAINE:  Because we feel that the brands who are producing in  Bangladesh, they share a collective responsibility of profoundly flawed  production model which was not safe, it was not sustainable.  The good news  today is that we are only $2.7 million short of the $30 million target in  the compensation fund which is defined by the ILO experts.  So now it's the  time for the brands to do the right thing and close one of the most  shameful chapters in the history of the global garment industry.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Well especially when you think about how much money these  corporations bring in, you have three and a half million people in  Bangladesh that work in the garment industry.  The minimum wage that they  are paid is about 25 pounds a month.  Why do you think it is that we  haven't seen an improvement on that front in terms of the wage front to  where it needs to be, which is about double that just for a living wage?  </p><p>RAINE:  Well the reality is that the minimum wage in Bangladesh is $68  a month and that is the reason why all the workers are working at least 60  hours a week.  It's a question of pressure, Poppy.  So now IndustriALL,  Unit (ph) and the Clean Clothes Campaign have been campaigning for a living  wage.  </p><p>So my challenge tonight is to H&amp;M, to Zara, to Walmart and to Gap to  work together within IndustriALL.  Let's go to Bangladesh, let's go to  Cambodia, let's put in place bargaining structures where the brands also  pay a bit more to enable living wages for all these millions of workers.</p><p>HARLOW:  You have said that not a single factory can be called 100  percent safe yet.  And some companies have responded that - like Disney  right after the collapse pulling out completely.  Others would say that is  not the answer because then the jobs go away.  </p><p>RAINE:  And that is also our line.  And Bangladesh is a poor  developing country.  They desperately need these millions of jobs for the  workers.  But they have to be sustainable jobs with living wages safe  conditions and reasonable working hours.</p><p>We know that these brands were making tens of billions of dollars of  profit every year can afford to pay a bit more to the factory owners and be  part of the solutions where we make sure that part of that price also goes  to the workers.  So that is something that we want to work together with  the brands.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Jyrki Raine live with us in Geneva this evening.  Thank you,  sir, for being with us and for the important work you're doing.  We  appreciate it very much.  Quick break - we're back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:46:13] HARLOW:  \"We will work with all parties.

John Holland-Kaye spoke with me a  short time ago and covered plenty of ground from the contentious third  runway proposal to Heathrow's strong results. </p><p>Airport revenues and passenger traffic were up in the first quarter of  this year.  Passengers voted Heathrow the best airport in Western Europe.   But the first question I asked him has to do with the upcoming U.K.  election and whether he's concerned Britain may eventually leave the  European Union.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JOHN HOLLAND-KAYE, CEO, HEATHROW AIRPORT HOLDINGS:  I think we have  many benefits that come from membership with the European Union just within  the aviation sector.  We can see the growth that has been in low-cost  carriers through the easy access they have to European markets.  </p><p>That's benefitted all consumers and businesses and I think that's  something that we should protect.  And in the future we're going to see a  new single European sky coming in which reduce emissions, reduce costs,  it'll allow more capacity on the air roofs that's so vital to trading  around the world and that's a real benefit to being part of the E.U. So I  hope we won't make it a hasty decision on this.  We do need certainty for  business so that we can investments.  </p><p>I think that Heathrow is not going to change things, particularly  we're a very successful and stable business. We have a good international  base, we have over 80 carriers from all over the world flying into  Heathrow.  So we will continue to do well, regardless of the decision.  But  there are many benefits from being part of the European Union.</p><p>HARLOW:  What's driving the traffic increase?  Is this more of your  traditional carriers or is this about new carriers that are popping up and  benefiting from lower oil prices and just bringing in more capacity, more  travelers?  </p><p>KAYE:  Well at Heathrow we are operating at capacity.  We can't have  any more flights coming in and out.  So what we're seeing is more routes  being introduced by largely existing carriers to the growth markets of the  world.  So since last year we've had Avianca flying to Bogota in Colombia.   That's a route that's doling very well.  </p><p>We just had Vietnam Airlines start a new service.  They've moved up  from Gatwick flying to Vietnam.  That's a really important service to one  of the highest-growing markets in the world.  </p><p>So we're seeing that happening.  We're also seeing carriers putting on  more seats to European markets.  So BA's been very busy and we're seeing a  lot more transfer passengers coming through Heathrow.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Heathrow is trying to persuade regulators to allow Heathrow  to build a third runway.  How is that going?  Where does it stand?  </p><p>KAYE:  Well it's going very well in terms of winning support for  expansion at Heathrow.  I think it's been clear for a long time that  Heathrow is the best solution economically.  We'll create 180,000 jobs in  the U.K. all across the country -- over 200 billion pounds for the British  economy.  </p><p>But we're also seeing growing support locally because people want the  jobs that will come - 40,000 jobs for local communities, tackling youth  unemployment.  That's a really big price.  </p><p>But we've also been listening to the local community and we've  announced a big noise insulation program which will be world leading -- 160,000 homes and schools being insulated from noise and that means that  more people are now saying Heathrow's the right solution - it can be  delivered sustainably, it can be delivered within climate targets with  lower emissions and Heathrow's the right answer for the local communities  and the right solution nationally.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  Well the U.S. secretary of defense has launched a national  security initiative in Silicon Valley.  We'll tell you more about that  next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:51:20:]  The U.S. Department of Defense is partnering with tech  companies to boost its capability to fight cybercrime.  Video (ph) D (ph)  aims to harness the latest innovations to fight cyberattacks, secure its  networks and support military operations.  </p><p>Well the U.S. defense secretary was in Silicon Valley on Friday as  part of a two-day visit to try to woo some of those executives in Silicon  Valley.</p><p>I spoke with the CEO of Accenture, a huge worldwide consulting and  technology services firm and I asked him how much the chief executive that  he works with are really focusing on cybersecurity and how concerned he is  about the threat.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>PIERRE NANTERME, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, ACCENTURE:  It is a huge challenge.   If you're talking with a CEO, it's clearly security is now in their top  three priority concern and challenges that need to get right.  And is  similar for a company like Accenture, if you will.  </p><p>So we're watching all the evolutions from a situated standpoint  extremely carefully.  </p><p>We are operating in this business and we have a great practice to  advise our clients how to deal with security issues, especially around the  data privacy, data integrity, data protection and many bills and many  regulations as well and policies are figured out around the world in the  United States but as well in Europe.  </p><p>We are participating to many of the forum in order to create a world  which is going to be more secure and where security is going to be center  stage. </p><p>HARLOW:  You have predicted that a digital revolution is coming in  three ways and that this is going to be huge for the way the businesses  around the world are run.  How is it going to impact them and where is it  going to create opportunity?  </p><p>NANTERME:  I mean it's an amazing revolution we are facing with the  digital revolution enabled by what we are calling the Smagda (ph) to show  the mobile, the analytic and the Cloud technologies.  And indeed the three  ways you are referring to are going to be first, the digital consumer with  everything (ph) like you know interact between the companies and the  consumer.</p><p>The digital enterprise of course -- how you digitalize all the  operations of a company, but the most important way in which it's going to  start - and it's starting recently - they're about the digital operations,  what we are calling the Internet of Things.  </p><p>HARLOW:  You say these companies need to take risks to be successful.   I wonder what you would compare this digital revolution to in past history  in terms of big shifts that companies have had to live through and try to  thrive through?  </p><p>NANTERME:  Yes, I mean the common wisdom today is to compare the  digital revolution with the electricity.  You'll remember this revolution  long ago totally changed the way the business operated at the time and I  guess it's probably the best proxy for what's happening with the digital - </p><p>HARLOW:  Wow.  </p><p>NANTERME:  It's a - it's an incredible rethink in the way you're  addressing your client's need and the way you think of your operation, but  as well in the way you can create global businesses extremely rapidly in a  nimble and a fast way.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Do you think that especially the millennial generation is  focused on what a company they are possibly going to work for actually  stands for?  Where they stand on gun rights, where they stand on gay  marriage - issues like that?  Do you believe people are now considering  that before they take a job?  </p><p>NANTERME:  I'm sure they are, and at Accenture this year we're going  to work with 95,000 people.  But I think we have a great experience on  recruiting people, attracting people, but as well reading their minds, if  you will - understanding their motivation.  We're working on this every  minute of every day.  </p><p>Again, they want to come and work for a company with a purpose, they  want to fulfill a goal which is going far beyond career and very  importantly they want to make a contribution and it's going to be very  important for companies like us to provide an environment which could  fulfilling that goal.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:55:13] HARLOW:  In a moment here on \"Quest Means Business,\" if you  missed out on tickets to the Mayweather versus Pacquiao huge boxing match  coming up, we have your solution.  I'll tell you what it is next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW:  So if you cannot afford the heavyweight prices like most of  us for next week's hugely-anticipated boxing match, we've got a way you  still might be able to see Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in person. </p><p>In an unusual step for a boxing match, tickets for the prefight weigh- in - those just went on sale, the price obviously much more affordable than  the fight itself.  They're just ten bucks.  Promoters say proceeds from the  weigh-in tickets will be donated to charity.  </p><p>This comes after tickets for the fight itself sold out in about one  minute on Thursday.  The cheapest seat you can find on the secondary market  for the fight -- $5,000.  Some of those floor seats went for up to $50,000.  </p><p>All the hype about this fight has done wonders for Johnny Dagami's  profile.  He is a former factory worker in the Philippines who just happens  to look exactly like Manny Pacquiao.  Now, he's even found someone to dress  up as Pacquiao's trainer and he says they're going to take their show on  the road.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROMEO JAMERO, FREDDIE ROACH IMPERSONATOR:  We've become a duo - you  know, duo?  Seeing comedian.  What is that?  I told (ph) practice (ph)  training Cantanny (ph) Manny and then the comedy Freddie (ph) to any kind  of a stage.  </p><p>HARLOW:  So I think if Pacquiao wins, he needs to give half of his  winnings to that guy.  All right, that is \"Quest Means Business.\"  Thanks  so much for being with us this Friday evening.  I'm Poppy Harlow in New  York.  The CNN U.K. election debate is next.  Stay right here.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2015 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Tonight, one of the world's biggest banks is threatening to leave British shores and leave a political hornets' nest behind it. HSBC is blaming tough regulation, uncertainty over UK -- over the UK's future in the European Union as the two driving factors for this</p><p>You are looking at footage of the banking giant's current headquarters at London's Canary Wharf. It is HSBC's biggest office in the world, and that means thousands upon thousands of jobs.</p><p>An obvious choice for a new headquarters would be, of course, Hong Kong, where HSBC already has a very strong presence. And Hong Kong's monetary authority says it, of course, would welcome the bank with open arms. After all, that is what the H stands for in HSBC.</p><p>The bank moved from Hong Kong to the UK as its headquarters back in 1993. Now, the bank's chairman, Douglas Flint, has real concerns over changes in regulations in the UK since the financial crisis. Also, HSBC cannot sidestep fears over the uncertainty that lies ahead for Britain and its place within the European Union.</p><p>With a general election less than two weeks away, this announcement has become highly, highly political. The leaders of Britain's two main parties have been trading insults as to who is to blame for HSBC potentially wanting to just walk away.</p><p>The Labour Party argues that businesses like HSBC are scared of the Conservatives' promise to offer up a referendum on the future of Britain in the EU.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED MILIBAND, LABOUR PARTY LEADER: I think the intervention from HSBC is very significant today. They say it's a number one economic uncertainty that our country faces, withdrawal from the European Union. This does go to a question of priorities and what is the in the interests of our country.</p><p>I think the last thing our country needs is two years of an internal debate about whether we should leave the European Union or not, but that isn't what I want to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: But Conservatives point out it isn't only Europe that HSBC is worried about. <person><nameText>Prime Minister David Cameron </nameText></person>says regulation is the key concern for the banking giant. He argues banks would be worse off under a Labour government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID CAMERON, PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN: Well, London is, I think the world's leading financial center. We've improved London as a financial center not least by changing the way we regulate banks so that we wouldn't have to bail them out with taxpayers' money in future, as the last Labour government had to do.</p><p>But it is an important reminder of how vital it is that we keep a pro- enterprise, pro-business, pro-employment policy in our country, of keeping taxes low, making us an attractive place to invest.</p><p>And all the time I've been prime minister, that is what we've been doing, which is why we see record levels of inward investment coming here to Britain. We must keep on that approach and not put it at risk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: And I've been speaking with Britain's shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, who is in full-swing election mode. I started by asking him about those regulations that are causing so much head-shaking in the halls of HSBC and Britain's corridors of power. He was very keen to discuss the views of the HSBC chairman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHUKA UMUNNA, UK SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY: Well actually, the statement that Douglas Flint read out at the annual general meeting there was actually very candid. He acknowledged that there were major reputational issues for his own bank coming out of recent revelations into the activities of the Swiss arm, the Swiss private bank.</p><p>But he also acknowledged some of the major problems that were exposed in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, 9, and some of those have still been carrying to recently, with the ethics scandal and, of course, libor rigging before that. And there was a general acknowledgment in his comments that the center needed to get its own house in order, and that the regulatory environment needed to be improved.</p><p>So, it wasn't actually in that sense so critical of the reforms as really just saying given that those reforms have happened and the field on which we're playing has slightly altered, of course you take stock, and I don't think that's unreasonable.</p><p>[16:04:55] HARLOW: Well, let me point this out: he did make very clear that the bank believes that the levies that it pays are too high in the UK, right? Looking at last year alone, HSBC paid the government the highest levy of $1.1 billion and said 58 percent of that charge did not relate to the UK banking activities of the bank.</p><p>UMUNNA: Well, I think that we have global banks here. The global financial crash cost the UK around 1.3 trillion pounds. I don't think in that context it is unreasonable to ask those in the sector to pay a bit of a bigger contribution into the UK exchequer.</p><p>Now, I accept -- I can hear, maybe, there'll be market makers and others watching this program who will say, well, look, HSBC didn't take public funds in the way that the Royal Bank of Scotland did, or Lloyd's Banking Group did. That's true.</p><p>But they did benefit from the measures that the UK government -- and of course, the US and others took measures, too -- took to prevent the entire system collapsing upon itself. And of course, HSBC would have benefited from that, too.</p><p>So, I don't think it is unreasonable to ask for these universal and other investment banks to make a bit of a bigger contribution.</p><p>HARLOW: But here's the thing: 80 percent of HSBC's profit in 2014 came from Asia, 80 percent of that $12 billion. And when you look at how these levies are decided on, they're decided on the size of the balance sheets.</p><p>So, does HSBC have a point there that it wants less cumbersome, as it would call them, levies and regulation? And you've got Conservatives who would say, look, it's the Labour Party who's actually planning to regulate these banks even further.</p><p>UMUNNA: Well, here's the thing: there is consensus on the need to tighten up regulation. And in fact, in terms of the bank levy, that was actually introduced by a Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne. So, there is a degree of political consensus on that in the UK.</p><p>But hey, look, if I was the chairman of a big universal banking corporation like HSBC, of course you're not going to be arguing A, for the institution of a levy, or B for it to be increased. Of course you're going to argue for it to be reduced. In some senses, that is what your shareholders would have expected of you.</p><p>But we as policymakers have to weigh all the different interests in society and ensure we've got a policy matrix that works for everyone and not just a few people.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: Let's discuss the political row in the UK over HSBC with Gillian Tett. She's the US managing editor of the \"Financial Times.\" She joins me live right here in New York City. Thank you so much for being with me. I appreciate it. It is good to have you on the program. And let's be --</p><p>GILLIAN TETT, US MANAGING EDITOR, \"FINANCIAL TIMES\": Great to be here.</p><p>HARLOW: Let's begin with this. We have heard, look, clearly he was in full election mode. You hear it from Labour, you hear it from Conservatives so close to the election. But who do you think has a stronger argument at this point in time when it comes to HSBC and why they're threatening to leave.</p><p>TETT: Well, I think the reality is that HSBC is engaged in saber- rattling right now. That's how we described it in the \"Financial Times\" tonight. And it is not the first time that HSBC has dropped these hints. It's indicated that it's pretty unhappy about the regulatory climate over and over again.</p><p>But it also has a business reason for wanting to look further east, which is that most Western markets are pretty mature. Asia is really where the growth is. So, it has made these hints before. It's been very clever in terms of blaming both the European issue and the tax issue --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>TETT: -- equally, so it managed to steer a line between the two sides. But you just have to look at one number, which is 750 million. That's the amount of eventually extra tax that HSBC had to pay last year because of the one-off bank levy. And that's a very large number. And there was a feeling that the governments are clamping down too aggressively on banks.</p><p>HARLOW: It's a very important point, because when you look at the levy that they paid last year, something like $1.1 billion based on the size of their balance sheet, but 80 percent of their profit came from Asia.</p><p>So -- but clearly they haven't made up their mind, because if HSBC had made up its mind, they wouldn't even need to threaten. Do you see this as a threat to get the government to back away from some of these regulations?</p><p>TETT: Absolutely it's a threat. It's also an attempt to show shareholders that they're not being negligent by ignoring these costs. The 750 million figure I cited was 750 million pounds sterling.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>TETT: Which is a big number for a levy to be actually imposed on a bank. And what really concerns HSBC and many of its shareholders is that although this was originally presented as a one-off measure, the government's now indicating it may anything but. So, they're looking potentially a long regulatory tunnel.</p><p>The problem, though, is that if HSBC was to move to Hong Kong, while the Hong Kong regulators are pretty widely respected around the world and by many HSBC shareholders, having China as, essentially, the dominant power overseeing you potentially in the future is not something that many shareholders would be very excited about.</p><p>[16:10:03] So, it's a lot of saber-rattling right now. Who knows whether it will actually lead to anything concrete?</p><p>HARLOW: That's a very important point you make, and certainly one they're considering in the C Suite at HSBC.</p><p>Let me ask you this: looking outside of HSBC at other big banks that call London their headquarters, at least in Europe, do you believe that they are more concerned right now about the levies they're paying because of this increased regulation or possibly more regulation coming from the Labour Party if they win, if you listen to the Conservatives.</p><p>Or do you think that they are really unnerved by the uncertainty of the UK's position within Europe as a whole?</p><p>TETT: Well, there are two things to notice here. The first thing, as far as the banks are concerned, right now -- and I was talking to a senior banker the other day -- what's going on is really not a beauty contest in geographical terms, in terms of different centers competing for bank business.</p><p>It's more like an ugly contest. Where is the worst of all worlds or the worst possible place to be? Because there are big problems in the UK right now with London, as far as the banks are concerned. But New York is not entirely welcoming either. And while Switzerland or Singapore might have some advantages, they also have big drawbacks, too.</p><p>So, the banks are thinking hard about geographical location. The other big question, though, is London as a haven or a center for the internationally-mobile elite. Because the Labour government has indicated that it does plan to crack down quite strongly on those internationally- mobile wealthy people. And that in many ways is an even bigger reason for banks like HSBC to be rethinking where they're based.</p><p>HARLOW: Gillian Tett, US managing editor for the \"Financial Times,\" joining us this Friday evening. Thank you so much, we appreciate it.</p><p>TETT: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: European indexes were up Friday, finishing the week with gains. Markets backed off from those midweek highs that we saw after inconclusive talks, to say the least, about Greece.</p><p>In Athens, Greek stocks rose more than 3 percent on hopes of positive talks between Merkel and Tsipras. Meanwhile, HSBC shares are up nearly 3 percent.</p><p>US markets closed the day higher. The Dow posted a modest gain. The NASDAQ -- the NASDAQ is what it is all about, hitting an all-time record high. CNN Money's Paul La Monica here to talk with us about it. The NASDAQ is on fire. Not only a 15-year-high, as we were saying yesterday, but an all-time high.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: All-time high was briefly above 5100 this morning and it didn't close above that. So, we're still waiting for it to get that intra-day record of 5132, March of 2000. Good chance we'll probably get there sometime soon the way these earnings have been.</p><p>You had strong results from Amazon and Microsoft. They really led the way. Amazon was up 14 percent today, all-time high. Microsoft up 10.5 percent. Google was the laggard, it was only up 3 percent.</p><p>HARLOW: And we have Apple coming Monday?</p><p>LA MONICA: We have Apple coming Monday after the bell. That is obviously the next big tech stock to be reporting, and the next big test, I think, for the NASDAQ. Clearly, a lot of high expectations for Apple.</p><p>All the hype about the watch, but that just went on sale, so we're not going to get any numbers about that yet, but iPhone sales will probably be big again.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. And we'll talk about the Apple Watch a little bit later in the program. Have a great weekend, Paul La Monica.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you, Poppy, you, too.</p><p>HARLOW: And thank you so much.</p><p>Well, talks to resolve Greece's debt troubled and with no progress. Not only that, but officials have heaped criticism on the Greek finance minister. We'll discuss, next.</p><p>[16:15:03] HARLOW: Talks to resolve Greece's economic future have ended with really no progress at all. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis met with eurozone finance ministers this week. Eurozone officials are reportedly very critical of him, calling him a, quote, \"time- waster\" and a \"gambler.\"</p><p>Varoufakis, on the other hand, said the talks are actually going pretty well and making progress. So, where's the disconnect? The head of the eurogroup said that things did not end so well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROEN DIJSSELBLOEM, PRESIDENT OF THE EUROGROUP: It was a very critical discussion. We came to an agreement two months ago, and today, of course, we had hoped to hear a positive results and an agreement on which we could then take a decision. And we are still far from that. So, yes, it was a very critical discussion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: And European officials now say time is, indeed, running out for Greece. There are three key issues that Varoufakis is supposedly gambling on. The first, the Greek budget. Europe has set various budget targets in exchange for bailout money, but Varoufakis says Greece cannot be expected to meet them all because all the austerity is making the economy too weak.</p><p>Europe agreed back in February that the bailout deal could be rejiggered, basically, but won't make any promises until the next issue is sorted. And that is Greece's reform program. Europe doesn't just want budget cuts, it also wants long-lasting structural reforms on things like taxation and corruption in Greece.</p><p>Right now, it says it simply is not seeing enough progress on that front, and until it's happy with Greece's overall plan, it will not hand over any more bailout money.</p><p>And that brings us to the biggest problem of all, Greek funding. The current bailout money stops flowing at the end of June. Beyond that, there is no guarantee that Greece can pay all of its bills, and it has $4 billion worth of payments that are due in June.</p><p>Before Varoufakis was finance minister, he was an academic specializing in game theory. Our Clare Sebastian looks at how this strategy can shed light on the negotiations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER (voice-over): At the heart of game theory, conflict, cooperation, and eventually, a mathematical solution. At least, that's how it works in theory.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For Greece, there is certainty --</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was still no firm common ground.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But it can't possibly be business as usual in Greece.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: In 2004, the now Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, published this academic text on game theory. His co-author was Shaun Hargreaves Heap.</p><p>SHAUN HARGREAVES HEAP, CO-AUTHOR, \"GAME THEORY: A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION\": Marketing games of the sort that Yanis and the Greek government are involved in don't have unique solutions in that sense.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Hargreaves Heap says that while game theory won't solve the Greek crisis, it does offer some useful principles.</p><p>HARGREAVES HEAP: Where there is a genuine, as it were, insight from game theory, notes the people who are likely to concede the most in a negotiation are those who have the most to fear from if you fail to make the agreement.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: In the case of Greece and Europe, both sides have plenty to fear if Greece defaults and leaves the eurozone. And both are putting on an optimistic face.</p><p>DIJSSELBLOEM: Grexit is simply not on the table, it's not discussed.</p><p>VAROUFAKIS: We are intent --</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>VAROUFAKIS: -- people.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Game theory is about principles, not specifics. Solving the Greek crisis requires both.</p><p>HARGREAVES HEAP: What the terms of the agreement are, games theory doesn't tell us what it should be. But what they say is both sides will be -- both lose if they leave the table with the cake still on it, because they've failed to agree how to cut it up.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: One thing we do know, it will test even the most experienced of game theorists.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): What was he like as a thinker? What was your experience working with him?</p><p>HARGREAVES HEAP: He was lots of fun to work with. We had lots of good arguments, lots of good discussions. We're both academics who believe in the positive value of dispute.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: With cash running out, the Greek government has issued an emergency decree asking state agencies and municipal coffers to hand over their reserves. I spoke with the mayor of Athens, George Kaminis, about how local governments and the public are responding.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GEORGE KAMINIS, MAYOR OF ATHENS: Well, things all those last years have been very bad for my country. OK that today's meeting was a disappointment, let's say. But we are still confident, and I'm optimistic. I firmly believe that we're going to arrive to an agreement with the European Union.</p><p>HARLOW: What makes you so confident? Because as the weeks go by, I think more and more people think that a Greek exit could happen.</p><p>[16:19:57] KAMINIS: There's a very solid basis to be confident in that 80 percent of Greek people, they want to remain in the euro, they want our country in the European Union. We belong to the court of the European Union, and those people are determined to work for that.</p><p>HARLOW: You have been the mayor of Athens for nearly five years, now --</p><p>KAMINIS: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: -- since 2010. Can you give me a sense of what it is like day-to-day for the average citizen living there? Just their concern level and the real-world impact on them?</p><p>KAMINIS: Of course, it's for many people, not only marginalized people, as it was in the past, many people who used to have their jobs only a few months ago, they are in difficulty, very severe difficulties.</p><p>But at the same time, there are people who are like tourists, who arrive in Athens. They stay for a week, and they say, where is the crisis? Because it's a lovely city, a vibrant --</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>KAMINIS: At night, the capacity restaurants are full with people. You don't realize very well if you remain as a tourist.</p><p>HARLOW: And I understand that, and I understand you want the tourism to continue, as it has. It's very important for the economy, but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KAMINIS: And this year, we have a new record on tourism arrivals.</p><p>HARLOW: But for the people, the people of your city, of Athens, you still have 26 percent unemployment. How are they getting by?</p><p>KAMINIS: Well, in a great difficulty and among young people, it's almost 60 percent.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>KAMINIS: So, that is one supplementary or even the most important reason to insist on remaining in the eurozone, and we have to foster entrepreneurship, create new business and create jobs for the people.</p><p>HARLOW: So it's not -- it sounds like it's not necessarily about bringing the old jobs back. You're talking about entrepreneurship, starting new businesses, opening new doors for citizens.</p><p>KAMINIS: Oh, yes, of course. We have to modernize the economy. Because for so many years, things didn't go well, but we used to live well on the loans, on the bank loans. Now, we are facing the reality, and the reality can be very, very cruel. So, we have be innovative in every, every aspect.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: Well, the Apple Watch makes its first highly-anticipated appearance in select stores worldwide, and guess who has one. Our Samuel Burke got his hands on one. We'll show you the goods next.</p><p>HARLOW: Apple Watches made their debut on store shelves, but do not try to buy the new smart watch in the Apple Store. They will be on display there, but just a handful of high-end shops around the world are selling the device for now. CNN technology correspondent Samuel Burke somehow got one -- why am I not surprised you got one --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: -- some way, somehow? -- and has an assessment. How does it feel? How does it operate? Do you like it?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Right away when I put it on, I liked the feel of it. If you want to get a lot of \"likes\" on Facebook, take a picture with an Apple Watch. Everywhere I'm going, everybody wants to see it. People are looking at it, they want to just view it.</p><p>It was pretty easy to use, not quite as intuitive as an iPhone. But one thing that I already don't like about it is the audio quality. Because don't forget, you can actually make phone calls on this thing.</p><p>And so, someone called me, and I was listening to it, and I almost had to kind of put my ear up to it to be able to hear, and it's not -- I think they tried to make it so it wasn't loud enough to disturb my colleagues, but I just couldn't hear from it.</p><p>HARLOW: Can you show me, how would you make a -- put it up to your ear, is that how you would do it? You have to put it all the way up to your ear?</p><p>[16:25:03] BURKE: In theory. Right now, I'm just clicking the CNN app, because I still don't quite remember the phone call app. So, I just want to show off the CNN app for company's sake. But someone calls you, you just click a button, and you should -- they want you to be able to hear like this, just from the way I'm sitting right now.</p><p>But I actually couldn't hear, so I kind of had to do this type of thing to hear it. And even then, the audio quality wasn't great.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>BURKE: So --</p><p>HARLOW: All right.</p><p>BURKE: -- hold off, use your iPhone for the phone calls for now.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>BURKE: This is the $400 model.</p><p>HARLOW: Pretty snazzy. Oh, that's not the $17,000 model? I was wondering which one.</p><p>BURKE: I decided to keep that at home.</p><p>HARLOW: I was wondering which one you had. Samuel Burke, have a great weekend. Thank you so much.</p><p>Well, the much-anticipated smart watch poses a big threat, frankly, to Switzerland's age-old watch industry. That is according to Elmar Mock, who helped revive the business as co-inventor of Swatch. He joins me now from Switzerland. Thank you for being with me, sir. I appreciate it.</p><p>ELMAR MOCK, CO-INVENTOR, SWATCH: Hello.</p><p>HARLOW: Hello. Let's begin with this. Your initial assessment of the Apple Watch. How much do you think the traditional watch industry should be worried?</p><p>MOCK: I think it's a fantastic opportunity also for the normal watch industry who meets a new world which opened now, and they are going in the right direction. So, I appreciate very much the Apple Watch. And I think it's a chance for the watch industry to also join this movement.</p><p>HARLOW: But can Swiss watchmakers who are putting out their own smart watches, do you think they can compete with the technology of the Apple smart watch?</p><p>MOCK: It will not be exactly the same technology. But I think they can seriously compete. So, I think it's really an opportunity, and they have a solution, and I know a solution.</p><p>HARLOW: Think about the Apple Watch, I think about charging it. Because you do, you have to plug it in, you have to charge it. Do you people -- think people are going to want to take their watch off at night and charge it like their phone?</p><p>MOCK: I think the functions are really great, and I think it makes life also easier. So why don't charge during the night? I think we charge also our phone. For ten years ago, I was charging my phone every week. Now I have to charge it every night.</p><p>I don't say that is the only way, but I don't think it's very great. I may be more afraid about the fact that she's not tight today. But I think that she will become more and more better. So, we have a chance, and it's the first one, and they will have other ones, and it's really going in the right direction.</p><p>HARLOW: It's interesting. You've said that Apple will really hurt companies operating at the mid-price level, like a Swatch, for example, right? So this initial one is below $400, they go all the way up to $17,000. I wonder if you think, though, Apple is maybe making a mistake trying to compete at the high end with those high-end watches?</p><p>MOCK: I don't think they've made a mistake. I'm not sure that the really high-end are affected. But the middle range, of course they are affected. You must imagine that Apple and the other competition -- I think, Samsung is at present, (inaudible) are present, Sony also. So, I think they will be maybe 50 million pieces a year who will be sold out through this new channel.</p><p>What is fantastic, it's also a new distribution. It's a new way to go on the market. I think it's a fantastic opportunity, and these 50 million watches who are sold out sell with this price. It will compete with the middle segment, of course. But it's not -- every competition is also something very healthy.</p><p>HARLOW: How many people, sir, do you believe are going to make the mistake of getting in the shower with their Apple Watch on?</p><p>MOCK: A lot. A lot, of course.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MOCK: That they will recognize they made a mistake. I was also wearing some electronic item with me, and I will go in under the shower. So, it's -- you make it once or twice, and after, you can make progress yourself. Of course, waterproof will have to become once.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>MOCK: But if your life is coming easier, and if you have pleasure with this product, you will also accept a little bit of disadvantage. But of course that will change.</p><p>HARLOW: I am certainly fascinated by it and can't wait to try one myself. Thank you so much for joining us. Especially as a Swatch fan, I appreciate all you've done for the watch industry. Sir, have a wonderful weekend.</p><p>MOCK: OK, thank you very much, and have a good time, too.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you.</p><p>Well, switching gears here. It has now been two years to the day since that horrific, horrific factory collapse in Bangladesh where 1100 people were killed, thousands more injured. We're going to find out if workers' conditions have improved.</p><p>[16:29:42] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:32:00] HARLOW: Hello, I'm Poppy Harlow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Francois Hollande condemned the deaths at a ceremony today. But the issue remains politically sensitive as Turkey and others insist that the killings should not be considered genocide as Armenians considers them.</p><p>In Italy, authorities say that they have broken up a terror cell with links to al-Qaeda, and the Vatican may have been one of its targets. At least nine people have been arrested. Some of the 18 suspects are accused of involvement in a bombing in Pakistan that left more than 300 people dead or wounded.</p><p>Authorities say they expect more activity from a volcano in Chile. This coming in the coming hours. Calbuco has already erupted twice this week, spewing some 60 centimeters of ash in some places. Some 4,500 people have now had to evacuate the region. The ash has now spread to neighboring Argentina which is not surprising considering Chile's slender geography. Look at those images - wow.</p><p>And the captain of a migrant boat that capsized in the Mediterranean last weekend has appeared in court. The 27-year-old Tunisia national is accused of causing the tragedy that killed hundreds. He has been detained and he has been - he has denied being in charge of that vessel.</p><p>It has been two years since the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh. More than 1,100 people lost their lives that day when the eight-story building collapsed. It was the deadliest disaster the world's garment industry has ever seen and it sparked outrage about dangerous conditions for hundreds and hundreds of workers.</p><p>Since the collapse, brands and retailers have contributed millions of dollars to a compensation fund for injured workers and their families. Still, campaigners say much more needs to be done. Maggie Lake reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL: More than 1,100 people dead, thousands injured, livelihoods destroyed.

Human rights officials say brands must use their influence because garment (AUDIO GAP) stilled denied basic rights that could save lives.</p><p>SIFTON: We're simply asking the Bangladesh government to allow them to organize in the union so that they can address their grievances to factory owners. The brands could do a big thing by simply telling the Bangladeshi government to make that a reality.</p><p>LAKE: But as pressure to hold down clothing costs persists, labor groups fear new disasters to come.</p><p>MCGILL: Western retailers and brands are setting prices for clothing that squeeze the producers in developing countries to the point where these kinds of accidents are absolutely inevitable.</p><p>LAKE: On the second anniversary of the worst workplace disaster in modern history, (AUDIO GAP) in Bangladesh remains intense.

Last week Richard asked him if the situation has even improved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ABDUL MOMEN, BANGLADESH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: There has been short-term, medium-term, long-term efforts. The government was - it is a wakening call. Whole nation get into it. This shows -- this what I'll talk to you -this shows one thing - that if people are committed and partners also help, we can achieve goals and we did.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR AND REPORTER HOST OF \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" SHOW: Buy no one doubts that people have got desires and goodwill to do it. The question is whether or not government has the wherewithal to enforce it and private industry now is determined to spend the money and invest?</p><p>MOMEN: Yes, see the government has imposed so many new rules. For example, we had only five - only few numbers - counted number inspectors. Now we have almost 300 inspectors and we increased the bill - government has increased the budget for it - 300 times.</p><p>Now do our workers they paid law (ph)? Well, we have increased 219 percent. There are 3,200 factories, more than half has been inspected. And not by government alone -- it by Western countries, the supplier and buyers - both Accord and Alliance -- and out of those they have done almost 1,800 inspections. Out of that only 2 percent appeared to be non- (inaudible) and they're closed down.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Now do you think that although there's obviously work to be done from the Bangladeshi side, does the consumer in the West has to recognize they have to pay more? Because obviously if the downward price pressure comes, it's going to hit at the weakest point, which is the laborer in the factory in Bangladesh.</p><p>MOMEN: I agree with you. This is an area we have not achieved much. We hope that because this wait is very long, companies increased 219 percent and the varieties of instruments. But we expected that the global community will rise to the occasions and they will pay extra few cents so that, you know, those people who suffers most, they could be benefitting.</p><p>QUEST: So who needs to do more?</p><p>MOMEN: I think we have to do a more job (ph) in the sense that we have to create a global consciousness that we must help together.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, that's easy to same, Ambassador, but tell me in practical terms - do the companies - the H&amp;Ms, the Prime Arts, the stores - do they need to charge consumers more so they can pay more?</p><p>MOMEN: I think they make enormous amount of profit as you know. One tie to do in Bangladesh, it costs - you can buy it, let's say, $1.00. But when they sell it here, it's $75.00. The marketeers they're making all the profit - huge corporate profit. So I think these big companies should come forward and pay a little extra. I' m not asking for too much - little extra - 25 cents, 50 cents. It can do magic for all.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:40:11] HARLOW: Jryki Raine is the general secretary for IndustriaLL Global Union. He joins me now from Geneva. Thank you for being with me this evening, sir. We just heard what he said - that people will pay more - saying the global community will rise to the occasion, they will pay more.</p><p>Maybe, maybe I'm a skeptic but I'm not so sure about that. Are you?</p><p>JRYKI RAINE, GENERAL SECRETARY, INDUSTRIALL GLOBAL UNION: No, not at all, Poppy. In Australia in a poll, 80 percent of the respondents said that they are prepared to pay more for their clothes if they know that they are made in decent conditions with living wages and safe work places which are still not the case today.</p><p>HARLOW: So they will. I'm very glad to hear that. I would hope that it would play out like that in practice. When you look at more than 1,100 people died - thousands were injured in that collapse.</p><p>When you look at some of these companies that your union has called out and called on a collective responsibility for brands like Benetton, Mango, Walmart, Carrefour to contribute more. Why specifically call out those companies?</p><p>RAINE: Because we feel that the brands who are producing in Bangladesh, they share a collective responsibility of profoundly flawed production model which was not safe, it was not sustainable. The good news today is that we are only $2.7 million short of the $30 million target in the compensation fund which is defined by the ILO experts. So now it's the time for the brands to do the right thing and close one of the most shameful chapters in the history of the global garment industry.</p><p>HARLOW: Well especially when you think about how much money these corporations bring in, you have three and a half million people in Bangladesh that work in the garment industry. The minimum wage that they are paid is about 25 pounds a month. Why do you think it is that we haven't seen an improvement on that front in terms of the wage front to where it needs to be, which is about double that just for a living wage?</p><p>RAINE: Well the reality is that the minimum wage in Bangladesh is $68 a month and that is the reason why all the workers are working at least 60 hours a week. It's a question of pressure, Poppy. So now IndustriALL, Unit (ph) and the Clean Clothes Campaign have been campaigning for a living wage.</p><p>So my challenge tonight is to H&amp;M, to Zara, to Walmart and to Gap to work together within IndustriALL. Let's go to Bangladesh, let's go to Cambodia, let's put in place bargaining structures where the brands also pay a bit more to enable living wages for all these millions of workers.</p><p>HARLOW: You have said that not a single factory can be called 100 percent safe yet. And some companies have responded that - like Disney right after the collapse pulling out completely. Others would say that is not the answer because then the jobs go away.</p><p>RAINE: And that is also our line. And Bangladesh is a poor developing country. They desperately need these millions of jobs for the workers. But they have to be sustainable jobs with living wages safe conditions and reasonable working hours.</p><p>We know that these brands were making tens of billions of dollars of profit every year can afford to pay a bit more to the factory owners and be part of the solutions where we make sure that part of that price also goes to the workers. So that is something that we want to work together with the brands.</p><p>HARLOW: Jyrki Raine live with us in Geneva this evening. Thank you, sir, for being with us and for the important work you're doing. We appreciate it very much. Quick break - we're back in a minute.</p><p>[16:46:13] HARLOW: \"We will work with all parties. We will work with any government.\" That is a declaration from the chief executive of Heathrow Airport not far from London. John Holland-Kaye spoke with me a short time ago and covered plenty of ground from the contentious third runway proposal to Heathrow's strong results.</p><p>Airport revenues and passenger traffic were up in the first quarter of this year. Passengers voted Heathrow the best airport in Western Europe. But the first question I asked him has to do with the upcoming U.K. election and whether he's concerned Britain may eventually leave the European Union.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JOHN HOLLAND-KAYE, CEO, HEATHROW AIRPORT HOLDINGS: I think we have many benefits that come from membership with the European Union just within the aviation sector. We can see the growth that has been in low-cost carriers through the easy access they have to European markets.</p><p>That's benefitted all consumers and businesses and I think that's something that we should protect. And in the future we're going to see a new single European sky coming in which reduce emissions, reduce costs, it'll allow more capacity on the air roofs that's so vital to trading around the world and that's a real benefit to being part of the E.U. So I hope we won't make it a hasty decision on this. We do need certainty for business so that we can investments.</p><p>I think that Heathrow is not going to change things, particularly we're a very successful and stable business. We have a good international base, we have over 80 carriers from all over the world flying into Heathrow. So we will continue to do well, regardless of the decision. But there are many benefits from being part of the European Union.</p><p>HARLOW: What's driving the traffic increase? Is this more of your traditional carriers or is this about new carriers that are popping up and benefiting from lower oil prices and just bringing in more capacity, more travelers?</p><p>KAYE: Well at Heathrow we are operating at capacity. We can't have any more flights coming in and out. So what we're seeing is more routes being introduced by largely existing carriers to the growth markets of the world. So since last year we've had Avianca flying to Bogota in Colombia. That's a route that's doling very well.</p><p>We just had Vietnam Airlines start a new service. They've moved up from Gatwick flying to Vietnam. That's a really important service to one of the highest-growing markets in the world.</p><p>So we're seeing that happening. We're also seeing carriers putting on more seats to European markets. So BA's been very busy and we're seeing a lot more transfer passengers coming through Heathrow.</p><p>HARLOW: Heathrow is trying to persuade regulators to allow Heathrow to build a third runway. How is that going? Where does it stand?</p><p>KAYE: Well it's going very well in terms of winning support for expansion at Heathrow. I think it's been clear for a long time that Heathrow is the best solution economically. We'll create 180,000 jobs in the U.K. all across the country -- over 200 billion pounds for the British economy.</p><p>But we're also seeing growing support locally because people want the jobs that will come - 40,000 jobs for local communities, tackling youth unemployment. That's a really big price.</p><p>But we've also been listening to the local community and we've announced a big noise insulation program which will be world leading -- 160,000 homes and schools being insulated from noise and that means that more people are now saying Heathrow's the right solution - it can be delivered sustainably, it can be delivered within climate targets with lower emissions and Heathrow's the right answer for the local communities and the right solution nationally.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Well the U.S. secretary of defense has launched a national security initiative in Silicon Valley. We'll tell you more about that next.</p><p>[16:51:20:] The U.S. Department of Defense is partnering with tech companies to boost its capability to fight cybercrime. Video (ph) D (ph) aims to harness the latest innovations to fight cyberattacks, secure its networks and support military operations.</p><p>Well the U.S. defense secretary was in Silicon Valley on Friday as part of a two-day visit to try to woo some of those executives in Silicon Valley.</p><p>I spoke with the CEO of Accenture, a huge worldwide consulting and technology services firm and I asked him how much the chief executive that he works with are really focusing on cybersecurity and how concerned he is about the threat.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>PIERRE NANTERME, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, ACCENTURE: It is a huge challenge. If you're talking with a CEO, it's clearly security is now in their top three priority concern and challenges that need to get right. And is similar for a company like Accenture, if you will.</p><p>So we're watching all the evolutions from a situated standpoint extremely carefully.</p><p>We are operating in this business and we have a great practice to advise our clients how to deal with security issues, especially around the data privacy, data integrity, data protection and many bills and many regulations as well and policies are figured out around the world in the United States but as well in Europe.</p><p>We are participating to many of the forum in order to create a world which is going to be more secure and where security is going to be center stage.</p><p>HARLOW: You have predicted that a digital revolution is coming in three ways and that this is going to be huge for the way the businesses around the world are run. How is it going to impact them and where is it going to create opportunity?</p><p>NANTERME: I mean it's an amazing revolution we are facing with the digital revolution enabled by what we are calling the Smagda (ph) to show the mobile, the analytic and the Cloud technologies. And indeed the three ways you are referring to are going to be first, the digital consumer with everything (ph) like you know interact between the companies and the consumer.</p><p>The digital enterprise of course -- how you digitalize all the operations of a company, but the most important way in which it's going to start - and it's starting recently - they're about the digital operations, what we are calling the Internet of Things.</p><p>HARLOW: You say these companies need to take risks to be successful. I wonder what you would compare this digital revolution to in past history in terms of big shifts that companies have had to live through and try to thrive through?</p><p>NANTERME: Yes, I mean the common wisdom today is to compare the digital revolution with the electricity. You'll remember this revolution long ago totally changed the way the business operated at the time and I guess it's probably the best proxy for what's happening with the digital -</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>NANTERME: It's a - it's an incredible rethink in the way you're addressing your client's need and the way you think of your operation, but as well in the way you can create global businesses extremely rapidly in a nimble and a fast way.</p><p>HARLOW: Do you think that especially the millennial generation is focused on what a company they are possibly going to work for actually stands for? Where they stand on gun rights, where they stand on gay marriage - issues like that? Do you believe people are now considering that before they take a job?</p><p>NANTERME: I'm sure they are, and at Accenture this year we're going to work with 95,000 people. But I think we have a great experience on recruiting people, attracting people, but as well reading their minds, if you will - understanding their motivation. We're working on this every minute of every day.</p><p>Again, they want to come and work for a company with a purpose, they want to fulfill a goal which is going far beyond career and very importantly they want to make a contribution and it's going to be very important for companies like us to provide an environment which could fulfilling that goal.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:55:13] HARLOW: In a moment here on \"Quest Means Business,\" if you missed out on tickets to the Mayweather versus Pacquiao huge boxing match coming up, we have your solution. I'll tell you what it is next.</p><p>HARLOW: So if you cannot afford the heavyweight prices like most of us for next week's hugely-anticipated boxing match, we've got a way you still might be able to see Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in person.</p><p>In an unusual step for a boxing match, tickets for the prefight weigh- in - those just went on sale, the price obviously much more affordable than the fight itself. They're just ten bucks. Promoters say proceeds from the weigh-in tickets will be donated to charity.</p><p>This comes after tickets for the fight itself sold out in about one minute on Thursday. The cheapest seat you can find on the secondary market for the fight -- $5,000. Some of those floor seats went for up to $50,000.</p><p>All the hype about this fight has done wonders for Johnny Dagami's profile. He is a former factory worker in the Philippines who just happens to look exactly like Manny Pacquiao. Now, he's even found someone to dress up as Pacquiao's trainer and he says they're going to take their show on the road.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>ROMEO JAMERO, FREDDIE ROACH IMPERSONATOR: We've become a duo - you know, duo? Seeing comedian. What is that? I told (ph) practice (ph) training Cantanny (ph) Manny and then the comedy Freddie (ph) to any kind of a stage.</p><p>HARLOW: So I think if Pacquiao wins, he needs to give half of his winnings to that guy. All right, that is \"Quest Means Business.\" Thanks so much for being with us this Friday evening. I'm Poppy Harlow in New York. The CNN U.K. election debate is next.

Last Thursday, the U.S. added the Chinese tech titan to a trade blacklist[1] as part of a growing effort to 'secure the information and communications technology and services supply chain,' as President Trump's Executive Order put it[2]. While this naturally prevents any U.S. hardware company from selling components \u2014 such as chips that may be used in 5G networking equipment \u2014 to Huawei, the world soon realized the ban also applies to software. Google revealed that to comply[3] with the trade restrictions, it would have to stop providing Huawei with support for Android and Google's services. This will have some impact on existing Huawei devices, but the real effect will be felt on future Huawei devices, as they won't be able to offer the Google Play app store or any of the Google services people have come to rely on, such as Google Maps, YouTube, and Gmail. </p><p>What has largely been overlooked is the long-term impact this will have on Google. The U.S. government's intention was to strike a blow at 'foreign adversaries,' not to hit Google's Android revenue. But the move could (and probably will) do just that, particularly with Android already facing growing resistance across the technological and political landscape.EuropeAbove: Android options in Europe: What search engine and browser would you like to use? Last year, EU antitrust regulators hit Google with a $5 billion fine[4]for the way it reportedly forced manufacturers to preinstall certain Google apps on Android devices. This led the Alphabet subsidiary to completely rework its licensing model[5] for Android in Europe, instead charging device makers a fee to preinstall its apps \u2014 including YouTube, Google Maps, and Gmail \u2014 while offering them Google Play, Chrome, and Search under separate licenses. Earlier this year, Google also started suggestingbrowser and search engine alternatives[6] for Android users in Europe. Android remains intact for now, but such measures set the groundwork for what has been a gradual unbundling of Android in Europe[7]. Russia launched (and won) a similar case against Google's Android monopoly[8] a few years before, paving the way for internet giant Yandex to launch a smartphone[9] that put its own services front and center. Elsewhere, Google has tried to push Android into other verticals, with varying degrees of success.CarsAbove: Android in a Volvo Google has made no secret of its desire to infiltrate the automotive realm. Back in 2014, it introduced the world to Android Auto[10], which is essentially a mobile app that mirrors features from an Android device on a car's in-dash entertainment display. A number of carmakers have signed on to support Android Auto, but support is still patchy at best \u2014 and there is a reason Google opened up Android Auto so that it works straight from a mobile phone screen[11]. Undeterred, Google two years ago launched Android Automotive[12], an operating system designed specifically to embed in cars. The initiative was launched in partnership with Volvo and Audi, and we can likely expect the first Android Automotive vehicle \u2014 Volvo's Polestar 2[13] \u2014 to hit the roads in 2020. However, back in November Volvo signed an extended deal with Ericsson,[14] which will provide its connected vehicle cloud platform for Volvo's in-car digital services globally. It's not entirely clear what impact this has on Android Automotive, but it does hint at Volvo's reluctance to hand all its data over to Google. 'Ericsson is providing a highly scalable and global platform for connected services to Volvo Cars,' said sa Tamsons, Ericsson's head of business area technologies, at the time. 'By removing complexity in areas such as data legislation and storage management and improving services latency, our platform enhances the overall user experience of Volvo Cars' connected services.' Google also signed up the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance[15] for Android Automotive, but a few months back the alliance revealed it had signed a deal with Microsoft's Azure[16] to power its vehicles' various services in the cloud. This suggests the alliance is also disinclined to give Google access to all its data, though naturally it made no mention of such concerns. 'Through our collaboration with Microsoft, we are introducing the most powerful and far-reaching connected vehicle platform,' said Kal Mos, global VP of Alliance connected vehicles at Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi. 'Leveraging the size and scale of the Alliance, we have built an intelligent cloud platform that sets the pace for our industry.' So while carmakers have shown some willingness to embrace Android, Google has not met the resounding welcome it may have hoped for. There may be a number of reasons carmakers are hesitant to hand over the keys to their infotainment systems[17], but chief among them could be a reluctance to cede control of monetizable data and services to Google. This resistance has popped up elsewhere in the automotive sphere, with companies pushing to ensure they retain full control over their in-car services. The likes of Ford and Toyota joined forces a couple of years back[18] to launch the SmartDeviceLink (SDL) Consortium, which supports open source software deployment for cars. And in 2015 a consortium of German car giants bought Nokia's mapping business for $3 billion,[19] which gave them direct control over their navigation and mapping smarts and one more way to fend off Google Maps' push into cars.Tizen and FireAbove: Samsung Z4: Tizen Image Credit: SamsungWearables, TVs, and tablets paint a similar picture. Samsung started off using Android[20] on its smartwatches but switched to its own Linux-based Tizen OS[21] five years ago \u2014 a move that certainly did nothing to help Android Wear's chances of survival. Despite subsequent rumors that Samsung would perhaps switch back to Google's Android-based software, now called Wear OS, it has steadfastly stuck with Tizen. Similarly, Samsung has never embraced Android TV, instead using its own Samsung Smart TV platform before switching[22] entirely to Tizen a few years ago. As an aside, LG has sought its own smart TV path[23] in the form of WebOS, which it acquired in 2013. But rival smartphone companies face considerable challenges as they try to forge a path outside of Google's Android. Huawei has made up ground[24] against Samsung, but the Korean company is still the biggest smartphone maker in terms of shipments \u2014 23.1% market share as of Q1 2019, compared to 19% for Huawei. It's fair to say that Samsung is a big deal for Google's Android, but it has been clear for a while that Samsung would love to drop Android entirely. The company has tried to push Tizen out into the mobile realm, but thus far it has made it onto just a handful of devices \u2014 including the 4G Z2 in 2016[25], and the Z4 a year later[26], which was Samsung's last Tizen phone. Of course, the problem with switching its phones to Tizen is that Samsung loses the full app inventory Android offers. The company has tried to lure developers on board, including offering cash prizes[27] via the Tizen Mobile App Incentive Program, but that effort has never quite taken off. Android, and all the Google goodness that comes with it, is just too sticky. Similar to Samsung, Amazon has attempted to go it alone in the mobile phone realm. Back in 2014, it launched its Fire Phone[28] as it sought to build on its burgeoning Fire tablet lineup. Amazon's Fire devices are based on Android, but they use a 'forked' version that sidesteps Google Play Services to provide a direct artery into Amazon's ecosystem.  Amazon has made a success of its Fire tablet (though not without some friction with Google[29]), particularly as budget-friendly devices for families. It has also succeeded with its Fire-branded set-top boxes and dongles. By contrast, its Fire Phone barely lasted a year before it was culled[30], in part because it lacked a comprehensive pool of apps (including Google's).Fork in the roadHuawei will undoubtedly have to launch its own operating system, something it has been preparing for a while[31]. The system will probably be based on Android so it can support the millions of Android apps out there, but Huawei will need to do a better job than Amazon of getting third parties to put their apps in its app store[32]. Even if it succeeds in doing that, something it has reportedly already been working on[33], it will have one more huge obstacle to overcome. Huawei phones won't have access to any of Google's native apps, such as Maps, Gmail, or YouTube. And because the U.S. trade ban doesn't only implicate Google, other U.S.-based service providers, such as Facebook and Twitter, likely won't be available through this store either. So Google is still in a strong position from an Android perspective, but the aforementioned factors \u2014 ranging from EU regulation to U.S. trade blacklists \u2014 could eventually take their toll. Also, other phone makers will look at Huawei's predicament and recognize that the same thing could happen to them. Chinese companies, in particular, will observe recent events with caution, but it could serve as an impetus for companies such as Samsung to push ahead with efforts to escape Google's stranglehold. The impact such shifts would have on consumers isn't clear \u2014 the last thing the world needs is more fragmentation, with countless Android forks, app stores, and more. If Google's version of Android brings anything, it's consistency of access across devices. It would actually make a great deal of sense for all the big handset makers to form a consortium and develop their own Android fork and/or app store that works across their respective devices. That would go some way toward freeing them from their reliance on Google while encouraging app developers to join in. But that isn't likely to happen anytime soon \u2014 for starters, Samsung and others probably don't want to align themselves with Huawei. But make no mistake: As the U.S. tries to curtail Huawei, Google has very much been caught in the crossfire \u2014 and it has everything to lose.

The cost of the coronavirus is being counted; check out the estimate that it threatens $11bn in Asian tech profits (Mercedes\u2019 top 10). In other evidence of a downdraught on Asia tech, find the FT scoop on the mounting pressure for a merger between Grab and Gojek, south-east Asia\u2019s most valuable start-ups (Mercedes\u2019 top 10). Don\u2019t miss the podcast on \u201cDigital Dictators\u201d (When sages speak) and more high-stakes wrangling over Huawei and 5G in Europe in our Big Story. Take care wherever you are in the world. Don't forget Tech Scroll is\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://ft.com/asia-tech\"> free to read for a month</url>, so pass this email on to anyone you think would be interested.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>The Big Story </p><p>Huawei\u2019s ambitions to lay 5G infrastructure in Europe survived a UK\u00a0 parliamentary revolt, but only just. A total of 38 Conservative MPs voted against Boris Johnson\u2019s government to support a legal amendment that would, if it had passed, have banned Huawei from UK telecoms networks from the end of 2022.</p><p>The rebellion failed, but by a narrower-than-expected majority of 306 to 282. However, opposition in parliament is expected to persist because London has yet to legislate on Huawei\u2019s involvement. The US has raised pressure on European allies to shun the Chinese company.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications:</emphasis> President Donald Trump was \u201capoplectic\u201d over the UK\u2019s decision this year to allow Huawei a limited role in its 5G telecoms infrastructure. The US is also applying pressure on Germany, which is set to decide on the Chinese company\u2019s involvement possibly this month. </p><p>France, where Huawei pledged last month to build a factory making telecoms equipment, has also yet to make a clear determination. Its cyber security agency is examining Huawei equipment and Orange, the top French mobile operator, has already chosen Nokia and Ericsson, Huawei\u2019s European rivals, for its 5G services. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot:</emphasis> Europe is a crucial battleground for Huawei, which denies all allegations of espionage. The US, Australia and New Zealand have already made clear their intent to ban the Chinese company, while Japan appears to be following that line without spelling it out. Canada and Singapore are considering their positions.</p><p>Mercedes\u2019 top 10</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A round-up of the week\u2019s best tech stories from the FT\u2019s Asia tech reporter Mercedes Ruehl.</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Investors in Grab and Gojek, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">south-east Asia\u2019s</emphasis> biggest technology start-ups, are lobbying <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Japan\u2019s</emphasis>SoftBank to bring about a merger between the two companies.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th.  8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Your top stories right now, Chinese telecom giant Huawei making it official.  The company filing a lawsuit against the U.S. saying that Congress acted as judge jury and executer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are on edge this morning but well off of the lows of the morning.  Dow Industrials now down just nine points, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up, it is positive territory by a fraction.  And NASDAQ is -- right now lower by two.  A big bounce after the ECB meeting this morning where we did not see any moves in interest rates.  Another decline yesterday for the markets making it three in a row.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look, Dow Industrials down 133 points yesterday.  The S&amp;P was down 18 and the NASDAQ down 70.  The European Central Bank have left interest rates unchanged this morning setting a new round of long-term loans.  ECB President Mario Draghi holding a news conference later this hour.  We will bring you all of the developments but as you see her too, we're seeing a big of a turnaround after the ECB meeting.</p><p>Markets are well off of the lows, the FT-100 is down just 15 points, the CAC quarante in Paris is actually positive by three points and the DAX Index Germany still down but down just 10 points right now.  Pretty good bounce after the ECB meeting this morning.  In Asia overnight, market mostly lower with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite was up a fraction.</p><p>The push for privacy at Facebook.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg shifting focus to private communication.  The details on this major strategy shift to world's largest social network coming up.  And Apple facing slowing iPhone sales.  We are taking a look at what the technology giant is looking to do instead with services that's become a big business for Apple.</p><p>Plus, a new twist on a Philly cheesesteak.  It is raising some eyebrows because it's salty and sweet as well.  The controversy coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman and Fox News Contributor Liz Peek.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Good news from the ECB I guess.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  Great, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see if the ECB actually starts easing at some point because the economy in Europe is quite slow.  The other day we had Mohamed el-Erian on and he said that the Eurozone would be lucky to see growth -- GDP growth of one percent this year.</p><p>PEEK:  And that's pretty much the forecast I think and there was an expectation they were going to lower that.  I don't know if they did that or not but, yes, they need a change in regimen lower over there.  Lower taxes, deregulation, sound familiar?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what you write about in France with the 33 percent corporate rate in your op-ed today, James.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  So, instead of doing the reforms you're talking about they want to get the rest of the world to force tax rates higher, not good for growth but you wonder with Europe how long they can do this extending and pretending the very loose monetary policy.  The government of Greece this week is back in the bond market borrowing money, healthy demand, less than four percent and the European regulator said they haven't fulfilled their promises, they haven't done the privatization and either kind of reforms that you would want to see.</p><p>So, it doesn't really make sense why these highly indebted governments with zero growth economies can borrow so cheaply but they'll see how long they can --</p><p>PEEK:  Because they know if they're going to about bailed out by the ECB, that's why, right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  But I --</p><p>PEEK:  There is back stop.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think there's a reckoning at some point if you don't --</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  For sure.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- transition as we have done to a real economy.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Based on by the decision making.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No.  I was just going to say this -- the -- I want to point this out, the U.S. economy is so much healthier than the rest of the world.  That's why our trade deficit hit a record last year and I will call out a lot of these publications, a lot of these media organizations the way that they're framing this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to bait the President into doing something that's destructive to economic growth in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They're framing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- what a failure and expanded, he's trying to narrow the gap.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Front page of the New York Times, U.S. trade deficit under President bulges to record failing a Trump metric.  I think that they're trying to go and poke the President into doings something rash.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think you're reading it right.  And by the way, we'll talk more about your op-ed on tax rates in France and the U.S.'s response what Steven Mnuchin said about that.  But first our top story this hour is Huawei, it is suing the United States as President Trump signals progress with China on trade talks.  Blake Burman is covering the story, he's at the White House this morning.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  You're right.  Huawei is now fighting back as it has sued the U.S. government in a Federal Court.  At issue here is a provision that was in the middle of the National Defense Authorization Act that was put into law at the end of last year which says that Federal agencies cannot use Huawei products.</p><p>Now Huawei is saying that that is singling out company and that they claim is unlawful.  Huawei's chief information officer though has said in the recent days that the company should be trusted and is completely separate from the Chinese government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI:  On theft of the intellectual property by the China government that's not us, the China government does not speak for us, we don't speak through the China government.  I applaud the efforts of the United States and others to try to crack down on the global theft of intellectual property which has been a disgrace over the last 15 years that we haven't done enough about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The issue of I.P. theft as you heard him mention there is at the heart of a possible trade deal between the U.S. and China.  President Trump yesterday continued to remain more optimistic than pessimistic at the prospects of a detail.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Gong OK.  We're moving along, we're discussing that with Lindsey and Mitt.  That moving along well, we'll see what happens.  There either going to be a good deal or it's not going to be a deal but I think they're moving on very nicely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  As we've talked about, Maria, any possible deal needs to eventually be signed off by President Trump and President Xi of China, a possible meeting between those two are likely meeting between those two as it relates to a possible date.  That has not yet though confirmed up by the White House.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We've been hearing rumblings of the end of March in Mar-a-Lago, right?</p><p>BURMAN:  End of March, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.</p><p>BURMAN:  Yes.  End of March, we'll see.  Still awaiting the official word from the folks behind me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you.  Blake Burman is at the White House this morning.  And joining me right now is House Ways and Means Committee Member, Congressman Tom Reed and House Financial Services member, Congressman Josh Gottheimer.  Good to see you, gentlemen.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK:  Good to see you.</p><p>REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D), NEW JERSEY:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Congressman Reed, let me kick this off with you.  Your reaction in terms of Huawei suing the U.S.?</p><p>REED:  Well, you know, obviously, they have been one of the individuals we've been looking at in regards to intellectual property theft, the unfair trade advantages that Chinese companies as well as Chinese government have taken advantage for for years.  And so I think now accountability is being imposed by this administration and that's the right thing to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I guess -- is this somewhere where we have common ground, Congressman Gottheimer in terms of China?  You know.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  Definitely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Huawei says, it's -- the Congress, you and your colleagues acted as judge, jury, and executioner.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Well, I think we need to hold them accountable.  I think Tom is exactly right on this.  And, you know, we know that there has been questions of practices and a lot of our security at stake here and we have to be incredibly mindful that in wary of their intentions and hold them accountable at every step.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean, how do you do that?  Right?  Isn't that the real question here?  because isn't this a culture?  I mean, they have been stealing I.P. for decades and I don't know that you change a culture so easily.  They've got a lot of money, they're acquiring companies from energy to financial, acquiring companies in Silicon Valley, they've got their Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley to soak up more intelligence from the U.S.  How do you -- how do you turn this ship?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  I think -- I think we make sure that we don't put their 5G centers all over the United States.  We make sure we got great companies like Qualcomm doing that and be very careful from a national security perspective of watching our I.P. and being vigilant.  And I think the administration is holding them accountable on it.  Right, Tom?</p><p>REED:  And I would say, Maria, this is -- most Americans don't realize, we don't have a trade agreement with China per se.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>REED:  They work under an old WTO type standard.  We need enforcement mechanisms at the table negotiated that.  When you engage in these activities, this theft of our intellectual property.  There is accountability immediately and enforceable accountability in those agreements.  That's why I so appreciate President Trump sitting at the table face-to-face saying enough is enough, we're going to hold you accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The enforcement is really critical here because they've said they would do things in the past and then they didn't follow up like they said they would buy all this beef.  So you think there is a measure, Congressman Gottheimer that you can actually put in place that if things go awry, they don't keep up their promises, you can quickly and easily put the tariffs back in place?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  I think we have to and I think we need to use our legislative authority to do that.  And of course, the administration has to enforce it enforce all trade deals.  But I think we have to act and I agree that with Tom that we've got to find a way the mechanisms in place to make sure that we can react so they can't steal our intellectual property, all of our technology they've been doing it for a long time and it's time to put our foot down about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I agree.  I think this is such an important subject, we've been covering it a lot, so thank you for input both of you on this.  Let me move to another issue, Congressman Gottheimer because House Democrats obviously are divided over how to deal with this measure on freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's comments regarding U.S. policy towards Israel, a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, being delayed in the House as a result.</p><p>What's with all the delays here?  I mean, can't we all agree that anti-Semitism should not be in the Foreign Affairs Committee and in the Congress?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think there is sweeping agreement about the fact that there is no room for anti-Semitism in our country or any hate speech or Islamophobia.  You know, there's no room for that.  And in our public discourse, obviously, someone who is Jewish, the idea that you would question my -- some would question my loyalty to the United States of America because of my fact is unacceptable.</p><p>Just like it was unacceptable when they questioned President Kennedy's allegiance to our great country because he is catholic.  There's no room for that in our country and it's clearly anti-Semitic.  You know, I think there's -- there are different ways to approach this and broadly talk about a lot of rhetoric that's happened in our country which is unacceptable over many years but especially over the last couple years.</p><p>And I think we need to address that too but we can't let-- get lost that what happened here and one member of Congress said about me and my faith and others are questioning our loyalty  is unacceptable.  We want to make sure that that does not get lost, move our foot down and say no anti-semitism in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I mean, we all agree with that.  I mean, we all agree with you but how come it keeps getting delayed?  Like what's the delay?  What are we questioning?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think it's just a -- I think honestly it's a question of all -- there're so many issues that of course concerning when it comes hate in this country.  It's what else should we address in a resolution we bring to the floor and I think that's what really the discussion is about at this point.  I don't think anyone is questioning that the anti-Semitic comments that were made were unacceptable.</p><p>And we have to make sure that speak out against them.  I think it's the approach in how we do it.  And, you know, we're working obviously together to try to get there.  But, you know, it's unacceptable and there is no room for it as you point out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think she should step off foreign affairs?  I mean, wouldn't that cure this?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Well, I think that's certainly above my pay grade but I'll tell -- but I know what I feel about what was said and that's what I can speak to.  It's unacceptable questioning anyone's loyalty in Congress to the United States of America because of their fate.  It's unacceptable and we have to -- and we just have to make sure that people understand in this country there's no room for it in our rhetoric.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's the Nancy Pelosi's decision then, right, Congressman Reed?</p><p>REED:  Yes, it is. But Maria, I would add one thing and I so appreciate Josh leading the charge standing up for being, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Me too.</p><p>REED:  And leading that charge and taking on anti-semitism head on.  But this is also a symptom of extremism in our politics.  This is more about a political issue that I think we used to face potentially in the Republican Party after 2010 that are now seeing the Democratic Party.  You see a very strong vocal minority trying to push back on this issue and it's about internal politics more than dealing with the actual root cause.</p><p>And I encourage my colleagues on the Democratic side.  Stand with Josh, send the message, anti-semitism is not allowed.  Anybody who speaks it, anybody who believes in it needs to be about called and shouldn't be in any party, Democrat or Republican.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's nice to see you, guys, having this common ground.  Let me ask you about taxes, Congressman Reed.  The state and local tax burden for New York, 12.7 percent, that s that is the highest in the country.  New Jersey ranked number three by the way, Congressman  --</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Yes.  Not good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gottheimer.  State and local tax burden of 12.2 percent, this information according to the tax foundation, both your states dealing with an exodus of residents fleeing to lower tax states.  So, Congressman Reed, what are you going to do about it?</p><p>REED:  I'm going to keep putting pressure on our state capitol and encourage my fellow New Yorkers wake up, we need to change policies out of Albany that are going to lower taxes, business a business friendly climate to the table so that people invest across all spectrums in New York and also stand with the existing businesses and residents first before you hand out goodies to potential people that you want to entice to come to the state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, Congressman Gottheimer, same deal in New Jersey.  Do you guys have the power to actually move the needle on this?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  First on those jobs, I'll take them in Jersey, Tom, especially in Amazon.  We'll take them but let me, you know, be clear what I feel.  We've got to cut taxes in New Jersey, this tax hike bill that came through last year raised taxes on it.  Jersey is pointing out on those statistics because of gutting the state and local tax reduction.  We've got to reinstate it, stop double taxation, so we're working on that but frankly I'm sick and tired of these other states taking of our -- tacking of our tax dollar and Jersey and, you know, we're not getting anything back for it.</p><p>We've got a tunnel between New York and New Jersey that's crumbling.  We can't get any resources for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: We're sick and tired of it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to solve deduction back, right?  You want that solved?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Yes.  Got to get -- got to get salt back, it's critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, both of you, good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: It's good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>REED:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Reed and Gottheimer there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching shares of Kroger this morning.  The stock falling on earnings.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange checking that out in the broader markets.  Gerri, good morning.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  That's right.  A double miss for Kroger on both the top line and the bottom line.  Take a look at these numbers, the stock down nearly 10 percent here.  EPS of 52 cents a share, that was the expectation, they came in at 48 cents a share.  Revenue estimate was 28.38 billion --nah ah, 28.1 billion, as you can see right here,</p><p>So a big disappointment in this -- what is really a narrow margin business, very difficult business because the margins are so narrow.  This company spending heavily on technology and delivery services to better compete with companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon.  As you remember on Friday, the stock was down mightily after Amazon announced they're going to start their own line of grocery stores in major American cities.</p><p>Now, tonight, the opposite side of the coin, Costco coming in big expectations for that company.  EPS estimates of $1.69 at stock, up marginally here.  We expect a positive earnings result and revenue should be higher as well at 35 billion.  So higher membership fees at E-commerce revenue should be higher for Costco.  I guess we'll have to wait and see but Kroger, double miss today.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you.  Coming up next, defending the border.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended President Trump's emergency declaration over the border crisis.  We're going to bring you what she said.  And then, flip-flop fine.  The beautiful clinic, Cinque Terre Italian Coastline is ready to implement a no flip-flop rule for tourists.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defending the President's national emergency declaration.  Lauren Simonetti with headlines now.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Secretary Nielsen saying that the country faces a serious and sustained crisis at the southern border in her testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  The projections are dire at the current pace we are on track to encounter close to one million illegal aliens at our southern border this year.</p><p>Our capacity is already severally restrained but these increases will overwhelm the system entirely.  This is not a manufactured crisis, this is truly an emergency.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Senate expected to pass the measure in opposition to the national emergency declaration.  The President has vowed to veto that resolution.  Well, SoftBank's next big bet is in Latin America.  The Japanese company launching a $5 billion fund to invest in tech start-ups in the region.  SoftBank says, it will work with the Saudi backed $99-billion SoftBank vision fund to make bigger investments.</p><p>It's already shaken up the tech industry with splashy investments and start-ups including Uber and WeWork.  And finally an historic Philadelphia restaurant is putting together two of the city's famous foods, cheesecake and pound cake.  Joe's Steaks and Soda Soups is selling a hybrid sandwich of the two.  Every Tuesday this month pound cake cheese steak.  You can even top it with chocolate icing.</p><p>So it's added to the menu to celebrate Jo's Steak's 70th anniversary.  Some people are writing on Twitter.  April Fool's Day is next month but, yes, it's not getting the best rest reviews as you can imagine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  You don't have to very dessert, you just have the dinner and dessert all in one.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  That's very practicable, Maria.  Yes.  That's a good justification.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't like it.  What do you guys, think?  Dagen?  Do you eat that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just thinking it's like a hamburger instead of a bun, you use two Krispy Kreme donuts, that's the same -- it's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just stick with the regular bond and mushrooms and pepperoni.  Some people call that a Carmen, it's outstanding.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>PEEK:  It all sounds like a heart attack on a plate, honestly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It does.</p><p>PEEK:  Forgive me but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Italian stuff, that a Philly too, when I used to eat meat that had the -- it's broccoli raab and the beef steak.  I remember that being quite delicious.</p><p>PEEK:  It's a different direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Coming up.  Facebook's privacy push, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plan to go private sharing after losing users.  Details next.  And then awaiting key economic data this morning.  Initial jobless claims are out, moments from now, we will bring you the numbers and see if there's an impact on markets.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th.  Your top stories right now just before 8 a.m. on the East Coast.  New stimulus from the European Central Bank sparking a turnaround.  Futures as you see are higher across the board.  The ECB left rates unchanged.  In Europe the European Central Bank taking new measures to support the struggling European economy.</p><p>The ECB is launching a new round of long-term loans.  As you can see, the markets completely reversed course.  In the U.S. as well as in Europe, the FT-100 is still lower but just by nine points.  And the CAC Quarante is up 11 points, and DAX Index up 15.  Ditto for the U.S. markets as you saw a moment ago.  We are waiting on jobless claims which will be out in about 30 sections right here.</p><p>In Asia overnight, take a look at the markets.  And as you can see, it was lower across the board with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite, did squeak out a fractional gain.  iPhone sales are slowing.  There could be more problems brewing for Apple.  We're going to take a look this morning.  And the end of an era today.  General Motors closing its Lordstown, Ohio plant which has been open since 1966.</p><p>Plus, a fine over flip-flops.  Get this.  A major tourist destination in Italy focusing on footwear.  You will have to pay up.  We have the story.  But first we begin this half an hour.  It's Facebook's future.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a new plan to address privacy concerns after losing users.  Joining me now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director of Equity Research, Dan Ives.  Dan, it's good to see you.</p><p>DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the -- let's talk about what you're seeing out of -- out of this company, and whether or not this is the way to move in terms of Facebook and private.</p><p>IVES:  Yes, I think we'll get to posturing, too.  I mean given what they've seen the Beltway in Brussels to some extent here, you know, they really need, from a privacy perspective, to kind of give, you know, I think directionally go in this move.  (INAUDIBLE) comes down to monetization.  The game hasn't changed Facebook in terms of how they're going to monetize this.  And I think that's what really investors are focused on.  But I think right now, they continue to face an uphill battle on the privacy side as we've seen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So they're going to offer encrypted messaging across all of it's products, some of the messages, the private conversations will be ephemeral, is the word, the operative word.  The problem is Facebook has never figured out a way how to make money, expect from revenue from advertisers.  Ninety-eight percent of its revenue comes from advertisers.  How did -- this actually hurts Facebook.  And to your point, the issue hasn't been really -- it's how Facebook treats our private information.  Just because you say our conversations are going to be private in the future, how are you going to prove to us that you're not going to be selling our data, that you're going to be combing through our conversations to get the juiciest details to then offload to advertisers for money?</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean look, they're playing nice in the sandbox, but the reality is it's 98 percent revenue, and that's not going to change, that's why, you know, as they went through the congress, and they went in Brussels, they've kind of done some of those moves.  But if you'll get numbers, you've seen obviously advertising revenue hasn't really been hit.  And I think this is just a move where they need to continue to go from a privacy perspective, in that direction, especially when you look at Cook and Apple and you saw obviously the advertisement at CES, I mean they've kind of gotten the other side.  So right now, there's kind of a battle brewing among tech giants with Facebook on one side, Apple on the other.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, I said this privately really quickly.  I went through my preferences on my Facebook app, I don't -- I rarely use Facebook anymore.  I do use Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, and under my ad preferences, it said advertisers who uploaded a contact list with your information in it is a thousand advertisers.  And I've barely used that service in the last --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you can actually do that, you can actually go in and see how many advertisers uploaded your content.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who there are.  And who there are.  And I had -- you have to go through though and block every single one of them, basically delete them.</p><p>PEEK:  It's almost impossible.</p><p>IVES:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  And what we know is from last week, revelation, I think that they're -- even if you're not on Facebook, they're taking your information somehow and selling it.  So, it seems to me that this constant parade of mea culpas from Facebook are become meaningless.  I mean they're going to have to do something to address this issue or people are going to stop using Facebook.</p><p>IVES:  And there's a lack of teeth in terms of what you're seeing from a regulatory perspective.</p><p>PEEK:  Sure.</p><p>IVES:  That's pushing back the background.  (INAUDIBLE) the stocks jumped significantly, investors now view it as background noise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES:  Versus maybe a year ago where it actually was a big overhang in stock.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't understand the business model going forward.  You're saying that they're not going to get their money from fees, from subscription fees.  It's still going to be almost entirely advertising.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said it's 98 percent.</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean, look, you're going to -- you'll -- you could start to slightly to move that, but realistically right now and you look at it in the numbers, advertising (INAUDIBLE) Facebook is.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So you -- if you're transition in a big way from people publishing stuff and large audiences being able to see it to private communications in small groups where audiences are very much restricted from seeing it.  That sounds, on its face, like much lower advertising revenue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>IVES:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Is there a reason they can charge more per thousand or per chat group?  Or how do they --</p><p>IVES:  And then --</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- sustain the revenue?</p><p>IVES:  And now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you --and you compared it to WhatsApp.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  WhatsApp, which Facebook owns --</p><p>IVES:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is private when they spend -- how much did they spend?  $19 billion for WhatsApp, and they haven't figured out a way how to monetize these private messaging platforms.  The plan is, and I don't mean to interrupt you, Dan, is to build payment systems and e-commerce systems within these private messaging apps and that's how they would theoretically make money off of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do we know --</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  Driving Whats -- the -- it's really driving the WhatsApp acquisition in trying to monetize that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  But I mean why would that mean that your private conversations are not going to go to the advertisers?</p><p>IVES:  It does -- and look, and that's why right now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't.</p><p>IVES:  I mean fundamentally, this is a paper -- it's a -- it looks good on paper, but the jury's still out in terms of --</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think it looks good on paper.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't -- yes.  I don't know if it looks good on paper either.</p><p>FREEMAN:  From a -- from a shareholder perspective.  If you're saying -- when you said these huge audiences (INAUDIBLE) now we're going to tiny audiences, that doesn't sound like an advertisement bonanza --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, like --</p><p>IVES:  And investors have seen -- and investors have seen through it.  Investors looked at this and kind of, you know, I think shrugged their shoulders in terms of what this release ultimately (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It lets -- it -- well, you have to think about it in terms of, say, the iMessage that Apple offers on its phones, which is a protected messaging service, like in iMessage, you can use your Apple Pay and send cash to people.  That's the model that Facebook is potential using within the -- offering private messaging across its platform.</p><p>IVES:  That's really the ultimate goal --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>IVES:  -- on the next step, but the first step is where you have to really get those private message and you could ultimately monetize.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It seems --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then this raises the issue though of Mark Zuckerberg because he's -- well, a phony baloney, has damaged the company's reputation and his reputation so much, does anybody believe him?  Again, it's -- this is impossible to quantify, but it raises the issue of like -- but can they build out this idea with the users trusting this guy?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  Look, I think right now, it's an average, like, uphill battle for him to prove, you know, not just to consumers but even investors, that they can do this successfully, and that's why right now then you see the stock in the penalty box.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES:  And then the other side --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you still avoiding the stock?</p><p>IVES:  Look, we continue -- we would much rather own a name like, you know, a name like Microsoft, on the Clouds on large cap --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES:  -- rather than Facebook here, you know, in terms of our opinion, or even Apple.  Just to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about Apple?  I mean they have their own issues, slowing iPhone sales.  Apple's app fees might be next because companies are pushing back on how much Apple is charging them.</p><p>IVES:  Look, iPhones obviously fell off the cliff in China, and it's really about to services business, 50 billion a year right now.  And, look, you saw with Netflix, Netflix pulled the ripcord going off of, you know, the App Store, and I think that's why right now for Apple, March 25th, they'll announce their video streaming service, it's about putting few (INAUDIBLE) on that content on the services side.  We ultimately think Apple is continuing to have pressure to do an acquisition on content, on original content.  And I think right now, remember that case is going to the courts, too, in terms of the App Store.</p><p>PEEK:  It seems to me one of the sort of derivative problems for the tech companies is that with all these bad publicity, Europe is feeling freer and freer to impose taxes on revenues.  I mean, you know -- and this is a small thing, but Europeans really don't like these big tech companies very well, and I think the latest thing was in fact a proposal that they're going to start to tax revenues.  I mean maybe that's what all this bad publicity leads to, not regulations on privacy because we all agree that's unenforceable possibly.  But simply a money pull.</p><p>IVES:  Yes, and, look, the four letters that no tech company wants to hear, GDPR.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well --</p><p>IVES:  And if you look at what happened in Europe --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's in place.</p><p>IVES:  And it's in place, and that's really the star, and I think that's the fear of tech companies, but when you look at Apple specifically, services is really the linchpin to the valuation, the installed base.  Right now, it's seeing more and more pressure on the services side, and I think Netflix is just the start of this.</p><p>PEEK:  Interesting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We will leave it there.  It's great to have you on the program, Dan.</p><p>IVES:  No, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Dan Ives.  Joining us there.  Coming up, high emotions at General Motors this morning, the final Chevy rolls off the line at the company's Lordstown Ohio Plant, we're taking a look at what's next for the automaker.  Then flip-flop fine, a top tourist destination in Italy, wants you to pay up if you're not wearing the right footwear, back in a minute.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report.  For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger.  There was plenty for the home fans to cheer for day one at Indian Wells as American women proudly flew the red, white, and blue.  Seventeen-year-old Amanda Anisimova is the youngest player in the WTA's top 100, and she cruised into the second round with a straight sets win over Serbia's Aleksandra Krunic.</p><p>Sofia Kenin continued her excellent running form with a comeback win over China's Wang Yafan.  The 20-year-old fighting her way back into the match after losing the opening set 6-1.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOFIA KENIN, TENNIS PLAYER:  In the third set, I started off good, but then things went -- didn't go so well but I was fighting and like I said, you guys are amazing and I love playing out here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KLUPENGER:  And don't forget, you can watch all the action from Indian Wells on Tennis Channel.  Our daily live coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Democrats are pushing a vote to condemn Anti-Semitism, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi facing conflicts within her own party this morning.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Stu, we've been talking about this a lot this morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Hey, look, if you can't condemn Anti-Semitism, clearly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  -- don't be in congress.  If you can't condemn the scourge of centuries, you are a disgrace.  And furthermore, if you can't recognize and understand that there is a crisis on our border, you are wilfully blind.  And if you insist on undermining the present with constant investigations that will stretch out for the next couple of years, just looking for dirt of any kind, you're just a hater.  I'm frankly disgusted with the state of the Democrat Party, and I'm going to let everybody know on my three-hour show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  They are a disgrace.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I'll tell you, I had two Democratic congressman on in the last 15 minutes, Stu, and it kept asking that question, why do we need, you know, why do we need a resolution to condemn this?  It's like I don't get it, you know.  And why is she still on Foreign Affairs?</p><p>VARNEY:  They can't get the wording right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't -- I don't understand.</p><p>VARNEY:  Are you kidding me?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  You can't get the wording right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's pathetic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're going to be watching, Stu.  I know you'll have a lot more.  We will see you in about 15 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'll calm down.  I promise I'll calm down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, seriously, tell us how you really feel.</p><p>VARNEY:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stuart Varney.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his wonderful panel coming up.  First though, beyond clothes, Rent the Runway is moving into your home in a whole new way.  It's a partnership with West Elm and we've got it for you right after this, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A sad day for G.M. and the plant in Ohio, ending production.  Lauren Simonetti with the details there.  Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, Maria.  It's a sad story for the workers.  The last Chevy Cruze rolling off the assembly line at G.M.'s Lordstown Ohio Plant after more than half a century making about 16 million vehicles.  That factory is now idled, 1,700 jobs lost.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a day that I don't think anybody ever saw coming.  It's very tough.  It's hard to swallow.  It's almost surreal, like, is this really happening?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It'll night be a blow to the economy.  It'll be a blow to all the local businesses which rely on General Motors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The plant is the first of five North American factories that G.M. plans to close by next year.  Well, Rent the Runway is expanding beyond designer clothes, partnering with West Elm to allow subscribers to rent home goods, things like blankets, pillows, and quilts.  Rent the Runway's unlimited subscribers pay $159 a month to rent four outfits at a time for as long as they wish.  The home goods would count as one of the four items.  Just think millennials move around a lot, maybe they don't want to own furniture and the like.</p><p>And this, the Italian hot spot Cinque Terre is flipping its rules on tourists.  People will reportedly be fined up to $2,800 if they're caught wearing flip-flops, sandals, or pumps on hikes through those hills.  Officials say they're sick of rescuing people because they're wearing the wrong shoes.  Ooh.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I mean why would you wear high heels if you're hiking in Cinque Terre?  But anyway --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe people didn't know what they're up against.  I mean they don't --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  True.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- realize the terrain before they went out.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, you better realize now.  Otherwise, you're out 2,800 bucks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's a big number, right?  Italy needs money, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a lot of money, Liz.</p><p>PEEK:  Italy.  It's a growth industry.  Look, I think actually -- it's -- it is an interesting thing, when someone goes hiking in one of our national parks, they don't have a map, or they don't take with them, and then you have a search party that spends tens of thousands of dollars to find them.  There should be some accountability, right?  I mean I think this is kind of ridiculous, but, you know, I'm not totally unsympathetic that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They need to tell people beforehand.</p><p>PEEK:  -- people should be responsible.  Oh, totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  I think that's right -- exactly right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, here's a revenue --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe just a sign at the bottom of the trail would work.  I don't know.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just stay at the bottom of the trail.  Don't hike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they don't read -- but they're Italian, and they don't read Italian because they're from --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- everywhere else.</p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.  Maybe English, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, I'm proposing a $10,000 fine in New York City as a revenue raiser for all men wearing flip-flops because nobody needs to see your hairy toes.  I don't care if it's June or January.</p><p>PEEK:  That's discrimination, really, Dagen.  And so now --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was told by my wife and kids that my sandals were ugly so I went to flip-flops even though they're not my favorite.  Now -- you're telling me that now?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now you're facing Dagen's fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you not dirty your feet walking around in flip-flops in New York City?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I don't.</p><p>PEEK:  Sneakers are good (INAUDIBLE) sneakers are good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got final thoughts from this all-star panel when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>PEEK:  Better than those.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A couple of lines from the ECB Meeting and the news conference that's happening.  As you just saw, the markets have reversed course again and are now negative.  One of the issues is that Mario Draghi put a growth outlook out there and his target is now GDP of 1.1 percent for Eurozone in 2019, that's down from 1.7 percent.  So, even though the ECB today said, you know, fresh measures to stimulate the Eurozone's faltering economy, they also talked about the weakness there in terms of the growth outlook, 1.1 percent versus 1.7 percent, turn these markets down again.  Dow Industrials lower, S&amp;P, and the NASDAQ, along with the European indices down across the board.</p><p>Meanwhile, comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin raising some questions about tax policy in Europe particularly taking a page out of France.  James Freeman wrote the op-ed this week, and you asked in your op-ed, James, is Team Trump getting along too well with France?  A bad tax idea gets a surprise U.S. endorsement.  Tell us about it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I know there's a concern obviously that this white house is not getting along so well with our traditional allies and I'm -- but I'm worried maybe the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is going too far to make the French feel better.  He -- I don't know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He agreed with the French policy.</p><p>FREEMAN:  He agreed that we ought to have a minimum corporate income tax.  I think maybe there will be a debate about what this ought to be, but this is a terrible idea.  You mentioned the slow growth in Europe, there is slow growth in France.  Instead of trying to become more competitive, their politicians want to try and get everybody else to raise tax levels up to where they are.  This is a play by that guy, Bruno Le Maire to tax and punish tech companies based in the United States and to go after Ireland's competitive low 12-1/2 percent corporate tax rate.  He doesn't like it because Ireland grows faster and steals business from France, he doesn't like low tax rates because the U.S. does better than France.  Why the U.S. wants to encourage them --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- participate in this effort beyond --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  But I mean look at the rates.  I mean what is the corporate tax rate in Ireland and the corporate tax rate in France?  You write that the corporate tax rate in France was 33 percent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Very high.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Compare that to the U.S. at 21 percent now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This is the game-changer from this tax reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We used to at 40 when you count the local --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- state and local.  Now we're competitive than France.</p><p>PEEK:  But France is really an outlier now because almost --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  -- everyone else in Europe has lowered corporate tax rates, but I mean it's sort of shocking to me that Mnuchin would advocate anything to do with the French tax scheme because it is clearly contrary to what we tried to do in this country successfully.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Ireland's like 12 percent?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  12-1/2.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  12-1/2.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  Yes.  Very -- I'm just -- I'm hoping Mnuchin was confused and he wanted to make ties --</p><p>PEEK:  Lives now change.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- given that we've got these other trade disputes going on, but really, really negative signal.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, meantime, you have like Elizabeth Warren proposing the wealth taxing in the United States, unconstitutional, but she's trying to borrow from France, although it didn't work in France.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  They nixed it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That they had to nix it because guess what (INAUDIBLE) and they all leave because Maria keeps saying money's mobile.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And all these other nations, same thing happened with corporate tax rate.  All these other nations stepped back and go, oh, you don't want rich folks living in your country and paying taxes?  You want to confiscate their wealth?  You can come here.  Russia would be handing out passports right and left, to American if we tried to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's important to look at the growth story here.  I mean we're just hearing this morning from Mario Draghi who cut his Eurozone growth target to 1.1 percent for 2019, down from 1.7 percent.  Part of that is the bite from taxes.</p><p>PEEK:  And this is not a one quarter phenomenon.  I mean since the recession, basically the United States has outperformed handily Europe, and it's not just -- it's also regulations.  The E.U. bureaucracy is nonpareil, there is no other group that puts regulations on industry the way they do.  So, look, they got to figure this out.  I think Macron would like to lower taxes and kind of deregulate, but this liberal's view, corporate taxes, as a painless enterprise.  They don't believe that it impacts growth, they don't believe it flows through the consumer, both things are true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why the talking point on the left is that the tax cut plan went to the rich.</p><p>PEEK:  That's right.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's how they get there, by looking at the corporate tax rate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Family of four got --</p><p>FREEMAN:  And the real result is more jobs for people at all income levels.</p><p>PEEK:  That's exactly right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And, of course, there was a cut at every income level, which often is overlooked.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they doubled the standard deduction.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  family of four got a tax cut of more than $4,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, guys.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Look, the, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And great piece.  Dagen McDowell, James Freeman, Liz Peek, good to see you.</p><p>PEEK:  Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  It was a great show today.  Thank you for joining us.  Be sure to tune tomorrow, we've got the coverage of our jobs in America, special, it kicks off at 8:00 a.m. Eastern as we identify where the jobs.  We're expecting 180,000 jobs created in the month of February when we get that report tomorrow.  And the unemployment rate to move lower to 3.9 percent.  That'll do it for us today.  We'll see you again tomorrow.  Seize the day, everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins now, Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  And good morning, Maria.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2189096406</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKT-36P1-DY0W-42CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th.  8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Your top stories right now, Chinese telecom giant Huawei making it official.  The company filing a lawsuit against the U.S. saying that Congress acted as judge jury and executer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are on edge this morning but well off of the lows of the morning.  Dow Industrials now down just nine points, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up, it is positive territory by a fraction.  And NASDAQ is -- right now lower by two.  A big bounce after the ECB meeting this morning where we did not see any moves in interest rates.  Another decline yesterday for the markets making it three in a row.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look, Dow Industrials down 133 points yesterday.  The S&amp;P was down 18 and the NASDAQ down 70.  The European Central Bank have left interest rates unchanged this morning setting a new round of long-term loans.  ECB President Mario Draghi holding a news conference later this hour.  We will bring you all of the developments but as you see her too, we're seeing a big of a turnaround after the ECB meeting.</p><p>Markets are well off of the lows, the FT-100 is down just 15 points, the CAC quarante in Paris is actually positive by three points and the DAX Index Germany still down but down just 10 points right now.  Pretty good bounce after the ECB meeting this morning.  In Asia overnight, market mostly lower with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite was up a fraction.</p><p>The push for privacy at Facebook.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg shifting focus to private communication.  The details on this major strategy shift to world's largest social network coming up.  And Apple facing slowing iPhone sales.  We are taking a look at what the technology giant is looking to do instead with services that's become a big business for Apple.</p><p>Plus, a new twist on a Philly cheesesteak.  It is raising some eyebrows because it's salty and sweet as well.  The controversy coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman and Fox News Contributor Liz Peek.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Good news from the ECB I guess.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  Great, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see if the ECB actually starts easing at some point because the economy in Europe is quite slow.  The other day we had Mohamed el-Erian on and he said that the Eurozone would be lucky to see growth -- GDP growth of one percent this year.</p><p>PEEK:  And that's pretty much the forecast I think and there was an expectation they were going to lower that.  I don't know if they did that or not but, yes, they need a change in regimen lower over there.  Lower taxes, deregulation, sound familiar?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what you write about in France with the 33 percent corporate rate in your op-ed today, James.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  So, instead of doing the reforms you're talking about they want to get the rest of the world to force tax rates higher, not good for growth but you wonder with Europe how long they can do this extending and pretending the very loose monetary policy.  The government of Greece this week is back in the bond market borrowing money, healthy demand, less than four percent and the European regulator said they haven't fulfilled their promises, they haven't done the privatization and either kind of reforms that you would want to see.</p><p>So, it doesn't really make sense why these highly indebted governments with zero growth economies can borrow so cheaply but they'll see how long they can --</p><p>PEEK:  Because they know if they're going to about bailed out by the ECB, that's why, right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  But I --</p><p>PEEK:  There is back stop.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think there's a reckoning at some point if you don't --</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  For sure.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- transition as we have done to a real economy.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Based on by the decision making.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  No.  I was just going to say this -- the -- I want to point this out, the U.S. economy is so much healthier than the rest of the world.  That's why our trade deficit hit a record last year and I will call out a lot of these publications, a lot of these media organizations the way that they're framing this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're trying to bait the President into doing something that's destructive to economic growth in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They're framing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- what a failure and expanded, he's trying to narrow the gap.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Front page of the New York Times, U.S. trade deficit under President bulges to record failing a Trump metric.  I think that they're trying to go and poke the President into doings something rash.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think you're reading it right.  And by the way, we'll talk more about your op-ed on tax rates in France and the U.S.'s response what Steven Mnuchin said about that.  But first our top story this hour is Huawei, it is suing the United States as President Trump signals progress with China on trade talks.  Blake Burman is covering the story, he's at the White House this morning.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  You're right.  Huawei is now fighting back as it has sued the U.S. government in a Federal Court.  At issue here is a provision that was in the middle of the National Defense Authorization Act that was put into law at the end of last year which says that Federal agencies cannot use Huawei products.</p><p>Now Huawei is saying that that is singling out company and that they claim is unlawful.  Huawei's chief information officer though has said in the recent days that the company should be trusted and is completely separate from the Chinese government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI:  On theft of the intellectual property by the China government that's not us, the China government does not speak for us, we don't speak through the China government.  I applaud the efforts of the United States and others to try to crack down on the global theft of intellectual property which has been a disgrace over the last 15 years that we haven't done enough about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The issue of I.P. theft as you heard him mention there is at the heart of a possible trade deal between the U.S. and China.  President Trump yesterday continued to remain more optimistic than pessimistic at the prospects of a detail.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Gong OK.  We're moving along, we're discussing that with Lindsey and Mitt.  That moving along well, we'll see what happens.  There either going to be a good deal or it's not going to be a deal but I think they're moving on very nicely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  As we've talked about, Maria, any possible deal needs to eventually be signed off by President Trump and President Xi of China, a possible meeting between those two are likely meeting between those two as it relates to a possible date.  That has not yet though confirmed up by the White House.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We've been hearing rumblings of the end of March in Mar-a-Lago, right?</p><p>BURMAN:  End of March, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.</p><p>BURMAN:  Yes.  End of March, we'll see.  Still awaiting the official word from the folks behind me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you.  Blake Burman is at the White House this morning.  And joining me right now is House Ways and Means Committee Member, Congressman Tom Reed and House Financial Services member, Congressman Josh Gottheimer.  Good to see you, gentlemen.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK:  Good to see you.</p><p>REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D), NEW JERSEY:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Congressman Reed, let me kick this off with you.  Your reaction in terms of Huawei suing the U.S.?</p><p>REED:  Well, you know, obviously, they have been one of the individuals we've been looking at in regards to intellectual property theft, the unfair trade advantages that Chinese companies as well as Chinese government have taken advantage for for years.  And so I think now accountability is being imposed by this administration and that's the right thing to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I guess -- is this somewhere where we have common ground, Congressman Gottheimer in terms of China?  You know.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  Definitely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Huawei says, it's -- the Congress, you and your colleagues acted as judge, jury, and executioner.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Well, I think we need to hold them accountable.  I think Tom is exactly right on this.  And, you know, we know that there has been questions of practices and a lot of our security at stake here and we have to be incredibly mindful that in wary of their intentions and hold them accountable at every step.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean, how do you do that?  Right?  Isn't that the real question here?  because isn't this a culture?  I mean, they have been stealing I.P. for decades and I don't know that you change a culture so easily.  They've got a lot of money, they're acquiring companies from energy to financial, acquiring companies in Silicon Valley, they've got their Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley to soak up more intelligence from the U.S.  How do you -- how do you turn this ship?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  I think -- I think we make sure that we don't put their 5G centers all over the United States.  We make sure we got great companies like Qualcomm doing that and be very careful from a national security perspective of watching our I.P. and being vigilant.  And I think the administration is holding them accountable on it.  Right, Tom?</p><p>REED:  And I would say, Maria, this is -- most Americans don't realize, we don't have a trade agreement with China per se.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>REED:  They work under an old WTO type standard.  We need enforcement mechanisms at the table negotiated that.  When you engage in these activities, this theft of our intellectual property.  There is accountability immediately and enforceable accountability in those agreements.  That's why I so appreciate President Trump sitting at the table face-to-face saying enough is enough, we're going to hold you accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The enforcement is really critical here because they've said they would do things in the past and then they didn't follow up like they said they would buy all this beef.  So you think there is a measure, Congressman Gottheimer that you can actually put in place that if things go awry, they don't keep up their promises, you can quickly and easily put the tariffs back in place?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  I think we have to and I think we need to use our legislative authority to do that.  And of course, the administration has to enforce it enforce all trade deals.  But I think we have to act and I agree that with Tom that we've got to find a way the mechanisms in place to make sure that we can react so they can't steal our intellectual property, all of our technology they've been doing it for a long time and it's time to put our foot down about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I agree.  I think this is such an important subject, we've been covering it a lot, so thank you for input both of you on this.  Let me move to another issue, Congressman Gottheimer because House Democrats obviously are divided over how to deal with this measure on freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's comments regarding U.S. policy towards Israel, a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, being delayed in the House as a result.</p><p>What's with all the delays here?  I mean, can't we all agree that anti-Semitism should not be in the Foreign Affairs Committee and in the Congress?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think there is sweeping agreement about the fact that there is no room for anti-Semitism in our country or any hate speech or Islamophobia.  You know, there's no room for that.  And in our public discourse, obviously, someone who is Jewish, the idea that you would question my -- some would question my loyalty to the United States of America because of my fact is unacceptable.</p><p>Just like it was unacceptable when they questioned President Kennedy's allegiance to our great country because he is catholic.  There's no room for that in our country and it's clearly anti-Semitic.  You know, I think there's -- there are different ways to approach this and broadly talk about a lot of rhetoric that's happened in our country which is unacceptable over many years but especially over the last couple years.</p><p>And I think we need to address that too but we can't let-- get lost that what happened here and one member of Congress said about me and my faith and others are questioning our loyalty  is unacceptable.  We want to make sure that that does not get lost, move our foot down and say no anti-semitism in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I mean, we all agree with that.  I mean, we all agree with you but how come it keeps getting delayed?  Like what's the delay?  What are we questioning?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think it's just a -- I think honestly it's a question of all -- there're so many issues that of course concerning when it comes hate in this country.  It's what else should we address in a resolution we bring to the floor and I think that's what really the discussion is about at this point.  I don't think anyone is questioning that the anti-Semitic comments that were made were unacceptable.</p><p>And we have to make sure that speak out against them.  I think it's the approach in how we do it.  And, you know, we're working obviously together to try to get there.  But, you know, it's unacceptable and there is no room for it as you point out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think she should step off foreign affairs?  I mean, wouldn't that cure this?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Well, I think that's certainly above my pay grade but I'll tell -- but I know what I feel about what was said and that's what I can speak to.  It's unacceptable questioning anyone's loyalty in Congress to the United States of America because of their fate.  It's unacceptable and we have to -- and we just have to make sure that people understand in this country there's no room for it in our rhetoric.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's the Nancy Pelosi's decision then, right, Congressman Reed?</p><p>REED:  Yes, it is. But Maria, I would add one thing and I so appreciate Josh leading the charge standing up for being, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Me too.</p><p>REED:  And leading that charge and taking on anti-semitism head on.  But this is also a symptom of extremism in our politics.  This is more about a political issue that I think we used to face potentially in the Republican Party after 2010 that are now seeing the Democratic Party.  You see a very strong vocal minority trying to push back on this issue and it's about internal politics more than dealing with the actual root cause.</p><p>And I encourage my colleagues on the Democratic side.  Stand with Josh, send the message, anti-semitism is not allowed.  Anybody who speaks it, anybody who believes in it needs to be about called and shouldn't be in any party, Democrat or Republican.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's nice to see you, guys, having this common ground.  Let me ask you about taxes, Congressman Reed.  The state and local tax burden for New York, 12.7 percent, that s that is the highest in the country.  New Jersey ranked number three by the way, Congressman  --</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Yes.  Not good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gottheimer.  State and local tax burden of 12.2 percent, this information according to the tax foundation, both your states dealing with an exodus of residents fleeing to lower tax states.  So, Congressman Reed, what are you going to do about it?</p><p>REED:  I'm going to keep putting pressure on our state capitol and encourage my fellow New Yorkers wake up, we need to change policies out of Albany that are going to lower taxes, business a business friendly climate to the table so that people invest across all spectrums in New York and also stand with the existing businesses and residents first before you hand out goodies to potential people that you want to entice to come to the state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, Congressman Gottheimer, same deal in New Jersey.  Do you guys have the power to actually move the needle on this?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER:  First on those jobs, I'll take them in Jersey, Tom, especially in Amazon.  We'll take them but let me, you know, be clear what I feel.  We've got to cut taxes in New Jersey, this tax hike bill that came through last year raised taxes on it.  Jersey is pointing out on those statistics because of gutting the state and local tax reduction.  We've got to reinstate it, stop double taxation, so we're working on that but frankly I'm sick and tired of these other states taking of our -- tacking of our tax dollar and Jersey and, you know, we're not getting anything back for it.</p><p>We've got a tunnel between New York and New Jersey that's crumbling.  We can't get any resources for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: We're sick and tired of it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to solve deduction back, right?  You want that solved?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Yes.  Got to get -- got to get salt back, it's critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, both of you, good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: It's good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>REED:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Reed and Gottheimer there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching shares of Kroger this morning.  The stock falling on earnings.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange checking that out in the broader markets.  Gerri, good morning.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  That's right.  A double miss for Kroger on both the top line and the bottom line.  Take a look at these numbers, the stock down nearly 10 percent here.  EPS of 52 cents a share, that was the expectation, they came in at 48 cents a share.  Revenue estimate was 28.38 billion --nah ah, 28.1 billion, as you can see right here,</p><p>So a big disappointment in this -- what is really a narrow margin business, very difficult business because the margins are so narrow.  This company spending heavily on technology and delivery services to better compete with companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon.  As you remember on Friday, the stock was down mightily after Amazon announced they're going to start their own line of grocery stores in major American cities.</p><p>Now, tonight, the opposite side of the coin, Costco coming in big expectations for that company.  EPS estimates of $1.69 at stock, up marginally here.  We expect a positive earnings result and revenue should be higher as well at 35 billion.  So higher membership fees at E-commerce revenue should be higher for Costco.  I guess we'll have to wait and see but Kroger, double miss today.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you.  Coming up next, defending the border.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended President Trump's emergency declaration over the border crisis.  We're going to bring you what she said.  And then, flip-flop fine.  The beautiful clinic, Cinque Terre Italian Coastline is ready to implement a no flip-flop rule for tourists.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defending the President's national emergency declaration.  Lauren Simonetti with headlines now.  Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Secretary Nielsen saying that the country faces a serious and sustained crisis at the southern border in her testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  The projections are dire at the current pace we are on track to encounter close to one million illegal aliens at our southern border this year.</p><p>Our capacity is already severally restrained but these increases will overwhelm the system entirely.  This is not a manufactured crisis, this is truly an emergency.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Senate expected to pass the measure in opposition to the national emergency declaration.  The President has vowed to veto that resolution.  Well, SoftBank's next big bet is in Latin America.  The Japanese company launching a $5 billion fund to invest in tech start-ups in the region.  SoftBank says, it will work with the Saudi backed $99-billion SoftBank vision fund to make bigger investments.</p><p>It's already shaken up the tech industry with splashy investments and start-ups including Uber and WeWork.  And finally an historic Philadelphia restaurant is putting together two of the city's famous foods, cheesecake and pound cake.  Joe's Steaks and Soda Soups is selling a hybrid sandwich of the two.  Every Tuesday this month pound cake cheese steak.  You can even top it with chocolate icing.</p><p>So it's added to the menu to celebrate Jo's Steak's 70th anniversary.  Some people are writing on Twitter.  April Fool's Day is next month but, yes, it's not getting the best rest reviews as you can imagine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  You don't have to very dessert, you just have the dinner and dessert all in one.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  That's very practicable, Maria.  Yes.  That's a good justification.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't like it.  What do you guys, think?  Dagen?  Do you eat that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just thinking it's like a hamburger instead of a bun, you use two Krispy Kreme donuts, that's the same -- it's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  Just stick with the regular bond and mushrooms and pepperoni.  Some people call that a Carmen, it's outstanding.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.</p><p>PEEK:  It all sounds like a heart attack on a plate, honestly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It does.</p><p>PEEK:  Forgive me but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Italian stuff, that a Philly too, when I used to eat meat that had the -- it's broccoli raab and the beef steak.  I remember that being quite delicious.</p><p>PEEK:  It's a different direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Coming up.  Facebook's privacy push, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plan to go private sharing after losing users.  Details next.  And then awaiting key economic data this morning.  Initial jobless claims are out, moments from now, we will bring you the numbers and see if there's an impact on markets.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th.  Your top stories right now just before 8 a.m. on the East Coast.  New stimulus from the European Central Bank sparking a turnaround.  Futures as you see are higher across the board.  The ECB left rates unchanged.  In Europe the European Central Bank taking new measures to support the struggling European economy.</p><p>The ECB is launching a new round of long-term loans.  As you can see, the markets completely reversed course.  In the U.S. as well as in Europe, the FT-100 is still lower but just by nine points.  And the CAC Quarante is up 11 points, and DAX Index up 15.  Ditto for the U.S. markets as you saw a moment ago.  We are waiting on jobless claims which will be out in about 30 sections right here.</p><p>In Asia overnight, take a look at the markets.  And as you can see, it was lower across the board with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite, did squeak out a fractional gain.  iPhone sales are slowing.  There could be more problems brewing for Apple.  We're going to take a look this morning.  And the end of an era today.  General Motors closing its Lordstown, Ohio plant which has been open since 1966.</p><p>Plus, a fine over flip-flops.  Get this.  A major tourist destination in Italy focusing on footwear.  You will have to pay up.  We have the story.  But first we begin this half an hour.  It's Facebook's future.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a new plan to address privacy concerns after losing users.  Joining me now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director of Equity Research, Dan Ives.  Dan, it's good to see you.</p><p>DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the -- let's talk about what you're seeing out of -- out of this company, and whether or not this is the way to move in terms of Facebook and private.</p><p>IVES:  Yes, I think we'll get to posturing, too.  I mean given what they've seen the Beltway in Brussels to some extent here, you know, they really need, from a privacy perspective, to kind of give, you know, I think directionally go in this move.  (INAUDIBLE) comes down to monetization.  The game hasn't changed Facebook in terms of how they're going to monetize this.  And I think that's what really investors are focused on.  But I think right now, they continue to face an uphill battle on the privacy side as we've seen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So they're going to offer encrypted messaging across all of it's products, some of the messages, the private conversations will be ephemeral, is the word, the operative word.  The problem is Facebook has never figured out a way how to make money, expect from revenue from advertisers.  Ninety-eight percent of its revenue comes from advertisers.  How did -- this actually hurts Facebook.  And to your point, the issue hasn't been really -- it's how Facebook treats our private information.  Just because you say our conversations are going to be private in the future, how are you going to prove to us that you're not going to be selling our data, that you're going to be combing through our conversations to get the juiciest details to then offload to advertisers for money?</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean look, they're playing nice in the sandbox, but the reality is it's 98 percent revenue, and that's not going to change, that's why, you know, as they went through the congress, and they went in Brussels, they've kind of done some of those moves.  But if you'll get numbers, you've seen obviously advertising revenue hasn't really been hit.  And I think this is just a move where they need to continue to go from a privacy perspective, in that direction, especially when you look at Cook and Apple and you saw obviously the advertisement at CES, I mean they've kind of gotten the other side.  So right now, there's kind of a battle brewing among tech giants with Facebook on one side, Apple on the other.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, I said this privately really quickly.  I went through my preferences on my Facebook app, I don't -- I rarely use Facebook anymore.  I do use Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, and under my ad preferences, it said advertisers who uploaded a contact list with your information in it is a thousand advertisers.  And I've barely used that service in the last --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you can actually do that, you can actually go in and see how many advertisers uploaded your content.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And who there are.  And who there are.  And I had -- you have to go through though and block every single one of them, basically delete them.</p><p>PEEK:  It's almost impossible.</p><p>IVES:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  And what we know is from last week, revelation, I think that they're -- even if you're not on Facebook, they're taking your information somehow and selling it.  So, it seems to me that this constant parade of mea culpas from Facebook are become meaningless.  I mean they're going to have to do something to address this issue or people are going to stop using Facebook.</p><p>IVES:  And there's a lack of teeth in terms of what you're seeing from a regulatory perspective.</p><p>PEEK:  Sure.</p><p>IVES:  That's pushing back the background.  (INAUDIBLE) the stocks jumped significantly, investors now view it as background noise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES:  Versus maybe a year ago where it actually was a big overhang in stock.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't understand the business model going forward.  You're saying that they're not going to get their money from fees, from subscription fees.  It's still going to be almost entirely advertising.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said it's 98 percent.</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean, look, you're going to -- you'll -- you could start to slightly to move that, but realistically right now and you look at it in the numbers, advertising (INAUDIBLE) Facebook is.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So you -- if you're transition in a big way from people publishing stuff and large audiences being able to see it to private communications in small groups where audiences are very much restricted from seeing it.  That sounds, on its face, like much lower advertising revenue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>IVES:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Is there a reason they can charge more per thousand or per chat group?  Or how do they --</p><p>IVES:  And then --</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- sustain the revenue?</p><p>IVES:  And now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you --and you compared it to WhatsApp.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  WhatsApp, which Facebook owns --</p><p>IVES:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is private when they spend -- how much did they spend?  $19 billion for WhatsApp, and they haven't figured out a way how to monetize these private messaging platforms.  The plan is, and I don't mean to interrupt you, Dan, is to build payment systems and e-commerce systems within these private messaging apps and that's how they would theoretically make money off of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do we know --</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  Driving Whats -- the -- it's really driving the WhatsApp acquisition in trying to monetize that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  But I mean why would that mean that your private conversations are not going to go to the advertisers?</p><p>IVES:  It does -- and look, and that's why right now --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't.</p><p>IVES:  I mean fundamentally, this is a paper -- it's a -- it looks good on paper, but the jury's still out in terms of --</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't think it looks good on paper.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't -- yes.  I don't know if it looks good on paper either.</p><p>FREEMAN:  From a -- from a shareholder perspective.  If you're saying -- when you said these huge audiences (INAUDIBLE) now we're going to tiny audiences, that doesn't sound like an advertisement bonanza --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, like --</p><p>IVES:  And investors have seen -- and investors have seen through it.  Investors looked at this and kind of, you know, I think shrugged their shoulders in terms of what this release ultimately (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It lets -- it -- well, you have to think about it in terms of, say, the iMessage that Apple offers on its phones, which is a protected messaging service, like in iMessage, you can use your Apple Pay and send cash to people.  That's the model that Facebook is potential using within the -- offering private messaging across its platform.</p><p>IVES:  That's really the ultimate goal --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>IVES:  -- on the next step, but the first step is where you have to really get those private message and you could ultimately monetize.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It seems --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then this raises the issue though of Mark Zuckerberg because he's -- well, a phony baloney, has damaged the company's reputation and his reputation so much, does anybody believe him?  Again, it's -- this is impossible to quantify, but it raises the issue of like -- but can they build out this idea with the users trusting this guy?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?</p><p>IVES:  Yes.  Look, I think right now, it's an average, like, uphill battle for him to prove, you know, not just to consumers but even investors, that they can do this successfully, and that's why right now then you see the stock in the penalty box.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES:  And then the other side --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you still avoiding the stock?</p><p>IVES:  Look, we continue -- we would much rather own a name like, you know, a name like Microsoft, on the Clouds on large cap --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES:  -- rather than Facebook here, you know, in terms of our opinion, or even Apple.  Just to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about Apple?  I mean they have their own issues, slowing iPhone sales.  Apple's app fees might be next because companies are pushing back on how much Apple is charging them.</p><p>IVES:  Look, iPhones obviously fell off the cliff in China, and it's really about to services business, 50 billion a year right now.  And, look, you saw with Netflix, Netflix pulled the ripcord going off of, you know, the App Store, and I think that's why right now for Apple, March 25th, they'll announce their video streaming service, it's about putting few (INAUDIBLE) on that content on the services side.  We ultimately think Apple is continuing to have pressure to do an acquisition on content, on original content.  And I think right now, remember that case is going to the courts, too, in terms of the App Store.</p><p>PEEK:  It seems to me one of the sort of derivative problems for the tech companies is that with all these bad publicity, Europe is feeling freer and freer to impose taxes on revenues.  I mean, you know -- and this is a small thing, but Europeans really don't like these big tech companies very well, and I think the latest thing was in fact a proposal that they're going to start to tax revenues.  I mean maybe that's what all this bad publicity leads to, not regulations on privacy because we all agree that's unenforceable possibly.  But simply a money pull.</p><p>IVES:  Yes, and, look, the four letters that no tech company wants to hear, GDPR.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well --</p><p>IVES:  And if you look at what happened in Europe --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's in place.</p><p>IVES:  And it's in place, and that's really the star, and I think that's the fear of tech companies, but when you look at Apple specifically, services is really the linchpin to the valuation, the installed base.  Right now, it's seeing more and more pressure on the services side, and I think Netflix is just the start of this.</p><p>PEEK:  Interesting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We will leave it there.  It's great to have you on the program, Dan.</p><p>IVES:  No, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Dan Ives.  Joining us there.  Coming up, high emotions at General Motors this morning, the final Chevy rolls off the line at the company's Lordstown Ohio Plant, we're taking a look at what's next for the automaker.  Then flip-flop fine, a top tourist destination in Italy, wants you to pay up if you're not wearing the right footwear, back in a minute.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report.  For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger.  There was plenty for the home fans to cheer for day one at Indian Wells as American women proudly flew the red, white, and blue.  Seventeen-year-old Amanda Anisimova is the youngest player in the WTA's top 100, and she cruised into the second round with a straight sets win over Serbia's Aleksandra Krunic.</p><p>Sofia Kenin continued her excellent running form with a comeback win over China's Wang Yafan.  The 20-year-old fighting her way back into the match after losing the opening set 6-1.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOFIA KENIN, TENNIS PLAYER:  In the third set, I started off good, but then things went -- didn't go so well but I was fighting and like I said, you guys are amazing and I love playing out here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KLUPENGER:  And don't forget, you can watch all the action from Indian Wells on Tennis Channel.  Our daily live coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Democrats are pushing a vote to condemn Anti-Semitism, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi facing conflicts within her own party this morning.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that.  Stu, we've been talking about this a lot this morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Hey, look, if you can't condemn Anti-Semitism, clearly --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  -- don't be in congress.  If you can't condemn the scourge of centuries, you are a disgrace.  And furthermore, if you can't recognize and understand that there is a crisis on our border, you are wilfully blind.  And if you insist on undermining the present with constant investigations that will stretch out for the next couple of years, just looking for dirt of any kind, you're just a hater.  I'm frankly disgusted with the state of the Democrat Party, and I'm going to let everybody know on my three-hour show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  They are a disgrace.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I'll tell you, I had two Democratic congressman on in the last 15 minutes, Stu, and it kept asking that question, why do we need, you know, why do we need a resolution to condemn this?  It's like I don't get it, you know.  And why is she still on Foreign Affairs?</p><p>VARNEY:  They can't get the wording right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't -- I don't understand.</p><p>VARNEY:  Are you kidding me?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  You can't get the wording right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's pathetic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're going to be watching, Stu.  I know you'll have a lot more.  We will see you in about 15 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY:  I'll calm down.  I promise I'll calm down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, seriously, tell us how you really feel.</p><p>VARNEY:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stuart Varney.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his wonderful panel coming up.  First though, beyond clothes, Rent the Runway is moving into your home in a whole new way.  It's a partnership with West Elm and we've got it for you right after this, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A sad day for G.M. and the plant in Ohio, ending production.  Lauren Simonetti with the details there.  Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, Maria.  It's a sad story for the workers.  The last Chevy Cruze rolling off the assembly line at G.M.'s Lordstown Ohio Plant after more than half a century making about 16 million vehicles.  That factory is now idled, 1,700 jobs lost.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is a day that I don't think anybody ever saw coming.  It's very tough.  It's hard to swallow.  It's almost surreal, like, is this really happening?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It'll night be a blow to the economy.  It'll be a blow to all the local businesses which rely on General Motors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The plant is the first of five North American factories that G.M. plans to close by next year.  Well, Rent the Runway is expanding beyond designer clothes, partnering with West Elm to allow subscribers to rent home goods, things like blankets, pillows, and quilts.  Rent the Runway's unlimited subscribers pay $159 a month to rent four outfits at a time for as long as they wish.  The home goods would count as one of the four items.  Just think millennials move around a lot, maybe they don't want to own furniture and the like.</p><p>And this, the Italian hot spot Cinque Terre is flipping its rules on tourists.  People will reportedly be fined up to $2,800 if they're caught wearing flip-flops, sandals, or pumps on hikes through those hills.  Officials say they're sick of rescuing people because they're wearing the wrong shoes.  Ooh.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I mean why would you wear high heels if you're hiking in Cinque Terre?  But anyway --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe people didn't know what they're up against.  I mean they don't --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  True.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- realize the terrain before they went out.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, you better realize now.  Otherwise, you're out 2,800 bucks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's a big number, right?  Italy needs money, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a lot of money, Liz.</p><p>PEEK:  Italy.  It's a growth industry.  Look, I think actually -- it's -- it is an interesting thing, when someone goes hiking in one of our national parks, they don't have a map, or they don't take with them, and then you have a search party that spends tens of thousands of dollars to find them.  There should be some accountability, right?  I mean I think this is kind of ridiculous, but, you know, I'm not totally unsympathetic that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They need to tell people beforehand.</p><p>PEEK:  -- people should be responsible.  Oh, totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  I think that's right -- exactly right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, here's a revenue --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe just a sign at the bottom of the trail would work.  I don't know.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just stay at the bottom of the trail.  Don't hike.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they don't read -- but they're Italian, and they don't read Italian because they're from --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- everywhere else.</p><p>FREEMAN:  All right.  Maybe English, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, I'm proposing a $10,000 fine in New York City as a revenue raiser for all men wearing flip-flops because nobody needs to see your hairy toes.  I don't care if it's June or January.</p><p>PEEK:  That's discrimination, really, Dagen.  And so now --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I was told by my wife and kids that my sandals were ugly so I went to flip-flops even though they're not my favorite.  Now -- you're telling me that now?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now you're facing Dagen's fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you not dirty your feet walking around in flip-flops in New York City?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I don't.</p><p>PEEK:  Sneakers are good (INAUDIBLE) sneakers are good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got final thoughts from this all-star panel when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>PEEK:  Better than those.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A couple of lines from the ECB Meeting and the news conference that's happening.  As you just saw, the markets have reversed course again and are now negative.  One of the issues is that Mario Draghi put a growth outlook out there and his target is now GDP of 1.1 percent for Eurozone in 2019, that's down from 1.7 percent.  So, even though the ECB today said, you know, fresh measures to stimulate the Eurozone's faltering economy, they also talked about the weakness there in terms of the growth outlook, 1.1 percent versus 1.7 percent, turn these markets down again.  Dow Industrials lower, S&amp;P, and the NASDAQ, along with the European indices down across the board.</p><p>Meanwhile, comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin raising some questions about tax policy in Europe particularly taking a page out of France.  James Freeman wrote the op-ed this week, and you asked in your op-ed, James, is Team Trump getting along too well with France?  A bad tax idea gets a surprise U.S. endorsement.  Tell us about it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I know there's a concern obviously that this white house is not getting along so well with our traditional allies and I'm -- but I'm worried maybe the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is going too far to make the French feel better.  He -- I don't know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He agreed with the French policy.</p><p>FREEMAN:  He agreed that we ought to have a minimum corporate income tax.  I think maybe there will be a debate about what this ought to be, but this is a terrible idea.  You mentioned the slow growth in Europe, there is slow growth in France.  Instead of trying to become more competitive, their politicians want to try and get everybody else to raise tax levels up to where they are.  This is a play by that guy, Bruno Le Maire to tax and punish tech companies based in the United States and to go after Ireland's competitive low 12-1/2 percent corporate tax rate.  He doesn't like it because Ireland grows faster and steals business from France, he doesn't like low tax rates because the U.S. does better than France.  Why the U.S. wants to encourage them --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- participate in this effort beyond --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  But I mean look at the rates.  I mean what is the corporate tax rate in Ireland and the corporate tax rate in France?  You write that the corporate tax rate in France was 33 percent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Very high.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Compare that to the U.S. at 21 percent now.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This is the game-changer from this tax reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We used to at 40 when you count the local --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- state and local.  Now we're competitive than France.</p><p>PEEK:  But France is really an outlier now because almost --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>PEEK:  -- everyone else in Europe has lowered corporate tax rates, but I mean it's sort of shocking to me that Mnuchin would advocate anything to do with the French tax scheme because it is clearly contrary to what we tried to do in this country successfully.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Ireland's like 12 percent?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  12-1/2.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  12-1/2.</p><p>FREEMAN:  That's right.  Yes.  Very -- I'm just -- I'm hoping Mnuchin was confused and he wanted to make ties --</p><p>PEEK:  Lives now change.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- given that we've got these other trade disputes going on, but really, really negative signal.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, meantime, you have like Elizabeth Warren proposing the wealth taxing in the United States, unconstitutional, but she's trying to borrow from France, although it didn't work in France.</p><p>PEEK:  Yes.  They nixed it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That they had to nix it because guess what (INAUDIBLE) and they all leave because Maria keeps saying money's mobile.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And all these other nations, same thing happened with corporate tax rate.  All these other nations stepped back and go, oh, you don't want rich folks living in your country and paying taxes?  You want to confiscate their wealth?  You can come here.  Russia would be handing out passports right and left, to American if we tried to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's important to look at the growth story here.  I mean we're just hearing this morning from Mario Draghi who cut his Eurozone growth target to 1.1 percent for 2019, down from 1.7 percent.  Part of that is the bite from taxes.</p><p>PEEK:  And this is not a one quarter phenomenon.  I mean since the recession, basically the United States has outperformed handily Europe, and it's not just -- it's also regulations.  The E.U. bureaucracy is nonpareil, there is no other group that puts regulations on industry the way they do.  So, look, they got to figure this out.  I think Macron would like to lower taxes and kind of deregulate, but this liberal's view, corporate taxes, as a painless enterprise.  They don't believe that it impacts growth, they don't believe it flows through the consumer, both things are true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why the talking point on the left is that the tax cut plan went to the rich.</p><p>PEEK:  That's right.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's how they get there, by looking at the corporate tax rate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Family of four got --</p><p>FREEMAN:  And the real result is more jobs for people at all income levels.</p><p>PEEK:  That's exactly right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And, of course, there was a cut at every income level, which often is overlooked.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they doubled the standard deduction.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  family of four got a tax cut of more than $4,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, guys.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Look, the, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And great piece.  Dagen McDowell, James Freeman, Liz Peek, good to see you.</p><p>PEEK:  Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  It was a great show today.  Thank you for joining us.  Be sure to tune tomorrow, we've got the coverage of our jobs in America, special, it kicks off at 8:00 a.m. Eastern as we identify where the jobs.  We're expecting 180,000 jobs created in the month of February when we get that report tomorrow.  And the unemployment rate to move lower to 3.9 percent.  That'll do it for us today.  We'll see you again tomorrow.  Seize the day, everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins now, Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  And good morning, Maria.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2189097679</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKT-36P1-DY0W-42CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th. 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Your top stories right now, Chinese telecom giant Huawei making it official. The company filing a lawsuit against the U.S. saying that Congress acted as judge jury and executer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are on edge this morning but well off of the lows of the morning. Dow Industrials now down just nine points, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up, it is positive territory by a fraction. And NASDAQ is -- right now lower by two. A big bounce after the ECB meeting this morning where we did not see any moves in interest rates. Another decline yesterday for the markets making it three in a row.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look, Dow Industrials down 133 points yesterday. The S&amp;P was down 18 and the NASDAQ down 70. The European Central Bank have left interest rates unchanged this morning setting a new round of long-term loans. ECB President Mario Draghi holding a news conference later this hour. We will bring you all of the developments but as you see her too, we're seeing a big of a turnaround after the ECB meeting.</p><p>Markets are well off of the lows, the FT-100 is down just 15 points, the CAC quarante in Paris is actually positive by three points and the DAX Index Germany still down but down just 10 points right now. Pretty good bounce after the ECB meeting this morning. In Asia overnight, market mostly lower with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite was up a fraction.</p><p>The push for privacy at Facebook. CEO Mark Zuckerberg shifting focus to private communication. The details on this major strategy shift to world's largest social network coming up. And Apple facing slowing iPhone sales. We are taking a look at what the technology giant is looking to do instead with services that's become a big business for Apple.</p><p>Plus, a new twist on a Philly cheesesteak. It is raising some eyebrows because it's salty and sweet as well. The controversy coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman and Fox News Contributor Liz Peek. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Good news from the ECB I guess.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: Great, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see if the ECB actually starts easing at some point because the economy in Europe is quite slow. The other day we had Mohamed el-Erian on and he said that the Eurozone would be lucky to see growth -- GDP growth of one percent this year.</p><p>PEEK: And that's pretty much the forecast I think and there was an expectation they were going to lower that. I don't know if they did that or not but, yes, they need a change in regimen lower over there. Lower taxes, deregulation, sound familiar?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's what you write about in France with the 33 percent corporate rate in your op-ed today, James.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. So, instead of doing the reforms you're talking about they want to get the rest of the world to force tax rates higher, not good for growth but you wonder with Europe how long they can do this extending and pretending the very loose monetary policy. The government of Greece this week is back in the bond market borrowing money, healthy demand, less than four percent and the European regulator said they haven't fulfilled their promises, they haven't done the privatization and either kind of reforms that you would want to see.</p><p>So, it doesn't really make sense why these highly indebted governments with zero growth economies can borrow so cheaply but they'll see how long they can --</p><p>PEEK: Because they know if they're going to about bailed out by the ECB, that's why, right?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. But I --</p><p>PEEK: There is back stop.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think there's a reckoning at some point if you don't --</p><p>PEEK: Yes. For sure.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- transition as we have done to a real economy.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Based on by the decision making.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: No. I was just going to say this -- the -- I want to point this out, the U.S. economy is so much healthier than the rest of the world. That's why our trade deficit hit a record last year and I will call out a lot of these publications, a lot of these media organizations the way that they're framing this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're trying to bait the President into doing something that's destructive to economic growth in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. They're framing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- what a failure and expanded, he's trying to narrow the gap.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Front page of the New York Times, U.S. trade deficit under President bulges to record failing a Trump metric. I think that they're trying to go and poke the President into doings something rash.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I think you're reading it right. And by the way, we'll talk more about your op-ed on tax rates in France and the U.S.'s response what Steven Mnuchin said about that. But first our top story this hour is Huawei, it is suing the United States as President Trump signals progress with China on trade talks. Blake Burman is covering the story, he's at the White House this morning. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. You're right. Huawei is now fighting back as it has sued the U.S. government in a Federal Court. At issue here is a provision that was in the middle of the National Defense Authorization Act that was put into law at the end of last year which says that Federal agencies cannot use Huawei products.</p><p>Now Huawei is saying that that is singling out company and that they claim is unlawful. Huawei's chief information officer though has said in the recent days that the company should be trusted and is completely separate from the Chinese government.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: On theft of the intellectual property by the China government that's not us, the China government does not speak for us, we don't speak through the China government. I applaud the efforts of the United States and others to try to crack down on the global theft of intellectual property which has been a disgrace over the last 15 years that we haven't done enough about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The issue of I.P. theft as you heard him mention there is at the heart of a possible trade deal between the U.S. and China. President Trump yesterday continued to remain more optimistic than pessimistic at the prospects of a detail.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Gong OK. We're moving along, we're discussing that with Lindsey and Mitt. That moving along well, we'll see what happens. There either going to be a good deal or it's not going to be a deal but I think they're moving on very nicely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: As we've talked about, Maria, any possible deal needs to eventually be signed off by President Trump and President Xi of China, a possible meeting between those two are likely meeting between those two as it relates to a possible date. That has not yet though confirmed up by the White House. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We've been hearing rumblings of the end of March in Mar-a-Lago, right?</p><p>BURMAN: End of March, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see.</p><p>BURMAN: Yes. End of March, we'll see. Still awaiting the official word from the folks behind me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you. Blake Burman is at the White House this morning. And joining me right now is House Ways and Means Committee Member, Congressman Tom Reed and House Financial Services member, Congressman Josh Gottheimer. Good to see you, gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R), NEW YORK: Good to see you.</p><p>REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D), NEW JERSEY: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Congressman Reed, let me kick this off with you. Your reaction in terms of Huawei suing the U.S.?</p><p>REED: Well, you know, obviously, they have been one of the individuals we've been looking at in regards to intellectual property theft, the unfair trade advantages that Chinese companies as well as Chinese government have taken advantage for for years. And so I think now accountability is being imposed by this administration and that's the right thing to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I guess -- is this somewhere where we have common ground, Congressman Gottheimer in terms of China? You know.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Definitely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Huawei says, it's -- the Congress, you and your colleagues acted as judge, jury, and executioner.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Well, I think we need to hold them accountable. I think Tom is exactly right on this. And, you know, we know that there has been questions of practices and a lot of our security at stake here and we have to be incredibly mindful that in wary of their intentions and hold them accountable at every step.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean, how do you do that? Right? Isn't that the real question here? because isn't this a culture? I mean, they have been stealing I.P. for decades and I don't know that you change a culture so easily. They've got a lot of money, they're acquiring companies from energy to financial, acquiring companies in Silicon Valley, they've got their Confucius centers in and around Silicon Valley to soak up more intelligence from the U.S. How do you -- how do you turn this ship?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think -- I think we make sure that we don't put their 5G centers all over the United States. We make sure we got great companies like Qualcomm doing that and be very careful from a national security perspective of watching our I.P. and being vigilant. And I think the administration is holding them accountable on it. Right, Tom?</p><p>REED: And I would say, Maria, this is -- most Americans don't realize, we don't have a trade agreement with China per se.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>REED: They work under an old WTO type standard. We need enforcement mechanisms at the table negotiated that. When you engage in these activities, this theft of our intellectual property. There is accountability immediately and enforceable accountability in those agreements. That's why I so appreciate President Trump sitting at the table face-to-face saying enough is enough, we're going to hold you accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. The enforcement is really critical here because they've said they would do things in the past and then they didn't follow up like they said they would buy all this beef. So you think there is a measure, Congressman Gottheimer that you can actually put in place that if things go awry, they don't keep up their promises, you can quickly and easily put the tariffs back in place?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think we have to and I think we need to use our legislative authority to do that. And of course, the administration has to enforce it enforce all trade deals. But I think we have to act and I agree that with Tom that we've got to find a way the mechanisms in place to make sure that we can react so they can't steal our intellectual property, all of our technology they've been doing it for a long time and it's time to put our foot down about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I agree. I think this is such an important subject, we've been covering it a lot, so thank you for input both of you on this. Let me move to another issue, Congressman Gottheimer because House Democrats obviously are divided over how to deal with this measure on freshman Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's comments regarding U.S. policy towards Israel, a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, being delayed in the House as a result.</p><p>What's with all the delays here? I mean, can't we all agree that anti- Semitism should not be in the Foreign Affairs Committee and in the Congress?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think there is sweeping agreement about the fact that there is no room for anti-Semitism in our country or any hate speech or Islamophobia. You know, there's no room for that. And in our public discourse, obviously, someone who is Jewish, the idea that you would question my -- some would question my loyalty to the United States of America because of my fact is unacceptable.</p><p>Just like it was unacceptable when they questioned President Kennedy's allegiance to our great country because he is catholic. There's no room for that in our country and it's clearly anti-Semitic. You know, I think there's -- there are different ways to approach this and broadly talk about a lot of rhetoric that's happened in our country which is unacceptable over many years but especially over the last couple years.</p><p>And I think we need to address that too but we can't let-- get lost that what happened here and one member of Congress said about me and my faith and others are questioning our loyalty is unacceptable. We want to make sure that that does not get lost, move our foot down and say no anti- semitism in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I mean, we all agree with that. I mean, we all agree with you but how come it keeps getting delayed? Like what's the delay? What are we questioning?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: I think it's just a -- I think honestly it's a question of all -- there're so many issues that of course concerning when it comes hate in this country. It's what else should we address in a resolution we bring to the floor and I think that's what really the discussion is about at this point. I don't think anyone is questioning that the anti-Semitic comments that were made were unacceptable.</p><p>And we have to make sure that speak out against them. I think it's the approach in how we do it. And, you know, we're working obviously together to try to get there. But, you know, it's unacceptable and there is no room for it as you point out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think she should step off foreign affairs? I mean, wouldn't that cure this?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Well, I think that's certainly above my pay grade but I'll tell -- but I know what I feel about what was said and that's what I can speak to. It's unacceptable questioning anyone's loyalty in Congress to the United States of America because of their fate. It's unacceptable and we have to -- and we just have to make sure that people understand in this country there's no room for it in our rhetoric.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it's the Nancy Pelosi's decision then, right, Congressman Reed?</p><p>REED: Yes, it is. But Maria, I would add one thing and I so appreciate Josh leading the charge standing up for being, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Me too.</p><p>REED: And leading that charge and taking on anti-semitism head on. But this is also a symptom of extremism in our politics. This is more about a political issue that I think we used to face potentially in the Republican Party after 2010 that are now seeing the Democratic Party. You see a very strong vocal minority trying to push back on this issue and it's about internal politics more than dealing with the actual root cause.</p><p>And I encourage my colleagues on the Democratic side. Stand with Josh, send the message, anti-semitism is not allowed. Anybody who speaks it, anybody who believes in it needs to be about called and shouldn't be in any party, Democrat or Republican.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's nice to see you, guys, having this common ground. Let me ask you about taxes, Congressman Reed. The state and local tax burden for New York, 12.7 percent, that s that is the highest in the country. New Jersey ranked number three by the way, Congressman --</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Yes. Not good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gottheimer. State and local tax burden of 12.2 percent, this information according to the tax foundation, both your states dealing with an exodus of residents fleeing to lower tax states. So, Congressman Reed, what are you going to do about it?</p><p>REED: I'm going to keep putting pressure on our state capitol and encourage my fellow New Yorkers wake up, we need to change policies out of Albany that are going to lower taxes, business a business friendly climate to the table so that people invest across all spectrums in New York and also stand with the existing businesses and residents first before you hand out goodies to potential people that you want to entice to come to the state.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, Congressman Gottheimer, same deal in New Jersey. Do you guys have the power to actually move the needle on this?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: First on those jobs, I'll take them in Jersey, Tom, especially in Amazon. We'll take them but let me, you know, be clear what I feel. We've got to cut taxes in New Jersey, this tax hike bill that came through last year raised taxes on it. Jersey is pointing out on those statistics because of gutting the state and local tax reduction. We've got to reinstate it, stop double taxation, so we're working on that but frankly I'm sick and tired of these other states taking of our -- tacking of our tax dollar and Jersey and, you know, we're not getting anything back for it.</p><p>We've got a tunnel between New York and New Jersey that's crumbling. We can't get any resources for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: We're sick and tired of it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You want to solve deduction back, right? You want that solved?</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: Yes. Got to get -- got to get salt back, it's critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, both of you, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>GOTTHEIMER: It's good to be with you, Maria.</p><p>REED: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Reed and Gottheimer there. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are watching shares of Kroger this morning. The stock falling on earnings. Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange checking that out in the broader markets. Gerri, good morning.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Maria. That's right. A double miss for Kroger on both the top line and the bottom line. Take a look at these numbers, the stock down nearly 10 percent here. EPS of 52 cents a share, that was the expectation, they came in at 48 cents a share. Revenue estimate was 28.38 billion --nah ah, 28.1 billion, as you can see right here,</p><p>So a big disappointment in this -- what is really a narrow margin business, very difficult business because the margins are so narrow. This company spending heavily on technology and delivery services to better compete with companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon. As you remember on Friday, the stock was down mightily after Amazon announced they're going to start their own line of grocery stores in major American cities.</p><p>Now, tonight, the opposite side of the coin, Costco coming in big expectations for that company. EPS estimates of $1.69 at stock, up marginally here. We expect a positive earnings result and revenue should be higher as well at 35 billion. So higher membership fees at E-commerce revenue should be higher for Costco. I guess we'll have to wait and see but Kroger, double miss today. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you. Coming up next, defending the border. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended President Trump's emergency declaration over the border crisis. We're going to bring you what she said. And then, flip-flop fine. The beautiful clinic, Cinque Terre Italian Coastline is ready to implement a no flip-flop rule for tourists. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defending the President's national emergency declaration. Lauren Simonetti with headlines now. Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. Secretary Nielsen saying that the country faces a serious and sustained crisis at the southern border in her testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: The projections are dire at the current pace we are on track to encounter close to one million illegal aliens at our southern border this year.</p><p>Our capacity is already severally restrained but these increases will overwhelm the system entirely. This is not a manufactured crisis, this is truly an emergency.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: The Senate expected to pass the measure in opposition to the national emergency declaration. The President has vowed to veto that resolution. Well, SoftBank's next big bet is in Latin America. The Japanese company launching a $5 billion fund to invest in tech start-ups in the region. SoftBank says, it will work with the Saudi backed $99-billion SoftBank vision fund to make bigger investments.</p><p>It's already shaken up the tech industry with splashy investments and start-ups including Uber and WeWork. And finally an historic Philadelphia restaurant is putting together two of the city's famous foods, cheesecake and pound cake. Joe's Steaks and Soda Soups is selling a hybrid sandwich of the two. Every Tuesday this month pound cake cheese steak. You can even top it with chocolate icing.</p><p>So it's added to the menu to celebrate Jo's Steak's 70th anniversary. Some people are writing on Twitter. April Fool's Day is next month but, yes, it's not getting the best rest reviews as you can imagine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. You don't have to very dessert, you just have the dinner and dessert all in one.</p><p>SIMONETTI: That's very practicable, Maria. Yes. That's a good justification.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't like it. What do you guys, think? Dagen? Do you eat that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm just thinking it's like a hamburger instead of a bun, you use two Krispy Kreme donuts, that's the same -- it's just --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Just stick with the regular bond and mushrooms and pepperoni. Some people call that a Carmen, it's outstanding.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>PEEK: It all sounds like a heart attack on a plate, honestly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It does.</p><p>PEEK: Forgive me but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Italian stuff, that a Philly too, when I used to eat meat that had the -- it's broccoli raab and the beef steak. I remember that being quite delicious.</p><p>PEEK: It's a different direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Coming up. Facebook's privacy push, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plan to go private sharing after losing users. Details next. And then awaiting key economic data this morning. Initial jobless claims are out, moments from now, we will bring you the numbers and see if there's an impact on markets. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 7th. Your top stories right now just before 8 a.m. on the East Coast. New stimulus from the European Central Bank sparking a turnaround. Futures as you see are higher across the board. The ECB left rates unchanged. In Europe the European Central Bank taking new measures to support the struggling European economy.</p><p>The ECB is launching a new round of long-term loans. As you can see, the markets completely reversed course. In the U.S. as well as in Europe, the FT-100 is still lower but just by nine points. And the CAC Quarante is up 11 points, and DAX Index up 15. Ditto for the U.S. markets as you saw a moment ago. We are waiting on jobless claims which will be out in about 30 sections right here.</p><p>In Asia overnight, take a look at the markets. And as you can see, it was lower across the board with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite, did squeak out a fractional gain. iPhone sales are slowing. There could be more problems brewing for Apple. We're going to take a look this morning. And the end of an era today. General Motors closing its Lordstown, Ohio plant which has been open since 1966.</p><p>Plus, a fine over flip-flops. Get this. A major tourist destination in Italy focusing on footwear. You will have to pay up. We have the story. But first we begin this half an hour. It's Facebook's future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a new plan to address privacy concerns after losing users. Joining me now is Wedbush Securities Managing Director of Equity Research, Dan Ives. Dan, it's good to see you.</p><p>DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So the -- let's talk about what you're seeing out of -- out of this company, and whether or not this is the way to move in terms of Facebook and private.</p><p>IVES: Yes, I think we'll get to posturing, too. I mean given what they've seen the Beltway in Brussels to some extent here, you know, they really need, from a privacy perspective, to kind of give, you know, I think directionally go in this move. (INAUDIBLE) comes down to monetization. The game hasn't changed Facebook in terms of how they're going to monetize this. And I think that's what really investors are focused on. But I think right now, they continue to face an uphill battle on the privacy side as we've seen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So they're going to offer encrypted messaging across all of it's products, some of the messages, the private conversations will be ephemeral, is the word, the operative word. The problem is Facebook has never figured out a way how to make money, expect from revenue from advertisers. Ninety-eight percent of its revenue comes from advertisers. How did -- this actually hurts Facebook. And to your point, the issue hasn't been really -- it's how Facebook treats our private information. Just because you say our conversations are going to be private in the future, how are you going to prove to us that you're not going to be selling our data, that you're going to be combing through our conversations to get the juiciest details to then offload to advertisers for money?</p><p>IVES: Yes. I mean look, they're playing nice in the sandbox, but the reality is it's 98 percent revenue, and that's not going to change, that's why, you know, as they went through the congress, and they went in Brussels, they've kind of done some of those moves. But if you'll get numbers, you've seen obviously advertising revenue hasn't really been hit. And I think this is just a move where they need to continue to go from a privacy perspective, in that direction, especially when you look at Cook and Apple and you saw obviously the advertisement at CES, I mean they've kind of gotten the other side. So right now, there's kind of a battle brewing among tech giants with Facebook on one side, Apple on the other.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dan, I said this privately really quickly. I went through my preferences on my Facebook app, I don't -- I rarely use Facebook anymore. I do use Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, and under my ad preferences, it said advertisers who uploaded a contact list with your information in it is a thousand advertisers. And I've barely used that service in the last --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you can actually do that, you can actually go in and see how many advertisers uploaded your content.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And who there are. And who there are. And I had -- you have to go through though and block every single one of them, basically delete them.</p><p>PEEK: It's almost impossible.</p><p>IVES: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: And what we know is from last week, revelation, I think that they're -- even if you're not on Facebook, they're taking your information somehow and selling it. So, it seems to me that this constant parade of mea culpas from Facebook are become meaningless. I mean they're going to have to do something to address this issue or people are going to stop using Facebook.</p><p>IVES: And there's a lack of teeth in terms of what you're seeing from a regulatory perspective.</p><p>PEEK: Sure.</p><p>IVES: That's pushing back the background. (INAUDIBLE) the stocks jumped significantly, investors now view it as background noise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES: Versus maybe a year ago where it actually was a big overhang in stock.</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't understand the business model going forward. You're saying that they're not going to get their money from fees, from subscription fees. It's still going to be almost entirely advertising.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You said it's 98 percent.</p><p>IVES: Yes. I mean, look, you're going to -- you'll -- you could start to slightly to move that, but realistically right now and you look at it in the numbers, advertising (INAUDIBLE) Facebook is.</p><p>FREEMAN: OK. So you -- if you're transition in a big way from people publishing stuff and large audiences being able to see it to private communications in small groups where audiences are very much restricted from seeing it. That sounds, on its face, like much lower advertising revenue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IVES: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Is there a reason they can charge more per thousand or per chat group? Or how do they --</p><p>IVES: And then --</p><p>FREEMAN: -- sustain the revenue?</p><p>IVES: And now --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you --and you compared it to WhatsApp.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. WhatsApp, which Facebook owns --</p><p>IVES: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- is private when they spend -- how much did they spend? $19 billion for WhatsApp, and they haven't figured out a way how to monetize these private messaging platforms. The plan is, and I don't mean to interrupt you, Dan, is to build payment systems and e-commerce systems within these private messaging apps and that's how they would theoretically make money off of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So how do we know --</p><p>IVES: Yes. Driving Whats -- the -- it's really driving the WhatsApp acquisition in trying to monetize that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes. But I mean why would that mean that your private conversations are not going to go to the advertisers?</p><p>IVES: It does -- and look, and that's why right now --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It doesn't.</p><p>IVES: I mean fundamentally, this is a paper -- it's a -- it looks good on paper, but the jury's still out in terms of --</p><p>FREEMAN: I don't think it looks good on paper.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't -- yes. I don't know if it looks good on paper either.</p><p>FREEMAN: From a -- from a shareholder perspective. If you're saying -- when you said these huge audiences (INAUDIBLE) now we're going to tiny audiences, that doesn't sound like an advertisement bonanza --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, like --</p><p>IVES: And investors have seen -- and investors have seen through it. Investors looked at this and kind of, you know, I think shrugged their shoulders in terms of what this release ultimately (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FREEMAN: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It lets -- it -- well, you have to think about it in terms of, say, the iMessage that Apple offers on its phones, which is a protected messaging service, like in iMessage, you can use your Apple Pay and send cash to people. That's the model that Facebook is potential using within the -- offering private messaging across its platform.</p><p>IVES: That's really the ultimate goal --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>IVES: -- on the next step, but the first step is where you have to really get those private message and you could ultimately monetize.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It seems --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then this raises the issue though of Mark Zuckerberg because he's -- well, a phony baloney, has damaged the company's reputation and his reputation so much, does anybody believe him? Again, it's -- this is impossible to quantify, but it raises the issue of like -- but can they build out this idea with the users trusting this guy?</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think?</p><p>IVES: Yes. Look, I think right now, it's an average, like, uphill battle for him to prove, you know, not just to consumers but even investors, that they can do this successfully, and that's why right now then you see the stock in the penalty box.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES: And then the other side --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you still avoiding the stock?</p><p>IVES: Look, we continue -- we would much rather own a name like, you know, a name like Microsoft, on the Clouds on large cap --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>IVES: -- rather than Facebook here, you know, in terms of our opinion, or even Apple. Just to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what about Apple? I mean they have their own issues, slowing iPhone sales. Apple's app fees might be next because companies are pushing back on how much Apple is charging them.</p><p>IVES: Look, iPhones obviously fell off the cliff in China, and it's really about to services business, 50 billion a year right now. And, look, you saw with Netflix, Netflix pulled the ripcord going off of, you know, the App Store, and I think that's why right now for Apple, March 25th, they'll announce their video streaming service, it's about putting few (INAUDIBLE) on that content on the services side. We ultimately think Apple is continuing to have pressure to do an acquisition on content, on original content. And I think right now, remember that case is going to the courts, too, in terms of the App Store.</p><p>PEEK: It seems to me one of the sort of derivative problems for the tech companies is that with all these bad publicity, Europe is feeling freer and freer to impose taxes on revenues. I mean, you know -- and this is a small thing, but Europeans really don't like these big tech companies very well, and I think the latest thing was in fact a proposal that they're going to start to tax revenues. I mean maybe that's what all this bad publicity leads to, not regulations on privacy because we all agree that's unenforceable possibly. But simply a money pull.</p><p>IVES: Yes, and, look, the four letters that no tech company wants to hear, GDPR.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, well --</p><p>IVES: And if you look at what happened in Europe --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's in place.</p><p>IVES: And it's in place, and that's really the star, and I think that's the fear of tech companies, but when you look at Apple specifically, services is really the linchpin to the valuation, the installed base. Right now, it's seeing more and more pressure on the services side, and I think Netflix is just the start of this.</p><p>PEEK: Interesting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We will leave it there. It's great to have you on the program, Dan.</p><p>IVES: No, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Dan Ives. Joining us there. Coming up, high emotions at General Motors this morning, the final Chevy rolls off the line at the company's Lordstown Ohio Plant, we're taking a look at what's next for the automaker. Then flip-flop fine, a top tourist destination in Italy, wants you to pay up if you're not wearing the right footwear, back in a minute.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report. For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger. There was plenty for the home fans to cheer for day one at Indian Wells as American women proudly flew the red, white, and blue. Seventeen-year-old Amanda Anisimova is the youngest player in the WTA's top 100, and she cruised into the second round with a straight sets win over Serbia's Aleksandra Krunic.</p><p>Sofia Kenin continued her excellent running form with a comeback win over China's Wang Yafan. The 20-year-old fighting her way back into the match after losing the opening set 6-1.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOFIA KENIN, TENNIS PLAYER: In the third set, I started off good, but then things went -- didn't go so well but I was fighting and like I said, you guys are amazing and I love playing out here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KLUPENGER: And don't forget, you can watch all the action from Indian Wells on Tennis Channel. Our daily live coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern. I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Democrats are pushing a vote to condemn Anti-Semitism, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi facing conflicts within her own party this morning. Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in on that. Stu, we've been talking about this a lot this morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. Hey, look, if you can't condemn Anti-Semitism, clearly --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: -- don't be in congress. If you can't condemn the scourge of centuries, you are a disgrace. And furthermore, if you can't recognize and understand that there is a crisis on our border, you are wilfully blind. And if you insist on undermining the present with constant investigations that will stretch out for the next couple of years, just looking for dirt of any kind, you're just a hater. I'm frankly disgusted with the state of the Democrat Party, and I'm going to let everybody know on my three-hour show.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: They are a disgrace.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I'll tell you, I had two Democratic congressman on in the last 15 minutes, Stu, and it kept asking that question, why do we need, you know, why do we need a resolution to condemn this? It's like I don't get it, you know. And why is she still on Foreign Affairs?</p><p>VARNEY: They can't get the wording right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't -- I don't understand.</p><p>VARNEY: Are you kidding me?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: You can't get the wording right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: That's pathetic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we're going to be watching, Stu. I know you'll have a lot more. We will see you in about 15 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY: I'll calm down. I promise I'll calm down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, seriously, tell us how you really feel.</p><p>VARNEY: OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stuart Varney. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart and his wonderful panel coming up. First though, beyond clothes, Rent the Runway is moving into your home in a whole new way. It's a partnership with West Elm and we've got it for you right after this, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A sad day for G.M. and the plant in Ohio, ending production. Lauren Simonetti with the details there. Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, Maria. It's a sad story for the workers. The last Chevy Cruze rolling off the assembly line at G.M.'s Lordstown Ohio Plant after more than half a century making about 16 million vehicles. That factory is now idled, 1,700 jobs lost.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a day that I don't think anybody ever saw coming. It's very tough. It's hard to swallow. It's almost surreal, like, is this really happening?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It'll night be a blow to the economy. It'll be a blow to all the local businesses which rely on General Motors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: The plant is the first of five North American factories that G.M. plans to close by next year. Well, Rent the Runway is expanding beyond designer clothes, partnering with West Elm to allow subscribers to rent home goods, things like blankets, pillows, and quilts. Rent the Runway's unlimited subscribers pay $159 a month to rent four outfits at a time for as long as they wish. The home goods would count as one of the four items. Just think millennials move around a lot, maybe they don't want to own furniture and the like.</p><p>And this, the Italian hot spot Cinque Terre is flipping its rules on tourists. People will reportedly be fined up to $2,800 if they're caught wearing flip-flops, sandals, or pumps on hikes through those hills. Officials say they're sick of rescuing people because they're wearing the wrong shoes. Ooh.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I mean why would you wear high heels if you're hiking in Cinque Terre? But anyway --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, maybe people didn't know what they're up against. I mean they don't --</p><p>SIMONETTI: True.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- realize the terrain before they went out.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Well, you better realize now. Otherwise, you're out 2,800 bucks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It's a big number, right? Italy needs money, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a lot of money, Liz.</p><p>PEEK: Italy. It's a growth industry. Look, I think actually -- it's -- it is an interesting thing, when someone goes hiking in one of our national parks, they don't have a map, or they don't take with them, and then you have a search party that spends tens of thousands of dollars to find them. There should be some accountability, right? I mean I think this is kind of ridiculous, but, you know, I'm not totally unsympathetic that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They need to tell people beforehand.</p><p>PEEK: -- people should be responsible. Oh, totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: I think that's right -- exactly right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, here's a revenue --</p><p>FREEMAN: Maybe just a sign at the bottom of the trail would work. I don't know.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just stay at the bottom of the trail. Don't hike.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they don't read -- but they're Italian, and they don't read Italian because they're from --</p><p>FREEMAN: Oh.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- everywhere else.</p><p>FREEMAN: All right. Maybe English, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, I'm proposing a $10,000 fine in New York City as a revenue raiser for all men wearing flip-flops because nobody needs to see your hairy toes. I don't care if it's June or January.</p><p>PEEK: That's discrimination, really, Dagen. And so now --</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I was told by my wife and kids that my sandals were ugly so I went to flip-flops even though they're not my favorite. Now -- you're telling me that now?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now you're facing Dagen's fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you not dirty your feet walking around in flip-flops in New York City?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I don't.</p><p>PEEK: Sneakers are good (INAUDIBLE) sneakers are good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got final thoughts from this all-star panel when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>PEEK: Better than those.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A couple of lines from the ECB Meeting and the news conference that's happening. As you just saw, the markets have reversed course again and are now negative. One of the issues is that Mario Draghi put a growth outlook out there and his target is now GDP of 1.1 percent for Eurozone in 2019, that's down from 1.7 percent. So, even though the ECB today said, you know, fresh measures to stimulate the Eurozone's faltering economy, they also talked about the weakness there in terms of the growth outlook, 1.1 percent versus 1.7 percent, turn these markets down again. Dow Industrials lower, S&amp;P, and the NASDAQ, along with the European indices down across the board.</p><p>Meanwhile, comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin raising some questions about tax policy in Europe particularly taking a page out of France. James Freeman wrote the op-ed this week, and you asked in your op- ed, James, is Team Trump getting along too well with France? A bad tax idea gets a surprise U.S. endorsement. Tell us about it.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I know there's a concern obviously that this white house is not getting along so well with our traditional allies and I'm -- but I'm worried maybe the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is going too far to make the French feel better. He -- I don't know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: He agreed with the French policy.</p><p>FREEMAN: He agreed that we ought to have a minimum corporate income tax. I think maybe there will be a debate about what this ought to be, but this is a terrible idea. You mentioned the slow growth in Europe, there is slow growth in France. Instead of trying to become more competitive, their politicians want to try and get everybody else to raise tax levels up to where they are. This is a play by that guy, Bruno Le Maire to tax and punish tech companies based in the United States and to go after Ireland's competitive low 12-1/2 percent corporate tax rate. He doesn't like it because Ireland grows faster and steals business from France, he doesn't like low tax rates because the U.S. does better than France. Why the U.S. wants to encourage them --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- participate in this effort beyond --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know. But I mean look at the rates. I mean what is the corporate tax rate in Ireland and the corporate tax rate in France? You write that the corporate tax rate in France was 33 percent.</p><p>FREEMAN: Very high.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Compare that to the U.S. at 21 percent now.</p><p>FREEMAN: This is the game-changer from this tax reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: We used to at 40 when you count the local --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- state and local. Now we're competitive than France.</p><p>PEEK: But France is really an outlier now because almost --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: -- everyone else in Europe has lowered corporate tax rates, but I mean it's sort of shocking to me that Mnuchin would advocate anything to do with the French tax scheme because it is clearly contrary to what we tried to do in this country successfully. And --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Ireland's like 12 percent?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: 12-1/2.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 12-1/2.</p><p>FREEMAN: That's right. Yes. Very -- I'm just -- I'm hoping Mnuchin was confused and he wanted to make ties --</p><p>PEEK: Lives now change.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- given that we've got these other trade disputes going on, but really, really negative signal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, meantime, you have like Elizabeth Warren proposing the wealth taxing in the United States, unconstitutional, but she's trying to borrow from France, although it didn't work in France.</p><p>PEEK: Yes. They nixed it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That they had to nix it because guess what (INAUDIBLE) and they all leave because Maria keeps saying money's mobile.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And all these other nations, same thing happened with corporate tax rate. All these other nations stepped back and go, oh, you don't want rich folks living in your country and paying taxes? You want to confiscate their wealth? You can come here. Russia would be handing out passports right and left, to American if we tried to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And it's important to look at the growth story here. I mean we're just hearing this morning from Mario Draghi who cut his Eurozone growth target to 1.1 percent for 2019, down from 1.7 percent. Part of that is the bite from taxes.</p><p>PEEK: And this is not a one quarter phenomenon. I mean since the recession, basically the United States has outperformed handily Europe, and it's not just -- it's also regulations. The E.U. bureaucracy is nonpareil, there is no other group that puts regulations on industry the way they do. So, look, they got to figure this out. I think Macron would like to lower taxes and kind of deregulate, but this liberal's view, corporate taxes, as a painless enterprise. They don't believe that it impacts growth, they don't believe it flows through the consumer, both things are true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why the talking point on the left is that the tax cut plan went to the rich.</p><p>PEEK: That's right. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's how they get there, by looking at the corporate tax rate.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Family of four got --</p><p>FREEMAN: And the real result is more jobs for people at all income levels.</p><p>PEEK: That's exactly right.</p><p>FREEMAN: And, of course, there was a cut at every income level, which often is overlooked.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they doubled the standard deduction.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: family of four got a tax cut of more than $4,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right, guys.</p><p>FREEMAN: Look, the, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great show.</p><p>FREEMAN: Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And great piece. Dagen McDowell, James Freeman, Liz Peek, good to see you.</p><p>PEEK: Nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. It was a great show today. Thank you for joining us. Be sure to tune tomorrow, we've got the coverage of our jobs in America, special, it kicks off at 8:00 a.m. Eastern as we identify where the jobs. We're expecting 180,000 jobs created in the month of February when we get that report tomorrow. And the unemployment rate to move lower to 3.9 percent. That'll do it for us today. We'll see you again tomorrow. Seize the day, everybody. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins now, Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: And good morning, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019030703cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKB-XDP1-DXH2-63BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As the global economy is under tremendous downward pressure, all parties should take strong measures to jointly further liberalise and facilitate trade and investment, and create a fair, transparent, and predictable investment environment,\" it said in a fax.\u00a0SOME BRIGHT SPOTS\u00a0Investors said some less sensitive sectors such as gaming are still open to Chinese players.\u00a0Tencent Holdings has had some of its apps in India banned, but not popular games such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. The company recently launched a new California-based gaming studio and plans more such operations.\u00a0A huge domestic market is by far the biggest profit centre for China's tech firms, and some countries remain keen to accept Chinese investment.\u00a0\"Global markets are big and Southeast Asia and Europe should still be open to Chinese companies,\" said one Beijing-based, internet-focussed hedge fund investor.\u00a0But some startups in Southeast Asia that were previously open to taking Chinese money are becoming more reluctant, said David Chang, managing director of Hong Kong-based MindWorks Capital.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"For example, if I take ByteDance on my (equity) capitalization table and then ByteDance gets blocked and blacklisted in the U.S., my dream of listing on the Nasdaq is limited,\" he said, referring to the U.S. stock exchange popular with tech firms.\u00a0<br/>Efforts by Chinese companies to change the minds of the foreign regulators have had little effect in the absence of\u00a0<br/>policy<br/>\u00a0changes by Beijing.\u00a0<br/>ByteDance says it has ring-fenced TikTok from its China operations and poached a Disney executive to head the unit. That has failed to assuage Washington.\u00a0<br/>\"That's about all you can do,\" said Mark Natkin, managing director at Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting. \"Push the public relations as hard as you can, hire managers that give you more of a foreign feel, and keep your fingers crossed that there isn't another geopolitical flashpoint.\"\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1277188</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-7NB1-DYDW-70MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Zhang Yiming, founder of ByteDance, the operator of short video app TikTok, has plastered his Beijing headquarters with posters including a cover of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's book \"How Google Works\", and has long said he will build a global firm that can compete with U.S. tech giants.    But the two companies which best exemplify China's ambitions to challenge U.S. tech dominance are now stymied by strains in relations between China and countries including the United States, India, Australia and Britain.

As the global economy is under tremendous downward pressure, all parties should take strong measures to jointly further liberalise and facilitate trade and investment, and create a fair, transparent, and predictable investment environment,\" it said in a fax.     Bright spots    Investors said some less sensitive sectors such as gaming are still open to Chinese players.    Tencent Holdings has had some of its apps in India banned, but not popular games such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. The company recently launched a new California-based gaming studio and plans more such operations.    A huge domestic market is by far the biggest profit centre for China's tech firms, and some countries remain keen to accept Chinese investment.    \"Global markets are big and Southeast Asia and Europe should still be open to Chinese companies,\" said one Beijing-based, internet-focussed hedge fund investor.    But some startups in Southeast Asia that were previously open to taking Chinese money are becoming more reluctant, said David Chang, managing director of Hong Kong-based MindWorks Capital.    \"For example, if I take ByteDance on my (equity) capitalization table and then ByteDance gets blocked and blacklisted in the U.S., my dream of listing on the Nasdaq is limited,\" he said, referring to the U.S. stock exchange popular with tech firms.

ByteDance says it has ring-fenced TikTok from its China operations and poached a Disney executive to head the unit. That has failed to assuage Washington.    \"That's about all you can do,\" said Mark Natkin, managing director at Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting. \"Push the public relations as hard as you can, hire managers that give you more of a foreign feel, and keep your fingers crossed that there isn't another geopolitical flashpoint.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42692181317</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FM-6XS1-F07F-82TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Business Standard India</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Julia Chatterley. This is FIRST MOVE, and here's your need to know. Hoping for harmony: Huawei unveils its Android alternative operating system. Broadening out: Chipmaker Broadcom buying Symantec's enterprise software business for over $10 billion. And Uber disappointing. The ride hailing app posting an XL loss. It's fortunately Friday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE, almost forgot it was Friday. I'm not quite sure how, but they say though fortune favors the brave, and I can tell you bravery has been needed with the market volatility this week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Right now, what we're looking at for Wall Street majors here. The stocks down premarket once again following what was in fact the best day for stocks in two months on Thursday. Volatility is the name of the game.</p><p>I think we chalked that up to firmer us bond yields over the past couple of days. The Dow and the S&amp;P gaining one and a half percent yesterday. The NASDAQ rising more than two percent were actually positive.</p><p>As we stand right now for the week following, of course, Monday's three percent tumble on China devaluation fears. That feels like weeks ago right now. But we did see China's Central Bank guiding yuan lower for the seventh straight session. Key: The pace of the decline here is slow and steady. But I think the direction is pretty clear and that is weaker.</p><p>What about what we're seeing over in Europe right now? Well, I can tell you it is weakness there, too. Italian stocks down over two percent. Bond yields have jumped amid strong signals from the coalition government there, but we could be about to see a collapse. Over in the U.K., too, the economy contracting in the second quarter. More details on that coming up very shortly.</p><p>Now, from a negative surprise on that to a positive one, Japanese growth data coming in better than expected for the second quarter that then triggered a pop higher in the Japanese yen and as a result, fueling more speculation that the Bank of Japan might intervene to try and weaken the currency.</p><p>Well, I can tell you, too, two can play at that game. President Trump, of course, tweeting yesterday that he liked to see a weaker U.S. dollar at this moment. His trade seem to be having more impact on weakening everyone else's currencies.</p><p>Speaking of trade wars. Let's get to the drivers. Huawei launching its new operating system called Harmony OS. This comes just as the White House says it's going to crack down on government contracts of Huawei and some of the others.</p><p>Matt Rivers joins me on this. Aptly named, Matt, if only they were hard money, quite frankly, but Huawei saying, \"Look, we've got an alternative if we lose access to Google's Android here.\"</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and you know this is according to the Consumer Business CEO, Richard Yu you who made this presentation earlier today, you know, this operating system has been in development for the last two years, Julia, but it's really become a lot more important recently because of this trade war -- I'll get into that in a second. But just to talk about the operating system for a second here.</p><p>It's not going to show up on Huawei smartphones right away. They say they're going to do that over the next three to five years. Really, you're going to start seeing it more on what they're calling their smart screens, which will debut later this year. You might see it on smart watches that Huawei makes and even in in-vehicle systems.</p><p>So this operating system is going to be rolled out slowly over time it looks like, but this all comes back to this trade war because remember, it was back in May that the Trump administration placed Huawei on an entity list which basically forbade U.S. companies from selling their technology to Huawei. Huawei needs key U.S. technology to operate, including Google's Android operating system, which is what Huawei's smartphones run on basically.</p><p>Now, Huawei can only use the open source or the public version of Android and can't use the Google apps like Google Mail, like Google Maps, and so that was a big deal for Huawei. So, this operating system is basically a hedge, Julia against, you know, Huawei needing U.S. products in order to make its own products competitive.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And there's so much or so little clarity around what the relationship is going to be going forward, particularly with companies that supply Huawei. But what we heard yesterday from the White House was, as far as Federal contracts are concerned, they're going to tighten the grip here.</p><p>RIVERS: Yes, and not only that, but Bloomberg has been reporting this week that the White House was considering at one point which we had no public knowledge that they were going to loosen some of those restrictions on private U.S. companies like Google providing technology to Huawei.</p><p>[09:05:10] RIVERS: Well, Bloomberg is reporting that the White House is going to delay restarting some of those relationships. And so Huawei is -- you know, this puts a big question mark over Huawei's future, and I think this just goes to show you that there's no short term deal in place for Huawei, no immediate relief as this trade war drags on with no end in sight, Julia.</p><p>You know, companies that are caught in the middle, not only Huawei, but you know, companies like Apple or Intel, you know, these are all examples of private companies that are going to continue to get hurt from this trade war.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. And an operating system takes time, it takes years to develop. So I'm a hedge, but what kind of quality? Matt Rivers, great to have you with us and on a Friday night, too. We are very appreciative.</p><p>RIVERS: Happy to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's talk about Broadcom now, because Broadcom is looking to buy Symantec's Enterprise Security unit for $10.7 billion in cash. Paul La Monica joins us now. A bit of a head scratcher for me this one, Paul, but talk us through the details. And then we'll work out whether this is a good idea or not. Very different from their core business, of course, which is chip maker -- chip making.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, exactly. Julia, I think it's a bit of a head scratcher because as you point out, Broadcom is mainly known for being a chip company, but it has been making efforts to diversify and try and find higher margin businesses like software.</p><p>So by buying the Symantec corporate cybersecurity business, the hope is that this can be a deal that will give them a new revenue stream and, you know, possibly some more profits as well at a time where, you know, there are concerns about what's going on in the chip market, particularly because of U.S.-China trade tension.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it is quite fascinating. To your point, if you can't see growth organically, then you can buy in, except the revenues of this company, I was just flicking through some of the numbers earlier and they're actually shrinking. So, it's how much can you strip out of this business in terms of costs, perhaps to generate more growth here, which for me is an interesting one.</p><p>The challenge, of course, for Broadcom was that they couldn't buy the whole thing. They tried to buy Qualcomm and they were refused access. Is this going to get through the regulators? Or do they not have any problems since they shifted their HQ to California?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think the move to San Jose obviously helps on that front. There shouldn't be any major issues with this deal from the standpoint of President Trump in a CFIUS review. But it's still possible from an antitrust standpoint that there will be some scrutiny of the deal in the U.S. and Europe. It probably is going to go through though. And you're right, though, Julia. Obviously, this is still not exactly a high growth business, even though the margins are higher for Broadcom.</p><p>So I think that the company is going to try and cut costs, but you can cut costs too aggressively, you know, a different business, obviously, but Kraft Heinz is a perfect example of what happens when you just slash expenses, but don't actually invest in growth.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Couldn't agree more. Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that. All right, on to our next driver now and Uber shares going into reverse premarket. The company reporting a record $5.2 billion loss late Thursday. The stock down some eight percent premarket.</p><p>Clare Sebastian joins me now. Clare, these results to me felt like a car exhaust with a hole in it. They were simply really noisy. Talk us through the details here, because a lot of the losses here tie back to the IPO and expenses related to that.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, absolutely. $3.9 billion of the loss. It was more than $5 billion in three months. That was mostly due to cost related to the IPO, that's true, but there's no hiding behind that. Because even if you strip that out, they look $1.3 billion in the last quarter, that's more than 50 percent increase on the same period last year.</p><p>And you know, I think Wall Street might be more willing to overlook that if we were seeing the kind of growth rates when it comes to revenue that we've become used to seeing, but revenue was only up 14 percent and compare that to Uber's biggest competitor in the U.S., Lyft that reported yesterday 72 percent increase in revenue.</p><p>So this is a pretty, you know, kind of ugly report on the surface. But some perspective here. If you look at gross bookings, they were up 31 percent. That says that there's still demand for this. Uber Eats was up 72 percent in terms of revenue. That's starting to contribute a little more to the top line revenue growth.</p><p>In terms of Uber and in terms of what analysts are saying this morning, Julia, it's not a complete disaster. We can show you some of the price targets today. Most of them either unchanged or even slightly raised. People are starting to look at the sense that the competition with it in terms of price wars with Lyft is easing in the U.S.</p><p>And then Goldman Sachs said that it was interesting. They said today, \"We continue to believe the risk reward in owning the leader in this space is favorable despite the regulatory concerns, despite the competition.\" This is still the biggest player out there and they are very diverse business today, Julia.</p><p>[09:10:06] SEBASTIAN: So, I think that's why we see some kind of long term positivity despite this disappointing number today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you make a great point as well. And we talked about this yesterday, even if the price competition and the price wars with Lyft easing, Uber has got far greater businesses around the world, not just the United States. So other things to tackle there perhaps.</p><p>What about a path to profitability here? Because even Dara Khosrowshahi talked about this in a meme that's going around saying, \"Are they ever going to be profitable here?\"</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, he got a meme on the call for that. That was really interesting. And there was another interesting comment from him, Julia. He said, \"The balance between the top and bottom line is more of an art rather than a science.\" He was a little less definitive when it comes to when they expect to break even or when they expect to be profitable compared to the Lyft, which said, \"Look, we think 2018 was our peak loss year.\" They are now probably at least a year ahead of Uber in that regard.</p><p>Dara Khosrowshahi, he said he expects 2019 to be the peak loss year, but he was, as I say, less definitive. And I think, you know, comparing it with Lyft, it isn't always useful, because as we've said, Uber is a much more diverse business.</p><p>They are in everything -- from Eats, which is incredibly fast growing, incredibly competitive to everything from new mobility to freight to even flying taxis. So they are definitely -- they made this very clear on the call -- still in an investment mode. And I think they are hoping that Wall Street stays with them through this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, this is a transportation app. It's not a ride hailing app. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right to the U.K. now where the U.K. economy contracted in the second quarter for the worst quarterly performance I believe since 2012. Isa Soares joins us now on this story.</p><p>Isa, it feels like some of the stockpiling that we saw in the first quarter leaking away and some real uncertainty here yet again over Brexit risks. Talk us through the details here. What did we see?</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Very much in fact, Julia, one economist telling CNN this will be a rude awakening for Boris Johnson and most likely leave Boris Johnson and his government really your knife edge when we're talking about the third quarter because what we saw, you are seeing there on your screen, the U.K. economy contracting 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the biggest in seven years in terms of contraction.</p><p>Now, economists as well as the Bank of England, Julia, are expecting it to flatline, so this is quite a surprise here, but we're talking about U.K. production shrinking by 1.4 percent, manufacturing -- get this -- down by 2.3 percent. This is down to a couple of things.</p><p>One, as you say, a lot of stockpiling that we saw in the first quarter. That's beginning to unwind. This is the stockpiling preparation for Brexit, this do or die Brexit the government was saying, but also factory shutdowns. They've been moved earlier in April rather the end of summer.</p><p>But the reality is, Clare, it doesn't matter whichever you read these numbers, Julia. This is uncertainty, the lack of clarity, the nervousness within the market of a no deal Brexit; that is starting to bite and starting to be felt.</p><p>You are seeing there the pound; actually, Sterling fell to a two-year low against the dollar. It actually went down to $1.21. Yet Boris Johnson, Julia is continuing to push through his do or die pledge. And in fact, we heard today from Savid Javid, the U.K. Chancellor who said, \"Look, we're not expecting recession,\" and painting rather a really good and positive picture when it comes to the U.K. economy. But what these numbers show, it is pretty dire, says the CBI -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, just because you're not expecting it doesn't mean you don't get it. Talk to me about the video that Boris Johnson popped on social media because I retweeted this this morning. He was talking about game, he was talking about relaxing some of the immigration laws to encourage scientists to come in and help develop drugs and innovation in the U.K. It sound like a brilliant idea.</p><p>Do we have any detail on exactly how and when they are going to do this?</p><p>SOARES: No, very little on detail as it's been something we've seen from this administration. But I can say, Boris Johnson as you can see there, \"Tonight, I announced live on Facebook we're changing immigration rules to make it easy for scientists to live and work in the U.K.\"</p><p>Now he took -- he did a Facebook Live which we haven't seen him do and he wants to point space, fast track immigration route to try and attract what he says the very best minds from around the world specifically when it comes to science, engineering as well as technology.</p><p>No word as of when that will start, when will it take place, what will shift in terms of numbers? But he -- they want to abolish the 2,000 a year cap on the number one -- on the tier one exceptional visa talents. And that, I have to say has been very well received by many people here and say this is a great idea. We need to build on the science, on the engineering and really boost the economy with this talent. So very well received.</p><p>The tactic though coming to Facebook or doing a Facebook Live is something that we haven't seen before from Boris Johnson, but it's something that has been very well received here -- Julia.</p><p>[09:15:08] CHATTERLEY: Yes, welcome to the 21st Century. Isa Soares, thank you so much for that. All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we're following around the world.</p><p>Hong Kong protesters have begun what's intended to be a three-day occupation of the city's busiest airport. Part of a series of rallies to mark the 10th straight week of demonstrations since the protests began. We're going to be live in Hong Kong later in the program to bring you all the details.</p><p>At least government is teetering after the far right coalition partner, the League filed a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister. Its leader, Matteo Salvini is pushing the snap elections, which he hopes will put him in the top post. Parliament has been recalled from summer recess and a date for the no confidence vote will be set on Monday.</p><p>All right, so we're going to take a quick break here, but coming up, what does your purchase history say about you? Cardlytics cashing in on your spending habits, and it is paying off for investors.</p><p>Plus, it's the pot tech startup that gets high on data. Not weed, we find out how Akerna is tracking cannabis from seed to sale. All of that coming up, stay with FIRST MOVE.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. We're counting down to a market open that is expected to be weaker. For all the volatility though, I should point out the S&amp;P 500 only down some three percent from record highs. We've got the 10-year yield softening a little bit, 1.7 percent after the 10 produced price numbers this morning.</p><p>Call rates falling for the first time since 2015. That gives the Federal Reserve more space. Remember, 10-year yield beginning Monday's session at 1.77 percent. So again, only a bit of easing over the week despite all the volatility.</p><p>[09:20:04] CHATTERLEY: I'll tell you something that has moved though, gold. The best week in more than three years as that safe haven is coming into play, of course, in the midst of the broader uncertainties, a little bit softer today, but we're still trading around that $1,500.00 an ounce.</p><p>Let's talk through these markets. Liz Young joins us now, Director of Market Strategy at BNY Mellon, great to have you with us.</p><p>LIZ YOUNG, DIRECTOR OF MARKET STRATEGY AT BNY MELLON: Great to be back.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What do we think here?</p><p>YOUNG: We think right now, if you're looking at yields and dividend yields, if you look at the yield on the 10-year, still below the dividend yield on the S&amp;P, and if we don't think that there's a recession coming, which we don't, it still makes more sense to buy equities. You're going to buy equities, you still have more upside opportunity in a stock from prices. And you've got that dividend yield that's giving you more income than you're getting on a Treasury bond.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting. I mentioned this point earlier on this week, that actually 80 percent now of the Dow stocks, or at least one point earlier this week, had a better dividend yield, a better return here than what's offered to you right now by buying the safest asset arguably which is bonds.</p><p>To your point, is the bond market then too bearish? It's too worried right now about what's going on. Because --</p><p>YOUNG: You know, I don't even know that it's necessarily that the bond market is worried. I think the bond market is trying to price and what's going to happen with rates and the bond market is following what's happened with rates around the globe.</p><p>So when we have dovish Central Banks around the globe, there's the expectation that the Fed is going to have to narrow that gap, and maybe that's true to some degree.</p><p>But at some point, the Fed is going to have to take the market on here and say, we're not going to cut all the way down to zero. We're not going to get in line with some of these other Central Banks, because our economy is not in an emergency situation like some others.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And that is exactly where we're always going. So at some point, Jay Powell, the Federal Reserve is going to have to say, \"Guys, you want more stimulus. You want me to cut rates, but we're simply not seeing the justification for that right now.</p><p>YOUNG: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: In the data -- look what happened in December when Jay Powell kind of tried to tell the market that it wasn't seeing something or it was seeing something that they were -- he is risking more than what we see.</p><p>YOUNG: Right, well, and he's trying to walk this tightrope, right? He is a little bit scarred by what happened in December, and some of his commentary that sent the market really, really --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Significantly lower.</p><p>YOUNG: Right. But I don't think he is altogether comfortable with how many cuts the market is pricing in here. Because to your point earlier, there's not really data to support that. If the data materializes, or let's say the trade war really escalates and we start to see the making of kind of a trade induced global slowdown, then then there might be data to support some more cuts. But that's cutting into a downturn in trying to support an economy that's actually turning down.</p><p>At this point, we can't really make that case, there's not a fundamental downturn in the U.S. and there's not a recession here. So, he can't cut unless bad data starts coming through in a real way.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How much focus are you placing on what -- through the markets for a loop on Monday, which was the weakening of the Chinese yuan here because, I feel like we've spent months and months and months talking about weakening Chinese data.</p><p>YOUNG: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And actually not seeing the follow through in the currency. Yet, it is acceptable to see weakening currencies in other countries around the world when their economies are weakening.</p><p>YOUNG: Sure. So China's currency you have to remember is really the bellwether for most of EM, especially Asia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>YOUNG: So that currency is the most important one. And the fact that they let it weaken, I don't think it should have really been a surprise. We were actually expecting them to let it get above seven -- that exchange rate -- that mental threshold of seven, we were expecting that earlier in the year.</p><p>So now it finally happened. Again, it was a mental threshold. It doesn't necessarily mean anything from a numerical perspective.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, it means something to the White House. It was the fear factor.</p><p>YOUNG: It means something. Exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It was.</p><p>YOUNG: It means something from a sentiment perspective, and obviously to the administration. I think China will continue to incrementally let currency devalue, but they're going to try to control that fall, because they don't have the tools to prop it up if it really goes to a precipitous drop off.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, so don't be oversensitive. Expect a gradual decline.</p><p>YOUNG: Expect a continued gradual decline.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What should investors be doing at this moment? Because I've seen you use the term this is an investable market, you can take risk in this market.</p><p>YOUNG: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What should we be looking at? And what do we need to focus on here?</p><p>YOUNG: Yes, and I want to be careful and be clear that this isn't me saying that I'm overly bullish, right. And we need to make sure that there's a balance in everybody's portfolio of the things that would do well, the defenses that rally on those days when we're down or even intraday, when we're down. But making sure that you still have money in the market.</p><p>This isn't something where you take everything off the table. Even if we get some of those classic indicators like an inversion at the twos tens. That doesn't mean you pull everything out of the market, because even if that does predict a recession, which it doesn't all the time, but even if it does, you still see a nice return for usually the next eight to 12 months, maybe even eight to 18 months.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, this is fascinating, just to get to your point there. The inversion we're talking about is 10-year bond yields in the United States falling below what we see the yield gap for the two-year point.</p><p>To your point as well, not only that, but there's still time to make money. It's happened particularly with stocks rising here. But also, if you see a Central Bank like the Federal Reserve making insurance rate cuts, that also tends to mean that stocks can rise. It's supported for equity investors.</p><p>[09:25:21] YOUNG: And in the past, when they've done things that are slightly similar to this, you do see continued bull run in stock. So over the short to medium term, you can expect that there's some support to stock prices.</p><p>Now, what we've seen though, in the last call it seven or eight trading days is that it's very easy to derail that bull ram with just a little bit of a macro headline or a little bit of a threat from an escalated trade war or a currency war or anything that would kind of come along and knock us off track.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We've talked a lot about macro, what about micro? What were your key takeaways from earnings season here in the United States and just to justify the fact that for all the noise and all the volatility and all the trade concerns, like I made the point, we are still three percent off record highs.</p><p>YOUNG: Right. Well, what's interesting actually is if you look at the market compared to a year ago, we really haven't gone very far, it's only about two and a half percent up.</p><p>So it feels like this has been really violent, and it felt earlier in the year like we had a really strong year coming in, we were up 20 percent. I remember we were down almost 20 percent in the fourth quarter.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We were only taking back -- yes. So, we are taking there.</p><p>YOUNG: So we're sort of just got back to where we were. Now, if you look at it on a limited basis and say, \"Oh, we're up 20 percent.\" Earnings didn't really support an up to 20 percent move because we had kind of a flat first quarter, a flat-ish second quarter. We're expecting the full year to be about 2.6 percent growth in earnings. Average earnings growth is about six percent. So we're below average.</p><p>What the market needs though and the comps from last year are really tough. But what the market needs is some fundamental reason to keep going up. So we need earnings guidance, just continue to stay positive. We need those beasts to come through.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I have to wrap you there because we've got the market open next.</p><p>YOUNG: Okay.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We'll come back to this conversation. The market open it next. We'll continue talking anyway, even if you don't.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and the final opening bell of the session here in Wall Street. As expected, a lower open for stocks this morning.</p><p>Tech stocks in fact leading the declines. Its trade concerns, once again back in focus. A report saying the White House will delay its decision on whether or not to let U.S. firms do business in Huawei. That obviously having an impact on the suppliers and those that do business with Huawei over in the Asia session, too, in addition to an expected crackdown on Federal government contracts here in the United States as well for Huawei, but also ZTE.</p><p>Let me give you a look at what we saw in the Asia session as well. Well, Japan's Nikkei bucking the trend, rising after that stronger than expected growth report for the second quarter. Chinese stocks falling though. The Producer Price numbers, they are falling for the first time in three years. That opens the door clearly for more easing.</p><p>But we also saw stocks falling in Hong Kong, too. Hong Kong Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, saying weeks of protests have hurt the economy more than SARS and the 2008 financial crisis, too.</p><p>All right. Let's get the latest on that because pro-democracy protesters have begun what they're calling a three day occupation of Hong Kong's International Airport, one of the busiest airports in fact, in the world.</p><p>It's one of a number of protests that are planned by those protesters gearing up for 10th straight weekend of demonstrations. For more, we're joined by Ben Wedeman, who is there.</p><p>Ben, great to have you with us. Can you give us a sense of numbers right now of protesters that are there and expected to stay over the weekend, but also police and authorities? What presence on their part too?</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, at this point, we're here at the arrival hall of the airport and there are thousands of people here. However, it should be pointed out that they're not interfering with the operations of the airport. Some flights are delayed, some of them canceled apparently, as a result of a typhoon that's headed to Shanghai.</p><p>We just heard, however that the Chinese Civil Aviation Authority is very unhappy that some of the crew members of Cathay Pacific, which is the carrier based out of Hong Kong, have, in fact, taken part in some of these pro -democracy protests, and therefore China is saying that those crew members they believe were involved in the protest will not be allowed to work on flights to Mainland China.</p><p>Back to this protest. What we've seen is thousands of people mostly young, in the arrival hall. They're not bothering anybody and police are keeping a very low profile as far as the situation. They're not trying to stop anybody from doing this. Although, to get to the check-in desks, you have to show that you're actually traveling, so they're being stopped from entering the departure area.</p><p>Now one thing they are providing, though, to people who come -- visitors arriving is this fake ticket, which says HK 809 from Hong Kong to Freedom and in Chinese, it says on the bottom, that the gates of freedom will be closed unless you work to open them.</p><p>So they're using all sorts of other things. Here's a pamphlet they're handing out to arriving travelers saying, \"Dear traveler, welcome to Hong Kong. We regret the inconvenience.\" But then the pamphlet goes on to explain why they are holding these protests. What their demands are.</p><p>But as you can see, it's a very noisy protest. It seems to be this is the major protest in Hong Kong this evening. The city itself, the territory is otherwise quiet. So it appears that many people have come here, and it's worth noting that not just young people, students, also old people, some people earlier today I saw even brought their children here.</p><p>So yes, it is exactly two months today that the protest began on the 9th of June. This is the 10th consecutive weekend. And these protests do not appear to be losing steam -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, interesting. Ben, great to have you with us and that ticket to freedom. Poignant. All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of our global movers, some of the companies that we are watching in this session. Broadcom and Symantec, of course. Broadcom, also and Symantec actually higher. I'm just looking at the numbers here. Broadcom buying Symantec's Enterprise Security unit for some $10.7 billion as we discussed earlier on in the show.</p><p>[09:35:10] CHATTERLEY: Uber, also under pressure here. They reported a record $5.2 billion loss for the second quarter and a $3.2 billion revenue number that coming slightly below expectations. The ride hailing or transportation app says most of its losses are down to stock based compensation. So there was a lot of noise in this report. You have to strip back the details here.</p><p>What about Beyond Meat, also watching this stock today. Reports are it shelved the plans to enter the Japanese market and plans to focus more on the U.S. market. Recently, bolstered at funding to fight some rivals like Impossible, of course, too. So shelving plans to enter Japan at least for now, it seems.</p><p>All right, another stock we're watching, Goldman Sachs. Malaysia has charged 17 current and former Goldman Sachs employees in its investigation into the 1MDB scandal. Goldman's top international banker is among those on the list. Matt Egan joins me now. Matt, complex story there. Talk us through the details. What have we learned today?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: Julia, the 1MDB scandal continues to be a major black guy for Goldman Sachs. Today, the Malaysian Attorney General announced charges against 17 current and former Goldman Sachs employees including the CEO of Goldman Sachs International, Richard Gnodde.</p><p>Now these individuals were all Directors at three Goldman Sachs subsidiaries during the time that the investment bank arranged three large bond offerings for Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, which is known as 1MDB.</p><p>Now, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged debt $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB by Malaysian officials, and then funneled into New York condos and hotels, and even used to help finance the film \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" and Malaysia has accused Goldman Sachs of -- and some of its bankers of misleading investors about the bond sales and fraudulently diverting $2.7 billion of the proceeds.</p><p>Now, today, the Attorney General in Malaysia is saying that these individuals who were charged, these 17, they were either -- they either exercised or ought to have exercised decision making authority at these Goldman Sachs divisions.</p><p>Now the charges carry up to 10 years in prison, in addition to fines. Now, for its part, Goldman Sachs has said that they think that these charges are misdirected, and they will be vigorously defended.</p><p>I think Julia, you know, beyond the obvious legal implications, there are obviously, you know, reputational concerns here because if you're Goldman Sachs, you have to worry that these charges, and this overall scandal will, you know, make wealthy individuals and potential other sovereign wealth funds think twice before they hire Goldman Sachs.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a tough one, isn't it? But to reiterate your point, Goldman Sachs at this moment, saying that they will defend themselves vigorously against all charges. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, so we're going to take a quick break here again, but coming up on the First Move, the FinTech company, monetizing your purchase history. The CEO of Cardlytics joining us next. Stay with FIRST MOVE.</p><p>[09:41:33] CHATTERLEY: Welcome to FIRST MOVE and a move into the FinTech space now and the look at the firm, Cardlytics. It's a company that harnesses what's called purchase intelligence, working with big banks to collect data from card and bill payments. It's the kind of info advertisers and banks crave, helping them target customers with things like deals and promotions, and that strategy is paying off for early investors.</p><p>The stock has surged almost 90 percent in the last three months alone. Joining us in the \"Chatt Room,\" Scott Grimes is the CEO and Cofounder of Cardlytics. Great to have you with us.</p><p>SCOTT GRIMES, CEO AND COFOUNDER OF CARDLYTICS: Good morning, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, that was my words, in your words, what is Cardlytics? Tell me how it works.</p><p>GRIMES: So we're a digital marketing platform, just like a lot of the other ones out there. We have some really unique capabilities. So let me tell you how we built it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>GRIMES: Unlike other digital marketing platforms, which kind of signed up a customer at a time to create a business. We partner with lots of banks to build a single sort of marketing network for advertisers. And there are two things we get from our bank partnerships.</p><p>First of all, we're able to bring marketing to all of their customers through the bank's digital touch points -- mobile banking and online banking.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>GRIMES: And we bring it to customers in the form of cashback offers. So while people haven't heard of Cardlytics, they've heard of -- BankAmeriDeals through Bank of America.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I've definitely heard that.</p><p>GRIMES: Chase offers through Chase. PNC Payback through PNC. We work with lots of banks. Second, we use insights from the bank's purchase data to both make sure we're bringing customers offers that are relevant to them, which also means advertisers are reaching customers that are likely to be valuable customers. And then we're also using that purchase data to measure the effect of the advertising.</p><p>So closing the loop in the advertising so we can measure the return to the penny.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So this is really important for me. I mean, there's many things in there. One, you understand exactly what we're all buying, how do we target a person knowing exactly what they buy, and perhaps assuming that they will want to buy the same thing.</p><p>But also with all advertising, you're never quite sure whether it's tackling the consumer appropriately where they are actually, they're acting on it. But what you're saying is, this is a great way of understanding how that advertising is impacting a customer, and if they're acting on it.</p><p>GRIMES: Exactly. And what we find is that the way you've purchased in the past is incredibly predictive and insightful in what you're interested in buying in the future.</p><p>So that past purchase behavior, the objective is really find the people who are going to be most interested in the marketing that we're bringing to them. And because we're then measuring the impact of the marketing, did it actually work? Did it change consumer behavior? Our models are constantly getting better and better at bringing the right message to the right consumer.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, the first thing I thought when I was looking at what your company did was go, am I comfortable with the bank selling my data?</p><p>GRIMES: Yes, yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Tell me what exact data they give you? And do you see my name? Is there any way for an individual to be identified and kind of a consumer or someone that works with a bank or banks with a bank go, you know what? I don't want my data handed over. I don't want it to be targeted.</p><p>GRIMES: Yes. So a couple things. First of all, banks aren't selling the data. Instead, what they're doing is letting us analyze the data.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>GRIMES: To go and understand what offers to bring to their customers. But importantly, we never use any personally identifiable information. And the data never leaves us or the bank, so it never goes outside the network.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>GRIMES: Second, we actually -- there's two numbers I look at. We make it very easy for customers to opt out. If they don't like the service, it's fine. System-wide opt out rate is less than a quarter percent. But the other metric we look at is, how do people engage with the offers? On average, we see about an eight percent click rate, which is an order of magnitude higher than you see in other digital channels.</p><p>So I look at two things, people aren't opting out, but they are aggressively engaging with the channel that we believe the reason for that is because we're bringing great value.</p><p>[09:45:14] CHATTERLEY: Amazon Prime Day -- or two days -- what did you see there? What are your big takeaways? Because that does interest me in terms of just spending habits and what we see, and actually outside of Amazon, what happens to people's spending?</p><p>GRIMES: Yes, you know, we're pretty geeky. So we're always analyzing how people are changing their spending.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Geeking out with you.</p><p>GRIMES: And we've watched Amazon Prime pretty carefully over the past few years. What we saw this year is that Amazon Prime customers spend about 25 percent more than they did last year. So, it's really growing. It also is pulling that back to school spending forward.</p><p>But the other thing that's really cool is for those same Amazon Prime customers that have spent more, they also spent 20 percent more online at all the other retailers. So, it's a kind of a rising tide benefits all.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Does it steal from bricks and mortar, though, because that's the thing, do we think this ship time on online purchases and actually to the cost of the high streets?</p><p>GRIMES: So yes, online is definitely growing. But it was more of pulling the back to school spending forward versus stealing from the high streets - - using your term -- you know, the one thing that we are seeing that is super, we do a lot of work with advertisers on growing their omni channel strategy.</p><p>A lot of people talk about that, but we can really do it because we can see the brick and mortar customers who also have a propensity to spend online and other places. The reason it's so important is when a retailer gets someone to spend both in the brick and mortar, and online, it doubles the total amount of sales they get from that customer versus a customer he spends in only one channel.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, you work with a number of the big banks. You mentioned, Chase, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, I know is a big one. I was just trying to think given that you IPO'd, you went public a year and a half ago, who would actually like to buy you? Perhaps the banks would have a real battle, actually, because no one actually wants the other person to own you.</p><p>I think a big tech giant would actually love to have the ability to strategically target and to go to advertisers and go, \"Guys, look at this technology. You know, let's pinpoint exactly who wants to buy what, when and how.\" Any interest for big tech companies to buy you?</p><p>GRIMES: You know, I spent all my time running the business, trying to make it more and more valuable. One of the things that we are incredibly in tune to is, we work with some really sensitive assets with our bank partners, but also for our advertising partners.</p><p>And we always make sure that we're that really sort of good and fair partner that sits in between the two.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Are you profitable?</p><p>GRIMES: We're getting there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, not yet.</p><p>GRIMES: Not yet. We lost about $600,000.00 of adjusted EBITDA last quarter. But we are just now starting to see the fixed cost effects of our business that we're starting to really show leverage. And that was driven by -- we made some very large investments to scale up for Chase. Wells Fargo is launching in Q4. Those investments are made and now we're starting to see the operating leverage as we grow in towards scale.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Feasible in 2019? 2020?</p><p>GRIMES: We have publicly stated that in 2020, we will be adjusted EBITDA profitable.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Fantastic. Come back and talk to us again. Fascinating company.</p><p>GRIMES: We'd love to.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Scott Grimes, CEO and Cofounder of Cardlytics. All right, we're going to take a quick break now, but up next, redefining high tech. The NASDAQ's newest pop stock finds a fresh way to cash in on the cannabis market. Akerna CEO tells us how. Stay with us. That's coming up.</p><p>[09:50:29] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Meet Akerna, the newest cannabis stock to hit the market. But unlike most pot stocks, this company pushes software, not soft drugs. This is how CEO Jessica Billingsley described what Akerna does.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JESSICA BILLINGSLEY, CEO, AKERNA: The way an investor, any investor should think about us is as a software as a service.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Right.</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: That happens to be serving what is arguably one of the fastest growing industries in the.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. But you're collecting data basically. This is the key.</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Legal cannabis retailers use a kind of software to enter product data at all points in the supply chain from planting the original seeds to customer sales. It's not an exceptional business model, but it focuses on an exceptionally high growth and lucrative market. I asked the CEO to give me a sense of the cannabis industry's growth potential.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: July 4th is the third busiest holiday of the year for cannabis sales. And this year, cannabis in the July 4th week did 80 percent more than in a normal week in terms of sales.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow.</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: And in fact, at the current rate of consumer growth, which is about 12 percent a month. So if you think about that, the consumer growth rate of cannabis 12 percent a month, we predict that by 2020, people will buy more cannabis for the July week than wine.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Really?</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: Just next year.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Just based on the growth that you're seeing right now. And he said you're tracking in other countries, too. Is the United States far more prevalent in terms of the growth rate and the amount that's being bought than any other nation right now?</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: The United States still leads, but it is hampered by the Federal-state conflict, which is still existing, and it's a question of when, not if. It's going to end, and in the meantime, we're working with many countries that are legalizing on a Federal level and enabling compliance for them providing the backbone and regulation as really a global marketplace is emerging.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, I've read that you sold $400 million worth of sales in that July 4th weekend. I mean, as you said, that's the third largest holiday, so we can't take that in isolation.</p><p>But what kind of size market are we talking about by 2020, if you're talking about a 12 percent growth rate on a on a monthly basis?</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: So we're projecting around $30 billion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: A $30 billion market. As Jessica outlined there, the lack of clarity on regulation is tough on a business, it's also tough on the consumer, and you've heard this on FIRST MOVE before, as Akerna's CEO points out, no regulation means no clear standards on the product and that she says is a key concern.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: We talk about the three P's, which are public safety. So knowing where the product is going, making sure there's no diversion, it's not making it into the hands of minors. Product safety, which is this concept of a supply chain tracking and being able at any time to enable a recall or to know where your product is along the life cycle.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: And then finally, that really important piece for any patient or consumer, so patient safety, what's in my product? What am I getting? How can I know that when I buy this, it's going to have this effect, and it's not going to be double or less that I really could have good confidence in what I'm receiving?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Are you talking to regulators? Are you even having that conversation at this stage where they say to you, \"Look, can we use your data? Can we have a conversation with you about what you're seeing?</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: Absolutely, we often have a seat at the table with regulators and really educate them on how you can regulate, how you can tax and how you can have good confidence in tracking this product and having good confidence that what you're doing for your constituents is going to be appropriate.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, the majority of Americans now want to see legalization at the Federal level. What's your sense? How long do you think it takes? Particularly when we've got the majority of Republicans, I believe actually now are saying that perhaps this is something that we should be looking at whether it's recreational or medicinal purposes, how long do you think it takes before we see at the Federal level a relaxation of these rules?</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: I've been doing this for about a decade.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>BILLINGSLEY: And I haven't said this in all the years leading up. We're now in a near term period of time.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Really?</p><p>[09:55:00] BILLINGSLEY: It's within a couple years. And part of that if you look back at our previous conversation there around what's happening globally. There are other countries, they are moving forward with really strong, really stable regulation and tracking and proving that this works and creating this global marketplace and the U.S. is not going to want to be left out of that for very long.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The business could not only work for cannabis, of course, they can track any kind of product and she said that, but right now, they're just focusing on the cannabis industry itself.</p><p>All right, let me give you a look at what we're seeing for U.S. majors at this moment. We are softer. The tech stocks remain the underperformers, plenty of broader trade concerns right now, and I think that's going to continue to play into the session.</p><p>I'll be back in a couple of hours' time on \"The Express.\" But for now, that's it for the show. I'm Julia Chatterley. You can also listen to our podcast cnn.com/podcast if you want to rehear the show's action, but for now, you've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours. Have a wonderful Friday.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019080901cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSK-CJ11-JB20-G38X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 9, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000236R</classCode><className>SYMANTEC CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002GD1</classCode><className>BROADCOM CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000DAH9</classCode><className>BANK OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS334614 SOFTWARE &amp;

Here's what we expect it to include.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Early 2017 was the last time we saw Huawei introduce a full-blown Wear OS smartwatch, and it seems the company may soon be ready to bring another similar device to market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to a new rumor, the Huawei Watch 3 may be just around the corner and it&amp;#x2019;s likely to be a big upgrade over the Huawei Watch 2. For starters, it's likely to include Wear OS software on board from the very beginning, whereas its predecessor shipped with older Android Wear software.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Below we&amp;#x2019;re listing everything we know so far about the Huawei Watch 3, as well as a list of things we&amp;#x2019;d love to see Huawei adopt for its upcoming wristwear attempt.</p><p>Cut to the chase What is it? May be Huawei's next smartwatch<br/>When is it out? Could launch at IFA 2019<br/>What will it cost? May launch at around &amp;#xA3;329 ($299, AU$450)<br/>Huawei Watch 3 release date and price</p><p>There are no clear clues as to when we&amp;#x2019;ll see Huawei introduce its next Wear OS smartwatch, but IFA 2019 - a big tech conference held in early September in Berlin, Germany - would be an obvious choice.</p><p>Then again, Huawei is likely to introduce its next phablet in October, so it may be the Huawei Watch 3 is introduced alongside the Huawei Mate 30 later in the year.</p><p>Bluetooth filings are the clearest hint we&amp;#x2019;ve had so far of the device existing, and usually their existence means a product is at most a few months away, as it&amp;#x2019;s a relatively last minute piece of documentation needed when making a new product. So one or other of those events seems likely.</p><p>As for price, so far we can only guess. We'd expect it to be a similar price to the Huawei Watch 2, which launched at &amp;#xA3;329 ($299, AU$450). We won&amp;#x2019;t know for certain until the Huawei Watch 3 is actually introduced though.</p><p>Huawei Watch 3 news and leaks</p><p>Little concrete information is currently known about the Huawei Watch 3. Bluetooth regulatory filings have suggested the watch is in development, but these don&amp;#x2019;t give us a clear image of what the watch will look like or what it will be able to do.</p><p>However, codenames in these listings suggest there may be three different variants of the Huawei Watch 3.</p><p>Considering how Huawei styled its past smartwatches, we can expect these to be slightly different design variants. One will likely come with a more premium design while another may be lighter and ready for fitness activities with a silicone strap. One will probably also pack LTE.</p><p>Back in early 2018, Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Division, confirmed to TechRadar that the company was working on a new smartwatch.</p><p>Later in 2018, Yu confirmed why it was taking so long to come to market, saying the company had some improvements it wanted to make before returning to smartwatches.</p><p>Yu said he wanted the company to better adapt artificial intelligence for wearables, so it may be that this next rumored smartwatch will have a bigger focus on AI when it comes out.</p><p>That may mean we'll see improved automatic functionality, or it may just mean you're able to speak directly to your watch more easily to ask for different features through a voice assistant.</p><p>Yu also said, &amp;#x201C;We want to make bigger improvements and make the experience much better than today [speaking in September 2018]. That&amp;#x2019;s my target. We want to make the smartwatch more useful, more intimate, more functional, and with much longer battery life.\"</p><p>Expect some improvements in all of those areas, which may mean we see new technology on board, including the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 chipset inside, which has yet to be used in many smartwatches.</p><p>We'll be sure to add further information here once we've heard additional leaks and rumors.</p><p>What we want to see</p><p>We don&amp;#x2019;t know all that much about the Huawei Watch 3, but we&amp;#x2019;ve speculated about a few new features and improvements that it may bring to your wrist.</p><p>1. A larger screen</p><p>One of our biggest bugbears with the Huawei Watch range is that the screens are that little bit too small. The larger the display on a smartwatch, the easier it is (generally) to interact with it.</p><p>We're hoping Huawei decides to opt for a slightly larger screen on its upcoming device to make navigating and activating features on it that touch easier.</p><p>2. A more premium design</p><p>The original Huawei Watch was one of the best looking, most premium smartwatches on the market at the time, but the company opted for a more sporty design for the follow up.</p><p>We'd like to see Huawei offer another high-end option that can help compete with products such as the Apple Watch 4 or Samsung Galaxy Watch, with a design that suits formal outfits as well as everyday wear.</p><p>3. Improved performance</p><p>There's no getting around the fact the Huawei Watch 2 is old. It's a couple of years out of date, and it's using the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset that is still included in a lot of Wear OS watches.</p><p>It's not unusable, but it would be good to see Huawei put serious effort into improving the performance of its new watch. That could be achieved simply by using the newer Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 chipset, but there's no guarantee Huawei will decide to do that.</p><p>4. Some of that improved battery life</p><p>Improved performance is likely to mean that Huawei will also be able to extend the battery life on the watch.</p><p>The Huawei Watch 2 is capable of around two days from a single charge, but we'd like to see the focus that was put on the battery of the Huawei Watch GT translate over into an extra day or so on the Huawei Watch 3.</p><p>That's quite a big ask, but generally smartwatch battery life is improving with each generation, and considering there has been an over two year gap it would make sense if Huawei could vastly improve the battery for the new model.</p><p>5. A fresh coat of paint</p><p>This one is down to personal taste, but we think Huawei should give its watch a bit of a design upgrade with some new looks as well as a couple of new colors.</p><p>We're expecting some big improvements in the design of the Huawei Watch 3, and a variety of color options with some bold new choices may be a great way to achieve that.</p><p>Can't wait for a new smartwatch?

I cited a Forbes article that featured an interview with Andrew Svetly, Florida Hospital's chief medical information officer, who said possessing clinician credentials helped him earn respect from physicians and hospital administrators.</p><p/><p>That kind of in-depth domain knowledge would probably be a plus for any CIO but may be especially critical for health care, an industry with specialized operational requirements and lots of regulatory and security issues.</p><p/><p>As <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">InformationWeek</emphasis> reports, AT&amp;T's health care division has <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">appointed Geeta Nayyar, MD, MBA as its first chief medical information officer</emphasis>.

As IT Business Edge's Loraine Lawson wrote last summer, health care IT was once considered a niche market, served primarily by smaller vendors with proprietary solutions. But big tech vendors became seriously interested after the federal government announced plans to spend some $20 billion updating the country's medical records and other IT systems.</p><p/><p>In a post on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">hot market for IT talent with experience in electronic health records</emphasis>, IT Business Edge's Susan Hall mentioned a recent a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that predicted health care spending will make up nearly 20 percent of the U.S. economy by 2019 and research from RNCOS forecasting 24 percent spending growth on health care technology in the U.S. between 2012 and 2014.</p><p/><p>The InformationWeek article mentions several IT health initiatives in which AT&amp;T is involved, including a joint effort with the Department of Health and Human Services and the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) to improve self-management training of diabetic patients. AT&amp;T will contribute $100,000 to the AADE to fund the initiative, which will start with a pilot in Texas, and will provide 150 smartphones with voice and data plans for patients, diabetes educators and other coaches.</p><p/><p>Chief medical information officers, whether or not they have medical training, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">face plenty of challenges in implementing new health care technologies</emphasis>. As interest in health care IT continues to grow, the CMIO role will probably grow right along with it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITBCOM-83387310</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITBCOM2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KJ9-0W01-JC90-T4PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433695</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><timeReceived>01:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Quinstreet, Inc.

The nation's biggest poultry producer, Tyson Foods, acquiring Hudson for close to $1 billion in cash, stock and debt.  The majority of Hudson's business also comes from poultry, but the company became the focus of national attention after its Nebraska beef plants was linked to the potentially deadly E.coli bacteria, that had a major effect on the rest of Hudson's business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wall Street applauded the deal.  For the week, Hudson gaining nearly $5.  Tyson stock jumping almost $1.75.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The nation's largest poultry company is coming to the rescue of an Arkansas neighbor battered by the largest beef recall in history.  Hudson Foods is primarily a poultry company, the nation's fifth largest, despite last month's recall 25 million pounds of hamburger as a result of an E.coli scare.</p><p>JOHN MCMILLIN, FOOD INDUSTRY ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: Just because their selling out in what is perceived to be a distressed time of this beef recall.  They're not selling out at a distressed price by my calculation.  Adding in the debt it works to almost a billion dollars, which is a decent price for Hudson shareholders.</p><p>FRANK: Hudson built its name selling processed poultry to wholesalers and chains such as Wal-Mart and Burger King.  Hudson expanded into beef only two years ago.</p><p>JAMES \"RED\" HUDSON, CHAIRMAN, HUDSON FOODS: That's history. That beef plant was an unfortunate situation.  We still don't know where the product came from that created that problem, the 15 or 16 people in Colorado.</p><p>It's kind of interesting to note that all of the sicknesses were in Colorado, and fortunately, nobody died.</p><p>But that's history.  We closed the plant first, we sold the plant, we closed the book.</p><p>FRANK: But closing the beef plant did not solve Hudson's image problems.  Angered by the beef recall, Burger King stopped buying</p><p>Hudson chicken too.  Analysts say that put pressure on the company to sell itself.</p><p>(on camera): With the Hudson purchase, Tyson will process an estimated 28 percent of the chickens in the United States.  This combination also gives Tyson even greater ability to boost its wholesale business to McDonald's and other fast food chains.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: A spectacular start to September after the agony of August.  Blue-chip stocks kicking off a holiday-shortened week with their biggest one-day point gain ever.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrials soaring 257 points on the first trading day of the month wiping away nearly half of last month's 600 point loss.  But investors cooled off after that as some big-name companies warned their earnings outlook not quite as rosy as expected.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RONALD HILL, EQUITY ANALYST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN: We're starting to get the pre-announcements of disappointing earnings, but they're not as significant enough, I think, to make third-quarter earnings be negative for the market.</p><p>I think you're going to see 12 percent year over year gains in third-quarter earnings again.  And that's going to be another lift for stock prices that's why we're look for new highs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Fridays still proving to be volatile.  The past eight Fridays the Dow has declined 689 points.  For the week, the Dow rose nearly 200 points.  Much of that due to Tuesday's stunning rally.</p><p>Broader market measures sizzled, particularly technology stocks. On Friday the Nasdaq climbed 11 points to a record high racking up 48 points for the week.</p><p>A different story for the bond market, however, despite more economic news showing no signs of overheating.  The benchmark 30-Year Treasury fell more than a quarter of a point for the week.  And the yield now up to 6.63 percent.</p><p>A report on the labor market showing no signs of inflation.  The nation's jobless rate edged up 1/10 of a percent in August with a mere 49,000 new jobs added to the payrolls.  That reflects the impact of the 16-day United Parcel Service strike.  Even though hiring at post offices and other agencies offset some of those lost jobs.  Hourly wages rose a nickel as expected.</p><p>The relatively tame economic report giving the Federal Reserve more reason to hold off on raising interest rates -- at least for now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM SULLIVAN, DIRECTOR MONEY MARKET RESEARCH, DEAN WITTER SECURITIES: This is not a figure that's going to create a see change in attitudes at all.  And it's not going to create fears of immediate interest rates or inflationary pressures.</p><p>So, this really doesn't change the central theme that the economy is expanding and still remains relatively free of inflationary pressures.  The figure confirms that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: In the week ahead, investors and the FED get a look at worker productivity, producer prices and retail sales.</p><p>In other economic news: the federal government is on track to erase its long-running budget deficit.  The White House says it expects a surplus of $63 billion by the year 2002.  It would be the first time since 1969 that the deficit would be wiped out.  The White House expects to stay in the black at least through 2007.</p><p>Coming up in our focus on high-technology, stern warnings about earnings from two major companies.  And if you've got tech stocks in your portfolio, you won't want to miss our guest.  Erica Klauer, high- tech analyst of Salomon Brothers joins us with her technology picks and pans.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Two high-profile technology companies painting a gloomy picture for the industry.  Apple Computer rubbing out its competition.  And if you're wishing you had a seat on center court at the U.S. Open, juice up that computer.  All that and more in our \"DIGITAL JAM WEEKLY.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(voice-over): This is DIGITAL JAM WEEKLY.</p><p>A couple of big tech companies issued warnings about future earnings after a huge run-up in stocks.  First, computer direct marketer Gateway 2000 said it won't meet the street's expectations because of the impact of the UPS strike and intense price competition.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Then chip maker Advanced Micro Devices surprised analysts when it says it is having trouble wrapping up production of the K6 chip, a rival to Intel's Pentium Processor.</p><p>GENE GLAZER, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, FORTIS ADVISERS: What is happening with AMD is that they're gearing up this major production facility to do the K6.  As it happens, they're not getting the yields out of that plant that they had would hoped that they would get.  So, they're not selling it, or they're not able to sell, as many units of the K6 as they thought.</p><p>What that means in a high-fixed cost business, which is what this is, that if you don't get the revenue side you get killed on the cost side.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Apple made a big move by buying the core assets of Mac-clone maker Power Computing for $100 million in stock.  In just two years Power Computing built a $300 million business out of selling Mac compatible computers and ate into Apple's core business.</p><p>And Netscape launched a new free online service for the business community called Net Center.  Netscape's home page is the most frequently visited site on the web and now the company is moving to keep surfers there with new features.  Like automatic downloads of software.</p><p>JAMES BARKSDALE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NETSCAPE COMMUNICATIONS: We're already the largest provider of software downloads on the web and this would just increase that because our web store will be easier -- our software store would be easier to use. And then new features of the Communicator and Navigator allow you to automatically download just segments of software.</p><p>Right now we're coming up with 100 different software companies. Hundreds and hundreds of products along with the Netscape softwares.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: The leader of the direct broadcast satellite industry, Direct TV, may be in hot water.  20 state attorneys general are looking into allegations of consumer fraud claiming the company sold customers a package of TV channels and removed some of the channels later.</p><p>The social security administration plans to reopen it's controversial web site that allows tax payers to compute their future retirement benefits.  The site was shut down earlier this year when critics said it provided too much private financial information.</p><p>And the tennis world is focused on Flushing Meadows this weekend for the finals of the U.S. Open. But if you can't make it to the tourney, check out <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.usopen.org\">www.usopen.org</url> for up to the minute and array multi-media tidbits.</p><p>That's our wrap of the week high-tech business news on DIGITAL JAM WEEKLY.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (on camera): That's the big picture.</p><p>As you heard, some earnings warnings rattled investors this past week and my guest says some more surprises can be expected in the week ahead.  But overall, the outlook for tech sector is a good one.  She is Erica Klauer, technology analyst with Salomon Brothers.</p><p>It's great to have you on MONEYWEEK.</p><p>ERICA KLAUER, TECH ANALYST, SALOMON BROTHERS: Thanks.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: What do you think of the warnings?  That's the big question.</p><p>KLAUER: I think that the warnings that I saw on my sector was with Advanced Micro Device.  This company has finally broken through with a K6 product that has legitimate competition for Intel.  However, the company has had production problems, so they're sort of in a bind in the sense that they can -- they have the product but just can't make it.  I think that it will take a while before Advanced Micro Devices is able to compete effectively with Intel on a volume basis.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: This was interesting this whole week when a company came out with bad news didn't spill over to other companies like in Intel and that sector and the other chip stocks.  Why is that?  Is this a company by company thing?</p><p>KLAUER: I think what we're see sag widening of the gap between the leaders and the contenders.  Advanced Micro Devices is clearly having a tough go of it against such competitor like Intel.  And what I thought was interesting is that was also the trend in some other areas outside semi-conductors.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: PC makers exactly the same case, right?  Gateway 2000 came out with a warning but Dell kind of rolled along.</p><p>KLAUER: Exactly.  I mean I think that Gateway had reported that they had seen increased price competition.  That they were going to have to take a write off in the quarter to account for some average selling price erosion.</p><p>So, I think what's happening with Gateway is that they're seeing more competition from Dell and Compaq in their traditional consumer mail-order segment.  And they're having a tough time competing with Compaq and Dell in the corporate market.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Overall we talk about valuations, the price to earnings, price to book.  Do you think in fact the evaluations are very high?  The names that come up again and again are Dell and Compaq trading at very high levels compared to history.</p><p>KLAUER: Absolutely.  I think we've seen a broad multiple expansion in the technology sector in general.  And if you look at absolute PE's, absolute price to book values, they certainly are at the upper end of the historical range.  However, if you factor them relative to the market they are sort of the in the middle of the range.</p><p>So, I think they look reasonable.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: And you're positive about the future now.  So, this is not bothering you the fact that the Nasdaq Composite set a record on Friday and we're plowing ahead here.</p><p>KLAUER: I'm not concerned.  I'm actually very bullish on technology stocks in general.  I think that the technology spending is generally intricately linked to the health of the overall economy. And as long as that remains in tact I think we're going to see positive earnings from a lot of these companies.</p><p>The other thing I would mention is also inventories are at very low levels across the board which really creates for a very healthy order environment.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Unlike the rest of the economy right now.  That's odd for the technology sector, right?</p><p>KLAUER: Absolutely.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Going ahead do you think, in fact, that these companies can maintain the robustness of their sales?  There was some concern that we hit a peak for Dell, and it couldn't maintain revenues of 66 percent quarter by quarter, but -- what are your thoughts?</p><p>KLAUER: I think that the critical long-term factor is PC unit growth.  And with worldwide penetration rates still at reasonably low levels -- only around four or five percent -- I think that the long- term outlook is positive.</p><p>Whether Dell can maintain 60 percent plus sales growth rate I think probably is in question.  But certainly the overall demand picture, I think, looks pretty good.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Going ahead we had National Semiconductor surprising the market on the upside.  That was a name that was tarnished before, but it came back.</p><p>KLAUER: National is one of the stocks that we've liked for quite some time.  They've got a great new CEO, Brian Halla (ph) and they've weeded a lot of the unprofitable products from their mix.</p><p>And they again are an example of a company that has seeing extremely low inventory levels at their customers.  And so the order rates have really come back, even in a time when you get a seasonable slow down.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: I don't want to leave out the big name, Intel. Continues to plow ahead, do you like the stock?</p><p>KLAUER: Intel is a tougher call for me.  I've been wrong on the stock.  I haven't liked it recently and yet it's gone ahead.  I was concerned that the earnings cuts would hurt the stock and yet it's just continued to have enormous momentum.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Texas Instruments finished the week sprinting gaining better than $3.  The stock has tripled in the last year and you still like it.</p><p>KLAUER: My bet is on Texas Instruments.  I think this is the a tremendous company.  Their new CEO, who took the home of the company last year, is doing an enormous job in terms of really focusing on digital signal processors.  These products carry higher margins.  The order rates are very robust.  The (inaudible) entry are high.</p><p>And I think this is going to drive the overall financial performance and reward the stock in turn, I think, with a doubling over the next year.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: OK, great, thanks for the analysis.</p><p>KLAUER: Thanks.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Erica Klauer, once again, Tech Analyst at Salomon Brothers.</p><p>Still ahead on MONEYWEEK, a multibillion dollar merger heating up the hotel business.  And smokers beware: your habit is getting pricier.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN GRAPHIC)</p><p>TECHSTOCKS</p><p>Gateway 2000 down 5 3/8 Advanced Micro Devices down 2 5/16 National Semiconductor up 6 13/16 Intel up 2 7/16 Apple Computer up 7/16</p><p>(END GRAPHIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Doubletree and Promus linking up to create the world's third largest hotel chain with revenues of $5 billion.  The new company will be called Promus Hotel and will operate hotels under the Doubletree, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn and Red Lion names.</p><p>Overall, the deal is seen as a nice fit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH COCCIMIGLIO, HOTEL ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: I think this is a good example of a merger where one plus one equals three.  You've got a company, Doubletree, which known as a manager full-service hotels -- hotels that offer conferences and so forth. And you've got a company, Promus Hotels, which is really known as franchiser of limited service hotels -- their best brand is Hamptons.</p><p>So you've got overlapping brands.  They've got a better broad coverage of brands and now better geographic diversity as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Shares of Doubletree down 5/8 on the week and Promus soaring nearly seven and a quarter.</p><p>U.S. sanctions on Japanese shipping went into effect Thursday. Several cargo ships docking in U.S. ports getting slapped with $100,000 fines.  The fines in retaliation for what U.S. regulators view as unfair trade practices in Japanese harbors.</p><p>Bill Dorman has more from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL DORMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Docking and unloading a ship in Japan can cost three times as much as it does at a U.S. port.  U.S. officials have been complaining about restrictive practices at Japanese ports since the early 1980s.  Earlier this year, the dispute went to the brink of sanctions, leading to a one-day strike by Japanese dock workers.</p><p>The three targeted Japanese shipping lines plan to absorb the costs of the sanctions.  One company official says it will cost more than a million dollars a month.</p><p>DODD FIORI, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, NYK LINE: We definitely believe that we're in the middle if this issue.  This is a bilateral government to government issue and we're a commercial entity that's not benefiting from any of these practices.  And we believe, frankly, unfairly being penalized.</p><p>DORMAN: A source familiar with the issue says the real story is a dispute within the Japanese ranks.  The Ministry of Transport has been trying to persuade a powerful industry group, the Japan Harbor Transport Association, to change some of its practices.  The JHTA organizes work teams at ports and has veto control over any schedule changes by shippers, a practice known as prior consultation.  It's a practice that goes back to the days after World War II, when organized crime, the Yakuza ruled the Japanese waterfront.</p><p>One Tokyo based source familiar with the issue says the scene is much like the one depicted in the 1950s movie \"On the Waterfront,\" where organized crime controlled labor on the docks.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP OF \"ON THE WATERFRONT\" COURTESY RCA/COLUMBIA PICTURES)</p><p>Some question whether continuing influence of organized crime is complicating the current negotiations.  In the past, the court dispute has gone to the highest levels of government.</p><p>(on camera): The head of the U.N.'s Federal Maritime Commission says the goal remains their resolution of the dispute and not the sanctions.  But speaking of the Japanese he adds, quote, \"The ball is in their court now.\"</p><p>Bill Dorman, CNN Financial News, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Smokers, get ready to feel the pinch from the big tobacco company settlements.  The nation's largest cigarette makers are jacking up prices.  Phillip Morris, RJR Nabisco and Brown and Williamson are raising wholesale prices a hefty seven cents a pack. And retailers are likely to add on to that.</p><p>Tobacco companies are attempting to cover up some of the nearly $1 billion in up front payments after settlements in Florida and Mississippi.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARTIN FELDMAN, TOBACCO ANALYST, SMITH BARNEY: Clearly they have to raise money from customers.  It's in the industry's interest to go for a long period of small increases rather than a contractibal short period of very big increases.</p><p>I think consumers sort of feel it less if the -- if prices go up slowly rather than big massive increases.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Some analysts say the price hike may also signal the industry believes Congress will approve the $368 billion national tobacco settlement.</p><p>Coming up next on MONEYWEEK, contributing editor James Q. Wilson has a few thoughts on the death of Princess Diana when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Welcome back.</p><p>Political commentator and contributing editor to \"MONEYLINE,\" James Q. Wilson has been observing the global outpouring of grief for Princess Diana.  He has his own perspective on all the emotion and spoke about it on \"MONEYLINE WITH LOU DOBBS.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES Q. WILSON, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Why in the world does anyone care what happened to a young woman named Diana?  She had no power and few accomplishments.  Many know what causes she supported, but if she supported none of them the outpouring of grief for her would still be impressive.</p><p>She became the object of our fascination because in 1981 she married the heir to the British throne.  She was, for awhile, part of royalty.</p><p>Over a century ago the British writer Walter Badgett (ph) wrote that a monarch retains the feelings by which heroic kings once governed.  Kings, and now queens, have this great virtue.  They draw the attention of the nation to one person or one family doing interesting things.  By contrast the democratic government divides the public's attention among many leaders doing uninteresting things.</p><p>We all now prefer democracy, but as Badgett explained, so long as the human heart is strong and human reason weak, royalty will engage us because it appeals to a deep feeling.  Democracy will annoy us because it only appeals to rational understanding.</p><p>Princess Diana drew our feelings because she seemed to be a warm and vulnerable part of an ancient system of rule.  A system that draws from even we, small, D-Democrats a mystic reverence that no legislature can produce.  When she married Prince Charles we were absorbed by a petty event with irresistible appeal.  We liked the idea of there being a first family.  She was more than a movie star celebrity.  She was instead part of an old claim that a family can rule a nation.  The claim is dead, but the public's heart does not admit it.</p><p>This is James Q. Wilson.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: And that is MONEYWEEK.

We're going to get started. Welcome to the presentation portion of Hudson Pacific Properties 2018 Analyst and Investor Day. I hope everybody had a great time last night. I think I see some new English [PMs] in our audience. You can admit it, it's okay. As most of you know, I am Laura Campbell, I'm head of Investor Relations and I'm delighted to be your host this morning.</p><p>First and foremost, I want to thank you all for coming. I know that many of you traveled cross-country or came from ICSC, and we're just thrilled that you're here joining us live for our second biannual Investor Day.</p><p>And as you can see from the agenda in your folders, we have a terrific lineup this morning of management and guest presentation. So I'm just going to run through that high level. We're going to start with our Chairman and CEO, Victor Coleman, who'll provide a snapshot of where we are today, how we got there, and give you a sense of what the future holds. Art Suazo, our EVP of Leasing, will take you through, in his words, the blocking and tackling of our portfolio-wide leasing efforts. This is the nuts and bolts of how deals get done and what we're most focused on right now.</p><p>We'll hear from industry expert, Spencer Levy, Head of Research for CBRE, who will provide a macro and micro view of the drivers of growth in our West Coast markets and in Silicon Valley. Drew Gordon, our SVP of Northern California, will dig into our competitive positioning in the Peninsula and Silicon Valley. Former Head of Global Workplace, for our tenant Uber, Adony Beniares, will give us some insight into how tech and other growth companies are thinking about real estate. That should be a real treat. Bill Humphrey, our SVP of Studios, will provide an update on the tech and media convergence and our accomplishments and game plan for that line of the business. And finally, the grand finale always, we'll hear from Mark Lammas, our COO and CFO, who after showcasing our superior credit metrics is going to give you a throwback to 2016, our bridge to success outlining our strong NOI growth through 2019 and provide some perspective on our current valuation.</p><p>Now for some logistics. You're going to receive a lot of information today. The presentation materials are available for download on our website, and the webcast will be available for replay on our website as well. We're going to keep introductions short, but in the folders you have all the bios on the speakers for today and from yesterday as well. There will be one Q&amp;A period only following Mark Lammas' presentation and all of our speakers will be available to answer questions. So please hold them until that time. And there will also be one 10-minute break after Spencer Levy, and we're going to have some great snacks, so step outside and enjoy those. And we're going to do our very best to stay on track time-wise, because I know people have to get to the airport and other places after this.</p><p>Finally, before we kick off the presentations, I'd like to remind everyone that this morning, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to our GAAP financial results in the presentation's appendix and in our supplemental. We will also be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, discussing our SEC filings. Actual events could cause or current expectations to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, which we undertake no duty to update.</p><p>And now since you're going to hear us talk about ourselves most of the day, we thought it would be helpful for you to hear from our partners, our tenants, some of the civic leaders in our markets as to what makes Hudson Pacific a truly fantastic company.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>LAURA CAMPBELL: And with that I give you our Chairman and CEO, Victor Coleman.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: Good morning, everybody. Thank you all. Well, that's kind of like a puff piece, but we always like to do puff pieces. I want to thank Laura, I want to thank the team, when you get to do a piece like that, people sort of think it's like a group effort, and it's nothing but a group effort at Hudson. We have a phenomenal team, which I'm going to get into a little bit. And everybody here, senior management inclusive, these guys are awesome. You guys had a good time last night? I did. So just a couple of protocol issues. We're going to take your phones and delete the videos from last night, on your way out, nobody was there. No, we had a great time.</p><p>So we're going to jump right into this, and I really -- I think, as Laura said, before I jump into this, there's going to be ton of information. So you should write down some questions, because I think you're all going to have a bunch of things to ask us at the end of the day, I hope.</p><p>So with that, so we continue to invest and focus in the epicenters of innovation, tech and media. It's something we used to do for the last 12 years, it's something we've established a significant foothold and what is the most important part of our market is these 2 industries. As a result of that, each of these markets has a mix in factors that provide us with a lot of staying power. And perhaps the most important is the intellectual capital in our marketplace at very, very established industry structure -- clusters. The most cutting-edge thinkers and doers want to be in these marketplaces. And as the capital markets grow and inflows of major corporations, tech, groundbreaking start-up companies, we are fortunate to be in the epicenter of that.</p><p>Today, as Laura said, we're going to have Spencer Levy, Head of Research of CBRE, talk about this, he is going to dig into the drivers of technology, impact, employment growth, and what our markets are and how they are going to outpace other markets in the country. And both tech and non-tech sectors are very active in the foreseeable future, and so we're going to take a little closer look at our positioning and what our markets are and what our submarkets are and how we go from there.</p><p>So in Los Angeles, it's very unique. Right now, as you all know, we're the largest independent owner of studios in the United States. We capitalize on the tech and media marketplace. I think we've had a vision in this for a long time, we've seen it grow. In addition to our 3 studios, which Bill is going to talk about, we have an additional 2.5 million square feet and growing immediately to almost 3.5 million, and then from there, hopefully to 4.5 million with our development, which we'll talk about. It's growing not through acquisitions, it's growing through redevelopment and development of our assets, land banking that we've had, not on our balance sheet, and future growth. As Bill is going to discuss, the growth has typically been in the media side here in Los Angeles, traditional streaming and non-streaming networks, and growth networks in the media business have been growing exponentially. This market is maturing, the Silicon Beach market is flowing through to other markets, which is maturing. And the last and most important I think Los Angeles is, we have very limited supply, which we're going to get into as well today.</p><p>Go up north, we talk about our institutional ownership in the valley. We're the largest owner of assets in the valley, both in the Peninsula and Silicon Valley. Our portfolio consists of 3 key marketplaces as you well know: Foster City and Redwood Shores and sort of the central county; Palo Alto, where we are the largest landlord as well in the Stanford Research Park area; and the San Jose Airport, which is essentially the downtown adjacent marketplace that has now capitalized with Google and everybody else, it's growing. Drew is going to talk about the competitive edge that we have in those markets, the tenant mix that's there, but our assets in that marketplace are 87% leased and our expirations over the next 4 quarters is about 20% mark-to-market.</p><p>We expect to see considerable NOI growth in those marketplaces, and these markets have superior talent and also unbelievable capital inflows, which we're going to talk about today a little bit on the VC capital standards. Large tech companies continue to expand, also non-tech companies are growing at a rapid pace as well. But you know them, as we all sit here today, the big 3, Facebook, Google and Apple.</p><p>Go to the city, what do we say about San Francisco? I mean, we own 2.3 million square feet in probably the hottest market in the country, and it's been the hottest market in the country for the last 5-plus years. Iconic assets: South of Market place -- sorry, Mid-Market and the Financial District. While we have minimal mark-to-market in those marketplaces over the next 4 quarters, we've seen in-place rents 32% below market right now, and we have some unique opportunities with the vault space in our 1455 asset, but our mark-to-market is well in excess after this year of 30-plus percent. Also incredible talent base growth, capital inflows and public and private tech, not to mention that the Prop M has really helped out San Francisco and all the owners in that marketplace.</p><p>Smaller but yet a very active market for us and something we're very excited about is our Seattle marketplace. Our growing presence in downtown Seattle, we focused on Pioneer Square, South Lake Union and the Denny area. Our portfolio there is 94% stabilized; not much role through -- until '19, but in '19, our mark-to-market role is in excess of 25%. Deep talent pool there as well, central theme of capital inflows in that marketplace and a presence of blue-chip companies and in-migration of tech companies growing there in their second hubs.</p><p>So tech and media. Tech represents about 40% of our company, media about 15%, for an aggregate of 55%. Our top-tier tenants, Google, Uber, Netflix, NFL. FIRE-based companies balance out our tenancy. Companies like ZipRecruiter and DoorDash are considered non-tech. And tech and non-tech industries are increasingly intertwined in our portfolio and overlapping on a greater basis.</p><p>To put a finer point on tenant quality, you can look here. 84% of our tenancy, public or private companies have been in business for 10 years. Including Uber, that number jumps to 92%. 75% of our tech tenancy, public and private companies have a valuation of $1 billion or greater. 60% of our tenants in that same sector group have a valuation of $10 billion or greater. Stabilized force, tenancy that's more than just sticky, they're stable and growing. So when you invest with us, yes, you're getting tech exposure, but you're getting the best exposure for the outperformers.</p><p>Looking at the capital allocation since inception, 40% of our portfolio has been core, core plus, 45% has been value add. Much smaller percentage of that has been redevelopment and development in our portfolio, about 15%. Core plus and value add projects range from a minimal lease-up to mark-to-market, to minor repositionings, to operational improvements. So significant retaining and repositioning in assets that we have built throughout the portfolio.</p><p>Our target stabilized yields are in the range of 5% to 7% for that property type. If you look to 7-plus percent, is what we've been looking at and achieving well in excess of that for our redevelopment/development assets. We like the risk-reward potential, the proposition of these types of projects. And although we have the capabilities to invest wisely, I think we've shown our discipline across these metrics on a full spectrum by what we've owned and what we've significantly improved.</p><p>If you look at the investment buckets that we've made, there's some pretty impressive ones. Rincon is an example. We captured significant mark-to-market rents, we rolled over time, we put Google and Salesforce in. It's a Class A asset, 4% cap rate. If you look at 1455, we took an 80% occupied basically former data center and we repositioned it for the corporate headquarters for Uber and for Square.</p><p>Everybody knows the ICON story, you were there last night, but we love to tell it: a world-class headquarters facility for Netflix and an entr\u00c3\u00a9e in Southern California that was a former parking lot. So we find and execute on opportunities across the spectrum. In all instances, our stabilized yields for these projects well surpassed our hurdles. If you look at this compared to what the market caps, as I said, Rincon is like a 4% -- if you had 1455 ICON, probably mid-4s. We focus on core-plus value add. Shorter time to market, less capital-intensive. It lends ourselves less exposure on the development side -- peer development side at any point in the cycle. Today, our exposure is in line with most of our peers, and we're very L.A.-focused. Virtually, all of our development today is in Los Angeles. 100% of the future projects, in the near future, are in Los Angeles area.</p><p>We're -- in terms of our balance sheet, we are capital disciplined for significant growth. We focus not just on maintaining a healthy balance sheet, which Mark and his team had provided, but proactively improving our credit, our metrics and our capital resources. Mark is going to show how that played out over time in his presentation today, but our financing outlines here are that we maintain a low leverage throughout the whole portfolio. Today, we're about 30%. On average, we've been about 25% levered, and we've staggered our maturities and extended our term. We focus on our interest rate exposure and having modest unencumbered tenant base right now of debt on current assets. And most importantly, the -- last 3 years ago, we became investment grade.</p><p>So I started off my presentation about talking about team. And that's the most part -- most proud I am of this entire company. We have a complete competitive advantage here. If you look at our team, the team has been together for the last 12 years. We've lost one senior person in 12 years. There's not a company that's even remotely close to that. We're very stable. We're seasoned. We've got an unbelievable track record. Whether people who were with me at Arden or other companies, the public company exposure and experience in real estate in all our markets have been unbelievable. This full team has led the marketplace in all facets. The -- our relationships -- and as a result of our relationships that we've incurred, this team gets the first, last and sometimes only look at acquisitions in the prospects of the markets that we're in.</p><p>Our capabilities are unlike anybody else. We develop, we redevelop, we reposition, we lease, and it's all in-house. It ties to what I said before, we deploy smart capital, it's proven track records, we create value in ways that others have not had the vision nor had the capacity to do so.</p><p>Turning to our performance. Our portfolio has grown over 5x and resides at over 17 million square feet, going to almost 20 million with our development assets that are in play. Our market cap has increased 1,100% in 8 years. Exponential growth one at a time, in one of the best periods of buying real estate in this cycle or any other.</p><p>At the same time that we've been growing, we've also been prudently selling assets in our portfolio. We sold over $1 billion in our portfolio in the last several years, nonstrategic either in terms of the quality, the location and oftentimes both. This chart shows that we've highlighted our pruning over a period of time. And you can see we've gotten out of marketplaces like Burlingame, Encino, San Diego, Orange County and grown in our core markets. If you even look at this -- the far right side of this between Q4 '17 and Q1 '18, even that portfolio is showing a rebalancing in our core marketplaces and it continues to do so.</p><p>On the leasing market, we've leased 10 million square feet in this portfolio in the last -- since our IPO. We've averaged 46% cash rent spreads. I know people have come to me, talked to our team and said, \"This is an old story.\" This is a really good story, and we like it that it's an old good story. Nobody has had the mark-to-market rents in our marketplace in our sector close to what we've done in the last 8-plus years. So today, our stabilizing in-service portfolios have 94% and 90% leased, respectively. Substantially, we have increased occupancy and rent in every market we're in. Overall, nearly a 1,200 basis point increase in occupancy and a 32% increase in ABR. Art is going to get into this in major detail, and I know, you're going to be anxious for that, but he's going to provide our leasing front metrics and the performance.</p><p>Despite the asset sales, our growth through acquisitions and development and our leasing success, it's enabled us to achieve an outsized cash flow growth in this portfolio relative to our peers, over the last 5 years. As you can see here, it's well above our West Coast peers and well above the remainder as well.</p><p>Prudent to our growth and our organic prospects here, this is where we sit and this is what I think, if you look at what's going in the marketplace today. As I said, significant embedded growth, a lot of opportunity for increased cash flow, which Mark is going to talk about, without doing a lot of acquisitions at all. Currently today, internal growth. Our lease-up portfolio, which people have questioned us on, is going to go from 76% to 92% to be stabilized, and there are great assets in that portfolio that are dropping into the stabilization, like our 11601 or our 450 Alaskan Way asset are going to be in that pool.</p><p>Also, we do have some challenging assets, and we do have row to hoe in some of the assets, but we're all over those. Art is going to take you through asset-specific strategies and progress.</p><p>About 1.2 million square feet of expirations in '18 and '19, and we're already ahead of schedule at a mark-to-market of 18-plus percent on both the -- on both years. We've got great momentum on the development/redevelopment pipeline. As I said, we have 1 million square feet coming to marketplace over the next 2 to 3 years. And on top of that, we've got an additional 900,000 square feet followed behind on our Sunset Gower and Sunset Las Palmas lots that we can come to marketplace probably by '22 or '23.</p><p>We've got world-class future projects in Los Angeles, aligned with tech and media and the convergence, which Bill is going to talk about. We're going to continue to acquire assets, but at a measured pace with the goal of driving more gradual growth. Those assets are going to be funded through the sale of non-core assets and joint ventures. We're going to focus on the higher-yield premium assets, where we can create value and grow foothold in our current core marketplaces. And some of you may have seen a press release or 2 about a potential acquisition in San Francisco. Well, I can't confirm that at this time. We're happy to hopefully make some announcements in the near future on a large acquisition and a large disposition, simultaneously, in our portfolio.</p><p>Now as for something that I thought long and hard about talking about today. So I put this slide up, because I know there's several of you who are a little trigger-happy in writing (expletive). So no, we're not under contract in any new asset in any new marketplace, okay? Nothing is imminent, not at this time, but as a company, we need to be forward thinking and forward looking at other markets in our current asset classes. So any expansion in our company will be on the 2 existing business lines, an office line and our studio line.</p><p>So in terms of office, the marketplace that we would look to today to expand into would be Vancouver. There are many demand drivers in that marketplace, they are similar to what we have in our current portfolio, and they exist in the core markets. And we are doing our research at this time and spending some time with our Seattle-based team to look what's up there. Nearly half the population of Vancouver are between the ages of 20 and 44 years old and it's homegrown to many, many popular expanding tech companies. It draws from 21 different universities and colleges as well as it's got -- it is -- produces 58% of Canada's real GDP and it's growing.</p><p>Another reason we like Vancouver is because they have studios. It's been a sticky studio business. This is not a marketplace that has started and stopped and started and stopped, it's been consistent. So we're going to look at the studio business there as well and see if there are opportunities for us to expand our studio portfolio.</p><p>As to studios, the other market that we're going to look to and get educated on is Atlanta. Atlanta is not New Mexico, it's not Detroit, it's not a part of Michigan, where it's just supported short-term growth. Atlanta now currently, and Bill is going to talk about this a little bit, has a tremendous amount of shows, and some of our current stable media tenants have taken stages and lease stages for multiyear terms. So it's a marketplace we're also going to get educated on.</p><p>And while we look at Vancouver, Atlanta, in the studio business, we're also going to look at New York, because next to Los Angeles, it's the top priority marketplace that has studios. As I said, this is a time that I think given our platform and given the cost of where these guys are and the fact that in these 3 markets, there's not one institutional player, these are marketplaces that we will evaluate, look to see what happens, and from that point on, we'll have conversations whether it's appropriate for us to dig in. So I also think it's important for us to see what other markets are doing on the studio side to see what else we can and can't do in our portfolio.</p><p>So with that, as I said, I'm super excited about our portfolio, our team, our growth and our upcoming announcements that should be very exciting. Laura? I'm going to get my coffee. Thank you.</p><p>LAURA CAMPBELL: Thanks, Victor. And just to be clear, that's Vancouver, Canada. Someone just asked me, so -- our next speaker is Art Suazo, our EVP, or as I often say, MVP of Leasing. So Art, please come forward.</p><p>ARTHUR X. SUAZO, EVP OF LEASING, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: Wow, thank you, Laura. MVP of Leasing, I don't know about that, but I just want to win a title. So thank you very much for the MVP. Thank you very much, thank you all for being here. Welcome to our Investor Day, welcome you all in the room and the tens of people listening around the world on the webcast, welcome.</p><p>I was going to say, it's very difficult to follow Victor, because, well, he's Victor. It's very difficult to follow Victor, but because this is the most important topic of the day, no problem, right? You guys are going to -- I'm going to have your attention. But after last night's performance and rendition, I'll take you there, I'm going to rephrase that and say, it's impossible to follow Victor and please, please God, listen to what I have to say.</p><p>Before I start, I want to frame this properly, this is really just a look back. This is a look back from the last time we all met Q2 2016, so I just wanted to frame that up for you. Oops, the cat out of the bag, I wanted to frame that up for you. But no, this is truly the most important part of our business. It's what we talk about every day amongst ourselves, it's what consumes me, it's what we talk about with all of you on an ongoing basis, and it is exciting. I live and breathe it every day, so if I get overly excited, I apologize. That's just -- that's me, and as we say in Southern California, I'm super stoked to be talking about this.</p><p>So -- but I'm not just excited, I'm really -- I'm pleased with the performance of the team, their accomplishments to date, and I'm really proud of them setting us up for future successes in the coming quarters. And how do they do that? Well, it's by substantially growing the pipeline coverage, and they've done it consistently since 2016. It's executing the play that Victor was talking about, executing on the ground this strategy that drives activity and sets us apart -- truly sets us apart from our competition. And it's because of that, that we're all very, very confident about what's coming in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>So let's jump in, because I'm super stoked, let's jump in. Yes, we've been externally busy, we've been extremely busy since that point in time. We have leased 4.8 million square feet of space. That's 2.2 million square feet of new deals, 2.6 million square feet of renewal deals. So this is exhibit A that we've been extremely busy, exhibit B is my hairline. You remember me with the pompadour, don't you, 2 years ago. We've been extremely busy, but of these executed deals, I want to say 3.6 million square feet of those deals, 3.6 million were either renew or backfill deals done at a weighted average of 31% mark-to-market. That's an amazing number. I guarantee, our competition is nowhere near that number.</p><p>But we're not done yet. Listen, we've got -- we realize, we have accomplishments. We're executing our ground game impeccably, but we've got a lot of wood to chop. As Victor said, we've got 2.7 million square feet of deals expiring in all of 2018 and into 2019. So nobody, especially me, is taking their foot off the gas, but I'm encouraged, because we're way ahead of schedule, team is way ahead of schedule. We've got 65% coverage on the 2018 expirations now, and we've got 34% coverage on the 2019 expirations already. So that's great news.</p><p>So let me explain to you what I mean by coverage, and then we're going to dig into the 2018 and 2019 expirations. What I mean by coverage is simply it's the combination of completed deals and deals in negotiation. That is the same deals in -- I would like to say, trading paper deals that are in proposals, LOIs and leases. The combination of those, those are real deals that we're negotiating on. Of the 40% completed deals, in 2018, of the 40% completed deals, they were done at a 31% mark-to-market, again, very impressive. And if you look to the bar chart to the right, it simply just shows the relationship, the composition of our coverage on the renewals for 2018. So you just get a look at the composition.</p><p>Equally impressive as 2018 is 2019, where we have 34% coverage already, as I said, 18% of those completed, 16% in negotiation -- in serious negotiation. And of -- by the way, of the 18% completed, which we did had a 27% mark-to-market, again, a very, very high number. We've knocked down 2 of our biggest expirations next year, right? You often ask us, who are they? Well, InvenSense, in San Jose for 140,000 square feet, all right, and Capital One up in Seattle, it's about 130,000 square feet. We backfilled just about all of that space. I think we have one floor -- one of the floors left, but we have activity on that. So we're really moving in the right direction. And then once again, the bar chart just demonstrates the coverage on that activity across all of our markets.</p><p>So we're not slowing down at all, right? We're executing the ground game. We are moving and it's because of our pipeline. You hear me talk about pipeline all the time. Let me define pipeline for you. Pipeline is, again, deals in negotiation, proposals, LOIs and leases. These are real deals. These are real requirements. A lot of landlords, they pad their pipeline. And ask them, I challenge you to ask them. They have tours in their pipeline, that's not something we put in our pipeline. Inquires in their pipeline, and I swear to God, they put in unnamed tenants that are floating around the market. None of that exists in our pipeline. It's very conservative, which is why I'm so encouraged by these numbers. And as you can see, from Q2 2016, we increased our pipeline by 1.1 million square feet, right? So if you think about it, we've leased on average about 600,000 square feet of deals per quarter, right, since Q2 2016.</p><p>Well, we haven't just reloaded the pipeline. That's a whole different story, you reload the pipeline. And by the way, I had a great slide for that, but it was inappropriate. Reloaded the pipeline, we've grown the pipeline, right? I had [bandolero], the whole thing, but it was -- I can't. We've grown it, and said a different way, we've grown the coverage from 52% on the availability to 70% on the availability. Again, very, very encouraging and this is -- to me, this is the most important, because this is our lifeblood. When you ask me, hey, Art, such and such deal you're going to make, what's going on it? I always say, you've heard me say it, this is my crystal ball. It informs what's closing next week and it informs what's closing next quarter and well into the next year. So again, very important and I wanted to underscore that.</p><p>And this is the composition of our pipeline across all regions, and you can see how it compares to our availability. And it is in lockstep, right, where you think we need activity, we have it and the team is doing a great job of executing. So I keep saying that you do a great job of executing the game plan, right? They are filling up the pipeline, they're growing the pipeline, because that's our lifeblood. Well, what does that mean? Well, they are executing a game plan that we've been running for a long time, and I am proud to say that not a lot of landlords do it, it's quite overlooked, right? We've been running a play out of this playbook since the beginning of Hudson. Victor and I've been running this play since, God, into past lives, in different companies. For 20 years, we've been running this because it works. It's really -- it's a two-pronged approach -- it's a two-pronged approach that we run in tandem and we've tried to get to ensure we did close on every deal. And it sounds corny, but -- on -- whether it's a 1,000 foot deal or it's a 300,000 square foot deal, we're running this program in tandem, and our team is executing flawlessly, as you can tell by the momentum we have.</p><p>But let's start with the -- what it is. It's the broker experience and it's the tenant experience. And we try to enhance those experiences, as I said, in tandem. Let's talk about the broker side of the equation real quick. Often, most of our -- not often, it's the most overlooked. Most landlords you talk to, they are going to say the broker -- how many times have you heard this? Brokers are necessary evil, right? Almost a joke. Well, that's just a bad way to look at it. We embrace that experience, because brokers represent 95% of the tenants out in the market. They represent 95% of the tenants out in the market. So not only are we embracing it, but we're out -- we're forging new relationships. Nobody, nobody has better and deeper relationships than we do across all the markets. It starts with the third-party brokerage teams on the ground, it moves into our seasoned HPP leasing team, and it includes all the senior management at Hudson. And we forge these relationships, we foster them, and again, we're out always trying to establish better relationships.</p><p>How do we do that? Well, we do exclusive events with brokers. When I say exclusive events, I mean, events like a black tie event, like we have in Silicon Valley; ski trip, like we have with the top echelon brokers in Seattle; day at the races and so forth, right? We have brokers coming up to us going, hey, how can I get invited, right? You don't think it's a big deal, how can I get invited? How can I bring you a deal to get invited? It really makes a difference. We run that in tandem with the streamlined process. What is that? Well, simply making the deal easier, that's really what that means. We try to start the deals on second base, on third base, right, so we're not reinventing the wheel. And these guys, they appreciate it, because the deal is getting done faster. So what happens when the deal gets done faster? Yes, yes, we appreciate that too, because we get rent earlier, but for them, deal gets done faster, they get paid faster. Let's not forget that part of the equation. So we marry this up, and again, we run it in tandem with the enhanced tenant experience.</p><p>So let's talk about -- let's talk about what that is. Listen, nobody approaches building out space the way we do, especially with the experience we have with new economy tenants. And you heard Rob Jernigan talk about it yesterday. We are out trying to create -- we're trying to create more active spaces. Yes, we do lobbies, corridors and restrooms and that's great, but we activate spaces that perhaps were never used before, right? We reamenitize space for the tenants and we increase their ability -- well, we enhance their experience there for sure, but what we do is -- they use it as a recruiting tool, right, to recruit new tenants, to retain tenants. It's a very competitive environment out there, and we feel like we're way ahead of the curve. And so that's what we're doing, and you're going to see examples of that coming up on some of the assets. Again, we run these 2 programs in tandem, and it works perfectly.</p><p>Now the last bullet point on there that isn't just a bullet point on the slide, is the Vacant Suite Prep program. You've heard us talk about it, the VSP program. I wanted to give this a little bit more attention, so I've got another slide, but again, it is part of our game plan and we run that on the ground to perfection. The VSP program, Vacant Suite Prep program, it's something we started several years ago as an attempt to lease functionally obsolete space, very difficult space, super, super challenging space. So we - it was a forward spend of tenant improvement dollars to creatively enhance spaces like, oh, I don't know subterranean spaces, spaces that were impacted by mechanical rooms and things like that. Well, it worked. We leased the space up even faster than we had imagined. And guess what, not only has it worked, but over the last 3 years, we've built out 800,000 square feet of VSP space. That's 144 suites, right, and we've leased it. We've leased 76% of these suites faster than we would have imagined, and there is no way we could've done this level of work in the last 3 years if it wasn't due to the teams on the ground, Josh's team. And he did it with military precision. That's a shout out to West Point, Josh, military precision. Now we've got another 200,000 square feet, 200,000 square feet of space that we're building, and we're trying to keep up with demand. And again, we deploy these spaces strategically across the portfolio, right, in the areas where you think we need to, Silicon Valley, the Peninsula, and we do it in a very, very smart way.</p><p>Look at the pie chart to the right, 86% of the VSP suites are under 10,000 feet, 63% of the suites are under 5,000 square feet, right? We know this from the intel on the ground that we're getting from our third-party brokers, and again, it is working and it's moving the needle in a big way. The volume of these certainly moving is in a big way.</p><p>So this is our bread-and-butter, Peninsula, Silicon Valley, this is our bread-and-butter, but we are not taking our eye off the prize. We are not taking our eye off the ball, because you all talk to us about the large block activity -- the large block availability -- excuse me, and this is it. So I want to walk with you -- I want to walk you through what we're doing on the large blocks to make a difference. We're already seeing an increase in activity based upon the programs that we're running and the spaces that we're building.</p><p>So let's take them one by one -- if this thing cooperates with me. Metro Center, 171,000 square feet of availability. As you know, it's the tower, right, it's the high-rise tower and it's 2 Hillsdale buildings. Drew and his team on the ground have done an amazing job of reimagining the lobby and -- the entrance and creating a grand lobby, right? He has also activated spaces in the Hillsdale buildings that is really kind of indoor-outdoor space that a lot of the tenants are using. And because of that, you see, we've got 70,000 square feet of deals in serious negotiation and there's another 82,000 square feet of deals or active prospects in the market. Again, it's reactivating spaces, it's also the use of some VSP in the tower and some large-scale VSPs in the Hillsdale building. And, again, we're very, very successful.</p><p>Metro Plaza in San Jose. Well, this is a great case study for VSP, okay? 122,000 square feet available. We had a couple of big moveouts, and we're making the space more attractive to the smaller tenants that are dominating that market, okay? 55,000 square feet of deals in negotiation, I say, it's a case study for VSP, because that's like 12, 13 deals, right? That's hand-to-hand combat. These guys were churning the VSPs over, and we're trying to keep up with the demand. There's a 110,000 square feet behind it, and again, it's working, right? You're going to see the needle move in a big way here, because of the VSP program.</p><p>You may have heard of this one, right, Cisco, Cisco moved out. We knew that was coming, we underwrote it as such, we looked at it as an opportunity to unlock more value, like we've done in other assets. Once again, Drew and his team hard at work. They reimagined, not only the entrance, right, not only the entrances and the lobbies, they created a large-scale VSP on the second floor that looks phenomenal. They just finished the work probably about 1.5 months ago. We had a great open house. The market got to see this in all its grandeur. If you reimagine the campus, indoor-outdoor space, activating the athletic fields, and I've got to tell you, the 2.8 million square feet that's really looking in the greater Silicon Valley, those are the things that they are looking for. So we do have 800,000 square feet in negotiation, I think as I had mentioned on the call, that's 3 deals, and we're looking for some really good news in the next month or so. So stay with us.</p><p>Moving to the Arts District. 220,000 square feet between Maxwell and Fourth &amp; Traction. We -- we've started kind of -- we changed our strategy a little bit on Fourth &amp; Traction. We've done some VSPs down to 5,000 square feet, because that's the information we're getting and we are in leases on about 22,000 square feet there. Have we leased it as quickly as we'd like? We have not, but because we are the class A option in the Arts District, we feel really good about the momentum that's out there. And again, you can see 200,000 square feet of active prospects. And Derric told me just before I walked up here, and I told him not to talk to me before I walk up here, but he did. He said we have a proposal for 2 floors there. So that's more good news coming.</p><p>All right, EPIC in Hollywood. I think you had the opportunity to see the igloo, right? You walked in the igloo and it's an amazing marketing piece for us. I hope we don't upset anybody by calling it an igloo. Any Inuit Americans, I apologize. But it's amazing, it's an amazing building. Chris Barton and his team, they took the best pieces of element, ICON and CUE, and they created the best building in L.A. I swear to you, this thing -- and you saw the views, you saw what it's going to look like, this is -- it's got interior and exterior space, right? Those are not balconies, by the way. That's not your dad's office building. Those are activated exterior premises that tenants can create connectivity, horizontally and vertically, throughout the building. It's unbelievable, and we are negotiating, as you know, on the entire building and we've got another proposal for about 200,000 square feet. It's not even -- it's barely out of the ground, 2 by the way, so we've a lot of momentum. And then the active prospects, listen, 1.5 million square feet, there's no -- there are no large blocks of space in Los Angeles and certainly nothing of this caliber. So again, there's a lot of momentum at EPIC.</p><p>And we continue -- no, no, go back -- we continue the momentum in Hollywood to our Harlow project, right? It's a low-rise, very creative office campus, as you can see, vaulted ceilings. It's on the lot of Sunset Las Palmas. And though we do have 110,000 square feet of negotiations going on -- those are big -- by the way, those are big users for that type of building in that market. I suspect that we're going to be fighting with Bill to see who leases that space, right, because of the embedded growth that he has with content creators that he's going to talk to you about. We are going to be battling on who leases it. I mean, it's going to get leased, but rest assured that there will be a little bit of a battle going on. And whoops, oh man, somebody grab the clicker from me. I'm excited, I told you, I'm stoked.</p><p>Moving on to the Westside, you saw that amazing presentation in panel yesterday with Alex, Jeff Pion and Rob Jernigan. I mean, they said it all, but again, this is the finest real estate in West Los Angeles. You can't amass 500,000 square feet, you certainly can't do it in a creative campus style. It was a failed mall. We've partnered with Macerich. They've actually leveraged our expertise, because they know that we can execute. Somebody said it was the epicenter, that's a bad word here in Southern California. It's not the epicenter, it's the confluence -- it's a confluence of the major transportation corridors and it's just -- it's unbelievable. So I feel fantastic about our opportunities here.</p><p>We're in -- now I can let the cat out of the bag. We are in negotiations for the entire building and we have 1.2 million square feet of active prospects. And the active prospects, again, there's 2 tenants on that active prospect list, they are each about 200,000, 250,000 square feet. They're programming -- they're space planning it on their own nickel, because that's where they want to be. So I feel really bullish about what's going on here, as I do about all of the buildings I talked you about and including the VSPs and how that's driving our activity in the big way.</p><p>So I just want to leave you with no deal is out of reach ever. We're excited about our prospects in 2018 and beyond, because of everything I just told you. And we're going to just keep working the ground game as long as we can.</p><p>So thank you very much for your time, and look forward to questions later.</p><p>LAURA CAMPBELL: I don't know. Art, you're a pretty tough act to follow, too. That was great. And now it's time to hear from our industry guest speaker, Spencer Levy. As I mentioned earlier, Spencer is Head of Research for the Americas and Senior Economic Adviser at CBRE. In that capacity, he manages hundreds of professionals focused on producing market-leading insights on the latest real estate trends. He joined CBRE in 2007 and was previously Executive Managing Director in the company's capital markets division among other roles. He's a frequent speaker at NAIOP, ULI and other well-known industry organizations, and now he's here to share his insights with us. And so I'd like to welcome -- well, first we're going to show a brief video and then you'll hear from Spencer. Thank you.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>SPENCER G. LEVY, HEAD OF RESEARCH - AMERICAS &amp; SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISOR, CBRE GROUP, INC.: Good morning, everybody. The title of today's presentation is called the history of the future. And that video sets it up because what we're going to talk about is looking at the present and the future of not only the world, the United States, but focusing specifically on these markets. But to set it up, people have been trying to predict the future since the beginning of time. And the challenge is they've all been getting it spectacularly wrong. And including some of the smartest minds in the room from Adam Smith, John Maynard Keynes, Milton Friedman and Janet Yellen.</p><p>And the reason they get it wrong is twofold. Number one, they're inconsistent. So for people who follow economics, you'll know that John Maynard Keynes is probably the lion of left-of-center economics, always looking for fiscal stimulus when there's an issue. But what does the left-wing guy say to do in the event of a downturn? He said unleash the animal spirits of capitalists. So the left-wing guy says bring out the capitalist. This is Milton Friedman. For anybody who follows economics, he's the right-wing lion, monetary genius. What did he say to do in the event of a downturn? He said to give out helicopter money, to give money away to the people. So the left-wing guy says unleash the capitalists. The right-wing guy says give money away. It led Harry Truman, then President, to say, \"I want a one-armed economist.\" That way they couldn't say on the one hand this and on one hand that. So problem #1 is inconsistency.</p><p>Problem #2, which is something that everybody in this room deals with, is that looking at the future is both art and it's science. And that picture of the Mona Lisa there was painted using artificial intelligence. And why is it art and science? Because the science of forecasting is wrong the moment the model comes out of your machine. And you must take into consideration the art, and where is the art? And the art is called behavioral economics of taking a look at the behavior not only of the people out there, trying to predict what they're going to do, and humans are inherently very difficult to predict, but also taking a look at the most important picture on your wall, which is the mural because everybody in the room, myself included has bias, which will influence your outlook towards the future.</p><p>So let's look towards the future. Let's start here, 4 more years. This has nothing to do with our current President and the administration, but has everything to do with when is the next recession going to happen, because this is the key assumption that impacts our forecasting both on a macro basis and then market by market. So I had a conversation 2 weeks ago with my global heads of economics around the world, and what is our house view on the next recession? Well, our house view is that it's going to be about 2 years from now. And I mention that because when I spoke on a stage like this 5 years ago, do you know what our house view was then? Thank you, audience participation. And so I said to my people, I said, well, make the case for why the recession is going to be about 2 years from now. And they said, well, inflation is going up and interest rate's going up, and employment is so tight, we just can't grow any faster. And I said, well, in my experience, recessions don't start with a whimper. They start with a thud.</p><p>And what are the thud factors that could take us down? It could be macro; it could be China hard landing; could be an emerging market debt crisis; it could be domestic; it could be monetary or we raise interest rates too quickly; or the #1 risk factor in the world is trade war. And don't take my word for it. McKinsey came out with a study 2 weeks ago, and 55% of the world's CEOs say that is the #1 risk factor in the world. And I listen to those things, and I said China has been doing better than we thought. With the exception of the last couple of weeks where we have seen some issues in Turkey and Argentina, emerging markets are doing fine. The Feds have been walking on egg shells, which brings us back to trade war. And in my opinion, when we're listening to the words of the President, however inflammatory, offensive at times or otherwise, I think we listen too much and we think too little. Because if you read a very important research novel, which is The Art of the Deal from 1987, the President will tell you what he does and why he does it. He does it because he's trying to create the most important thing in the world. There's only 3 things in the world that matter: facts, logic and leverage. And leverage is what he's trying to create through his words. So I'm not trying to defend his words, but I am trying to suggest he's not going to cut off the U.S.' nose despite its face on trade, despite what his surface rhetoric might suggest.</p><p>But let me address the second issue, which is not only when the next recession is going to be, whether it's 2 years out or 4 years out, and I think it could be longer, is interest rates. And interest rates go hand in hand with the other I word, and the other I word is inflation. And in my opinion, I don't worry that much about inflation. We did see an uptick in January from the wage -- wages went up. But there are 4 secular factors that are going to permanently tamp down inflation. Factor number one: too much cheap money in the world; factor number two: too much cheap labor in the world. And these first 2 factors is a terrific book by a gentleman by the name of Daniel Alpert, called The Age of Oversupply. Read those, and you'll agree with me that these 2 factors are going to put a permanent cap on inflation and interest rates. Number three: cheap oil. Even though we've seen an uptick in the last few weeks because of Iran, cheap oil is still going to continue because of the shale oil revolution. But the #1 reason why we're going to see permanently lower inflation, not no inflation but lower inflation, is innovation. Innovation lowers inflation because we use less stuff as the inputs for what we make. So if you take a look at the curves of the world use of copper, iron, steel, oil, all those curves have now bent in terms of the usage. And the question is, will they go negative? And that's a key question about global trade as well.</p><p>But there's another reason why I'm optimistic, we're going to go a bit longer than the 2 years that our house model might suggest: the tax plan, highly stimulative, lower corporate rates, more liquidity, more incentive for CapEx. But I also think it's going to be quite good for our industry in 2 specific areas. One is multifamily because it changes the dynamic between rent versus buy and making rent more attractive than buy because it raises standard deduction among other things.</p><p>I also think it's going to be helpful to the one area that is the most put upon area in all of real estate: bricks-and-mortar retail. Why? First of all, I think the whole case about -- against bricks-and-mortar retail is overblown. But secondly, a disproportionate amount of the benefits in the tax plan help people at or below the median income level. And if you're at or below the median income level from an income tax standpoint, what are you going to do with an incremental dollar? You're going to spend it on consumables.</p><p>So the tax plan's all good, right? Maybe not. We're here in California, salt in your wounds. I don't think I've got to tell anybody what that means. State and local taxes can't be deducted. So what is that going mean? Does it mean everybody's going to move from New York, California and Illinois to Florida, Nashville, Texas, South Dakota? Do you think that's going to happen? It's not going to happen. You are going to see some marginal movement. We have seen some movement of some industries to those places, including a recent announcement from AllianceBernstein moving from New York to Nashville. It's not going to happen. Why do people come here to Los Angeles, to San Francisco, to New York? They don't go to those markets to save money. They go to those markets to make money. Because these markets have the deepest talent pools in United States, if not the world. They also have a live, work, play environment, which are 2 of the 3 most important factors a market must have to thrive over the long term. The third is foreign capital. We'll talk about that in a minute. But here's the deal folks, we measure not just the salaries that people are making, but the quality of the labor force using a whole host of metrics on quality of school, level of education. The best talent in the world is in San Francisco and Seattle by a lot, by every metric we have, and we'll look at it in just a moment. It's also very good in Los Angeles, which is right over here somewhere. But the bottom line is this: yes, it costs a lot more to operate in San Francisco and Seattle, but the quality of the labor force pays for itself. So I wouldn't worry about the change in the tax plan as having negative impact on these markets.</p><p>Does anybody know what this guy does for a living? Somebody shout it out, folks. He makes beer. Was it the beard, was it the tats, was it the beer bottles? Why am I showing this guy on the screen? Because you've seen a lot more of this guy recently, haven't you? You've seen microbreweries pop up everywhere. And why do you think that is? Do you think that is because people like beer more today than they did 5 years ago? No. What this is, is a reaction to the forces of globalization and automation, and people are adapting. And this is one of many examples I can give you of adaptation to those forces, and so we've come up with an expression that local is the new global. You're seeing this in particular in retail, but it's spreading into the office space as well.</p><p>But it brings up a key question. Because when you mention the word globalization, it's become one of these loaded political words like too many things these days. But globalization is not a one-trick pony, globalization is 4 things. It is the flow of money, information, services and goods. And some of them are objectively good, flow of information, flow of money, great. But it's the flow of services and goods where it's gotten complicated. And because of the displacement of so many people, because of the flow of goods, people are now adapting. And by the way, the school of thought that all growth is good is now -- the pendulum is swinging back even among some traditional economists say, \"You know what? Maybe these transitional costs need to be taken into consideration.\" And so the key thing you need to think about is, is global trade actually going to slow down?</p><p>And when you think about globalization, you go, \"Oh, it's all going to get faster.\" Well, guess what? Over the last couple of years, the rate of change has actually gone negative in the percentage of global GDP based on trade. And based upon a recent book 2 weeks ago, Ian Bremmer called, Haves Versus The Have-nots, The Fall of Globalization (sic) [Us vs. Them: The Failures of Globalism], this number may get significantly more negative and will have dramatic implications for our business. That's the bad news. Here's the good news. The good news is it's going to make proximity to talent, proximity to the consumer even more important. So high-density, high-wealth locations like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle are only going to become more valuable in the event globalization does, in fact, slow down.</p><p>Demographics, health care. I put a picture of my recently departed 100-year-old Grandma Bess on the screen for 2 reasons. Number one, I like looking at pictures of my Grandma Bess. Number two, you're going to see a lot more of these Grandma Besses over the next 20 years as the number of Americans over the age of 65 is going to double.</p><p>I was watching the presentation earlier, and I'm a huge fan of tech, media much like everybody in this company is. And one area I didn't hear and you should be hearing more of is health care. Even though health care may seem like this sleepy old-school industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it's going to be the #1 growth industry over the next 10 years. And it's not just in secondary or tertiary markets. This is picking up the pace in New York City, in San Francisco and other markets that are dynamic. So health care is enormous, but demographics is the most important issue in real estate. When people ask me about retail, I say, well, retail is not getting disrupted by the Internet. It's getting disrupted by demographic shifts, where people are moving out of secondary markets into dense or urban markets. And who's moving into the dense or urban markets? Young, highly educated people. So when you're looking for these talent pools, the CBD areas are not only young people, but young and highly educated. The stark difference between having no college education moving into secondary markets versus those people moving into high-density urban markets could not be more pronounced. The talent is in the dense urban locations.</p><p>Planes, trains and automobiles. I came to Los Angeles, I had to put one movie thing in there. What's planes, trains and automobiles about? Not the movie, the concept. The concept is about infrastructure. And the infrastructure is probably the fourth most important factor. After talent; live, work, play; money: infrastructure. The thing about infrastructure, though, is that infrastructure, what's important today may be different than it was 10 years ago, and it's certainly going to be different 10 years from now due to technological changes. My opinion, the most important piece of infrastructure for a market standpoint, not for an individual project standpoint, is planes. And why is planes most important? Because you need to have direct flights between your market and other markets like it.</p><p>The second reason is even more important. It has to do with the flow of goods. Last year, 85% of all goods in the world moved via ship, 3% moved via airplane. 90% of the value of all goods shipped via airplane. So airplanes are extremely important and, I think, are going to get more so. But when we poll our investors, they ask, well, what's the most important thing for your project? So you go from the macro to the micro, and the micro is still commuter rail. But I would suggest to you that airports are going to get more important. And the question is just how much disruption is going to happen from Uber, Lyft and then eventually self-driving cars, to the need to have railways. And the key question of all is parking. Anybody here that -- take a look at the project we talked about yesterday, talked about how they got rid of the entire roof parking deck and made it into green space, which is terrific. And that is at the vanguard of a trend. You're going to see less and less parking. You're seeing less and less people building parking because of these changes in technology.</p><p>Our returns, agile by capital structure. If my good friend and mentor, Ray Torto, was up here on stage today, he would tell you that commercial real estate has earned a 9% unleveraged internal rate of return since the beginning of time. Last year it didn't. It got 7% overall. And the only one that really exceeded it was industrial and everything else was below that. Here is one piece of bad news. Because of upward pressure on interest rates, the major driver of value, which is cap rate compression, is probably only going to get worse because interest rates are likely to rise, but it's not a 1:1 ratio. We think that interest rates are going to go up modestly and that it might have a 15 to 25 basis point impact on cap rates overall, but not necessarily in the high growth markets, where you might see almost no change for the best assets. Here's the better news: we're here in Los Angeles. Even though, the returns overall in the United States have been trending downward, Los Angeles is doing much better than the market, and this will be very similar for Seattle, San Francisco and even Vancouver, some of the markets you're looking at because they have high growth well in advance of the national averages.</p><p>And why do they have this high growth? Reason number one, foreign money. Now a lot of people that are here today say, \"We don't want this foreign money. It's competing with our projects. It's pricing us out.\" Don't look at it that way because foreign money brings with it, and you can take a look at the metropolis site downtown, where Chinese capital is one example, foreign money brings jobs. It also enhances the value of the other stock in the marketplace by depressing cap rates. So Los Angeles, San Francisco, 2 of your top markets are 2 of the top 10 markets in the United States for foreign money. So we look at this number very carefully. And the percentage in San Francisco is one of the highest in the United States.</p><p>And when I talk to markets about where do you want to go? You want to go to the markets where the foreign money is or is going. And I noted in Victor's opening comments, he suggested that San Diego was a market that you're not as high on. I can tell you one of the reasons why. Because the percentage of foreign capital in San Diego is near 0. Foreign money doesn't go there. It doesn't have the dynamism. You want to go to the dynamic market that have high percentage of the foreign money. Seattle is about half that, also dynamic.</p><p>The other capital that we track -- we don't just track foreign money. We track venture capital. And if you take a look at the amount of venture capital that has entered the San Francisco market and you take a look at the rents in San Francisco, I couldn't draw a much more closely associated chart. As venture capital drives that market, you're going to drive rents. And the good news is that venture capital has never been stronger in the tech industries, particularly in San Francisco.</p><p>These are the top 12 markets in the United States according to our investor pool. This is what I might call my, \"drop the mic moment,\" because Los Angeles is #1, and I did not put it up there for any reason other than that's what our investors have said for the last 2 years. Two good reasons, one other reason; two good reasons, one highly diversified economy, the media, the content side of media has gotten increasingly important. They have tech. They have everything. They also were a bit of a laggard. Los Angeles lagged San Francisco. Los Angeles lagged Seattle. So it has more room to run potentially than those markets. So as we talk about the recession, you can't just say the recession is in 2 years because markets that have been laggards might have the ability to go longer. Another market that has that same characteristic is Houston. Houston took it on the chin 3 years ago when the price of oil dropped, but now they are coming out of it. And actually, through a tragic event of their storm, they've actually not only been resilient to the storm, but actually helped the commercial real estate market albeit a terrible loss in the single-family residential market.</p><p>Now you'll notice, there are 2 numbers on the screen, and this is maybe really the key point. One number is where our investors rank these markets. The second number on the screen is the single most important number in commercial real estate, in my opinion, which is projected office-using job growth, okay? And that is what those other numbers are. If you have strong projected office-using job growth, you're going to keep showing up on this list. That's how Tampa Bay made it to this list. I think this year is the first time I said Tampa Bay in my life, in my career. That's why Portland makes it on to this list. That's why Nashville makes it on to this list as well.</p><p>So where were the jobs formed in the first quarter? You'll see that many of those markets that were on the screen are there, but including several of your markets, including San Francisco, Seattle, San Jose, some of the fastest job growth markets in the United States. That's the good news.</p><p>Here's the challenge. The challenge is that these markets are so good, they are literally running out of people and are almost entirely dependent on in-migration for people for new jobs because the unemployment rate in the United States is around 3.9%, and these markets is closer to 2%. In the high skilled trade, it's closer to 1%. So they have to rely on in-migration, which is why when you take a look at our projected office-using job growth in some of those markets, San Francisco doesn't show up on the screen, but L.A. does, which is a little bit of a laggard.</p><p>But -- so this is not throwing San Francisco under the bus because San Francisco is the #1 in-migration market for high-tech talent. How do I know that? We studied it. And you take a look at our chart, there, we ranked markets based upon so-called brain drain or brain gain, okay? At one end of the spectrum is Boston. Boston is the #1 brain drain market in the United States. What does that mean? It means that MIT, Harvard and the other schools produce too many tech graduates, and they've got to go someplace else. Where are they going? They're going to San Francisco; they're going to Atlanta, another market that was mentioned today; Seattle. So notwithstanding the fact that these markets are super tight, they are attracting the smartest talent in the United States and smartest -- and also the highest-quality talent in the United States, which leads me to my ranking. We ranked the top 50 tech markets in the United States, and San Francisco is the clear winner. They're not just the clear winner. They're a clear winner by a gap. And you could have ranked 1 versus 2 versus Seattle. But take a look at the scores based upon our different metrics. They are #1 by an enormous gap, which is why San Francisco and Seattle do so well.</p><p>By the way, another market that we just mentioned today, Atlanta, was our #1 rising market along with Toronto in this year's study. So Atlanta, I agree with what we said before, is the market that's on the rise. Now if you take a look at Los Angeles, Los Angeles is #24 on this list, but Los Angeles isn't a one-trick pony in the high-tech business. They have the creative industry where they're #1. So I would say that high tech is not necessarily the destiny of Los Angeles, but it's part of the story, which is good.</p><p>But tech type does matter. So if you take a look at the type of job growth across the different types of tech, high tech is the dark green line. Media and entertainment, which has also grown since 2007, certainly hasn't grown as quickly nationally, but it's obviously grown very quickly here in New York, Atlanta, Vancouver, several of the markets that were mentioned earlier.</p><p>Multifamily. I think it's important that we address the multifamily market because one of the key questions for growth is livability of a city. And one of the things I mentioned before is that the tax plan is now going to increase the number of renters versus buyers. And the reason for it isn't just the tax plan. This has been a massive secular shift in the number of renters versus buyers, which is not going to change. Now when I say it's not going to change, it changed slightly in the first quarter. In the first quarter, it changed slightly where we had a 50 basis point increase in the percentage of buyers versus renters. But do you know what the homeownership rate is today? The homeownership rate today is the same rate it was 50 years ago. So ultimately, you're not seeing much gain. And you take a look by age cohort, this is the millennial age cohort, who are finally buying homes. This is the baby boomer age cohort, which is buying homes. But who is this little age cohort right here? The 40 to 54 year olds. Those are the Gen Xers, my generation, who had the command decision to buy their first house between 2002 and 2007, which was the worst time in the history of creation to buy your first house. And we aren't buying it again. But the millennials, while they did uptick in the amount that they're buying, them and the generation behind them are so saddled with student loans, very difficult to buy, and baby boomers are going to age out.</p><p>Now when people take a look at a chart like this, they say, wow, San Francisco, Los Angeles, how could anybody afford to live there? It's 125% of the cost of living, and I mean, look how far up New York is, more than double what it is almost in San Francisco. You know how they can afford to live, and you know why you're still going to see growth in these markets? Because this isn't the number that matters.</p><p>You know what number matters? This one because this number shows the value of the rental based upon the average tech worker's salary. And you see it on that metric, they're still affordable. And how do I know it's affordable? Because typically the danger zone for where you are unaffordable is 33% to 35% of your take-home pay. Every one of the markets is below 30%, even the most expensive market in New York, Los Angeles slightly below that, even San Francisco. So for the types of tenants that you are going to attract in your buildings, notwithstanding how expensive it is, it's affordable for their average employee.</p><p>Office. This is my office here in Glendale, California. You guys know all about the interior changes to the space. I would suggest to you that the interior change to the space is something that you guys are expert in. But I would just suggest to you that we've seen other changes to the business dynamics in terms of how sticky are your tenants. We've seen some concerns raised recently about tenants being more mobile. And in particular, when we talk about that point, I look at old school versus new school industries. Old school being law, accounting, government; new school being media, tech and things like that. The old school industries have shown more mobility recently because they all want to move into the hip, cool, young new space, but they also want to densify more. The new school industries, I think that the pendulum on densification may have stopped. I'm not saying it's swinging back. It may have stopped. But in the old school industries, their stickiness has declined, as has their average headcount.</p><p>What are some of the industries that are driving it? So look, this is based upon first quarter information of our people that lease the most space. Technology, #1. Creative industries, which is really L.A., is also in the top 5. But once again, folks, if there's one word that comes out of this -- maybe it's 2 words, health care, massive growth driver not only in traditional health care settings, but retail and office. In New York City, health care is taking more and more space as well. And then when you take it -- break it down by market, you can see tech is driving several of your markets. But here we are in L.A., creative industries, #1 driver of your space.</p><p>So where are we, folks? We are in what's known as a Goldilocks economy. Goldilocks meaning it's not too hot, it's not too cold. But there are 3 bears that could take you down. One bear is the macroeconomic bear of hard landing in China, emerging market debt crisis. The second is the domestic bear, which could be something like a monetary error or the trade war, which I suggested is less likely. But the third bear is the scariest of all, and don't let her pretty little red ribbon fool you. That's the Black Swan bear, hard to predict. And as we talked about, this is the history of the future, not sure where that's going to come. But I think the key point is this, when people talk about recession, you have to look at the individual market characteristics. And the markets in which this company is concentrated are among the strongest in the United States, if not the world. And they should be more resilient than the U.S. overall.</p><p>Thank you very much, and I'll take any questions you have. Yes, sir?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Amazon, do you have any view on what their preference is?</p><p>SPENCER G. LEVY: Can I tell a funny story about that? So I did a TV gig about 6 months ago with Maria Bartiromo. I said, \"The one question you can't ask me is where is Amazon going to go because we represent them, and they're a great company. They have lots of great choices.\" What's the first question I get on the air? That question. So look, the funny answer is that as you take a look at our top 50 list -- no, or at least the top 30 of our top 50, every one of those cities was in it, because they're looking at tech talent; they're looking at infrastructure; they're looking at live, work, play. Really talent and infrastructure are the 2 ones. But if you would ask me where I think they're going to go -- and again, this is based upon some polling we've done of our clients, not my personal opinion. They had a lot of good choices, with as many caveats as I can give, a lot of people think it's going to be D.C. And I think a lot of people think it's going to be D.C. because the #1 competitor for Amazon isn't Walmart. It's regulation. And so there, they might have a better shot of doing it, and D.C. also has tremendous tech talent, tremendous infrastructure as well. Next question. Yes, sir?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: On the residential side, what are your views on rent control? They have years of (inaudible) elsewhere as far as (inaudible) encourage development. But obviously the opposite happens when you start implementing rent control or restrict (inaudible).</p><p>SPENCER G. LEVY: Here's the headline, it's the wrong solution to the right problem. It's the right problem -- affordable housing is the right problem we should be talking about. We should find a solution to it. But in addition to the solution that California is putting forth, Portland just put in a requirement that you have a 20% portion of your space assigned to it. Seattle has put $250 a head tax on employees. But the people who did it the worst, and this is not to knock Vancouver, which I think is a terrific market, they put a tax on foreign investors into their market, all right? And that to me is the worst of all solutions. So look, there needs to be a solution to the affordable housing crisis. All of these things are not necessarily designed to make money or to create units. I think they may be designed to create leverage over the development community so we come up with a better answer. So it's an impossible problem. The #1 problem really isn't lack of affordability. It's the lack of ability to build due to NIMBYism. That is really the #1 problem. So if you want to build in a suburban higher wealth location, because of that, it then cascades down to where are you going to build these units. So it will retard growth of building new units. But I will say this firmly, affordable housing is a crisis, we need to solve it. But these are not necessarily the solutions. Yes, sir?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you comment a little bit more on coworking? Is it possible [for it to boost] growth?</p><p>SPENCER G. LEVY: Sure. So coworking right now represents about 2.5% of the New York City market. And it depends upon where you think that percentage of the space tops out. I've heard numbers like 5%. Hard to say because it really all depends upon my first question, which is when the next recession is. Because during the last great boom in coworking in the early 2000s, it had pretty tough impact on the space. So let's assume for the moment that it goes between 2.5% and 5% for purposes of this conversation, I think the key question there isn't its growth, is what does it do to, a, traditional tenant demand? And number two, what does it do to the value of the traditional office building? So I think it's still disproportionately incubator space, but it's increasingly becoming a strategic option for traditional tenants. Now I don't think the traditional lease, the long-term stability of space is ever going away. I think it will only be incremental demand, maybe moving into a new market or basically temporary space. But I do think it could be 2.5% to 5% and I think it could be accretive, a, from a tenant standpoint, if you put them in that space, maybe you move them into your other space. But here's the key question. Let's assume I'm wrong, let's assume the number goes to something much higher than that, and you are a lender, and we have some lenders here in the room today, the person who's going to make the decision on what that right percentage is isn't us. It's the banks. Will they accept a short-term lease, license less credit and give you the same value for your property? So we did an ad hoc study in my company on this. We tried to determine where's the breakpoint in your building where you can have this coworking space and maintain the same value. And we came up with about 20%, 25%, which is a much higher number than I expected. We think that in today's market, that's the number. But in the future market, it might be different. So I'll give you one other example on this. So you probably noticed that WeWork bought the Lord &amp; Taylor building in New York, and they bought similar buildings to that in London. Why did they buy it, right? They bought it because they not only wanted to show their model is great, but I think it's a capital markets decision because I think what they're really going to do is fill it up and try to securitize the debt on the building and get a credit rating that people can't believe, great pricing and move forward because that -- if that happens, that actually helps the marketplace bring more of their space into other buildings. But until that happens, every person in this room is going to be reluctant to have more than that, call it, 20% of the space because they're afraid their banks are going to ding them on their valuation. Time for any more questions? Well, thank you very much, everybody.</p><p>LAURA CAMPBELL: All right. So we're going to take a quick break now for about 10 minutes, so we'll meet back here at about 10:05, and enjoy the food outside.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>LAURA CAMPBELL: I gave you guys an extra 5 minutes. Everyone on the webcast is probably wondering what is going on. So welcome back. We're going to get started again. And next up, we have Drew Gordon, our Senior Vice President of Northern California. Here comes Drew.</p><p>DREW B. GORDON, SVP OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: Thank you, Laura, and good morning. Where's Brendan from Wells Fargo? There he is. If you guys haven't met Brendan, you should. He's one of the rising stars. And this goes under the story of you know you're old when. So standing next to Brendan, watching the band last night, I look over to him and I'm like, \"What do you think?\" He's like, \"Oh, this is really cool.\" I said, \"Do you recognize any of these songs?\" And he looks at me, being very polite, and goes, \"Well, maybe like on Spotify once or...\" And I was like, \"Yes, no, I get that.\" But he goes, \"But I texted my dad, and my dad knew every single song.\" I'm like, God damn. So I go, \"Well, you should FaceTime him right now.\" And Brandon's looking at me like I can't believe this guy knows what FaceTime is. What I should've said is Snapchat, you should Snapchat your dad.</p><p>Anyway, good morning. Again, welcome to Investor Day, or as we call it around here, Hudson finals week. My name is Drew Gordon. I oversee our Northern California portfolio, and I have the distinct pleasure of, once again, reminding you all just how well our markets are doing in Silicon Valley and the Peninsula. But before I get started though, I ask you to enjoy the following short video that depicts examples of the reimagining of our Bay Area portfolio.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>DREW B. GORDON: Okay. Today, I'll be focused on 3 areas of importance with respect to our Bay Area portfolio. First, I'll be discussing the strong real estate fundamentals I see today in the Peninsula and Silicon Valley markets, markets that remain healthy and continue to exhibit signs of expansion. I'll also call out several examples of growing barriers to entry, barriers that bode well for our portfolio of existing properties. Second, I'll be discussing where we see the sweet spot of tenant demand today. That is tenant requirements of 10,000 square feet or less in size. And equally as important is that this demand aligns perfectly with the majority of our current availabilities in our portfolio. And lastly, I'll be highlighting the return of large tenant requirements to the Peninsula and the Valley, and why I believe Campus Center's well positioned to be a direct beneficiary of the surge in demand.</p><p>So let's kick this off and discuss the strong real estate fundamentals that I'm seeing in the Valley and in the Peninsula today. Let me first refresh you on how we define these 2 submarkets. The Peninsula is bordered by South San Francisco to the north, Palo Alto to the south; and the Valley is Mountain View to the north and San Jose to the south. Since the start of this current business cycle in 2011, we've seen strong net absorption of 4.2 million square feet in the Peninsula and a staggering 19.2 million square feet in the Valley. Additionally, we're experiencing very healthy single-digit vacancy rates in both markets that have declined 530 bps and 660 bps, respectively, since 2011. It's worth highlighting that though there has been a slight uptick in vacancy in the Valley, a bulk of this increase is a result of both new supply and additional sublease space, 2 factors that we do not see as material risks to our portfolio, and I'll explain this later in my presentation. Finally, the last 2 quarters in the Valley have been exceptionally strong in terms of net absorption, totaling 1.7 million square feet in Q4 of 2017 and 2 million square feet in Q1 of '18.</p><p>Now you can't speak to the health of the Peninsula or the Valley without addressing the impressive growth of both venture capital and corporate R&amp;D spending, something that Spencer spent some time on in his presentation. Not only has overall VC spending continued to increase domestically with an impressive year-over-year jump to nearly $1.4 trillion in 2017, but the Bay Area saw an even more impressive increase that year of $150 billion, with Bay Area firms being the recipients of approximately 43% of all VC spending, an incredible 3.2x the next closest region. We're also seeing a continued upward trend in R&amp;D spending in the Bay Area approaching $100 billion in 2017. And as many of you know, R&amp;D spending has historically been the engine for growth and innovation for technology firms in the Bay Area, and we see no signs of this weakening.</p><p>There's been some mention of a coming tech wreck in the Bay Area, though I don't think those concerns were raised by anyone in this room. Maybe those who no-showed today. I can tell you though, from where I sit, I simply have not seen any indications of this occurring. Rather, technology and other related industries continued to expand within the Bay Area. Google and Apple's footprint alone stands at 28.1 million square feet, and their planned expansions in San Jose equal an impressive 10.8 million square feet of new growth. Facebook, which is the new story in the Bay Area, who currently has 1.3 million square feet of expansion underway, recently announced plans to hire additional 20,000 employees in the Bay Area around its Menlo Park headquarters, more than doubling their existing headcount. These are truly staggering numbers and cannot be ignored.</p><p>Now here's where it gets a little more interesting and -- at least for me. Many of these same growth companies I just mentioned are now focused on purchasing existing properties to feed their thirst for growth. As evidenced by our sale to Google of Bayhill Office Center in San Bruno 2 years ago, along with many other recent examples. The purchase of these buildings has resulted in the displacement of numerous companies forced into the market to find alternative locations, several of which have landed in our portfolio. Two examples come to mind: First, Experian recently leased space at our Concourse project in San Jose after LinkedIn purchased a building in Sunnyvale. And second, a financial services firm is now in leases at our Techmart project in Santa Clara as a result of Google purchasing another property in Sunnyvale.</p><p>All the focus in our market seems to be around large tenant requirements. And even though these requirements are back in a big way, the real action and the opportunity that we see is with tenant demand below 10,000 square feet, our sweet spot. Roughly 90% of the deals completed in the Peninsula and the Valley are less than 10,000 square feet, 90%. This is a statistic that we focused on early in our ownership of this portfolio, and this focus has served us very, very well.</p><p>Now the good news. Pulling Campus Center out of this equation, more than 85% of all current availabilities that we have are also less than 10,000 square feet with an average suite size of 6,000 square feet. This is no coincidence as we have been systematically rightsizing many of our availabilities through our Vacant Space Prep program, that Art has already alluded to in his presentation. This rightsizing matches up very, very well with the strength of the small tenant demand that we are seeing.</p><p>So how do we feel about our focus on small tenants? Well, we feel really, really good. And why? First, these small tenants provide us with exceptional diversification across all major industries. 66% are non-tech-related companies. Second, with 27% of these companies public and additional 49% that have been in business for over 10 years, we're getting solid-credit companies across the board. And lastly, our Peninsula and Valley portfolio includes a total of 520 tenants, 410 of which are under 10,000 square feet, that's 79%. So we clearly have a small tenant portfolio. These small tenants in aggregate represent only 27% of our total ABR, which is our annualized base rent for this portfolio. However, taken individually, each of these smaller tenants represents no more than 0.1% of our total ABR, providing solid diversification.</p><p>People love to talk about what's happening with sublease space, and so do I. And it's often considered a canary in the coal mine of sorts. 2 years ago, there was growing concerns over the impact of sublease space in San Francisco. As we all know, that concern has now vanished. For sublease space though, we see in the Peninsula and the Valley today, we simply do not view it as competitive to our requirements. Why is that? Because over 80% of the sublease availability in both the Peninsula and the Valley is in blocks greater than 10,000 square feet. In addition, the sublease availabilities have offered little to no TIs to prospective tenants. In this environment of rising construction costs, providing no TIs simply kills deals. And lastly, the average sublease terms available today are relatively short, 4 to 5 years, terms that are not desirable for large tenants who are trying to manage their future growth needs.</p><p>Here's the real takeaway you should take from this. Of all the recent large tenant deals that have occurred in the Valley over the last 9 months, none went to properties offering sublease space, 0.</p><p>Now let's discuss what's happening with the delivery of new supply in the market and the corresponding amount of preleasing occurring at these projects. Both the Peninsula and the Valley have seen a tremendous amount of preleasing for both completed and under construction projects. Of projects under construction in the Peninsula that are being delivered this year, 71% have been preleased, which equates to 643,000 square feet of positive absorption. Though only 13% of completed projects in the Valley have been preleased, just 800,000 square feet of this new supply is truly competitive to us. And of that amount, 50% has already been preleased.</p><p>Lastly, and most important to our leasing efforts at Campus Center, the average asking rents for competitive new projects is $3.55 triple net and rising, nearly a 30% premium to our current asking rents at Campus, providing us a real competitive advantage. Not to mention that this newly repositioned project now boasts many of the same amenities being offered to all these new projects, amenities such as outdoor seating, recreational areas, large contiguous floor plates, everything that today's growing companies expect and demand.</p><p>So the return of large tenant requirements to both the Peninsula and the Valley matches up very well with Campus Center. With a significant asking rent spread advantage over both new and existing competitive properties and unparalleled expansion optionality over the competition, campus is well positioned to perform favorably in the new term, as you've heard. Though larger deals are taking longer to close, and Art mentioned this earlier too, we are currently seeing over 2.8 million square feet of active requirements that fit with our Campus Center availability and additional 800,000 square feet of actual deals in negotiations. This strong activity bodes very well for Campus Center, once again.</p><p>HPP's Peninsula and Silicon Valley assets outperform the market in both -- in terms of both occupancy and rent growth. Look, it's not just the title to my slide, but it's much more than that. It's something that Art and I are and our entire North Cal team are incredibly proud about. From mid-2015 to now, Hudson's asset performance has clearly distinguished itself from its competitors.</p><p>In our Foster City/Redwood Shores portfolio both occupancy and ABR growth are 500 bps higher than the market. In the Palo Alto research park -- sorry. In the Palo Alto research park, our ABR growth is 1,200 bps higher than the market. And finally, the San Jose airport market, we are 1,000 bps higher in occupancy and 1,300 bps higher in ABR growth, impressive numbers for sure, something, like I said, we are so proud about.</p><p>Now significant barriers to entry remain, and in fact, are increasing in the Bay Area as an ever-expanding labor force and strong economic conditions in the Bay Area are spurring many municipalities to try and reign in growth through restrictive land use measures. These efforts will continue to benefit existing landlords, like ourselves, who specialize in the repositioning of our properties, that compete alongside both existing and new assets. A current example of this is that the city of Palo Alto recently enacting a restriction on new office development to the tune of just 50,000 square feet annually and rumors of an attempt by the same city to broaden this restriction to include the Stanford Research Park as well. Now I've highlighted on this slide the 2 municipalities that we have our properties in, namely San Jose and Palo Alto. But all these growing restrictions will have the effect of tightening the overall supply for all markets in the Peninsula and the Valley, which once again, we think we're going to benefit from.</p><p>So in conclusion, all of our markets in the Peninsula and the Valley remain strong and robust with impressive growth of both VC and R&amp;D spending. Large tech company expansion continues for leasing and owning assets. Increasing barriers to entry will continue to enhance the performance of our assets. Our focus on smaller tenant demand, less than 10,000 square feet, will continue to drive our occupancy and rent gains. And the return of large tenant requirements, noncompetitive sublease and significant preleasing activity for new supply in the Valley bodes well, not just for Campus Center but for our entire Northern California portfolio. Thank you very much.</p><p>So as -- one last thing. When Victor led off, and he talked about how important relationships to us -- are to us, it's absolutely true, our relationships with you and with our tenants. And we are very happy to introduce Adony, who we have worked with very closely over many years, who's been running real estate for Uber. And we value that relationship. We've been working with him very, very closely, and I'd like you to welcome up to the stage Adony Beniares with Uber.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Hey.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Hey. How are you?</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Good. You guys can hear us both? Good. Thanks.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: You are more than welcome.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: So before we get into the formalities of it, what was -- I don't recall, what was the first size of the first lease we did with you guys? Do you recall what the size was?</p><p>DREW B. GORDON: It was pre me. Travis had negotiated for the fourth floor of 1455, about 90,000 square feet. And then since then, we've done deals and we're up around 320,000 or 330,000 at 1455.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: And your favorite landlord is...</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: It's [Fred]...</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: So Adony, so talk a little about your roles, both at Uber and LinkedIn first -- LinkedIn. And sort of what your responsibilities have been and where, sort of in a broadly aspect, if you can give us sort of a feel for it.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Absolutely. We own the entire build environment from prebuild to the strategic plan and the budget for real estate and facilities-related costs; managing the transactions across the world; construction and project management; and then daily operations on an ongoing basis. I did that at Uber, and I did that previously at LinkedIn, with the last 4 months of LinkedIn being more of a focus on daily operations as the company stabilized its growth.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: And sort of how did the real estate portfolio transform all over that period of time in those companies?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Sure. From a couple of high tech, high-growth companies, very successful companies, is of LinkedIn, we went from about a dozen sites about, 400 people, to about 6,000 people in about 30 sites. At Uber, we went from 15 sites and about 350 people to about 14,000 people in about 750 different sites.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Over what period of time is that?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Over and about the same period, about 4.5 years.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: That's amazing, isn't it?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Yes.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Well, so talk about the role of real estate in a company like Uber, since it's global, and its ability sort of stay competitive for growth and employees and the likes of that place?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: And I'll break it into 2 parts: one is for employees. And what we do is for there is we put the strategic plan and the budgets together. We bring insights to the business on where we should put office space based on demographics, where we should put office space based on market conditions. Then, what we do is we build and maintain spaces that people like to work at and people want to work at and are successful working at. And then ultimately, the other part is delivering on the business plan, right? It's everything you do in terms of the planning, everything you do in terms of the construction. If you don't do it on time, on budget, and people don't like working there, you kind of missed -- miss the boat.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: And that sort of premise of running your business, do you -- since you're intimately involved from the tech side, does that differ from the size of companies do you think today in the tech world? Or is that same model small, big, they still look at the same thing?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: It's the same around the tech world. Now different skills and different scope. And even at Uber and LinkedIn, when we're small, you think about things a little different, more transaction management. Then when you're big, you manage things on a portfolio basis and an environmental basis.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Perfect. So for a tech company, like Uber, what's the biggest priorities for real estate? Is it location? Is it what you talked about, sort of dealing with the urban amenities that your employees like, talent? I mean, what are you sort of looking at? And sort of give us a feel for sort of an A to Z menu on that.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Yes. The biggest thing -- and I'll keep coming back to this, so it'll sound a little bit like a trope. It really is about acquiring and maintaining your people. It's having a place where people want to come to work, and they don't show up just to work at a certain facility, right? Because it's the excitement of building something new. It's excitement about changing the world. It's excitement about enhancing their careers. But we have a part of it to make sure that it's a place that they want to come in to everyday, and that they can be successful there. And when they want to collaborate with people, they can collaborate. When they want to have heads down time, they can have heads down time. It's the right live, work, play environment for people. And then ultimately, is -- the other things that are important to us is total cost of ownership. And if I have a building that OpEx is lower than a competitive buildings and I'm paying a little bit more on rent, that's okay. If it's the other way, that's okay, too. So I think about cost per square foot. I think about cost per employee. And then the final think is flexibility of space. We've talked about first deal at Uber, you guys made a bet with us, right, at 90,000 square feet. And as a start-up, you don't want to overburden your real estate if growth isn't what you think it will be, and then worrying about, what do I do with all the empty space. But on the other hand, you don't want to keep moving every year to 2 years because you don't have a landlord who's flexible enough to be able to adjust to your growth needs.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Got it. Well, that sort of goes into the next aspect, which is planning. How far ahead to -- I think we'd all like to figure out, with all big tech today, how far ahead are they planning? How far ahead did you plan? I mean, you've 14,000 people. How far ahead did you plan to grow into space and markets like San Francisco and other markets around the world?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Yes, and I can talk about that a little bit in kind of what I call the band I'm in, not like our search engine friends or our iPad friends, who have 20, 25 year plans, right, for what they're doing. For us, what we look at is it's based on the scale and the scope and where our cores are. So for our headquarter spaces is in 2015, we put a 10-plan together with a 5-year execution horizon, saying, hey, look, this is where we're going to want to be in 2025. And this is how we're going to get there, and let's start working toward 2020. As we look at our dozen to 15 hub offices in the world, is we'll tend to focus on a 5- to 7-year plan on there. And then for a smaller office, it's 2- to 3-year plan. And then, every year, as the new business plan comes out, adjust and kind of adjust course a little bit. And at the end of the day, when you look back, you're successful, if you're sort of where you thought you'd be 5 years later.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: So this is something I think everybody wants to know. Like, do you care and do -- if at Uber or even generally, do tech companies care about new, old, renovated construction? I mean, is that -- does that hit the radar? And if it does, tell us a little bit about that.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: It's more about where the space is rather than its new or old, because we'll all go in and remodel the interiors. And employees show up, and we show up and everybody here shows up, and you kind of know the age of your building. But on Market Street right now, we're on -- in buildings that were built between 1906 and 1985. So it's like -- it's about the interiors more than the exteriors as long as you have the basic amenities, right? Efficient floor plates, light coming in are the 2 biggest things from a facilities and employee point of view. Access to transit is high on that list; and the whole live, work, play dynamic that is not just urban these days, but also suburban. That when employees are done working, they're where they want to be for the evening, or that they come up on the weekend.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Got it. All right. So we just heard a little earlier because -- and everybody's seen the paper, WeWork's buying assets. So talk a little bit about that: lease versus buy. You guys were both, obviously, leaned down more to the lease side, but you have ownership interests, too, and obviously, going forward. Give us your thoughts around that.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: And this is for me and the companies I've worked for, right? Again, different based on the scale and leadership's approach to real estate. But for us, it really matters because we don't buy assets to make money on it. We're not investing in assets. We're investing in places where our people want to work. So we look on a deal-by-deal basis, understanding whether it makes a difference to our long-term financials on buy versus lease. Do we have extra capital we can use? Do we make that capital be more effective than sitting in a bank? Is it what our long-term vision is? And then what our long-term growth plans are and the flexibility of space. We look at that for anything -- we used to look at that for every project, but we started looking at that only for spaces of more 50,000 square feet because it still was the sweet spot for us. And we decided to date that, that only made sense for our headquarter locations in San Francisco as well as our headquarter locations in Pittsburgh for our Advance Technology Group.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Got it. All right, so a little bit of a plug for Hudson, but just -- maybe not because I didn't ask you the question yet. But 1455, tell us what drew you to 1455 and continually draws, because you're almost 400,000 feet there, and the space is pretty cool. How did that sort of thought process run through? Because it was, \"by a very, very close competitor peer.\" I shouldn't say peer, but I'll say competitor, but I'm trying to be nice. It was the ugliest building in San Francisco at one point. And we said, we'll take it all day long. So what do you think?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: With the most orange carpet you could imagine. If you think of the most orange carpet you can imagine, you're not orange enough. It was phenomenal, right. Is that -- I can talk a little bit about a conversation I had with Travis, because Travis did the first deal first, and then I came on right after we closed on the fourth floor. It was size of floor plates. It was growth potential. It was honestly, the landlord relationship, right, punching windows in, right.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: We did that. How many windows did we punch in, Drew?</p><p>DREW B. GORDON: 112.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: 112 windows, wow. Okay.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: It's turning dark space into bright space. It was flexibility in lease terms to start with, right? And it's also small tech company with 300 people worldwide, while it's got a nice name in San Francisco in 2013 as Uber, not quite the monster and the great company it's become. Kind of the relationship on, hey, we'll grow with you. And then, when I came onboard, evaluated everything, right? When I come on board, I like looking at portfolios and saying, hey, is this the right place? Is this the right market? Looking at the growth of mid-market and the transformation with Twitter, Square, everybody else in mid-market; just made sense to expand in there. Some of the back-and-forth we've had in terms of interconnecting staircases that we've worked on together, elevator access. Making a building work for new use case isn't the easiest thing in the world to do. And you run into things where you're, like, oh, data connectivity, okay, let's figure that out. Oh, we have a lot more employees coming in and out than the footprint of the data center would be, and just kind of penciling out ideas.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Perfect. All right. So let's just talk a little bit more generally, and you can use to your example of Uber, because you're so tied into the tech world. We've been talking a lot in the last couple of years specifically about the -- obviously, the migration out to San Francisco for big tech, right, expanding into San Francisco. Give us your feel for San Francisco versus Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley versus San Francisco; survivability of both, none, 0. Just sort of general thoughts around that, and we can drill down a little bit if you want to.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Yes, I don't think about it as migration, but expansion. Where it was 15 years ago, right, there was 1 or 2 companies, who were based in San Francisco. San Francisco was, in my world, known as the startup and the incubator. And then when you got big, you moved down to Silicon Valley, is -- that's changed now, and instead of, oh, you're thinking about Silicon Valley, you think about San Francisco, you're thinking about the Bay Area. You look at where the people are living with the East Bay, with San Francisco. You saw the slides earlier in terms of demographics, is most tech companies -- or I should say, all of the big tech companies are both in the South Bay in San Francisco, expansion in the East Bay is happening. So it really is about access to talent. And the balance between making people's commute good compared to having people in the same office to work together, right? So it's this tricky balance between work-life balance, but when we want to meet, is as great as video conferencing is, it works out better if you can get in a room with a whiteboard. Figuring out flexible work schedules and figuring out the key for us for being able to expand in multiple locations, is the benefit that technology brings us, right? Is it being able to work almost anywhere in any style I want to work on, whether it's my laptop or whether it's a video conference meeting or whether it's my cellphone.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: And are people going back and forth, employees?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: People start off by going back and forth, and they quickly learn that it is easier just to jump on a call for the most part. We learned that on Market Street, is our strategy was expand as much as we can at 1455 but there's other centers as well.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Thank you.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Right. Yes. Is that -- and we picked a strategy of expanding on Market Street, where we could use the subway and get from door-to-door in 20 minutes, right, from any of our 3 buildings back-and-forth. And what we saw for the first 6 months is were -- people were spending their days kind of going back and forth between buildings, meeting to meeting, meeting. Then we saw them interestingly start scheduling multiple meetings in the same building and a spending a day. And now we see people staying in their buildings and getting together less frequently in person, but using technology bridge.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: So Bay Area, your general feelings. Obviously, it's the centric tech hub of the world, right? Your feelings about the Bay Area and the future of the Bay Area versus other markets that people are responding and talking about, like Austin or like Boston or other cases, even outside of the United States. What's your thoughts around that, Seattle, et cetera?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: I think as we talked about migration before. Again, I don't think it's migration but expansion, is -- both you and Spencer mentioned a couple of things. You talked about yesterday that if you're going to be in content, you're going to be in L.A., right? And there's great content providers across the world, but if you're not in L.A., you're kind of not paying attention. It's the same thing for tech, is if you're doing high tech and you're not in San Francisco Bay Area, you're kind of not paying attention to what the market is. Is -- it is additive to have engineers in Amsterdam. It's additive to have engineers in New York. It's additive to have engineers in Bangalore, but this really is -- or the Bay Area really is the tech center, and we and everybody else are going continue to grow there, and it's about access to talent and keeping people in your company. You saw Spencer's chart, right? The top 10 worker -- top tech workers around the world, based in San Francisco. That's not going to change for the foreseeable future.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: So I mean, for years, I've been defensive about this different tech cycle. This is not tech wreck, clearly talking our own book, because that's what I get paid to do and support the [real estate]. From the flip side, somebody who's a user, somebody who's a part of one of the largest companies in the Bay Area and in tech, growing also around the world, what's your thought about this whole negative trend of tech wreck? It's coming. We're all going to get wiped out with it in the next recession, et cetera. Just give us your thoughts on that as a Bay Area guy, too.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Pick the reason for your next recession, and as Spencer said, right, predicting the future is hard. And when we look at the 2001 setback, we look at 2008 setback, not a lot of, oh, yes, this is going to happen on this day. Is that tech is certainly not what it was in the dot-com days that I went through, right? Is that it is stable, financial, well-funded public companies that are actually delivering projects, delivering products and making money in terms of that. Where we see setbacks is you'll always see setbacks in any economy in any country around the world. But there's underlying strength, and technology is one of the major drivers of the future, right? Is that -- Spencer talked about health care. Is biggest driver around health care is how technology can enhance health care, right? It's not a trend that's going away. It's not, oh, I can get my coffee cheaper, right, if I can get my coffee delivered to me, although that's kind of a nice thing, right? It's really about the fundamentals of business, and I'll put a plug in for the rideshare guys, right, it's getting around with Uber, getting around with Lyft, getting around with JUMP bikes. It's changing our lives for the better. It's changing the world's lives for the better. That's not disappearing.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Got it. All right. So I got a couple just drill downs, and then we'll open it up for some questions. First of all, Travis is living in L.A. now. I don't know if you knew that. He started a real estate company. He's direct competitor. I think he bought like a 28,000 square-foot office building right in Culver City. So I know Art's a little nervous that he's going to compete with him, but it's okay. So offshoots of Uber for us -- for as an example. So we have here in L.A., and it's become very popular in San Francisco, is Bird, right? Which is the minimal version of Uber and the likes of that, but you can do it yourself. Where do you see something like the Birds going to on the next level? Is there something that you guys have kicked around internally and said, okay, we're going to see Uber expanding to Uber Air or Uber something else. And just give us a little flavor of sort of the progression of the business on that basis.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Well -- and I'm going to talk as Adony, a facility guy, as opposed to any spokesman for Uber or whatever.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Understood.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: So it's kind of like a high-tech junkie, right? Is it's interesting on what kind of used to be called the gig economy, but the delivery-only restaurants I find fascinating on -- pick your Uber, EatStreet or other delivery thing on. And there's restaurants that I get food delivered from that I can't actually go to. I'd say it's what I tend to call kind of the invisible service providers, like the bikes, like the...</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Scooters.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Lines, scooters, bikes, all those where I just go to do something, and there's is no one there to help me. There's -- which I think is a direct offshoot from what we started seeing in terms of service providers, like the travel companies. Where you used to call a travel agent, you used to book travel, you used to call the airlines. And now it's this cool invisible helper that just makes your life mostly easier. It's just an offshoot of that, and you talked about earlier rent versus buy. Is that rehabilitation of old assets is fascinating future, whether it's for restaurants, whether it's for self-driving car recharging, whether it's for converting things to housing, whether it's helping low income, it's kind of redistribution of assets, the stuff you guys are doing. That is a great future on reuse as opposed to replace.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: And obviously, the concern about employment, right? You're taking that sort of that risk expense factor and not necessarily negating it, but deminimizing it a little bit and giving it a little bit of safety.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Absolutely.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Right. Of course. All right. The craziest thing you guys ever thought that you didn't execute on for your space, something in your space, I mean, that user of said, oh, somebody came in and say, we need a swimming pool in the middle of the lobby, something -- is there anything like that that's coming your way, you're like -- you just like laugh at each other at the end of the day, that was the stupidest idea or the craziest idea?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Absolutely, and it was -- yes, it's kind of jobs ago, neither LinkedIn or Uber. And we had a great idea on kind of flex space for a year and just don't do anything with it. And people would be okay with it for a year, just squeeze them in into old data center space, into old warehousing space. It'll be a great thing. That was...</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Disastrous.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Disastrous, right. Is as people -- if you have, like all of us, if you have a light at the end of the tunnel, it's a great thing, and you'll say, \"Hey, we'll squeeze in for 6 months because we've got new office going.\" We're working on our Mission Bay campus to kind of expand, so we're trying to squeeze in at Uber, so we don't have to take significant amount of more space before we kind of expand into Mission Bay. But you have to make sure that light at the end of the tunnel is explainable and visible to your entire organization, and not this mythical light or it's this light that you say, hey, 4 years from now, it's going to be great. Because 2.5 years from now, 30% of the people aren't going to be working there.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Got it. How about some questions. Anybody, got any questions they like? Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You'd mentioned the Mission Bay campus. How does your space at 1455 and 1515 fit into that? And then eventual growth over time, where Uber wants to go get it?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Great question, and we're modeling that. As I talked about, we had our 10-year plan with kind of 5-year execution. So we're currently working on what that second 5 years is and whether Mission Bay, that is 7,000 assigned people, how that fits into our bigger portfolio. Do we need 12,000 seats in San Francisco or some 15,000 seats in -- I shouldn't say San Francisco, 12,000 seats in the Bay Area, 15,000 seats in the Bay Area. And we're just going to keep working on that. We've got great leases for all of our properties going into the mid-2020s, so kind of adjust. It'll be -- Mission Bay will certainly be our headquarters, but not our only office space in the Bay Area.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can help us think about the way that, whether it be in LinkedIn or in Uber, when they expand and they like say we're going to hire 5,000 people or 10,000 people. We need that force. How much of that is assigned specific use or a function? And then that function is already out in the space, versus we're going to hire all these people, and then we'll move them as we need to.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: It is -- and I tend to be on the more conservative side of facility guys, is I tend to keep the portfolio at kind of 85% to 95% occupied with space coming on about 2 quarters before I need it. Causes a few problems, as we talked about there, with the light at the end of the tunnel. So it's when we see headcount growth, we take that as people coming in, not necessarily 2,000 front-end designers and 1,000 engineers. So we tend to design space to be flexible for whatever group, and we colloquially talk about it 70%, 30%, where, regardless of who you are, you'll use space about the same, 70% of the time, and 30% if it is unique to your group. So recruiters need more phone booths to make phone calls in, is that finance guys need more space for transaction-based work. Engineers need more one-to-one desking than phone sales guys do. So we stay ahead of the growth by about 6 months, and then have the space about 70% standard, and then adjust for each team as they grow into it. That answer your question? Thank you.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Years ago, when LinkedIn tried to expand their headquarters, they did it in Silicon Valley. Uber has done it in Mission Bay. Can you contrast the 2 different strategies on (inaudible)</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Off the top off I'll say, not just for those companies, but for most companies, it tends to be where you first start up your headquarters is -- I'm trying to think if there's besides Adobe who did their big shift from San Francisco to San Jose. I'm not sure there's been another big tech company that, once they got to a few hundred people, didn't stay centered where they were. And I know from my LinkedIn days, was we evaluated San Francisco. We -- or should say we evaluated the entire Bay Area and said, yes, staying close to the center of where our growth started and where majority of our employees live is the right answer. When we're working with Travis on what we do for our headquarters for Uber, it was the same process we went through. We looked at every potential headquarters space in the Bay Area, heavily north of the San Mateo bridge in terms of that, and then came to the realization, both objectively and subjectively, that kind of staying near where you were born is a good thing.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Anybody else? I see over there. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: There was a lot of talk today about -- and some analysis [today, more focus around apartment]. So I guess, for guys like you guys who very, very well have [accounting to negotiate things], how important is the [CapEx perspective to you]?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: It's total cost of ownership for me. Because the nice thing is, when you're a funded company, whether you're public company or private company, when you're well funded, you can look at it from a total cost of ownership, in that I look at it and I say, hey, if you're giving to me $100 TI but my rent's a little higher. You give me $50 TI, rent's a little low. If I've access to capital, it doesn't impact me that much as long as my cost per square foot and cost per employee stays low. When I'm starting off, and we're 300 people, and we're trying to grow to 1,000 people, is getting CapEx to help pay for your rent. Getting free rent even though you're gapping it, getting free rents, very important right. Because I can always spend start-up money somewhere better than my space, even though, I need space and I need space for people to be effective is I'd rather have money go toward driver incentives. I'd rather have money go toward more technology and more engineers than spending today's cash. I'd rather spend tomorrow's cash.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible)</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Yes, as the company matures, right, is now I look at it and can I go, hey, my TI -- I can pay for my own CapEx if it helps me get a better overall cost of cost per square foot. But we always come back to cost per square foot and cost per seat and cost per active employee. Those are the 3 big drivers in the world of facilities and real estate, is how do I burden the P&amp;L and the business plan with the cost of doing business?</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So you mentioned a lot of the workforce is starting to live in East Bay. And you guys have a kind of changing strategy with respect to Oakland. Can you just talk about sort of pros and cons of the area? And how you guys think about Oakland?</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Yes, we still think -- or I should say myself, not the Uber guy, right? But for myself, East Bay is still a growing opportunity in there. We, as Uber, looked on -- as I said, our business plans have changed what our growth is, what our efficiency per employee is. So we looked at it and decided that at this time, Oakland wasn't the right play for us, and instead, we'll focus in on Mission Bay. But still personally high on the East Bay with commutability for people and being able to tap the immense talent of workers that are living in the East Bay. So still high on it, but we feel comfortable with the 1 million square feet we have in Mission Bay and the 800,000 square feet we have in Market Street and the 150,000 square feet in Palo Alto. That's a better fit for us now.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Great. Anybody else? No, we're good. All right, perfect timing. Look. Look how cool we are.</p><p>ADONY BENIARES: Exactly.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Thanks, Adony. Really very appreciate it, and the relationship, most importantly.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>LAURA CAMPBELL: Thank you, Victor and Adony. That was great. We're now going to switch and talk a lot about tech. So now we're going switch to the entertainment side of our business, studio side of the business. And there's no better person to talk about that than our SVP of Sunset Studios, Bill Humphrey.</p><p>WILLIAM A. HUMPHREY, SVP OF SUNSET STUDIOS, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: Thanks, Laura. Okay. So first of all, we're going to run a little video here to give you sort of a visual perspective for sort of an aerial view of the studios we manage. And I think if you really look at it carefully, you sort of see that integration point between our real estate side of the business and our media entertainment side. And you see how they really integrate well. So let's roll the video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>WILLIAM A. HUMPHREY: Okay. So we're going to talk today about studio of the future, what's next for Sunset Studios. Let me start that 2 years ago, I talked to you about the increasing demand for studio space, Class A office space, production office space and I'll tell you again, it's even -- the demand is even greater now.</p><p>The level of demand for our stages -- it's the best time to be in the business. I've been around the block a couple of times. Even though I'm a millennial that's grayed early, I still have a great perspective on it. But I want you to really get focused on this because you've got to view me as the lead in here for -- I'm sorry, the small lead in band like [payment pal] waiting for the main act Mark to come on board here, who's sort of like Radiohead, he'll be coming out. So I just -- I'm going to get you guys revved up here a bit, okay?</p><p>So I'm going to make 3 -- so the only thing I want to say is that the entertainment space is super exciting today. I was just reading over somebody's shoulder, that Comcast is now going to try to make a bid for Fox, trying to outbid Disney by trying to buy Sky, so there's a lot of different movements going on in the industry as the content guys, the technology guys, all try to merge together to create global scale.</p><p>Even Barack Obama and his wife just announced yesterday that they're going to into the TV business and they've just cut a deal with Netflix to shoot a bunch of television shows.</p><p>I'm going to make 3 key points: one, demand is continuing to increase in Los Angeles. With Los Angeles benefiting the most from this. And the same time, the supply side isn't going to grow for stages or for production services; secondly, Hudson Pacific, our combination of real estate expertise and our combination of media expertise gives a scale, technology, and to basically make this market really grow, take advantage of all this demand; and third, as Vic talked about in his presentation, we're going to keep an eye on opportunities outside of our Sunset Studio Los Angeles Hollywood portfolio.</p><p>Right now, Los Angeles continues to be the epicenter for -- oh, I use that word, sorry, epicenter, sorry -- continues to be a place where entertainment media is happening. There's 5 million square feet of production space, there's over 300 certified stages and we're right in the middle of it. So our primary services consist of 3 areas in terms of how we drive our revenue: one, is stage and production office rentals. So you have to basically rent stages and there's areas around it. You need green rooms, you need places for wardrobes, you need storage areas, and also, we have our office space. Office spaces are required if anytime you have a show. It's somewhere between 15,000, 20,000 square feet of office space required, to house producers and directors and all the people that make TV. And we also house people that don't do TV shows in our lots, so for example, Starz, Fox, Empire show, they love being on our lots, but they don't shoot on lots, they shoot on locations. So as you can see in the picture at the bottom here, we could see that we have 35 stages what makes us -- we are the largest independent operator stages in the United States. That gives us a lot of clout.</p><p>And our client base is really diverse. Well, first of all we deal with a lot of traditional media companies, so ABC and CBS are very large clients of ours. We have a lot of clients in the branded area, HBO, Comedy Central, MTV, VH1, and then on the streaming side, we're really -- we've grown tremendously in this area, that's why the demand is up. We have a very long 10-year deal with Netflix in place. We are doing work with Hulu right now, with Sarah Silverman, and we also do work with Amazon.</p><p>So take a look at this slide. This is an incredible piece of information here. There's over $60 billion of media production going on and most of it's happening in Los Angeles. A lot of it is happening in Los Angeles. It's a 40% increase from 2015. In the blue, you can sort of see all the different traditional media companies and trying to figure out how to grow here, but the most interesting part of it is the orange bars, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Apple, and what's really interesting about it, Hulu and Apple haven't even ramped up yet. They're just starting to ramp up. Amazon just -- basically just procured one of the top executives from NBC. Yesterday it was in the L.A. Times. So they're getting ramped up for TV. Apple is just entering the market and they have a ton of money and they were able -- they bought the talent, they basically stole the talent from Sony Pictures, so you're going to see more and more demand for programming -- and this demand, if i can explain to you, is going to also create tremendous demand for office space in Los Angeles.</p><p>Digital consumer spending dramatically increased while traditional spend remains constant. As you can see in this chart on the left. Netflix just announced, for example their quarterly earnings of which they have a 7 million increase in subscribers in one quarter. It's astounding. The MPAA 2017 Theme Report just stated, digital entertainment spending increased 20% domestically and 41% internationally, global streaming subscriptions up 33%.</p><p>So 2 years ago, I stated that traditional studios would be disrupted by this tech media conversion and it's absolutely happening right now and it's actually happening right before our eyes and it's also growing tremendously. The tech media conversed to be best summed up by recent quote from Bob Iger, Chairman of Disney, \"While media firms still debate whether content or distribution is king, technology completed altered the behavior, expectations and the power of consumers, making them the ultimate authority as to who will bend the knee\".</p><p>So the historic studios, as you can see here on the right, are scrambling. There are certain people that have digital expertise, global brand recognition and software expertise, and then there's other guys that have content. So they're trying to put the two together. AT&amp;T's purchase -- potential purchase of Time Warner is a great example of a gigantic content company that has all the Turner broadcasting, TNT, CNN, all these pieces and HBO with a -- just a nationally recognized and a globally recognized brand.</p><p>Disney, FOX, there's really bit of a Trojan Horse here because this acquisition gives Disney a majority hold of Hulu. And as you may have not known but Disney has tried 2 times to build their own software platforms and have failed because they're not a software company.</p><p>So again, what I'm saying is, Los Angeles is a place where these technology companies, including an Amazon out of Seattle, an Apple out of Silicon Valley come down to L.A. and grab that talent, Spencer talked about it, all that talent on the creative side is here. So we're going to see that kind of explosion. The point is that L.A. drives creative product supported by an expanding software infrastructure that continue to grow.</p><p>Okay. This slide -- this -- we're going to talk about Los Angeles for a minute. Why is Los Angeles the center of all this activity? 51% of all scripted television shows are produced in Los Angeles. Basically outnumbering all of the other -- all these other outlying markets. Why? Producers, directors, editors, cinematographers, agents, PR people, they all live in Los Angeles. They all want to stay here. They don't really want to go out of state. And that's what really drives this gigantic economy here around us.</p><p>So increase in content production continues to drive demand for studio and creative office space, 1.5 million square feet of additional spaces come on the market since I was up here 2 years ago talking to you. As Victor pointed out, most of our developments are occurring in Los Angeles. This is one of the reasons why, and Jeff Pio talked about this yesterday, is that these companies are starting to grow and you see these -- you see them in these big office buildings, say, wow, how can they keep growing? But if you look at a studio lot, like a Fox or a Sony, they're just -- what's happening, these companies are very efficient around how they manage their vertical infrastructure. And I think the Hudson Pacific were very well positioned to basically help them build this vertical creative infrastructure and then integrate it into, sort of, I call it the horizontal production factory.</p><p>So let me talk about this supply side for a minute; not changing. Land value is just too high in Los Angeles to build these gigantic stages that have -- that take up a lot of room. There's a shortage of residential housing here, there's a great demand for commercial real estate, for office use, so that's where the money is going to go. It's -- people are not going to go out and start building stages here.</p><p>As you also see on the right, so what's happening is, that L.A. as part of our [HQs] is already booked. Our Sunset Bronson is 100% booked right now, 100% occupied. And our other ones are in the 90s. So back in the business -- back -- not that long ago, everything was in about the 70%, 75% range for occupancy. Now it's in the 90s, in fact, right now it's about 90 -- all the stages in L.A., I mentioned 300 stages, were at like 96% occupancy. It's a staggering number. And on top of that, what's happening is those companies like Netflix and like Amazon, that don't really want to own the means of production, they don't want to own these big 45-acre lots, their focus is on brand identification on a global basis. Their focus is on making great content. Their focus is on distribution, making it really efficient.</p><p>So they don't need all this ownership, that's why we can partner with companies like this. And what they're doing is because they don't own studios, they're basically warehousing stages. So Netflix, for example, they're making deals with us, they're making deals in Atlanta, they're making deals in Malaysia, to basically lock down stages. And what's happening, all the other players are backing up and saying, what's going on here? I need stages too, because nobody is building new stages in Los Angeles.</p><p>So we're seeing this sort of dilemma and this push and pull and really competitive nature happening in the industry for companies that do not own large production facilities. And I will include ABC in that because they're owned by Disney and Disney' lot, which is originally an animation lot is quite small. Sunset Studio is poised to capture this increased demand and create significant value.</p><p>So I'm going to talk about 3 key factors in terms of the studio of the future: one, is the business model itself. The traditional model was -- anybody who's old enough in the room, you watch traditional TV, it was all time sequenced, then they had ratings, there's Nielsen -- these Nielsen ratings. And then you went to the upfronts, which just happened in New York, and you basically get your CPMs and you figure out your advertising dollars.</p><p>The streaming companies don't do that. They don't have those metrics like -- they have -- they don't use Nielsen, they have tons of private data that they have, they know exactly what their shows are doing the minute they're aired because of streaming. They don't shoot on the network schedule. They shoot all the time. Why? Because they have to keep producing new content. If you're going to spend -- even at HBO you can $16.99 for HBO on your cable box. If you're going to spend $11.99 for Netflix, if you're going to spend $39.99 for Hulu, you better make sure that you've got a product out there that people want. And you need to create products that'll have a global appeal. So you see these large dramas, which are done on stages and they're not our stages. Very high production values, very high costs. That's really good for us because we take those dollars in. American comedy, for example, does not translate well in most foreign countries. So that's why this big dramas, Game of Thrones, Westworld, all these kind of programming are really proliferating and they eat up a lot of space to make these shows. Because these shows, at the end, are really movies, they're just really long movies.</p><p>Second point, technology is really, really important here. We are -- just announced, we haven't formally announced it, but we are doing the first 4K show. You know what 4K is? It's 4x the resolution of high-definition television. And Netflix is doing a show called The Fix with us, and it's going to start shooting in 2 weeks in 4K.</p><p>Why 4K? Because compression algorithms, it's not about the TV sets, it's about -- Spencer talked about demographics, I didn't think of that. Demographics. Young people do not watch TV. They watch stuff on laptops, whenever they want to watch it and they basically binge watch programming, all right? So my daughter's there, she's watching some show. She's 23 years old. She's watching -- couple of years ago she's watching the show on her bed on the TV like, \"Dad, there's a show you got to see it. It's called Friends. It's unbelievable.\" So that's -- it's all about the compression that was around watching TV on a small screen. That's what 4K is going to take up with.</p><p>And the third point is, that we're really well positioned because we have premier Class A office space. We have -- and we can basically connect people to our office space and to our production environment, that's exactly what Netflix wanted from us.</p><p>So to give you a brief history, nobody is better positioned than we are right now but nobody wanted to hear it from us, right? So 2008, I'll just quote, \"Others have speculated that outside studio lots and densifying your location will eventually go the way of used car lots.\" I'll go on to quote, \"And Gilmore Field, just south of Hollywood where midget auto races circle the oval track back in 1930s.\" That was a block in 2008 when Victor bought Tribune Studios, which is now Sunset Bronson Studios probably 10 years ago. And here's a quote from Victor here or some -- \"We see a prime opportunity in creating a production network platform, comprised of state-of-the-art facilities.\" He didn't say that 2 weeks ago, he said that 10 years ago. So I think that we got it right.</p><p>We have taken advantage of our location and our ability to expand the studio lots. ICON, CUE, Carlo, all part of our vision that Victor had 10 years ago.</p><p>I'm going to tread quickly to the 3 studio lots we own. First, Sunset Bronson Studios, our fiscal plant, we've just built a 418,000 square feet of Class A office space, fully occupied by Netflix. At the same time, we're upgrading our facades' signage. Because when you build new space like that, all the -- everything else starts looking really old. So we have a whole program going on to improve that.</p><p>On our cash flow improvement, we've leased the entirety of those buildings. As I said, we have long-term lease with Netflix, KTLA, which is owned by Tribune to be sold shortly to Sinclair, and CBS, which means at the end of the day, since our IPO, our studio NOIs up a 100%. And our estimated value creation on profit cycle, obviously, is $152 million. Not bad, right?</p><p>Sunset Gower Studios. We developed back in 2008 the headquarter for Technicolor, their North American headquarters. We completed a parking garage extension, and the big thing is, right now as you can see in this picture, we are -- we've already submitted to the city, a plan to build 423,000 square feet space. Chris Barton, I know you're here, you're going to be a very busy person for a long time, just to let you know.</p><p>But what's exciting about this is, look at this diagram. Here we are with these 4, 5 story creative office buildings for productions. We have this tower going up, which would be for a creative office building, maybe Apple will take it, I don't know. And then -- but it's all integrated into the lot with trucks and people and stuff going on and you know what? Creative people love this. They love to walk outside to see the industry work, and that's why Ted Sarandos is headquartered in our building at ICON, because you can walk outside and go talk to the talent and just meet people, they love that interaction. It's really fantastic. Since the IPO on this lot, we're up 136%. Not bad either.</p><p>Okay, we bought Las Palmas Studios, Hollywood center for a private transaction back in May 2017. We've fully integrated it into our portfolio in terms of our organization, our operations, our financials very quickly, basically using our scale and our model. We're now upgrading all of our technology platforms in IT there, which was pretty -- really needed some work.</p><p>So on an NOI basis, we're up -- 11 months in, we're up 57%. Why? Because we've been really, really efficient around managing our expenses. We've signed a 5-year deal with Disney Channel, which again, as I talked early, that really needed stages and really wanted to lock some down. We've done our first big drama deal. We have Shonda Rhimes' new show called Station 19. It's the highly anticipated spinoff show from Grey's Anatomy, and all of our office space is full. And right now, we're in the process to just ground up a building, Harlow, which is this building over here in the picture. It's a beautifully designed 5-story creative office building or it can be a production office building.</p><p>So we're really excited about owning this property, and we feel so far that this formula we've created would prove it's being successful.</p><p>Victor talked a bit about these 3 markets and again, we're mindful of these markets because as L.A. basically gets boxed in, there's no place else to go, we need to understand what all the other players are doing in the marketplace. And a lot of these players as Victor said, aren't in -- they're not big prime investment companies, they're entrepreneurs or real estate people. So in a way, got to keep an eye on them, see what they're doing.</p><p>Atlanta is important, they have 150 stages there. All the feature film businesses moved there. So it's funny, if you look at old photographs of the lots that we have in our buildings, you'll see these studios that we own, surrounded by farmland from the 1920s. You go to Atlanta -- I went down to Atlanta and go, \"Oh, [look around], I've got these giant studio buildings, surrounded by farmland.\" It's the same concept all over again with Atlanta.</p><p>New York has always been a very strong place for where talent lives and there's a lot of creativity there, so those stages will continue to thrive. And Vancouver is the #3 market in North America. So these 3 markets are interesting for us to take a look at and to see if there's any kind of -- taking our model and we can use there.</p><p>So I'm now going to sort of sum this up and do my little classwork here for you. So back in 2016, I said media companies will continue to spend significantly on programming. 12 companies are now spending over $1 billion and $61 billion spent, not bad, I think I was right on that one. Two, streaming companies are going to create additional demand for Class A office. 1.5 million of additional incremental space in the marketplace in the last 2 years alone, with record high occupancy on the stages of 96%. Los Angeles remains the preferred content production market but supplementary markets will emerge.</p><p>L.A. continues to be the large market. 51% of scripted shows I showed you on that slide. With Atlanta, Vancouver remaining steady secondary markets. Supply is fixed in Los Angeles. The net increase in stages is 0 right now. Yes, Universal's announced they're going to build some stages, but they're tearing some stages down. Yes, Culver Studios is going to tear some stages down to make room for their office building, they're doing for Amazon, but they're also at the same time going to build some new stages but it's going to be net -- a net number.</p><p>So I'm going to go on a limb here, for 2020 when you all come back and talk about what's going to happen next. Spend will increase, at least for the next 2 years, because Apple and Amazon haven't ramped up yet. Disney, Hulu, if that transition -- transaction happens, there'll be more ramp up there. And I haven't talked about Verizon. Another company that as you might have read in The Wall Street Journal, were sort of behind the scenes with Les Moonves as trying to buy CBS and then got sort of -- that's when this whole problem happened there. So that's what my prediction is, that continued growth -- and that continued growth then means continued growth on the office side as well for Class A office space. Class A office space is going to continue to grow as these streaming companies grow, as I showed you in that bar chart.</p><p>Los Angeles will continue to drive production with modest growth in Atlanta, and New York and Vancouver will maintain their current market shares. And then lastly, minimum or no net increase in Los Angeles supply.</p><p>So in conclusion, I think that we're going to be -- it's going to be a real wild ride right here. It's going to be -- I'm really, really excited about this market. So everybody just hold on to your horses and we'll see what happens, okay? Thank you for your time. Really appreciate it.</p><p>LAURA CAMPBELL: All right, and now what you've all been waiting for. We're going to have Mark Lammas, our COO and CFO. And just a quick note, after he finishes, we're going to take a quick minute, reorganize the stage, so that we can bring everybody back up and then we'll do our Q&amp;A. So without further ado, Mark?</p><p>MARK T. LAMMAS, COO, CFO &amp; TREASURER, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: Thank you, Laura. [I think] a little bit of a sucker. I suppose I should start with an apology for not having a glossy video that kick-start my presentation. I suggested to Laura that we do a montage of photographs of my 1985 South Padre Island spring break adventure, but she just could not see the relevance. So I'll just dive right in.</p><p>This morning I'm going to walk you through 3 aspects of our company we believe should put Hudson Pacific on top of your stock pick list for 2018 and beyond. There are very favorable and continually improving credit metrics, our strong and potential NOI growth through 2019 the bulk of which is contractual, and our significant discount to NAV despite our proven track record of delivering outside the FIFO growth.</p><p>We've provided all the detail you'll need around our assumptions in these slides, but in addition, much of the underlying information could be found in our supplemental reports. So let's get started.</p><p>The purchase of our Peninsula and Silicon Valley assets in April of 2015 doubled the size of our company and therefore, provides an important milestone in terms of understanding how our credit metrics have trended.</p><p>Starting with year-end 2014, total debt as a percent of market cap has never exceeded mid-30%, even with indebtedness associated with the major acquisition. Our leverage has continued to trend lower since then and now is approaching 2014 preacquisition levels. Our secured indebtedness has also trended lower. Today, only 16% of our indebtedness is secured down from over 70% at year-end 2014.</p><p>We now have a large diversified unencumbered pool of properties, which enabled us to complete a $400 million inaugural bond offering last October as well as the recent recap of our revolving and term loan facilities. We similarly, dramatically decreased the percent of our floating rate indebtedness. Today, it's at an all-time low of 4%, down from 46% at the end of 2014. We've chosen to very proactively address the growing uncertainty around interest rates while simultaneously extending our debt maturities.</p><p>And finally, you can see our adjusted EBITDA at a fixed charge multiple is trending higher, even in the face of recent asset sales. We've successfully matched underlying EBITDA trends and with meaningful debt reduction.</p><p>This next slide demonstrates the fruits of our labors. Today our credit metrics stack up well against both our California office peers as well as other highly regarded investment grade CBD office REITs. Our metrics are stronger on nearly every measurement and I think our track record is clear. We've successfully grown our company around a commitment to a fundamentally sound and sustainable capital strategy.</p><p>Now let's turn to what you've no doubt been waiting for, our bridge to success 2.0, so to speak. Yes, we brought it back and it's even stronger this time around on one very important front, our contractual NOI growth. We'll talk about each component of our growth. As you all know, I like to get into details, but this first slide cuts to the chase, capturing all components of projected NOI growth through 2019 and ultimately, beyond. Big picture, we're projecting NOI growth beginning from Q1 2018 annualized through 2019 of 18% or 10% compounded annual growth rate with nearly 70% of that contractual. Two years ago, if you recall, contractual sources of NOI accounted for about 54% of projected growth. Meaning nearly half of the NOI projection was based on speculative sources. Today, 1/3 of the NOI projection is speculative, which of course significantly improves the predictability of our NOI growth.</p><p>This next slide, we provided a breakout of $61 million of embedded NOI growth from a combination of 3 contractual sources. The burn off of upfront rent abatements, signed uncommenced and backfill leases and contractual rent bumps under existing leases. Approximately, $27 million, or nearly half of the embedded NOI growth, stems from the burn off of nonrecurring upfront rent abatements detailed in the supplemental. Incremental tenant recoveries and parking and other revenue of 20% and 5%, respectively, of base rents are included in this component of NOI, though, tenant recoveries have been reduced by 1/3 to account for base year resets on gross leases.</p><p>Another approximately $16 million of embedded NOI growth results from executed uncommenced and backfilled leases over the next 7 quarters, also, as identified in our supplemental. Rents from uncommenced leases are grossed up for tenant recoveries and parking and other revenue subject to an NOI margin of 70% and a 1/3 reduction on tenant recoveries. Only the mark-to-market impact on the backfill leases is included together with a 5% increase for parking and other revenue, then, reduced by 1/3 of the tenant recoveries associated with the expiring leases being backfilled. The remaining almost $18 million of NOI growth stems from the 3% average contractual rent increases on our existing leases adjusted for scheduled explorations. Last Investor Day, contractual sources of NOI growth accounted for less than 12% growth over first quarter 2016 annualized NOI. By comparison, the current projection includes embedded sources of NOI growth accounting for more than 15% growth over our Q1 2018 annualized NOI. I think you can all agree that, that's a strong improvement over last bridge.</p><p>This next slide summarizes the $30 million of speculative NOI growth from 3 sources: Mark-to-market spreads on expiring leases, lease-up of existing vacancy at our in-service office and redevelopment properties and incremental NOI associated with our studios. I'll begin with $3 million of NOI growth from our studios. This is projected incremental NOI, assuming we achieve 6% annual NOI growth over our trailing 12-month NOI for our same-store studio assets and annualized trailing 6-month NOI for our Sunset Las Palmas Studios as of the end of Q1 2018. We are projecting another $6 million of NOI growth before downtime from the mark-to-market on the releasing of expiring leases not yet backfilled. We've assumed 18% rent spreads, and rents are grossed up for parking and other revenue subject to the same reduction on tenant recoveries associated with expiring leases. As with the backfill leases, no NOI margin is imposed since only the mark-to-market impact of expiring leases is included. So there would be no corresponding increase to expenses associated with this revenue. Obviously, not all the explorations during this period will be renewed. We budgeted for leases that don't get renewed. Based on a 60% renewal probability and 7 months of downtime, this represents an approximately $20 million NOI growth offset.</p><p>That takes us to the last component of potential additional NOI growth through 2019, $21 million associated with the lease-up of existing vacancy in our in-service and redevelopment properties. $4 million of the $21 million relates to the lease-up of 95 Jackson and Maxwell, the balance of available space at 95 Jackson and at the entirety of Maxwell through stabilization. The lease-up of the in-service office assets account for the remaining $17 million of NOI in this category. We've assumed average net absorption at 50,000 square feet per quarter plus the lease-up of the Fourth &amp; Traction asset until we reach 93.5% leased at the end of 2019. In terms of aggregate square footage, this amounts to 470,000 square feet of net absorption over the next 7 quarters. Roughly 3.8% of square footage of our in-service office portfolio. We've assumed rents for leases on our existing vacancy are executed at 15% mark-to-market and grossed up for tenant recoveries and parking and other revenue subject to the same adjustment per base year rent resets on gross leases. We've also assumed an NOI margin of 70% with respect to the rents and other revenue associated with these new leases.</p><p>Our projection of $461 million of NOI and 18% growth for full year 2019 is impressive, but our growth prospects don't end there. We have the mechanisms in place for NOI to reach $516 million beyond 2019, representing another 14% growth in comparison to our beginning in 2018. $43 million of this additional $55 million of NOI would come from the delivery and lease-up of EPIC, Harlow and Westside Pavilion. Target stabilized yields for these projects are in our supplemental. Another $12 million of NOI would result from the stabilization of Campus Center following a period of lease-up over next year. Collectively, our growth through 2019 and beyond points to NOI more than 30% higher than NOI as of the most recently completed quarter. I think we can all agree that, that should bode well for the future.</p><p>So with that, I'll turn to a discussion of our current intrinsic value and the implied NAV discount. I'm quite certain that the analysis I'm about to walk through is well understood by many of you. The punchline is that our stabilized office portfolio is trading at an implied cap rate that -- I just want to emphasize that, our stabilized office portfolio is trading at an implied cap rate 127 basis points to 177 basis points wide of market cap rate for high barrier West Coast markets, not to mention exceptional credit quality and significant upside on the in-place rents.</p><p>Let's quickly walk through the building blocks step-by-step. We begin with $7.6 billion of total capitalization based on Monday's closing price of $33.86. $605 million of our enterprise value is attributable to our studios based on a cap rate of 5.5% on Q1 2018 annualized NOI, for Sunset Gower and Bronson and 4.5% cap rate on Q1 '18 annualized NOI for Sunset Las Palmas. The lower cap rate on Sunset Las Palmas accounts for its stabilized value potential and results in a value materially in line with our purchase price from May of last year. $89 million is attributable to our land. You can find a detailed description of our valuation assumptions for these land assets in the Appendix.</p><p>$165 million of our enterprise value is allocated to development projects, EPIC and Harlow. Again, cost and yield assumptions are in our supplemental. We've applied a 5% cap rate on the stabilized NOI for these assets then deducted the remaining cost to complete. We did not discount the resulting value to present value as we ignored cash flow prior to stabilization for simplicity.</p><p>$253 million of our enterprise value is allocable to redevelopment projects, 95 Jackson, Campus Center and Maxwell. Cost and yield assumptions for 95 Jackson and Maxwell are in our supplemental. We deducted a -- we applied a 5% cap rate on the applicable stabilized NOI then deducted the remaining cost to complete. With respect to Campus Center, we've applied a 6% cap rate on the stabilized NOI, assuming we achieve a $2.20 per square foot net rent, then deducted the remaining cost to complete to get this asset to stabilization. As an important a side, as Drew and Art both mentioned, our rent assumption here is considerably lower than the rents being pursued by our competitors. As with the development properties, we did not discount the resulting value for these assets to present value as we've ignored all cash flow prior stabilization.</p><p>The $2.3 billion attributable to our lease-up office assets reflects the value of substantially all those assets at a 4% cap rate on Q1 2018 annualized NOI. As of Q1, 2018, neither CUE and Fourth &amp; Traction were contributing cash NOI, so we valued them separately, which I'll touch on in a moment. With respect to the other lease-up assets, we've applied a 4% cap rate on current NOI to appropriately reflect their stabilized value potential. Upon stabilization, the implied value equates to just shy of a 6% cap rate on stabilized NOI. I want to repeat that. If you take the value that's created out of the 4% cap rate on current NOI and you hold that value and then you stabilize the NOI on those assets, it implies close to a 6% cap rate.</p><p>As per CUE and Fourth &amp; Traction, again, cost and yield assumptions are in our existing supplemental. We've applied a 5% cap rate on the stabilized NOI for these assets then deducted the remaining cost to complete. The resulting value was also not discounted to present value, similar to our other development properties.</p><p>The other cash -- the other components of our enterprise value, other assets and liabilities and cash simply tie to our Q1 2018 balance sheet. The remaining $4.1 billion of enterprise value is attributable to our stabilized office portfolio. Q1 2018 annualized NOI for that portfolio was $268 million.</p><p>Taking this altogether, we end up at a 6.5 cap rate on our stabilized office portfolio.</p><p>If we value these assets within an appropriate range our shares should be trading at $40.15 at a cap rate of 5.25%, would be trading at $41.76 at a cap rate of 5% and would be trading at $43.55 at a cap rate of 4.75%, again, on our stabilized office portfolio.</p><p>As of Monday close, our stabilized office portfolio was trading at an implied discount between 24% and 37% at the same cap rates. Of course, that's a value on historic NOI. The discount would be even higher if we used full year 2018 NOI for our stabilized office portfolio.</p><p>This final slide provides a side-by-side comparison to our office peers of FFO growth and current consensus NAV discount. As you can see, no office REIT is projected to generate higher FFO per share growth since 2012 than Hudson Pacific. Meanwhile, we trade at the highest discount to NAV among our West Coast office peers and virtually every other office REIT, except for the New York-centric company.</p><p>We appreciate that the FFO growth that we're showing here largely looks to historic results, though it carries through to the end of the current year. However, it underscores our track record of consistently delivering exceptional growth as we recycle assets, capital development and redevelopment opportunities and take advantage of lease expirations and vacancies. We have every confidence that we will continue to achieve sector-leading growth. Thank you.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Drew, Bill, Art. Did we lose Art? I don't see him. I know he lost a lot of weight, but I think I could still see him. Anybody know where Art is? No questions on leasing at this time.</p><p>Well, first, I think you're not mic, right? Pass it around. First of all, I want to thank everybody for their participation today. And we're going to open it up to questions, I'm sure some people have some questions at various different levels and I'm going to try -- here he is. Yes, grand entrance.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: So. Who wants to start? Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you talk a little bit about -- 2 parts. One, in terms of new market in the studio business, on one side, how do you think about how much you want the studio business to be part of the portfolio? Is there a certain target or a certain level you don't want to get to? And then second in terms of international, I'll consider Canada international, so I don't if you still have your passport, whether that gives you an element of going back home, getting into Vancouver where there's a lot of institutional ownership, but how you think about that transition? And how close you are to doing it?</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Great. Yes. So -- and I'll take them both. So on the first, the studio media business, from our standpoint, is going to be an ever growing business. Now will it even remotely get close to the core office business? The answer is no. It's just not physically possible for us to buy that much. That sort of stems into the next piece, which is, as I said -- I mean, we're not looking specifically today any specific asset. And for us to enter a marketplace, we would have to do more than 1 deal. Wouldn't make any sense to go buy just a studio without a vision in, say, Vancouver or Atlanta, and then say we're done. We have to buy much more than 1 and have a stronger presence to grow that portfolio. There are tax considerations in Vancouver -- in Canada. We definitely have room on our bad income aspect. We've run that metrics and we feel comfortable that we can achieve the aspects there on a positive basis. Now there is -- clearly, the bigger question is the currency arbitrage, right? And today, I think it's $0.72 or something like that. So obviously, that can swing both ways. But right now, it's near relative low for the last 4 or 5 years. It's right around mid-$0.70, $0.72, so it hasn't moved. But we have to keep that in consideration, too. Institutionally-wise, you're absolutely right. I mean, you'd have to make a big headway. I think we're much more interested in the office sector in Vancouver because it's really a great marketplace to be a part of. So...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you use a partner?</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Yes, I think we would. I think -- on the office side, we probably would use a partner. I think we've clearly got one partner who kind of likes that marketplace already, who's our only partner that we currently have. So it seems like a good fit. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Can you talk about some of the key regulatory risks [in office sales], I don't think you touched on that, Seattle [and someplace else]?</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: The question was talk a little bit about the key regulatory risk in our marketplaces because we actually didn't touch on it. So there are several, and we can start right here in Los Angeles as the first. And the presentation that Spencer gave us, one of the things he did mention was the NIMBY-ism and the likes of that. What you're finding in Los Angeles right now is the City Council and the mayor are in the process of putting a proposal in place that I think our team, Chris Barton and Chris Pearson, who are the experts in the marketplace, and Chris is over in the left corner, you can talk him after, feel that it's going to come through, which is upsizing on density. And it will be a density and a height increase around all the metro areas in Los Angeles to increase the growth. It will be both on a residential and a commercial basis. So it's the first time they're proposing that. Clearly, there has been a lot of talk in Los Angeles but also in all of our main markets on the homelessness issue and cost of living, and so, we would not be surprised to see something affect real estate in all forms and functions other than residential for some form of a fee structure. Clearly, that's the case that happened in Seattle. I think we were in Seattle and it was last Tuesday night, and we'd go tonight, right? We'd go last night. We were there for a big broker dinner that we hosted and I got the pleasure of sitting at a table with the Facebook, Google and Apple brokers who all were absolutely bar none furious about what happened in Seattle. And the prelude to that is that they were saying, \"Hey, it's not the fact it was $500 or it's not the fact it was $275, the fact is that there's no game plan.\" And so it was just tax them because they're making money, and the reality is I think there is not a conscious business, from what I've been told, in Seattle of the main guys, and businesses have now come out and spoken, I think, a lot more vocally after last week, specifically Starbucks and...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Zillow.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Zillow, yes, right. And said it's not just the money, because this is -- we needed a plan and we're all going to contribute to what's going to happen in the validity of it, but how much of those dollars are actually really going to get to the bottom line and what's going to happen? And there's been, I think, a little bit of a shock around this just was sort of whimsically passed, and Amazon was the voice, and I think a lot of the CEOs wish that they had a voice, too. So those are probably the 2 mains ones that we've seen, but they both revolve around identification. And clearly, as you can see by our presentation, I mean, the biggest concern -- if you're a West Coast person, the biggest concern you would have is cost and affordability and future of residential. And so that's going to trigger a lot of things that could be potentially unfortunate to our businesses. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: [Follow-up question]. You have a lot of growth that you were [mentioning down here]. You spoke about a JV partner. So maybe if you could wrap in your thoughts on funding all of the stuff that you have planned. And then, Mark, how does that [translate] as part of -- how do these decisions factor in? I don't know if that's in your bridge or if that's incremental to [based on] whatever happens.</p><p>MARK T. LAMMAS: Yes, so look that was an easy one. We've provided a cash and a live bridge, right? So the funding considerations around, say, the EPIC or Westside Pavilion and so forth, it's going to hit interest expense, a lot of that gets capitalized. But it wouldn't factor into the bridge itself, right, because it's falling below the NOI gamut.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Right. But if you're selling assets to [solve]...</p><p>MARK T. LAMMAS: Fair enough. I didn't quite appreciate that part of your question. Right now, that analysis you just saw assumes no asset dispositions or acquisitions. So we'll have to adjust, I suppose, if and when we make an announcement on either one of those fronts.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: But the capital aligned today -- so our currently in place development is already taken care of.</p><p>MARK T. LAMMAS: Yes. And we have $850 million of immediate capital availability, not counting cash and cash equivalents. So everything we have that we would potentially need to fund, even if we made no dispositions, is easily covered with what we've got.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Anybody else? Nobody's going to talk about Mark stuff. So simple. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I think, Art, you mentioned it looks like (inaudible) this building. Is that the [Pavilion] users or the multiple?</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Art, repeat it, please.</p><p>ARTHUR X. SUAZO: I think the question was, at Westside Pavilion, the activity we have, the negotiation we're in, is it multiple users, is it one user? The answer is, it's one user. The 1.2 million square feet of active prospects, right, that's actually 4 users, right? And the 2 -- as I mentioned, 2 of those are proactively test fitting the space now on their own nickel.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Victor, at the start you talked about buying premium core props with all the upside opportunity in redevelopment and new development, why would you put any capital to work at a low cap rate under long lease duration for an asset?</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: So we balance it out. I didn't say only solely core. It can be core, core-plus and value-add. And so -- but today, anything that we are looking at has a value-add component to increase the NOI almost immediately. And I can't think of a project that we're looking at right now that's just pure core. And the only reason we would actually buy a pure core asset is if it actually has synergistic value to an asset beside us or in the market place that we have that helps the overall portfolio. And in a lot of those instances, we would probably bring a JV partner in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Maybe for the group. You talked about regulation being a bit of a supply constraint in the Silicon Valley. [How does] cost inflation affect any new supply and replacement cost?</p><p>ALEXANDER VOUVALIDES, CIO, HUDSON PACIFIC PROPERTIES, INC.: Well, I think that's a -- yes, so the question was the impacts of cost inflation on new supply and the cost of development? Correct. I think there's 2 things: One is -- I think I mentioned in my representation, as the cost of construction has increased, it's been forcing, asking rents to go up. So for new developers who want to achieve their cost of capital returns, rents are starting to rise. That obviously benefits us as with existing product and our lower bases in those assets. But I think two, and this goes to the VSP program that we've talked about, and Art specifically, is that with the rising cost of construction in general, a lot of our competitors just will simply either not front cost like we have forward spend of our TIs, as we mentioned on the VSP, in advance, or aren't even able to -- be able to clean up some of the buildings because of their own capital constraints. I think as -- with our healthy balance sheet, being a public company, we have a specific advantage over many of our competitors in the Valley and the Peninsula in this rising cost sort of market.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Anybody else? Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Atlanta, with the studio business, can you expand a little about what's being -- talk about what submarkets within Atlanta that is expanding? And sort of why Atlanta more than sort of other potential markets?</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Yes, I'll take the latter and then Alex is going to jump in on the former. The concern, and we've charted this for a long time, and I've been to all these other marketplaces and look, you go to New Mexico and then all of a sudden the tax credits go away. You go to Detroit and the tax credits go away. And they're not sticky marketplaces. We've seen -- as Bill put on his slides, on his presentation, we've seen that Atlanta and Vancouver are really in a position where they seem to be holding. We're also back channeling through Apple and Hulu and Netflix and the likes of that and the new content players who are actually leasing sound stages for 5, 7 and 10 years. So it's not just this is a short-term window. Alex, you can sort of talk about some of the markets that we're looking at, the specific submarkets.</p><p>ALEXANDER VOUVALIDES: Sure. So in Atlanta, there's nothing really kind of in downtown and the urban core, it's all slightly on the perimeter. When you think of Atlanta, the opportunity, so there's more production happening in Atlanta right now, when you factor in feature films and add it with television, than any other market in the United States. I think when we look at our clients like Netflix, which Bill can touch upon, they're shooting a lot of productions there and I think as the landlord of choice, we've seen opportunity where we can leverage those relationships and bring it to a market like Atlanta, New York or even Vancouver. The other thing, not too similar to L.A., current ownership is fragmented, it's non-institutional and with this scale and the platform that we've created with our studio facilities, we think there's a real opportunity to go in there, acquire potentially a couple of these facilities, leverage our relationships, leverage our operating platform and create value.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. Just maybe a follow-up on that. Can you just talk a little bit about what the size of studio market is and put it into context with L.A.?</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Repeat that.</p><p>ALEXANDER VOUVALIDES: Yes. So the question was just overall size of the market in Atlanta and how does that compare to L.A.? I think if you look at Atlanta, if you even look at New York and then Vancouver, you're probably talking about, right now, in each market, 3, 4, maybe 5 facilities at most that would be of institutional quality and something that I could see us potentially pursuing. So not too dissimilar to L.A.L.A. obviously is a much larger market. You have the major media conglomerates that own their own facilities and then the independents like us. In these markets, it's truly just independence, none of the majors own their own facilities. And like I said, it's probably no more than 5 in any given market. And when you look at number of stages, I think those facilities are very much akin to what we own in L.A. So it's not something that you're going to go into a market and all of a sudden we're going to own 20 facilities and 100 stages, it's going to be very similar to what we've done here.</p><p>WILLIAM A. HUMPHREY: And I would add to that, that, again, on the feature film side, only about 9% of feature films are done in L.A. now. Most of them are done, either on location or in these very large sound stages that are in Atlanta. So for example, take Marvel. Marvel makes -- they will go in and shoot a movie there on 10, 11 or 12 stages. There's no way you could do that in New York or Los Angeles. So that feature film market is there. I think the second part of it is, you have divide television shows and do like an A-level, which is the star-driven stuff and the B-level, which is the non-star-driven stuff. So you take, for example, Netflix' show, Stranger Things, which is a kid show, no stars in it, high risk, they shot that in Atlanta. And so I think you're going to see the screening companies grow. They'll have their A-level talent shooting in L.A. and sort of their B-level talent shooting in these lower-cost markets.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Then just one other point, because I knew we're sort of -- there's going to be conversations over periods of time of these markets. That's not an issue exclusive to, say, we're not going to be buying in Los Angeles. There still is potentially 4 studios that we can purchase in Los Angeles that we are still pursuing at various different levels that are not marketed studios at this time, but we have relationships though.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Maybe just about -- continue on the studios. Can you talk about the difference in cap rates and IRRs between L.A., Vancouver, Atlanta and New York?</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: Yes, go ahead Alex. The question was talking about various different cap rates and IRR's between Los Angeles as opposed to the new markets that we're looking at.</p><p>ALEXANDER VOUVALIDES: Sure. So in all these markets, there are traits that have occurred. So to pinpoint to say, \"Hey, what's the stabilized cap rate for a studio in any of these 3 markets?\" It's tough to pinpoint because there are comps. That being said, I think for us to go into one of these markets, take the risk to invest in a new market, it's safe to assume that our projected return and what we would look for would be outsized relative to what we maybe buy a stabilized studio here in L.A.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So Mark, what's that on IRR?</p><p>ALEXANDER VOUVALIDES: On an unlevered IRR basis, I would say high single digit to low double digit.</p><p>MARK T. LAMMAS: Alex, just to make sure to reconcile that back to the bridge we just provided. Our studios are undergoing a transformation in terms of the tenor of the leases. So the majority of the stages now or the vast majority, although 2 stages at Bronson are now under 10-plus year deals with credit. And Bronson is now seeing that very same trend -- and I mean, Gower is seeing that very same trend. So we've naturally adjusted our historic cap rate valuation for those studios to reflect that long-term credit quality.</p><p>VICTOR J. COLEMAN: And just as a side bar to that, I think we're pretty conservative -- I know we're pretty conservative because the most recent comp on a studios was Culver and that was purchased -- and it's sort of hard to quantify, but it was purchased $700 million. They're billing a 250,000 square feet of new space in this, master lease it to Amazon and they just got valued at $900 million, at a little over a 4% cap. So I think we're still very conservative on our numbers that Mark's going to put on the table. I know that chaps, Alex, more than anything else, but it's a deal that you -- sometimes you don't get them all. Anybody else?</p><p>Right. With that, before I call Laura up, I'd like to thank this team here, thank our senior management team for a fantastic Investor Day. So a round of applause, please. I'd also like to just recognize Laura's team over there in the corner. Go, please stand up. Natalie, Kristy, Sam, and Lisa. So -- and of course, Laura Campbell.</p><p>LAURA CAMPBELL: Great. So we'll just wrap things up real quick. I want to thank everyone again for coming and taking time to spend the time with us. A couple of quick announcements. We have box lunches for you out in the foyer. So feel free to grab them and eat in the room or take them as you go. We have shuttles outside at the Wilshire entrance. Our team will be outside -- for people going to the airport, sorry. So our team will be outside and can help direct you. Also in your folders, we've included a survey, and we are always looking for ways to improve. So if you could please take a few minutes and fill it out and hand it to our team on the way out. They have a goody bag for you. So you can pick that up and they'll take your survey. And then most importantly, I echo Victor's sentiments that I wanted to thank all of our presenters. This is not what they do every day, and it's a huge endeavor.</p><p>So thank you all very much. And thanks for the entire management team for their support. And I also want to thank our board for coming. So many of you are here and we're honored to have you. It's really terrific. And my team, you're awesome, I'm so glad that Victor recognized you. And thank you all so much and we'll see you and talk to you very soon, I'm sure.

The paper lays out several powers it would give to a new independent regulator to make sure platforms like Facebook and YouTube stay on top of \"harmful content.\" The powers mentioned in the paper include huge fines, geoblocking websites, and criminal sanctions. The UK government unveiled on Monday a new policy paper outlining how it plans to take a tough stance on \"harmful content\" online. </p><p>The paper's definition of harmful content is broad, ranging from terrorist content, to images of self-abuse, and child sexual exploitation. The paper also spells out the hefty punishments it plans to slap tech companies with, should they fail to comply with its new regulatory framework. Some of the punishments will be \"core powers\" given to a new independent regulator. However, the paper also lays out several more extreme punitive measures which the government is considering. All of the proposals will be consulted on over the coming months. Let's go through them one at a time.Fines worth billions of dollarsThe UK's new tech regulator will have a few standard powers, including serving notices on companies that break guidelines on harmful content and demanding they hand over internal information on how they dealt with a breach.The most significant of these \"core\" powers is the ability to levy fines. While the paper itself is unspecific as to how these fines would be calculated, Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told the BBC's \"Today\" programme on Monday that the fines could be \"up to 4% of global turnover.\" This would put the new regulator's maximum fine on a par with GDPR fines over privacy breaches[1]. To put this in perspective, a 4% fine is $2.2 billion of Facebook's total 2018 revenue of $56 billion. Google, whose revenues last year totalled almost $137 billion[2], could be slapped with a $5.5 billion fine \u2014 similar to what it received from the EU after it was found to be abusing the dominance of its Android platform last July. Google is appealing the ruling.Delisting apps and downgrading search resultsAfter listing the core powers which will be granted to the new regulator, the white paper says it is \"likely\" that the regulator would need some other powerful weapons in its armory. It then describes three more extreme measures which the government is considering adding to the regulator's powers. The first is the ability to force third-party companies to shut down anything which, \"directly or indirectly facilitates access\" to content from a website that's in breach. This means if a website flouted new rules, the regulator could make Google downgrade search its results. Read more: Apple, Google, and Facebook could be forced to censor apps and sites featuring 'harmful' content under new UK laws[3] The regulator might also be given the power to pressure firms that run app stores \u2014 namely Apple and Google \u2014 to delist or deprioritise apps that feature harmful content in some way.Geoblocking websites in the UKThe second and arguably most extreme recourse listed on the paper is that the regulator could ISP (internet service provider) block companies, so that their sites would be inaccessible in the UK.This would likely be a last resort, \"where a company has committed serious, repeated and egregious violations of the outcome requirements for illegal harms, failing to maintain basic standards after repeated warnings and notices of improvement.\" The paper also acknowledged that geoblocking sites would present \"technical limitations,\" presumably because savvy users would be able to access blocked sites through a VPN (virtual private network). It maintains, however, that the threat of ISP-blocking would still act as a \"powerful deterrent.\"Criminal sanctions for specific executivesThe third measure the government is considering, is giving individual senior executives personal liability. \"This would mean certain individuals would be held personally accountable in the event of a major breach of the statutory duty of care,\" the paper said. Punishment for these breaches could incur a civil or even a criminal fine for the executive in question. The paper is not clear, however, exactly which executives would fall under this personal liability, and identifies this as a \"challenge.\" The government is also considering forcing companies to appoint a European Economic Area-based nominated representative who would liaise with the new regulator to ensure compliance.NOW WATCH: We tried Louis Vuitton's wireless earbuds to find out if they're

'[Luxemburg] combines enormous flexibility to set up tax reduction schemes, along with binding tax rulings that are unique. It's like a magical fairyland.'<br/>Luxemburg tax deals: Companies ranging from Blackstone Group to Guardian Media named<br/>The names, some of which are still withheld, read like a who's who of big business. Private equity firms\u00a0The Blackstone Group L.P. (NYSE:BX[5]) and\u00a0The Carlyle Group LP (NASDAQ:CG[6]) are both on the list, as are major banks including HSBC Holdings plc (ADR) (NYSE:HSBC[7]) (LON:HSBA[8]), JPMorgan Chase Co. (NYSE:JPM[9]), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C[10]), and investment companies like Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS:FRFHF) (TSE:FFH[11]) and Boston Consulting Group.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://cdn1.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/blackstone-luxemberg.png\">http://cdn1.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/blackstone-luxemberg.png</url><br/> You've got big tech companies[12] including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL[13]) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN[14]), telecoms like Vodafone Group Plc (ADR) (NASDAQ:VOD[15]) (LON:VOD[16]) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ[17]), the list goes on and on. One of the withheld names that's expected to come out next week is in the financial sector with a name that fits between 'Delff Management' and 'Developers Diversified Realty Corp' in alphabetical order, so you'll forgive us for thinking Deutsche Bank might be soon added to the list.<br/> But it's not just tech and finance cutting corners: H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE:HNZ[18]), Pepsi Bottling Group, and Guardian Media Group (which operates liberal newspaper The Guardian) also have tax deals in Luxemburg.<br/>Documents should aid investigations into Luxemburg tax rulings<br/>Luxemburg[19] has been known as a tax haven years, so there's no reason to believe either that PwC is the only major accounting firm arranging such deals or that these are the only companies with special tax structures in the tiny nation, but the level of detail contained in these letters is stunning and should be a boon to regulators (if not prosecutors) for a long time to come.<br/> The most immediate case has to do with EU regulators[20] trying to get hold of documents relating to Amazon and Fiat Finance to determine if those deals violate European law.<br/> 'It's unclear whether any of these documents are among those still being sought by EU investigators, but they are the kinds of documents that go to the heart of the EU's investigation into Luxembourg's tax rulings,' write Leslie Wayne, Kelly Carr, Marina Walker Guevara, Mar Cabra and Michael Hudson for ICIJ.<br/> The post Huge Leak On Luxemburg Tax Deals Now Available Online[21]

Indeed, many Americans were generally unaware that such threats exist, even though these threats could potentially be more destructive to the country than Sept. 11, 2001, or Pearl Harbor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, U.S. social media \u2014 indeed, worldwide social media \u2014 remained open to manipulation by malign agents of disinformation. We are still defended by only the thinnest of lines at the Pentagon and within the law enforcement and intelligence communities.</p><p>Last week, our tech titans were a largely unregulated group. If not exactly indifferent to the growing consensus that these members of Big Tech are achieving dangerous concentrations of power and wealth, then at best the companies moved at a snail's pace to convince the public of their good and fair intentions and thus cut off ham-handed and outdated regulation.</p><p>Then, on Monday, reports confirmed that the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the House Judiciary Committee were launching almost simultaneous offensives against everything represented by the term \u201cFAANG\u201d \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. (Disclosure I own only Amazon stock, and The Washington Post is owned by Amazon\u2019s founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos. My views on this issue long predate either purchase.)</p><p>Neither investors nor consumers should be amused. There isn't any indication that any of the would-be regulators have the background to assess the new issues set or, crucially, even care much about the national security implications of either our collective defenses or lack of export controls on our technologies.</p><p>No notice. No public discussion. Just a bum's rush to regulate. Slow down.</p><p>I've argued for a new regulatory regime for Big Tech for years to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House GOP leaders, to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and national security adviser John Bolton, and to many others in both houses of Congress. About the only thing Hillary Clinton and I agreed on in our long on-air conversation after the publication of her campaign memoir was the need for everyone to read a different book (\"World Without Mind,\" by Franklin Foer) on the dangers of the new age of artificial intelligence. I don't need to be convinced that there are risks as enormous as an unregulated Manhattan Project out there in the wilds of Big Tech.</p><p>But count me very skeptical that these risks are best addressed and remedied by FTC regulators and lawyers using statutory authorities only remotely connected to the massive problem, or by Justice Department litigators wielding theories of antitrust law that were previously not widely aired, much less debated. There\u2019s little danger posed by the newly announced congressional hearings \u2014 perhaps even some good. But the suddenness of the collective lurch against Big Tech served most to illuminate how little has been done before to ask what these new technologies are doing to us and exposing us to.</p><p>What is needed, believe it or not, is a select commission. Yes, really It's the hoariest of old Beltway ruses for doing nothing, but this time it could do immense good. Attorney General William Barr is the right official who ought to impanel a select commission of, say, 15 or so, including the principals or general counsels of three or four of the biggest tech titans, a similar number of the country's best legal minds, senior military thinkers and a dash of academic genius and public intellectuals. Give them six months to a year to provide a comprehensive assessment of risks and regulatory approaches.</p><p>Barr knows that the government rushing in without a plan is in fact a plan for massive and potentially disastrous unintended consequences. It may indeed be that the Justice Department's antitrust division is from where the fashioning of new rules must proceed, or the export control experts at the Treasury Department, or perhaps a new regulatory structure recommended to and enacted by Congress. But this sudden spilling onto the floor of a boiling pot of unknown ingredients and enforcement actions is terrible policy.</p><p>Some thinking first, please. It is a problem of immeasurable consequence. Prudence, not politics, is required.</p><p>Hugh Hewitt, a Washington Post contributing columnist, hosts a nationally syndicated radio show and is author of \u201cThe Fourth Way The Conservative Playbook for a Lasting GOP Majority.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-httpswwwsltribcomopinioncommentary20190607hughhewittregulatebig</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W90-7CH1-JCB3-X4FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"747\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 7, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Those in Singapore have just eased into Phase 2 of our country's reopening. Most agree that the new normal, which some predict might last for a few years, will consist of intermittent lockdowns, more digital touchpoints, and more restrictions around physical spaces. Recently, Brian Halligan (CEO, Hubspot) shared an informative deck[1]on whatwe might expect of the new normal. </p><p>What does this mean for customer experience (CX), especially when CX is the key to acquiring customers and the landscape has changed? I believe there is a good opportunity for companies to rethink and reboot their CX strategies on a clean slate. Companies that succeed well in positioning their CX strategy from this point onwards, will also succeed well in differentiating themselves, acquiring customers and even building long-term loyalty. The keyis figuring out the kind of CX strategy that works well for our world today, and I address it below.Effectivecustomer experience and how it builds loyaltyThe first key is to think about CX as a whole: what makes it effective in peacetime, how strong brands build loyalty, and what changes the game now. Customer loyalty starts with effective personal relationships between customers and companies. In the sales context, the most effective salespeople and advisors never sound 'sales-sy'. They are customer-centric and often go beyond the call of duty, safeguarding client interests and focusing on creating value. Clients that have had experiences exceeding expectations stay loyal to such advisors even as these advisors move on to new companies. Also Read: Customer is not always the king, says Tokopedia's customer engagement expert[2] We know that an effective CX strategy puts itself in the shoes of the customer and considers the customer at all touchpoints. The main challenge in the new normal is that digital touchpoints and interfaces are by nature impersonal and there aren't ways for companies to engage customers through events, so the key question is: how do companies show customer-centricity and build personal relationships despite this?In-person customer experienceWe can first analyse different touchpoints, especially with the rise of physical-digital fusions. Many retail companies, especially in the e-commerce space (such as Style Theory and Love, Bonito), are omni-channel. Those with brick-and-mortar platforms could think about how social distancing and contact tracing measures change the way customers physically interact with their business. Do they pose 'barriers to entry', which discourage customers from patronising stores? Customers might also hang around within these enclosed spaces for longer periods since signing in and out is inconvenient. If there are fewer people and they are hanging around longer, then there is an opportunity for companies to re-create customer interactions as experiential journeys. This can create enjoyment-associations and affection for the brand. Pre-COVID-19, some e-commerce companies had already started shifting towards curating physical-digital experiences. Love, Bonito in Singapore had their latest store at Funan providing an eclectic space with digital catalogues and stocks updated in real-time. The space had an AR feature allowing shoppers to view the space using decorative filters. There was an artful curation of visually stimulating displays and neon lights. Of course, there are further considerations for a post-Covid-19 shopping experience - surfaces should be touch-free, rather than be touchscreens. Perhaps now, panels and screens showing animations and immersive art might be a new tactic. Also Read: How startups can consistently acquire new customers post-COVID-19[3] A post-COVID-19 future might accelerate re-imagination of the immersive superstore or the experience hub. There are other broader concerns to monitor in a well-rounded CX strategy that is beyond the scope of this article. Privacy might be an issue if customers become wary of being tracked. Resistance and misplaced anger might also increase, as customers get annoyed with being told what to do and how to behave in these prescriptive environments. Businesses will have to manage these considerations with empathetic communication strategies.Digital customer experienceGiven the weight of digital engagement now, refining touchpoints on digital platforms is an important key. We are all familiar that the amount of time it takes for a user (or customer) to achieve their objective on a platform influences the quality of their experience. A viral recent study by product expert Peter Ramsey (writer of Built for Mars)[4] compares the amount of time (number of clicks and of days) it takes to open a bank account in the UK. Challenger banks perform better than most incumbents. Of course, it is more complicated than that as a faster experience is not the only factor determining a high-quality experience. In the second instalment, he looks at his experience of sending payments[5], evaluating a comprehensive mix of factors with incumbents and challengers winning at different ones. Also Read: Customer experience: The opportunity that growing businesses are failing to see[6] Generally, we all realise that ease of use and access to key functions are important. Customers find a lagging website or having too many steps a poor experience. For example, while chatbots are well-intentioned, an unresponsive chatbot is a poor experience, and so is a chatbot that is unable to provide answers even after a user has spent time typing their questions. While we have talked about functional websites and apps, an interesting tactic that has fared well now is using AR in digital apps. This is another take on the digital-physical fusion, with an emphasis on assimilating the physical into the digital. This article[7] gives an example of Singapore physical-first furniture retailer Castlery adapting well by re-creating their physical showrooms in AR, enabling customers to enjoy virtual tours of living spaces. It's impressive that they have tagged all the items and enabled true-to-scale capability for its furniture pieces[8], so that users can visualise in real-time how the furniture would look against the real-life dimensions and appearance of their rooms. Chinese retail also shows us the future of e-commerce experiences ahead - they sell products through livestreaming[9] by showing viewers how products - from clothes to make-up - look in real-time and has actually resulted in increased sales. This could be the standard for customer engagement using digital platforms. The last factor to consider is the use of personalisation to tailor any recommendations, advice, products to specific customer needs. Data analytics and machine learning are commonly discussed as tools to extract deep insights from user data to build products and strategies. One issue here is privacy, data protection and consent, but that is also a broader topic outside of this article.How to shape the customer experience and build a connectionMost know that the key to winning customers and preventing them from disengaging lies in reducing friction throughout their interactions with the business. As many digital products are easily substitutable, some marketing strategies also aim to create customer and product stickiness through loyalty and reward programmes. However, it's fair to say that such campaigns can become undifferentiated gimmicky races-to-the-bottom driving price wars. So, how else can companies differentiate themselves through their CX strategies? I suggest that we have to start from first principles and understand why some salespeople and advisors retain clients more than others do. Companies must build 'personal' relationships and the brand is an important medium to achieve that.

It comprises all messaging communicated through tangible and intangible displays, such as visual design, content, actions. Even the quality of the digital user experience affects brand perception - poor quality denotes an untrustworthy or sloppy brand. The brand is a fabric of what the company stands for, from their mission to their values and impact. Customers feel engaged with a brand when the brand is empathetic, the company values resonate with them and are values they care about. They may even learn new insights about the world that they wouldn't have known. The deeper question to ask that is rarely explored in-depth amongst all UX/ CX, marketing and brand strategies is: what is the kind of brand that is inspiring of loyalty in a world like this today, and what characterises this world now? That will inform what customers need from a brand today.Branding that inspires loyaltyWe live in polarised times, driven by multi-directional tensions, with COVID-19 exacerbating these. There are geopolitical, economic, socio-political tensions between society, government, business and financial markets. Customers now have baseline expectations for how companies respond, whether they add value to the public good, and whether they walk their talk. Any good brand strategy in these times gets to the core of stakeholder capitalism. Types of indicators include: how do brands respond to ESG concerns; do they employ equitable practices in their supply chains; are employees, contractors, workers down the supply chain fairly compensated; is the work culture toxic or exploitative; do they step up in a global crisis; do they respond to societal issues. Empathy has also become a key criterion: does the company genuinely care about their customers and their stakeholders? A recent example includes the widespread socio-political discussion on systemic racism sparked by the unjustified death of African-American George Floyd by a police officer. This has rocked the world and everyone, from the average person to big business, is weighing in. During these sensitive times, people observe how brands react. Also Read: Between data and gut feeling, which one do Singaporean customers trust to make decisions?[11] Many have expressed that any systemic silence is being noticed, while others call for actions over words. Big tech such as Netflix, Amazon and Microsoft have issued public statements expressing regret and solidarity. VC firms and networks such as a16z and SoGal have prepared funds, grants and programmes targeted at Blacks, Latinx and other minority entrepreneurs. CEOs of global brands have also personally spoken out through public or company-circulated statements. Now that some time has passed, companies have also taken the time to write out concrete action plans (such as Microsoft and Crunchbase). In fact, consumers are noticing when there's incongruence between the public stance of a company and their actual actions - such is Facebook's case, where they are mired in a controversy due to their lack of regulation towards the US president's incendiary and racist posts. They have been criticised as being inauthentic although they have announced a donation towards anti-racism efforts. Right now, more than ever, consumers see that 'what you do is who you are' (borrowing the title of Ben Horowitz's book). All statements by tech companies[12] are being logged by The Plug[13] through crowdsourced insights and made public. Although nobody can escape the question of authenticity or performative allyship, it is obvious when a brand is making a genuine effort to step up (even if they hadn't succeeded before) or when they are paying only lip service. On the local and regional front in Asia, responses towards socio-political matters, whether global or local, are usually more muted. This might be due to cultural differences; I believe the tech community shouldn't shun these topics, but that is a broader topic outside of this article. Also Read: Coping with consumer behaviour during the COVID-19 crisis[14] There have been other actions (or inaction) through which tech brands in Asia illustrate their values. Jack Ma and Alibaba donated masks and COVID-19 test-kits around the world, regardless of region. Alibaba also started providing supplier credit to US small businesses. Razer set up face mask production to produce five million free face masks for Singapore. These are steps that show a strong social awareness of public duty to step up in a global crisis - that they care enough about public solidarity to leverage their resources to help the community. These can bolster consumer confidence and trust in these brands, especially amidst trying times. Again, there is always the question whether all these actions are sincere or mere PR exercises, but eventual consistency in value-creating efforts speaks for itself. A good example of branding and authenticity arose recently. When Nike released an anti-racism marketing campaign[15] with a twist on its signature tagline 'Just Do It', it sparked discourse split between praise and disdain for the sports giant. While some praised Nike for speaking up in a prominent manner through the eyebrow-raising twist, others criticised them for taking advantage of a serious matter to spin an opportunistic marketing campaign. Although the public may never come to any agreement on this, Nike then followed up with actions by working with Michael Jordan to donate US$10 million towards anti-racism efforts[16] over the next 10 years. No matter anyone's final verdict on these matters, we can generally agree - better that there are actions done for the public good than there are none, as we remember those that showed up for us in bad times than not. The same applies to how we experience brands. Right now, what customers need and expect from brands have exceeded textbook requirements of good UX and good customer service. Our experience of brands sits within our larger experience of the world. Our experience of the world shapes what we need as people and hence what we expect of brands. Also Read: Pepfuels's IoT-RFID device ensures smart delivery of motor fuels at customers' doorsteps in India[17] We connect with a brand that is human during trying times. We remember if they were empathetic towards their customers and the community when people went through hardships and polarised conflicts divided us. We look to them for moral authority and support when the world struggles to find its footing. While we are amid a great reset, seizing this opportunity to re-imagine and execute a strong CX strategy can build long-term loyalty. A holistic CX strategy is customer-centric when it walks in the customer's shoes, integrating strong UX strategy and a brand strategy that is well-fit for current times. In a trying period where people must swap in-person engagement for digital and fault lines are rupturing, being able to be personal, human and authentic is a strong differentiating factor. Right now more than ever, society expects brands not to turn away but to speak up on things that matter to everyone. When customers find your brand sincere and empathetic, they will remember you and help you on your path. - Register for our next webinar: How to pivot your growth strategy post COVID-19[18] Editor's note:e27 aims to foster thought leadership by publishing contributions from the community.

It has also fuelled xenophobic attacks against migrants in South Africa and been the driving force behind U.S policy to forcibly separate families seeking safety. Meanwhile, it has contributed to the increasing criminalisation of those helping refugees in Europe.</p><p>Instead of addressing real problems like inequality, corruption, unemployment and economic hardship, political leaders on every continent are using minority groups as scapegoats for social and economic ills, spreading fake news about them and inciting discrimination, hostility and violence against them.</p><p>Social media platforms have allowed these hateful views to flourish largely unchecked. However, such hatred has galvanised activists the world over. Fighting for our human rights has never seemed more important.</p><p>The climate emergency</p><p>This decade is likely to be the hottest on record - another alarming sign of the climate emergency which is one of the greatest threats to human rights of our age.</p><p>Millions of people are already suffering from the catastrophic effects of climate change \u2013 from prolonged drought in Africa to devastating tropical storms across South-east Asia and the Caribbean, and heatwaves that have set record temperatures in Europe.</p><p>Climate change threatens to exacerbate inequalities between developed and developing countries; between different ethnicities and classes; between genders, generations and communities \u2013 with the most disadvantaged groups hardest hit. It is already having harmful impacts on our rights to life, health, food, water, housing and livelihoods.</p><p>All the science suggests that extreme weather will only get worse, unless governments take urgent action to slash carbon emissions within the shortest possible timeframe, through a transition that protects the human rights of disadvantaged groups. However, virtually all governments are failing to put in place effective plans, and there is still resistance from some of the biggest emitters; notably the USA, which under President Trump has started the process to formally exit from the Paris Agreement.</p><p>More than ever, we need to stand together to hold our political leaders to account. The Fridays for Future movement, started in 2018 by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg and her colleagues, shows us that change is possible. We cannot afford to fail.</p><p>Violence against women</p><p>The struggle to protect women and girls, and others from all forms of gender-based violence, was as hard-fought as ever. Sexual violence continued to be used as a weapon of war, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where in one case out of many, more than 300 people were raped in four days by armed men in Walikale, North Kivu. Amnesty International also documented the horrific impact of rape in other conflict zones such as Iraq, Somalia, Darfur, Nigeria and South Sudan.</p><p>In many places, the very people meant to keep society safe are the ones attacking women and girls. In Mexico, women reported torture and other forms of violence such as electric shocks to the genitals, groping of breasts and rape with objects \u2013 during arrest and interrogation by police and armed forces as part of the country\u2019s 'war on drugs'. Homicide rates for women have risen sharply throughout the decade, with Mexican authorities failing to take effective action to solve gender-based violence.</p><p>In a breakthrough, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted the landmark Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence - which Amnesty International was involved in drafting \u2013 on 7 April 2011. Recently, Sweden and Greece became some of the few European countries who changed their laws to recognise that sex without consent is rape.</p><p>One of the most iconic online movements of the decade, #MeToo, brought millions of women together to stand up to sexual violence, harassment and assault. #MeToo has spurred change everywhere from Hollywood studios to remote villages in Nepal and northern Nigeria.</p><p>Sexual and reproductive rights</p><p>Although some 50 countries have changed their laws to allow greater access to abortion over the last 25 years, sexual and reproductive rights remain contested. One thing that unites all successful campaigns to reform abortion laws has been the bravery of women who speak out and demand the right to decide what happens to their own bodies.</p><p>Reproductive rights have come under threat elsewhere. Attempts to further restrict access to abortion sparked nationwide protests in Poland. Near-total bans or laws further restricting access to abortion have been introduced in several US states. President Trump\u2019s reinstatement of the 'global gag' rule, which blocks US federal international funding for NGOs that provide abortion counselling or referrals, or that advocate for decriminalising abortion, was a massive blow to women\u2019s rights globally. So were the US administration\u2019s attempts to remove references to \u2018sexual and reproductive health\u2019 from high-level UN policy documents endorsed by Members States,</p><p>From Ireland to South Korea, activists have helped dispel the stigma and secrecy surrounding abortion by sharing their stories. In Argentina and Poland, over a million women have marched to demand that their voices be heard. In the last year alone, legal abortion services opened up in Ireland and is on its way to becoming a reality in Northern Ireland too, after years of campaigning by groups, including Amnesty International. There was more good news in Argentina, where president-elect Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez promised he would move to legalise abortion after taking office in December 2019.</p><p>LGBTI rights</p><p>No doubt the LGBTI rights movement is more visible than ever before, but progress has been mixed in the past decade. In many countries, LGBTI people are still harassed in the streets, beaten up, arrested and sometimes killed simply because of who they are or who they love.</p><p>Consensual same-sex sexual activity is a crime in 70 countries, and the death penalty is imposed as a punishment in a number of countries, including in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen. Sometimes, hostility directed at LGBTI people is stoked by their own governments. In Chechnya for example, a state-sponsored campaign led to the abduction, torture and even killing of people believed to be gay or lesbian</p><p>There have been a few momentous steps taken this past year. A landmark ruling in India decriminalised consensual same-sex relations, marking a critical milestone in the three-decades-old struggle by LGBTI activists and their allies in India. Taiwan became the first in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage after passing a historic law on 17 May 2019. And Pakistan passed one of the most progressive legislations in the world on transgender rights, becoming the first Asian country and one of the few in the world to legally recognise self-perceived gender identity.</p><p>But for many LGBTI people around the globe who have been persecuted, maimed, killed, shamed, set on fire, refused entry into hospitals, shunned, raped and marginalised, there is still a long way to go. Governments must ensure that their rights are protected, and that discrimination on the grounds of real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity is abolished.</p><p>Big Tech and data privacy</p><p>The decade took an Orwellian turn with the rise of Big Tech companies, such as Facebook and Google harvesting and monetising our personal data, and the consequent omnipresent surveillance of billions of people posing a systemic threat to our human rights.</p><p>While, at the beginning of the decade, we were all lulled into a false sense of security, believing we were simply sharing photos with a few friends, it became increasingly clear that our shared information could be exploited as both a weapon of influence and a means of spreading dangerous disinformation and online abuse. A decade later, the so-called \u2018influence industry\u2019 in the form of social media platforms, internet search engines, data brokers and tech companies analysing our personal data and trading in predictions about people\u2019s interests, characteristics, and ultimately behaviour for marketing and advertising, has become one of the biggest and most sinister societal threats of our time.</p><p>We now live in a world where insidious control of our digital lives has far-reaching consequences that go even beyond our privacy - disinformation and information manipulation is a continual battleground, with serious implications on our freedom of opinion, expression and thought. In polls, huge numbers of individuals say they are worried about the influence Big Tech has on their lives, concerned both about data revealing too much about them, and about data being used by state authorities to target them.</p><p>It took time for the human rights risks posed by Big Tech to become clear, partly because civil society and tech companies have traditionally worked together to keep the Internet free from state meddling, and by extension from regulation.

Whether it's the caffeine or natural enthusiasm for the topic that has defined her career, is not fully clear. \"It takes time to work out social rules and social norms, and to decide 'is that a thing you are going to keep using, or is that just a passing fad?' \" she says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's an area of significant importance right now, with society struggling to cope with the growing role of internet-connected gadgets and the software accessible on them in our lives. Or more accurately, the troubling byproducts of smartphones and social media - political polarisation, the spread of fake news, and as Vanity Fair puts it, the Tinder-driven, online \"dating apocalypse\" - to list a few of them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are not good at working out the periodicity and the impact [of new technologies],\" Bell says. \"So are we due for a correction?\"</p><p>At this point in our interview, a deafening horn from a ship docked at the nearby overseas passenger terminal near Sydney's Circular Quay abruptly sounds, suggesting the answer is yes, we are due for a slowdown in the pace of technological change. After all, there have been long periods of human history where this has occurred.</p><p>Yet Bell, the anthropologist-turned-tech guru, actually thinks we could be on the brink of another era of rapid advances in what technology can do, driven by how we harness and analyse data. It's part of the reason she moved home to Australia.</p><p>The word \"extraordinary\" is used far too liberally in modern journalism but when it comes to Bell's career, there are few more appropriate superlatives.</p><p>The trailblazing social scientist is among the most prominent technologists this nation has produced. Her views on issues such as diversity and inclusion in the workplace - once considered radical - are now mainstream. Her influence on the way we interact with the devices that dominate our lives is significant.</p><p>Described by The New York Times as Intel's \"resident intellectual\", Bell has spent the better part of the past three decades in the US, including a 19-year stint at the $US170 billion chip giant's Oregon campus.</p><p>Nowadays she lives in Canberra.</p><p>It's not the usual destination for leading technology industry figures, but Bell has never followed the usual path.</p><p>She is one of the star recruits of new Australian National University vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt, who is trying to put the university, ranked by the 2018 QS World University Rankings as Australia's finest (and in the world's top 20), at the heart of the national conversation on innovation.</p><p>She has returned to Australia at a time when the Australia's economy has reached a crossroads, with many of our biggest companies under siege from the giants of the internet (think Amazon) and belatedly trying to embrace a tech mindset. At a time when human lives are being dominated by machines, and when machines are becoming more human.</p><p>In other words, it's a fascinating time for someone studying, as a press release heralding her appointment put it, \"what it means to be human in a data-driven economy\".</p><p>It's a role that will see her work closely with Data61, the relatively new flagship innovation unit of the CSIRO, and an opportunity she is relishing. \"Oh, it's going to be so good as a researcher,\" she tells AFR Weekend of the era she thinks will unfold. \"But I'm not sure how I feel about it as a human being.\"</p><p>The daughter of prominent anthropologist Diane Bell, Genevieve spent some of her formative years in remote Indigenous communities, an experience that left a permanent imprint on her world view. But Canberra, where her mother was a professor at the ANU, was mainly home.</p><p>Growing up she was \"always the kid with her head in a book\", which, she adds, \"wasn't necessarily a fun way to grow up in a place that didn't necessarily value that\".</p><p>\"I read my way through every public library I had access to, alphabetically,\" she says. So prodigious was her reading intake, the Lyneham High School library had to place a limit on the number of books she could borrow. \"Otherwise I would take a whole shelf home with me.\"</p><p>A precocious teenager, Bell somehow found herself on the typical Canberra trajectory, destined for a career in government. \"It's embarrassing. I wanted to be prime minister,\" she recounts. \"Because I thought if you were prime minister, you could fix everything. I was 16&amp;#xBD;. That's the thinking you have at that age. I was diligently pursuing it.\"</p><p>So, after finishing high school early, she did what many aspiring Australian prime ministers have done. She went to study arts/law at Sydney University. But Australia's oldest university and its environs, or maybe it was the law, just didn't quite seem right. After a semester she quit and went to work in the public service in Canberra.</p><p>Then, on a visit to a small, women-only liberal arts institution on the outskirts of Philadelphia, where her mother was briefly working, Bell had what she calls something of an awakening.</p><p>\"I remember being in a room with all these women, and they were just ridiculously articulate and elegant, in this beautiful place, and I remember going, 'I don't know what this is but I would like to try it',\" she recounts. \"I just had this moment. It takes a lot to achieve exit velocity from Australia, in a meaningful way. Like, it really does. You have got to get going. I wanted to see how big the world was, and what you can do in it.\"</p><p>Soon after, she left Australia and never looked back.</p><p>Bell enrolled at that liberal arts institution, Bryn Mawr College, and thrived. She left with two degrees in anthropology and an offer to be one of the seven people admitted each year to Stanford's prestigious doctoral program, on a fully funded scholarship.</p><p>\"It was OK to be just constantly lost in something, and to be always studying. I was such a dork! But it was great. The most intense period of my life. Everyone talked books, everyone talked ideas, everyone argued ideas.\"</p><p>At Stanford, she continued to shine. Bell completed her doctoral thesis on the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, a boarding school in rural Pennsylvania for native Americans. She had a book deal based on a dissertation and was on track for tenure at one of the world's most prestigious institutions.</p><p>But this was the late 1990s. Stanford is based right in the beating heart of Silicon Valley. The tech industry was booming. The internet was just beginning to assert itself as a serious force in global capitalism, and society. And so Bell decided to throw the dice again.</p><p>A chance encounter at a bar led her to being pursued by Intel, which was setting up a social science research lab. At the time, the chip giant was led by Andy Grove, a legendary, forward-thinking CEO named Time's Man of the Year in 1997.</p><p>\"I thought, here is Intel who, as far as I can tell, are building one of the critical technologies of the 21st century, a technology that proposes to disrupt almost everything,\" she says. \"Mum had always been really clear with my brother and me that you need to do work that mattered, and it shouldn't just matter to you.</p><p>\"Another way of putting it is, you had an obligation to make the world a better place. And I remember just looking at the people I had interviewed with at Intel and thinking, 'I don't know that I want you to build the world without me. I think I'd like in'.\"</p><p>For someone with academic blood in her veins, it was an unusual step. \"My supervisor said he would never speak to me again. He couldn't believe I could waste myself like this. It was not a very popular move.\"</p><p>But it has paid off.</p><p>At Intel, Bell led a team of engineers, designers and social scientists studying how humans interact with machines. Her stint at the chipmaker encompassed a period during which the internet (and the machines we use to access it) became the dominant forces in society and commerce.</p><p>\"I watched the internet grow up and I watched device categories that didn't exist take off. I am sometimes stunned that I got to witness that,\" she says. And with artificial intelligence, we may be on the brink of another period like that.</p><p>\"I think we are at the beginning of the next one of those [eras],\" she says. \"The capture, curation and circulation and sense-making of data is the next stage of tech. It's not about the stuff any more, it's about making the stuff do things.\"</p><p>At Intel, Bell also was a champion of diversity and equality in the workplace. Despite being a progressive place with a comparatively progressive culture (Bell got the job at Intel despite declaring she was a radical feminist and unreconstructed neo-Marxist), there are still deeply troubling aspects of Silicon Valley culture which is becoming mainstream business culture.</p><p>\"Did I experience sexism? Oh, God yes,\" she says. \"I was routinely the only woman in the room. And there were moments when people did look at me and go, 'You have a PhD? And yet you are a girl?' \"</p><p>But worryingly, Bell thinks that, in some ways, the culture problems in big tech companies have deteriorated. You only need to look at a company like Uber for proof.</p><p>\"There was a hyper-masculinity in Silicon Valley that over the past 20 years has increased, not decreased,\" she says.</p><p>This might be partially explained by the reality that while Silicon Valley was once the rebel child of corporate America, it is now the establishment. \"Money followed, and power followed, and some of those same people who wanted to change the world wanted to run it,\" she explains.</p><p>There is also a tone deafness in the technology industry about the role the industry is playing in job displacement and under-employment, a factor which arguably helped fuel the rise of Trumpism.</p><p>\"I think it's sometimes really easy to forget the rest of the world exists,\" says Bell. \"Silicon Valley is so compelling, and so runs on its own logic. It's so easy to be seduced by it. People are so full of energy and ideas and conversations, and it's really easy to think that's 'the world'.\"</p><p>In comments that will resonate with anyone who has had much exposure to the technology industry, she says: \"One of the challenges is, how do you run a critique of [Silicon Valley] without sounding like you are anti-progress? How do you run a critique of that without sounding like you dislike innovation?\"</p><p>Bell, a technologist after all, does not share the dystopian fears being espoused by many about the rising power of technology, and the firms that own and operate it.</p><p>Humans have been through this before, she says, pointing to the examples of electricity and television. There was similar angst about the latter's impact on society, and not even very long ago.</p><p>\"Was it going to make us into Americans? Is it good for our kids? That technology is 70 years old and we are still bedding it down inside our culture. We still rearrange our furniture around screens.

The good thing is that the industry has learned how to harness its power and use the platform effectively in newsrooms and advertising departments. Digital can be a powerful tool (when used right), but on the other hand, digital can be our worst own enemy. We've seen sales numbers decline, readers jump ship and misinformation spread like wildfire, thanks to digital. Despite this, news publishers should always be prepared.</p><p>No one can predict where digital will take us in 2020, but we compiled a list of trends to watch in this new year. From rules and regulation to the rise of fact-checking and artificial intelligence, digital will undoubtedly disrupt us as it has before, but the time has come for us to turn the tables.</p><p>(1)</p><p>Data Regulation Across the U.S.</p><p>At the start of this year, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) went into effect. As explained by CNET, the law gives California residents the right to know what kind of data companies have collected about them, the right to ask they not sell their data and the right to request their data be deleted. This data can include any source such as the internet or even paper forms.</p><p>According to Fortune magazine, there are several big companies, such as Microsoft, that are voluntarily complying in all 50 states to create goodwill, and even some smaller companies, like Boston-based internet service provider Starry. Aside from goodwill, it makes sense to provide these services to all 50 states as several are already following California's lead.</p><p>CNET reported that Nevada recently passed its own privacy law which went into effect in October, however, it only applies to data collected from consumers through the internet. Maine passed its own law in June, which requires internet providers in the state get customers permission before selling or sharing data with a third party. In addition, Washington considered a law last year although it was not passed. CNET suggests the bill could be reintroduced this year.</p><p>An impact assessment prepared for the California Department of Justice estimates that the CCPA could cost companies with 20 employees $50,000 in initial costs to comply with the law. A larger company with more than 500 employees could incur, on average, an initial cost of $2 million.</p><p>At this rate, companies might be willing to allow other states the same rights as Californians before they pass their own laws with new rules and regulations.</p><p>(2)</p><p>The Move to First-Party Cookies</p><p>With the recent rise of anti-tracking features (browsers, extensions, policies, etc.) from the likes of Apple, Mozilla and Google, as well as new regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the CCPA, publishers are increasingly making the switch from the third-party cookie to the first-party cookie.</p><p>News Corp, the Washington Post and Insider Inc. are a few of the publishers Digiday recently reported that are attempting to make the switch as they can no longer rely on the third-party cookie.</p><p>News Corp (parent company of the Wall Street Journal, and the Times and Sun in the U.K.) developed a news ID for individual readers so that they can be identified without third-party cookies--the feature tracks readers across its multiple sites.</p><p>Similarly, Insider Inc. developed reader IDs, which isn't personally identifiable but can provide insight into \"reader behaviors, interests and intents, in order to create effective targeting segments for marketers.\"</p><p>The Post developed Zeus Insights, a first-party ad targeting tool that offers contextual targeting capabilities along with user-intent predictions for marketers, according to Digiday.</p><p>As consumers continue to demand rights over their data, we should see more publishers and companies alike rely on first-party cookies.</p><p>(3)</p><p>The Tech Battle Against Misinformation Will Continue</p><p>As we enter 2020, the coverage of the U.S presidential election will certainly ramp up.</p><p>So will the spread of misinformation on social media.</p><p>\"It's likely that there will be a high volume of misinformation and disinformation pegged to the 2020 election, with the majority of it being generated right here in the United States, as opposed to coming from overseas,\" Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, told Politico.</p><p>In its report, Politico makes a valid point: Policing domestic content is tricky. Social media is a readily available tool for Americans to use to partake in their democracy and their posts won't \"leave obvious markers such as ads written in broken English.\" The organization also points out that bad actors are learning. For example, they can now better avoid automatic detection despite big tech pouring money into resources to dismantle fake accounts.</p><p>To make matters worse, social media has also struggled with how to handle political campaigns. We've seen Twitter ban political campaigns, Facebook openly say they will not fact-check them and Google restrict how the campaigns can target users online.</p><p>It's also important to point out that should artificial intelligence (AI) be democratized as so many 2020 predictions foresee, this will pose another hurdle for social media.</p><p>According to the Verge, research conducted by scientists from Stanford University, the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Princeton University and Adobe Research proved deepfakes are becoming easier every day. Imagine the kind of deepfakes that could be created with technology like Google Duplex, which uses realistic synthetic speech to make automated calls to restaurants or stores, or Adobe's VoCo software that lets users edit recordings of speech as easily as Photoshopping a picture.</p><p>While these technologies aren't yet perfected--or in Adobe's case--released to the public, in a prediction piece for Enterprise Project, Max Lytvyn, head of revenue and cofounder of Grammarly, said, \"More and more advanced technologies are available with little to no overhead cost or time commitment and algorithms can be effective with progressively smaller data sets. This trend democratizes AI innovation and also enables smaller and more niche AI tools to be created.\"</p><p>(4)</p><p>Human Curation Over Algorithms</p><p>As 2019 ended, tech companies and media groups set out to rely less on algorithms and more on human curation to shine a light on original, professional journalism.</p><p>Facebook, one of media's biggest disruptors, announced last summer it would launch a News Tab, a new section inside its mobile application that would utilize journalists to curate the day's top stories although most other stories would still be algorithmically sorted and ranked.</p><p>While Facebook's News Tab feature just launched in October, Apple, on the other hand, has been using this same approach since 2015 when it replaced its Newsstand with News, a free app that matches users with their preferred publications and allows them to curate feeds they enjoy. According to the New York Times, the announcement attracted little fanfare when it launched, but shortly after, Apple announced that humans would start selecting the app's top stories.</p><p>This could be a step in the right direction as human curators may reduce the amount of misinformation that spreads online. In the Times article, Lauren Kern, Apple News' editor-in-chief, explained that she values \"accuracy over speed\" which has moved the platform away from spreading stories filled with false claims several times.</p><p>Even Google has taken professional journalism into account by making changes to their search rater guidelines to help original reporting surface more prominently in their search engines and ensure it stays in search results longer.</p><p>While none of these companies have totally steered away from algorithms, this shift seems to be better for everyone involved.</p><p>Users see more trusted, original reports, and as a result, these stories get more traffic. In addition, Big Tech could help stop the spread of misinformation and disinformation that they have come under fire. If this formula succeeds, it will be interesting to watch how human curation is either incorporated into these companies, and whether or not there will be a ripple effect that will reach news publishers.</p><p>(5)</p><p>As Big Tech Struggles, Digital Advertising May Fall</p><p>Due to data privacy concerns and regulation laws, Big Tech may suffer a setback in advertising sales.</p><p>Last year it became clear that confidence in Big Tech was plummeting quickly. For example Pew Research Center released a study in June that showed only 50 percent of Americans thought tech companies had a positive impact on the country, down 21 percent from 2015 when 71 percent held this view.</p><p>Thus, online users might be more inclined to utilize their new rights via the GDPR and the CCPA (see point number one). If enough users make this request, targeted ads would be less effective, which could lead to this setback for big tech.</p><p>In addition, eMarketer discusses how internet users are concerned about how Facebook uses their data which leads the company to expect usage of the social network to decrease in 2020. Facebook expects usage to go down from 38 minutes daily in 2019 to 37 minutes in 2020. Losing a minute may not seem like a big difference, but when time spent is currency, those sixty seconds will end up being costly.</p><p>One advertiser, Brandon Rhoten, CMO of Potbelly Sandwich Works, told eMarketer, \"We're there to reach and hopefully influence consumers in a positive way. So, if we see a demographic shift occur in the platform, if we see reach change, if we see efficiencies shift, those are things that give us direct pause to say 'Hey, we're not so sure about this as the primary mechanism of advertising.'\"</p><p>If other advertisers share the same thoughts as Rhoten, then digital advertising is in trouble.</p><p>It's not just Facebook. Recently, major changes to YouTube went into effect that may impact the platform's advertising revenue. The Verge reported that due to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over the alleged violations of the Children's Online Privacy Act, targeted ads will now be restricted from running on children's videos.</p><p>In addition, the Washington Post reported the Justice Department had taken interest in opening a federal antitrust investigation into Google. In September, news came that half of the nation's state attorneys general were also readying an investigation to identify potential antitrust violations.</p><p>(6)</p><p>AI Investment Will Grow ... but For How Long?</p><p>A new report by Charlie Beckett, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science \"New Powers, New Responsibilities: A Global Survey of Journalism and Artificial Intelligence,\" revealed that many of the newsrooms they spoke with are already Al-active.</p><p>The report, based on 71 news organizations from 32 different countries, said nearly half of the respondents were already using AI. Examples include robot journalism, personalization of newsfeeds, predictive analytics, speech-to-text services, photo tagging and even spell check.</p><p>At the New York Times, Project Feels uses reader insights and machine learning to determine what its articles make readers feel. Last year, Guardian Australia announced the publication of their first automated news story as well, utilizing an automated system called ReporterMate. The Associated Press was an early adopter of AI. In 2014, the news organization partnered with Automated Insights, a technology company that specializes in natural language generation software, to begin automating quarterly earnings reports and generating minor league and college game stories.</p><p>The biggest challenges cited for adopting AI are lack of resources, knowledge or skills, and the fear of human workers losing jobs to AI. But respondents in the Beckett's report claim that AI will create labor as well as reduce it.</p><p>The \"Future of Work Survey Report\" (a survey of 1,500 employed adult Americans) by Sykes showed that 67 percent of Americans think of tools, machines or software that could assist them with tasks and make their job more efficient when they hear the words \"automation technologies\" or \"robots.\"</p><p>The idea of AI as a useful resource is becoming more accepted in workplaces as leaders invest in resources and training for their employees. When asked if their employer was providing training and/or resources to help keep up with changes in technology, 44 percent answered \"Yes, some\" and 13 percent answered 'Yes, a lot.\"</p><p>With this growing acceptance, expect more players to enter the AI game, but in the end, will the human touch win out?</p><p>Caption: Social media will continue to struggle with stopping misinformation from spreading.</p><p>Caption: Expect to see more more media companies steer away from algorithms and use more human curation instead.</p><p>Caption: YouTube will be now restricted on running targeted ads on children's videos due to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Please Note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright restrictions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-616167788</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 616167788</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBY-9V11-JCBJ-K3GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2170\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Duncan McIntosh Company, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Editor &amp;

Feucht hails from Redding and the megachurch, Bethel Church.</p><p>His services are held on beaches and rooftops, under bridges and in other open spaces and feature music, testimony and even some baptisms. </p><p>The tour has been the subject of some controversy, after videos from services from around California and the Pacific Northwest showed crowds of people gathering close together without masks or social distancing.</p><p>On July 30, Feucht went on Fox &amp; Friends to talk about his \"Let Us Worship\" movement, saying he felt there was a double standard unfairly targeting churches. </p><p>\"That there's a target on churches while we are seeing across America, thousands of people gather in protest in the streets ... and our cities are burning -- yet we're not allowed to gather and worship and sing,\" he said. \"It's pretty outrageous.\"</p><p>As of Thursday, more than 11,000 people have a signed a petition by Feucht to \"rise up with one voice and tell our government leaders and the rulers of big tech that we refuse to be silenced.\"</p><p>'For those who want to gather for prayer and praise'</p><p>The Pismo Beach rally is not organized by Feucht himself. </p><p>One of the local organizers, Pastor Ralph Hernandez of BStronglife Inc., told The Tribune on Thursday that the event is \"simply for those who want to to gather for prayer and praise.\" </p><p>(BStronglife is an organization aimed at establishing Christian clubs on high school campuses. According to its website, the organization began at Nipomo High School in 2016.)</p><p>\"We know the power of prayer and praise,\" Hernandez said. \"From personal experience and from great examples from the Bible, we know prayer can shift a city, county, state or nation from great turmoil to a land of stability and peace. </p><p>\"It's not a time for us to remain silent, but for the church to recognize the critical nature of our times,\" he added.</p><p>A request for comment from Feucht on why Pismo Beach was chosen as a stop was directed back to Hernandez. </p><p>In a Facebook Live interview with Pastor Sam Maganag of Liberty Church in Fairfield on Aug. 18, Feucht said he was \"so, so excited\" to be stopping in Pismo Beach.</p><p>\"We can hardly wait to be with you on the beach in that beautiful, beautiful region of California,\" he said. \"Specifically in California, we're in a crisis of the soul. Not only is the church scattered because of the pandemic, and not only do we have crazy government regulations that are bearing down upon us, but because the church hasn't been meeting, the spiritual well-being of the nation is really shaken up right now.\"</p><p>Masks, social distancing encouraged</p><p>It is unclear how many people will attend Friday's rally. Hernandez on Thursday said organizers don't know how many people to expect. </p><p>\"It has been a grassroots effort getting the word out, and it's mostly by word of mouth and some social media,\" he said. </p><p>Pismo Beach Communications Director Jorge Garcia told The Tribune on Thursday the rally does not require a special event permit because it is a protest. </p><p>\"The city is aware of the protest and have been in contact with some of the individuals,\" he said. Garcia said there are no road closures anticipated in relation to the event. </p><p>Those who do attend are encouraged to wear masks and social distance, Hernandez said. </p><p>He added that he thinks some especially will choose to wear masks considering the poor air quality in the area due to the California wildfires. </p><p>\"That may be what most will prefer if they venture outside,\" he said.</p><p>Hernandez did not respond to further requests for comment on whether organizers were worried about recommendations for people to stay inside because of the smoke.</p><p>After his stop in Pismo Beach, Feucht is next scheduled to make an appearance in Los Angeles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLOTRB-09336928c0ce4cf0b340d8ad64568d9d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLOTRB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MY-JTS1-DYJM-M3TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247838</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The San Luis Obispo Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Luis Obispo Tribune (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11085\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp;

These proposals called for independent regulation of social networks with potential criminal sanctions if tech directors fail to keep children safe on their platforms.</p><p>However a full response is now not expected until the end of the year with concerns there may not be a regulator until 2023.</p><p>NSPCC bosses are asking for new timescales for a Bill to go through Parliament urgently.</p><p>Mr Wanless spoke to Boris Johnson at a hidden harms round table back in May.</p><p>He highlighted how coronavirus had created a perfect storm for abusers because platforms hadn't done enough to tackle safety risks going into the crisis.</p><p>He urged the Prime Minister to ensure there is no unnecessary delay to legislation.</p><p>\"The Prime Minister signalled to me his determination to stand up to Silicon Valley and make the UK the world leader in online safety,\" he says.</p><p>\"He can do this by committing to an Online Harms Bill that puts a legal Duty of Care on big tech to proactively identify and manage safety risks.</p><p>\"Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.\"</p><p>The government said it intends to publish a full government response to the consultation later this year.</p><p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says it intends to establish in law a new duty of care on companies towards their users, overseen by an independent regulator to ensure companies have \"appropriate systems and processes\" in place to deal with harmful content.</p><p>A spokesperson said: \"We are developing our world-leading plans to put a duty of care on online platforms towards their users and will introduce legislation as soon as possible.\"</p><p>A Facebook company spokesperson said: \"There is no place for grooming or child exploitation on our platforms and we use technology to proactively find and quickly remove it.

The reason behind the progressive's begging is the Christchurch attack, in which a white supremacist madman killed several dozens of people in a mosque. The progressive's genuine motivation arising from sadness would be believable only if the massacre of Christians happening daily got even half of the attention from the progressive masters of the universe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today we look at the world through bad lenses. We want to prevent the threats of the 21st century from happening by applying the logic of the 20th century. The lesson of the 20th century is that people's freedom must primarily be safeguarded against the states, since they tend to take it from them. In the 21st century, however, gigantic private companies jeopardize people's freedom. And it seems, in the absence of other means, nation-states must protect freedom -- whether from globalist bureaucracy or large tech companies exercising extensive censorship.</p><p>The initial hope of tech utopia was directed to web 2.0 ensuring that each person had equal access to the public. Everyone could express his or her opinion freely, and they would not be arbitrarily limited by institutions or people with power. The idea of a global village was accompanied by the vision of a global discourse -- a discourse that takes place on the World Wide Web in a peaceful and rational manner. According to the initial hope, web 2.0 would have been a 21st century agora [central public space] where everyone could express his or her opinion freely and without constraints.</p><p>As in many other cases, the end result of the utopia does not match the initial expectations. The masters of the new kind of media did not know how to handle free speech in practice, just like for the politicians of the globalist elite the will of voters present the biggest obstacle to reaching their goals.</p><p>The world of netizens (net citizens) was celebrated while Barack Obama was the poster child of the new kind of media; however, it changed when Donald Trump, who used social media very shrewdly, was elected President, and when the Brexit campaign won with the use of social media. They had to abandon the concept of free, open social media without restrictions in order to lead \"the prejudiced, reactionary\" users (the \"dumb masses\" of democracy) back in the correct, progressive direction - or if this were impossible, exclude its dubious members from modern publicity.</p><p>After Brexit and the election of President Trump, the progressive political orthodoxy that makes up the tech elite faced the same problem that progressive politics always does: If they let people speak and think freely, they may not support their political goals. Therefore, they decided to reeducate people and continue to build a brighter future with these reeducated people who follow the politically correct religion. The key issues for the progressive political orthodoxy are the issues that are currently in the limelight of international politics. In their view migrants, the representatives of different kinds of \"genders of society\" (gender), ethnic minorities, and non-Christian religious minorities are groups exempt from any criticism that must be protected. Consequently, they started to introduce measures that promote the objectives of identity politics for these groups and also aim to silence their critics.</p><p>Global tech giants represent a problem for sovereignty as well. These are cloud-based services versus ground regulations of nation states on the [physical] ground. Big tech companies do not have a home country; they are at home everywhere and nowhere. They slip through the hands of traditional laws and regulations. The big tech companies pose a serious challenge for nation-state sovereignty. What is more: their very existence questions the rationality of this sovereignty. Can national sovereignty exist at all if social media, which is one of the biggest influences in our lives, is exempt from the jurisdiction of national regulation?</p><p>A global -- globalist -- unaccountable, irresponsible elite has been created, which influences the thinking of billions of people every minute. It is not accountable to anyone, especially not to the people, the citizens, or nation-states.</p><p>Facebook and others alike are not harmless actors for other reasons as well. It must be clear: Facebook lives off selling its users' data to others. And if we have learned anything from the series of scandals it is that data -- especially personal data -- is probably the most valuable currency these days. The possible interpretation rightfully arises that through web 2.0, politics was (and with it, the political activism of citizens) turned into goods. Through social media, the market turned political publicity into a service, political opinion and public discourse into goods.</p><p>Facebook and the global tech giants do not consider the laws of nation-states applicable to them. In Hungary, the freedom of expression is under constitutional protection, and yet, Facebook violates it every day. Nation-states must therefore act. We are not alone with this problem: Due to the totalitarian practice of political correctness flooding university campuses in the U.S., President Donald Trump recently had to enforce the First Amendment -- the right for freedom of speech -- by [executive] order.</p><p>It is absolutely clear that Facebook and the social media giants are political actors; they fight for political goals, and use political logic in their actions. They represent a progressive orthodoxy which persecutes heretics, and the truth that only heretics profess, especially about their favorite issues -- immigration, Islamism, nations, gender and LGBTQ lobbies. Comprehensive political censorship increasingly narrows the range of usable words and topics that can be discussed.</p><p>The question arises -- what tools does a nation-state possess to stand up against the practice of media giants, which violate the constitutional rights of citizens.</p><p>The recommendations of the Szazadveg Foundation [Szazadveg Alapitvany, independent think-tank] are the following:</p><p>They classify social media as traditional mass media, and regulate it the same way as other content providers.</p><p>They take antitrust measures; they split the monopoly provider, in other words, they pass its ownership to smaller shareholders.</p><p>They extend the territorial jurisdiction and constitutional regulations of the nation-state to social media activities.</p><p>They apply harder legal tools against self-proclaimed censors imposing external constrains on the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression.</p><p>The Facebook censorship is the newest project of progressive totalitarianism. The censorship of social sites is morally unjustifiable, since it tramples the principle of freedom of speech under foot; it is politically dangerous because it denies the legitimacy of rules and regulations, which are based on national sovereignty. In addition, it prevents us from finding out the truth, as it places a ban on its full presentation. Truth, freedom, and sovereignty: Presently these principles are the thorns in the side of the leftist, technology-led, progressive, beautiful new world.</p><p>Source: Magyar Nemzet in Hungarian 11 Apr 19</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCMIR-APR3019FST5509</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCMIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3N-7Y11-DYRV-3305-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10962</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1256\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 British Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BBC Monitoring Europe - Political <br/>Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30259\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Voices along the whole of the political spectrum are calling for heightened scrutiny of American information-technology companies, especially the Big Five of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. One may perhaps discount attacks on the tech giants from within the populist Trump administration (Meyer 2017), but even the once reliably free-market Economist recently published an editorial (May 6, 2017) calling stridently if vaguely for a rethink of antitrust in the digital age. Unsurprisingly, the drumbeat for regulation is loudest on the left, where a \"new structuralist\" paradigm is catching attention. Yet scholars such as Bill Kristol and Bill Galston, who advertise themselves as defining the centrist position, articulate a vision that is indistinguishable from that of the new structuralists (New Center n.d.).</p><p>One of the principal themes of this uprising is that present-day antitrust policy, forged in the rusty era of steel, oil, and cars, is now obsolete. We are in the age of information, which ipso facto calls for new rules. A second animating theme is that the antitrust thinking of the Chicago School, which came to prominence in the last quarter of the past century, must be completely overthrown. Led by Robert Bork (1978), Richard Posner (1976,1979), and others, the Chicago School insisted that antitrust be grounded in economic theory, which privileges the well-being of consumers as much as that of producers and which points antitrust in the first instance toward problems involving the restriction of output and the raising of prices above cost. Chicago doctrine must be discarded because it creates a problem of elephant-in-the-room proportions for proponents of antitech antitrust, whom it forces to explain why consumers (or indeed society more broadly) are being harmed by an incomprehensibly magical information source offered at a price of zero; by cheap and swift access to virtually all the products of humanity at the touch of a finger; by elegant devices that concentrate in the palm of the hand abilities undreamed of even in science fiction; and in general by quality-adjusted prices that continue to plunge through the floor.</p><p>As is characteristic of Romantic endeavors, proponents of the new antitrust attempt to elude the elephant by returning to an earlier and simpler time-in this case to the historical roots of American antitrust policy. My contention, however, is that the new structuralism gets this history wrong. it both misconceives the nature of the competitive process and deliberately refuses to confront the political economy of antitrust. in so doing, it adopts some of the worst traits of the Chicago School it criticizes while manifesting few of that school's many virtues.</p><p>To focus the discussion, I consider the most significant scholarly articulation of the new structuralism, a much-cited article by Lina M. Khan in the Tale Law Journal called \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\" (2017). This is the urtext of hipster antitrust. Khan makes essentially three large claims: (1) Chicago antitrust is misguided because it flies in the face of the clear legislative intent and precedent of American antitrust, which never wanted its criterion to be the maximization of social surplus but instead sought to promote other \"values,\" such as the insulation of existing competitors from pecuniary harms and the creation of a competitive environment in which \"power\" is decentralized for its own sake irrespective of economic efficiency. (2) Even on its own terms, Chicago fails because its indulgent attitude toward low prices and benefits to consumers blinds it to the inefficiency of predatory pricing. (3) The world would be a better place if antitrust policy returned to the values American law once supposedly embodied. This might involve, inter alia, making predatory (or even low) pricing per se illegal, scrutinizing vertical integration much more carefully, and even regulating large firms as common carriers or natural monopolies whenever any aspect of their business might be considered an \"essential facility.\"</p><p>The History of Antitrust</p><p>In his influential book The Antitrust Paradox (1978), Bork argued that the legislative intent and precedential history of American antitrust law supports the economist's view that competitive behavior should be defined as economic efficiency, and he cited chapter and verse (56-66). By contrast, Khan asserts that \"Congress passed antitrust laws to safeguard against excessive concentrations of private power. It recognized, in turn, that this vision would protect a host of interests, which the sole focus on 'consumer welfare' disregards\" (2017, 744). As both Bork and Khan are lawyers (Bork died in 2012), this is to be expected. One chooses and frames the precedents to make one's case. But the imperatives of the economic historian are rather different. And what history suggests is that both are right. Legislators and judges typically claimed that \"trusts\"-few were actually trusts in the technical sense-harmed society both by charging high prices and by driving out smaller, less-efficient competitors. Very often these contradictory sentiments would be expressed in the same speech or opinion. The reason is easy to see: there was in fact no single, or indeed perhaps any, coherent vision behind American antitrust policy. That policy resulted from the more or less haphazard intersection of the forces of political economy in nineteenth-century America.1</p><p>As Harold Demsetz (1974) has argued, there are fundamentally two theories of monopoly: the interventionism theory and the spontaneous-monopoly theory. In the first account, monopoly is always the creature of the state because only legally enforced property rights (like patents or taxi medallions) represent meaningful barriers to entry, especially in the medium and long run (Demsetz 1982). In the second account, the competitive system somehow naturally generates endogenous monopolies, which a wise and disinterested government must seek out and destroy.2 Eighteenth-century figures such as Adam Smith and James Madison thought of monopolies only in the first sense, even though their words are often trotted out against supposed monopolies in the second sense. The theory of spontaneous monopoly was effectively created along with American antitrust policy in the late nineteenth century.</p><p>At the state level, the united States after the American Revolution was highly regulated in ways that protected incumbent interests (Hughes 1977). Because of high transportation and transaction costs and to some extent because of the U.S. Constitution, the federal space was, however, far less regulated. With the coming of canals, the railroads, and the telegraph, an altered economic geography began knitting the country together economically, drastically changing the federal political economy.</p><p>Railroads were the first flashpoint. Because railroads were high-fixed-cost industries, they could not cover their total costs if they priced at marginal cost. There were two solutions to this problem: collusion to raise rates above marginal cost and price discrimination. As it always does without government support, collusion failed.3 But although there was intense competition on trunk lines whenever there were alternative routes to ship long distances, many localities were served by only one road, and the railroads could thus raise short-haul rates on routes with few alternatives.4 Since the railroads had become essential to the livelihoods of vast numbers of farmers and producers of raw materials, however, the pricing policies of the roads carried significant distributional implications (Higgs 1970). Both sides wanted the federal government to intervene: the roads wanted help in policing cartels, and the shippers wanted to prevent both cartels and rate discrimination. The legislative collision of a railroad-oriented Senate bill with a shipper-oriented House bill resulted in the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887, a train wreck that pleased no one.5</p><p>The political economy of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was similar to, if perhaps more complex than, what lay behind the interstate Commerce Act. The new economic geography of the country had encouraged the emergence of large concerns in manufacturing and distribution, which could produce centrally at large scale and ship their wares to the periphery (Chandler 1977). These firms began creatively to destroy the small producers and distributors that had been built up around the older network of canals (Benson 1955;Miller 1971). They also began to worry farmers and producers of raw materials in the countryside, who added \"concentrations of power\" to the long list of vague populist concerns that already included immigrants and Wall Street. The concerns in some cases were not entirely without a foundation in narrow interests. Traders and industrialists, mostly in the Northeast, had long favored high protective tariffs and a gold standard to encourage foreign investment, and the post-Civil War weakness of the Democratic South allowed the Republican Party largely free rein on these issues. By contrast, farmers and shippers in the South and Midwest opposed tariffs and wanted a depreciated currency to help them sell their output abroad (Frieden 1997).6</p><p>Representing what was then as now a swing state, ohio senator John Sherman understood that he had to assuage populist concerns if he was going to negotiate both the Republican agenda and his reelection. Populists were already agitating for inflation under the banner of silver, and they saw tariffs as raising the prices of their inputs in significant part because they encouraged monopoly. That tariffs caused monopoly was a plank in the Democratic platform of 1888. (Take note here that populists were concerned both with harms to small businesses and with higher prices.) Sherman's deft strategy was that, rather than give the populists what would have really benefited them-free silver and lower tariffs-he would instead blame the trusts for the higher prices they were paying. He would give them an antitrust bill.7 Then as now, antitrust offered symbolic reassurance to a diffuse constituency fearful of developments they didn't understand and couldn't control (Edelman 1964; Letwin 1965, 86-88). But there were also more concrete interests at play: independent businesses harmed by more-efficient large competitors. Typical of these independent businesses were small refiners threatened by Standard Oil's policy of translating refining and shipping efficiencies into lower prices and local slaughterhouses that had to compete with the highly efficient new system of refrigerated dressed meat (Libecap 1992; Troesken 2002).8</p><p>The Sherman Act forbade contracts, combinations, or conspiracies \"in restraint of trade or commerce\" as well as the \"monopolization\" or attempt to monopolize trade or commerce.9 The phrase \"restraint of trade\" came from the common law, where it had referred in no way to monopoly, as monopoly had been ubiquitous and unquestioned in medieval and early-modern times (Letwin 1954).10 The phrase also had little to do with cartels but applied primarily to what we would now think of as noncompete clauses: for example, a shopkeeper who sells his store might agree by contract not to establish another store within a certain distance of the one sold. The terseness of the act and the strange linkage of the phrase \"restraint of trade\" with monopoly would create an enduring legacy of interpretive complications. Because enforcing the act had never been the point, no one had given any thought to details and mechanisms of enforcement, and so Sherman became an empty vessel that future administrations could fill in their own way. The law of unintended consequences began to apply almost immediately. Because the Supreme Court originally ruled that manufacturing didn't count as \"trade or commerce\" (McCurdy 1979), Sherman was at first directed not at large firms but mostly at interstate cartels among small producers (and, of course, against labor unions), which created an incentive for the small producers to abandon their separate identities and merge into larger firms (Bittlingmayer 1985).</p><p>One of the reasons populists had been so restive in the late nineteenth century is that they were living through a period of mild deflation as productivity growth outstripped the growth of the money supply. As the turn of the century approached, however, new finds of gold and improved techniques for processing gold ore initiated a period of inflation, the largest since the Civil War (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, 135). Whereas (unanticipated) deflation had transferred resources from indebted farmers to eastern lenders, inflation began transferring resources away from those lenders. Complaints about the cost of living began to pile up, and, as would happen periodically throughout the century, \"trusts\" took the blame (Aldrich 2013). At the same time, independent middle-class businesses were coming under further pressure from the large, efficient, nationwide firms in manufacturing and distribution. increasingly, these small-business owners looked to government to defend them against economic change, and they adopted the amorphous antimonopoly sentiment of the populists. \"In general,\" writes Robert Wiebe, \"businessmen below the level of magnates subscribed to some variant of the theory that 'the growing power and influence of trusts' destroyed honest enterprise and stunted 'the hope and ambition of the youth of the country.' They shared, in other words, the widespread, ill-defined antimonopoly sentiments of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. But like 'Wall Street,' the term 'trust' was a rubbery one, covering whatever economic forces worried a particular businessman at a particular time\" (1962, 13).</p><p>Unlike the populists, who wished to break up large firms for the sake of smallness not efficiency, Progressive intellectuals such as Herbert Croly (1909) embraced both the inevitability and the desirability of large size, which, they held, could be turned to advantage by planning and scientific management. When fate ushered Teddy Roosevelt into the presidency in 1901, they found their champion. Roosevelt famously believed he could distinguish between good trusts and bad trusts, offering gentlemen's agreements to the former and prosecuting the latter.11 The president wanted to formalize this idea of gentlemen's agreements-to replace judicial antitrust with an executive agency that would supervise business and dictate behavior to them (Sklar 1988, chap. 4). Many business executives appreciated this idea, which they saw as creating a far more predictable world than that of Sherman jurisprudence. A star-studded centrist group called the National Civic Federation began drawing up legislation. But Roosevelt had his own ideas. He commandeered the drafting process and produced a bill that managed to alienate labor, small business, and big business all at the same time. The idea of a commission went down to defeat; and when William Howard Taft supplanted Roosevelt as president, the Sherman Act would emerge energized from its near-death experience: the Taft administration would launch more Sherman suits by far than any administration until the New Deal (Posner 1970).</p><p>Yet when Woodrow Wilson became president in 1913, all the issues remained on the table. Despite the effort of left-revisionist scholars to homogenize Roosevelt and Wilson into \"corporate liberals,\" Wilson was in fact the polar opposite of Roosevelt (Seltzer 1977). Like his principal adviser on antitrust, Louis D. Brandeis, he believed in preserving a system of small independent businesses. For both men, this was not an economic issue but a moral one: both saw the economic agent primarily as a moral agent and feared the moral costs of large-scale capitalism (Seltzer 1977, 190; Urofsky 2009, 342-43). Perhaps unsurprisingly, Brandeis is an explicit influence on the new structuralism.</p><p>At the same time, however, Wilson considered the existing Sherman Act inadequate, especially because of the uncertainty it caused for business. The solution, as he saw it, was to clearly enumerate anticompetitive practices in legislation. \"Surely,\" Wilson told a joint session of Congress on January 20, 1914, \"we are sufficiently familiar with the actual processes and methods of monopoly and of the many hurtful restraints of trade to make definition possible, at any rate up to the limits of what experience has disclosed. These practices, being now abundantly disclosed, can be explicitly and item by item forbidden by statute in such terms as will practically eliminate uncertainty, the law itself and the penalty being made equally plain\" (Wilson 1914). In fact, nothing of the sort was true. Even economists had no understanding of most of the strategies and contractual devices businesses used, nor would they have any until the transaction-cost revolution of the late twentieth century (Williamson 1979). For this reason and many others, there was no way legislation could articulate clear and simple rules. When constituents, including small business, got wind of the actual legislation-what was to become the Clayton Act-they went ballistic, fearing they could be sent to prison for ordinary business contracting (McCraw 1984, 120-21; Urofsky 2009, 289-92).</p><p>Congress responded by removing the criminal sanctions and making the description of \"anticompetitive\" practices vaguer and more qualified. But this meant uncertainty once again. In the January speech, Wilson had also asserted that business was entitled to \"the definite guidance and information which can be supplied by an administrative body, an interstate trade commission\" (Wilson 1914). What he had in mind was purely a \"sunshine commission,\" a clearinghouse for information, not the kind of strong commission Roosevelt had wanted. But if \"unfair\" practices were no longer to be so clearly and unambiguously enumerated, perhaps a more powerful commission was in order, one that could adjudicate as well as collect information, one that could interpret what \"unfair\" meant and give advice. Brandeis had already been thinking along these lines, formulating a bill to create a commission empowered to issue cease-and-desist orders and to give advice to business. It was Brandeis who persuaded Wilson to accept what would become the Federal Trade Commission (Link 1954, 71-72; McCraw 1984, 122-25; Urofsky 2009, 389-95).12</p><p>The pieces ofAmerican antitrust policy had been thrown up in the air, and in 1914 they came to rest in essentially the form they would assume for the next century. Behind this configuration lay no coherent account of competition, let alone of what constituted anticompetitive practices or restraints of trade.</p><p>Predatory Pricing</p><p>The Clayton Act explicitly listed as anticompetitive such practices as price discrimination, tying, and exclusive dealing. in other words, the act sought to outlaw non-standard forms of contracting that seemed puzzling to contemporaries, even economists. As economists later in the century would come to understand, these forms were actually contractual solutions to incentive and transaction-costs problems in arm's-length markets. Thus, on the whole, it was smaller, more vertically specialized firms that were involved in practices like tying and exclusive dealing. Making these practices illegal simply amplified the effect, already built into Sherman's anticartel policy, of encouraging horizontal and vertical integration as a way of effecting the same transactions internally and invisibly. Brandeis understood this perfectly, and he had long objected to the prosecution of cartels among small producers. it bothered him not at all that such cartels meant higher prices for consumers, whom he viewed as \"servile, self-indulgent, indolent, ignorant\" (qtd. in McCraw 1984, 107). For Brandeis, the one true anti-competitive practice was not pricing high but pricing low.</p><p>Precisely because antitrust jurisprudence did indeed embody in part a goal of keeping prices low to consumers, the Sherman Act was used against the practice of resale-price maintenance (RPM), which the Supreme Court outlawed in the Dr. Miles case in 1911.13 RPM binds sellers (explicitly or by threat of refusal to deal) to maintain a price set by the manufacturer. To the courts, and indeed to most casual observers, this is manifestly a \"restraint of trade\" because such contracts restrain sellers from offering discounts, that is, restrain them from competing on price. The Court may perhaps be forgiven for getting this wrong, as it was not until the second half of the century that even economists began to understand the logic of RPM and other vertical arrangements, and prominent contemporary economists, including the likes of Frank Taussig, mostly talked nonsense on the subject (Breit 1991). In a brilliant article in Harper's Weekly, however, Louis D. Brandeis (1913) anticipated all the modern-day arguments in favor of RPM.14 What angered Brandeis about the Court's decision is that it gave advantage to larger, vertically integrated firms, which could replicate the benefits of RPM by owning their own outlets.15</p><p>Brandeis's disdain for low prices went beyond RPM. Like the new structuralists he has influenced, Brandeis warned against \"predatory\" or \"cut-throat\" pricing, which allows large firms to drive smaller ones out of business-and, more crucially, to keep them out. As first pointed out by John S. McGee (1958), this second part is crucial: predatory pricing fails in the absence of barriers to entry because competitors can immediately reenter the market as soon as the would-be predator raises prices. Under the influence of this logic, the courts sensibly evolved a \"recoupment test\" (Khan 2017, 729). Claimants must demonstrate exactly how victims (or other contenders) will be prevented from reentering the market once prices are raised.</p><p>Khan promises to show that the Chicago analysis of predatory pricing (and relatedly of vertical foreclosure) fails even under the lamp of consumer benefit (by which she, like Bork, really means maximizing total social surplus). I expected her to trot out some of the many models that use game theory and related approaches to argue that predation and foreclosure are logically possible in certain abstract formal settings. These are available abundantly, including in the canonical Handbook of Industrial Organization (Ordover and Saloner 1989).16 What we get instead is essentially nothing. The best Khan has to offer is that the Chicago view of predation fails the \"incipiency test\" in antitrust law: it fails to nip monopoly in the bud and instead waits for it to develop (ifit does) (2017, 738).17 But this is not an argument that the economic view is wrong, only an argument that it has yet to penetrate all corners of antitrust. As Demsetz points out, the incipiency test fails \"not only because competition might also be nipped in the bud, but because penalizing monopoly already successful also discourages the attempt to monopolize; any penalizing of monopoly nips monopoly in the bud by reducing the expected profits of monopolization\" (1982, 56).</p><p>To be fair, there is a whiff of truth to Khan's criticism of the Chicago School, or, rather, of the kind of economics that has found its way into many antitrust discussions, both from the original Chicago School itself and from the present-day strategic-behavior theorists. She seems to believe that Chicago price theory ignores \"product quality, variety, and innovation\" (2017, 739). This is untrue. But there is a sense in which paying exclusive attention to price theory distracts attention from the complexities ofeconomics in the real world. The important Chicago revolution after World War II was not that of Bork, Posner, or George Stigler (1968). It was the revolution of Ronald Coase, a name that nowhere appears in Khan's document. Coase derided abstract price theory as \"blackboard economics. \"18 He insisted that economists actually examine the world historically and through case studies, and he stressed above all the importance of seeing economic practices in the light of the costs of information, transaction, and monitoring. Deirdre McCloskey (1997) calls the Coasean variant the \"good old Chicago School.\" It is this Chicago School that unpacked the riddles of nonstandard contracting, long decried as \"anticompetitive,\" in terms of information and transaction costs, and many of those explanations very much involve issues of product quality, variety, and innovation. There is no better example of good-old Chicago reasoning than Louis D. Brandeis's (1913) Harper's article on resale-price maintenance.</p><p>Far from making Khan's case, however, the Coasean approach undoes that case. For one thing, her vague assertions about predatory pricing and vertical restraints are blackboard economics without even the blackboard. There is a more important point. If we are to evaluate market processes as they really are, with the attendant transaction costs and limitations of knowledge, then we are obliged to propose alternatives and to analyze them in exactly the same terms (Demsetz 1969). How exactly do these alternatives work? How do they deal with the inescapable problems of scarcity, transaction costs, and limited knowledge? And what is the political economy of the proposed alternatives: Who will be in charge? How will they come to possess the knowledge necessary to make wise decisions? And who will really benefit? A persuasive analysis must be a comparative-institutional one. An argument that merely criticizes the (alleged) limitations of the market process as we observe it is no argument at all.</p><p>Real Competition</p><p>Of course, Khan's principal objective is not to fix economic analysis but to throw it out. \"Antitrust law and competition policy,\" she writes, \"should promote not welfare but competitive markets\" (2017, 737). To an economist, this is an absolutely astonishing statement. What system of values could possibly induce you to want to sacrifice the welfare of society (properly understood to include all aspects of welfare, not just the supposedly economicsy parts)? How could it be that competition properly understood and effected would not maximize welfare? Her answer is that there exist \"non-economic\" values, including \"our interests as workers, producers, entrepreneurs, and citizens\" (737). These values may trump \"whether consumers are materially better off\" (737). The way to ensure the survival of these values, she maintains, is to keep power artificially decentralized-for its own sake not for the sake of efficiency.19 This is the structure of the new structuralism. To keep the world adequately decentralized and therefore \"competitive,\" we must invoke the strong centripetal power of the state, unexamined in its working details, to forbid low prices and any other behavior that might threaten decentralization.20</p><p>This vision of antitrust is misguided and dangerous. The proper goal of competition policy is very much to enhance the material well-being of members of society, understood to mean far more than the mere elimination of deadweight-loss triangles. And the proper means to this goal is to encourage real competition in its true rivalrous and messy glory, even if doing so threatens sturdy yeomen of romantic fantasy (or their modern-day equivalents). Our \"interests as workers, producers, entrepreneurs, and citizens\" are no doubt as vital as they are vague. But history suggests that those interests will actually be ill served by the attempt to maintain a potted decentralization in place of active rivalry.</p><p>Let me be unambiguous about what I think real competition is. Competition is active rivalry. it is striving. it is experimentation. Real competition, as Joseph Schumpeter famously put it, is the competition of</p><p>the new commodity, the new technology, the new source of supply, the new type of organization (the largest-scale unit of control for instance)- competition which commands a decisive cost or quality advantage and which strikes not at the margins of the profits and the outputs of the existing firms but at their foundations and their very lives. This kind of competition is as much more effective than the other [i.e., price competition] as a bombardment is in comparison with forcing a door, and so much more important that it becomes a matter of comparative indifference whether competition in the ordinary sense functions more or less promptly; the powerful lever that in the long run expands output and brings down prices is in any case made of other stuff. (1950, 84-85)</p><p>The benefit of such competition is very much that it makes consumers (that is to say, people) \"materially better off.\" Big time. As McCloskey has emphasized, it is precisely this kind of evolutionary, experimental competition-which she calls \"trade-tested betterment\" (2016, 93)-that led to the Great Enrichment of the past two and a half centuries, an enrichment, in the case of the United States, of more than 1,700 percent, conservatively estimated, since the founding of the republic (McCloskey 2010, 48).</p><p>I am acquainted with a number of people, themselves having been made more than comfortable by the Great Enrichment, who refuse to shop at Walmart, considering it crass, exploitive ofworkers, and destructive ofthe charming boutiques ofsmall sellers. But i can also testify that when Walmart began experimenting with selling groceries, it came as a godsend to my elderly parents, who had to make due with a tiny retirement income.21 Jerry Hausman and Ephraim Leibtag (2007) calculated that the lower prices and increased variety that came with Walmart's entry into groceries represented the equivalent of a 25 percent decline in food expenditures, an effect that was more pronounced for lower-income shoppers. Would the world have been a better place with a nip-it-in the-bud policy of making predatory pricing illegal per se and of scrutinizing lateral integration more stringently?</p><p>At one point, Khan paints as pernicious the way dynamic competition from Amazon is pressing upon the large traditional book publishers, and she quotes writers who fret that these houses will be forced to concentrate on best sellers and ignore niche authors: \"A market with less choice and diversity for readers amounts to a form of consumer injury\" (2017, 767). This is another absolutely astounding pronouncement. By orders of magnitude, Amazon has done more to create diversity in books, and indeed in all products, than any organization in human history. Erik Brynjolfsson, Yu Hu, and and Duncan Simester (2011) have demonstrated that, far from reducing the prominence of niche works, Amazon has dramatically increased their market share. Overall, they calculated, Amazon enriched consumers (again, people) in the year 2000 by as much as a $1 billion, and increases in variety contributed seven to ten times as much to that enrichment as did lower prices (Brynjolfsson, Yu, and Smith 2003). That was in a single year, seventeen years ago.</p><p>Regulating Platforms and Information</p><p>It is an article of faith in the new antitrust that information-technology companies, especially those that represent platforms, are something wholly new in industrial history and that such firms require some new kind of government regulation. In fact, of course, neither information technology nor platforms are new, and the government has long attempted to regulate them using many of the techniques now proposed (and many others in addition). The results have not been pretty.</p><p>One ofthe most notable platform enterprises ofthe twentieth century was one well known to Brandeis-United Shoe Machinery Corporation. Indeed, United was perhaps the only \"good trust\" in the book of Brandeis, at least during the period when he served on its board of directors. Assembled in the late nineteenth century from a congeries of vertically and laterally specialized shoe-machinery makers and surrounded by a ring of patents, United provided equipment to the highly competitive and fragmented American shoemaking industry. Rather than selling its machines, however, United followed a long-standing practice in similar industries of only leasing machines, which effectively turned its product into a service. United provided not only a flow of machine services but also repair services and, perhaps most importantly, detailed knowledge about how to set up a shoe factory. This approach reduced the capital and technical knowledge required to enter the shoe business, encouraging myriad small firms to take advantage of local knowledge and high-powered incentives. \"The particular ground upon which i based my opinion that the shoe-machinery monopoly operated beneficially,\" said Brandeis, \"was that it appeared to help the small manufacturers and thus, while itself a monopoly, promoted competition in shoe manufacturing\" (qtd. in McCraw 1981, 45).</p><p>By 1911, however, Brandeis had decided that United was as heinous a monopolist as any other.22 The reason? United's contracting practices: \"[a] practice like that of the Shoe Machinery Trust of denying to the individual the right to lease a certain machine unless he will take his other machines from the trust, so that competition is killed; that is, a practice under which he who controls an indispensible [sic] article of commerce uses it to kill competition in other articles is obviously unsocial, and ought to be prohibited\" (testimony in U.S. Senate 1913, 1161). The irony here is that the logic behind United's contracting practices is exactly the same one Brandeis had articulated in making the case for RPM. Because United provided complete industrial-design and layout services to the small shoemakers, the company was vulnerable to free riding: shoemakers could take the services and then go buy cheap knockoff machines (Masten and Snyder 1993, 35). There were a variety of other moral-hazard problems as well, which United dealt with through contractual restrictions of various kinds.</p><p>United survived an early antitrust case on the grounds that it had been composed of vertically and laterally related companies that didn't compete with one another, though some Supreme Court justices questioned the company's nonstandard contracting.23 After World War ii, during the heyday of activist antitrust enforcement in the United States, the Department of Justice would take up the cudgels once again.24 This time the Court chose to go after the structure of the firm's contracts, demanding sale as well as lease of machines, arbitrarily altering the duration of the leases, and forbidding any restrictive provisions.25 The ruling proved disastrous not only for United but also for the American shoe industry, which as a result went into decline well before the era of cheap international imports.</p><p>Amazon too was put together by the accretion of vertically and laterally related businesses. Amazon also provides services and support, notably in its Amazon Marketplace, that allow enormous numbers of small players to flourish.26 Many take advantage of Amazon's own fulfillment services, thus benefiting from the massive discounts Amazon is able to negotiate with shippers such as Federal Express and UPS. Khan is sure there is some evil deviousness at work here (2017, 774-78), but she is at a loss to explain why any of it is anticompetitive. In fact, the vertical and lateral integration of present-day technology companies cuts in exactly the opposite direction she suggests. Unlike the customers of United, who had only one platform to deal with, today's customers have many platforms to choose from, and switching costs are not in fact high. As many authors have pointed out, it is precisely because the Big Five (and friends) have their fingers in many pies that they discipline and push one another: if one slips up, there are others with very similar capabilities ready to step in (Varian 2016; Manjoo 2017). A policy of forbidding vertical and lateral integration (by merger or otherwise) is a great way to create niche markets with less rivalry.</p><p>Another staple of the new antitrust is that in order to preserve the diversity of ideas and ensure access we need to regulate information companies as common carriers or maybe even natural monopolies. This, too, is not new. The federal government has long been regulating information companies in these ways, and the results have been the destruction ofonce vibrant markets, the throttling oftechnological change, and the loss of diversity and access.</p><p>By the end of the nineteenth century, the major patents surrounding the telephone had coalesced in the hands of a succession of Boston-based companies with the name \"Bell\" in them (Mueller 1997; MacDougall 2006). Bell had set up a subsidiary called American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) to create a system oflong-distance connections between exchanges. Bell also gained controlling interest in the Western Electric Company, an important Chicago manufacturer of electrical equipment that had been founded by Elisha Gray. In 1899, AT&amp;T became the parent company of the whole operation to take advantage of New York's more-open incorporation law. Already by 1893 and 1894, however, the principal patents had begun expiring, which unleashed a flurry of competitive entry both of independent operating companies and of companies manufacturing telephone equipment. By 1907, the number of independent telephones in the United States was almost as great as the number of Bell phones.27 This may seem surprising to modern readers accustomed to the notion of network effects.28 But at the beginning of the twentieth century, users were content to connect within their own coteries, and long-distance communication was easily effected by telegraph rather than by telephone. indeed, the independents had little interest in connecting with the Bell System (Mueller 1997). Some of the independents catered to farmers, even sending signals through barbed-wire fence; others were organized as mutuals, that is, as co-ops owned by the users themselves.</p><p>In 1907, the House of Morgan was able to edge out the original Boston interests and install the hard-charging professional manager Theodore Vail as head of AT&amp;T. Vail has become associated with the idea of pushing a unified \"Bell System\" as a competitive strategy, but this had already long been the company's response to competition from the independents (Garnet 1985, 110-27). In fact, Vail set his sights on a quite different response to competition. The first part of his strategy was universal service, which at the time meant not putting a phone in every home but requiring all phones to connect to the same network (Mueller 1997). The second, related part was government regulation by state-level commissions and through the rather ineffectual assignment of interstate telephone regulation to the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Mann-Elkins Act in 1910, which declared telephone systems to be common carriers. Regulation stabilized competition, allowing a well-capitalized AT&amp;T to come to terms and increasingly to merge with the independents, thus creating the regulated-monopoly structure familiar throughout most of the century.</p><p>During the New Deal, AT&amp;T's interstate operations came under the jurisdiction of the newly created Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Officials worried that AT&amp;T was making profits by marking up the equipment that unregulated Western Electric was selling to the regulated entities (it was). When state-level regulatory agencies began complaining about the rate hikes that AT&amp;T's local operating companies were demanding during the postwar inflation, the Justice Department saw the chance to divest Western Electric and break it into competing pieces (Peters 1985; Temin and Galambos 198 7).29 With pressure from the Department of Defense, however, the FCC and the Justice Department instead negotiated a deal that would keep AT&amp;T intact if it changed its accounting practices to allocate more of the joint fixed costs to long-distance service in order to lower charges to the customers of the local operating units.30 This deal forestalled the breakup of the company for almost three decades. in the meanwhile, the Fcc built a force field around \"the system\" to insulate it from disruptive technological change, delaying by decades the introduction of innovations ranging from the innocuous and almost silly Hush-a-Phone to fax machines and modems to cellular telephony (Wu 2010; Hazlett 2017).31</p><p>The resulting monumental inefficiencies, both static and Schumpeterian, eventually made it profitable for the entrepreneur William McGowan of MCI to pour resources first into persuading the Fcc to alter its policies and then into fomenting the breakup of AT&amp;T (Temin and Galambos 1987). McGowan and others recognized that microwave technology, developed for radar during World War ii, could be adapted to transmit information, and line-of-sight microwave towers could provide a system of long-distance telephony alternative to copper wires, especially given the weight of cross-subsidy that AT&amp;T's Long Lines division was bearing. Under a consent decree in January 1982, the Bell System was carved into its vertical components, with the local Bell operating companies gaining independence. Long-distance microwave providers such as MCI and Sprint would be allowed to compete with AT&amp;T Long Lines, and customers and operating units would no longer be required to buy equipment solely from Western Electric. The breakup of the system was performed under the banner ofantitrust, but it was in fact an act ofderegulation.</p><p>The history of broadcasting reveals an even more appalling legacy, one that compounded lost opportunities for innovation with government control of speech. At the end of the nineteenth century, Guglielmo Marconi had demonstrated the possibility of wireless telegraphy using a spark-gap transmitter, and by World War I American Marconi dominated wireless telegraphy in the United States (Langlois 2013). Because this was a military technology, the Navy Department nationalized the company for the duration of the war. The navy wanted badly to keep radio as a state-owned enterprise after the war, but Congress compromised and instigated the creation of a \"national champion\"-Radio Corporation of America (RCA)-that would be owned mostly by General Electric (GE) and would take over the assets of the foreign-owned Marconi. RCA came to a patent cross-licensing agreement with AT&amp;T, GE, and eventually Westinghouse, which partitioned technological spheres of influence. In the early 1920s, however, technological improvements had made it possible to broadcast modulated signals-words and music-not just dots and dashes. After Westinghouse created the first commercial radio station in 1920, the radio-receiver business exploded: over the decade, 60 percent of American homes came to possess radios. This shift favored RCA over its technological partners, and the company moved to consolidate its patent position, which by 1927 courts had made secure. AT&amp;T had withdrawn from broadcasting in 1926, and a consent decree with the Justice Department in 1932 disconnected RCA from the ownership of GE and Westinghouse. The National Broadcasting Company, which had been created originally by AT&amp;T, became the possession of RCA alone.</p><p>Radio in the early twentieth century was dominated by hobbyists, and transmission frequency was a free-for-all. When commercial broadcasting emerged, stations faced the problem of interference from hobbyists and other stations. The radio spectrum was an unowned commons, like your local interstate during rush hour or the George's Bank cod fishery. What was needed was the delineation of property rights. Courts actually took a step in this direction with the Oak Leaves decision in 1926,32 which conceptualized the problem in terms of the common law of nuisance (Hazlett 1990). But it would be more than thirty years before Coase (1959) would clearly explain the logic of creating property rights in spectrum-and a lot longer before he would be taken seriously-and there were powerful political forces at work on the ground (Twight 1998).</p><p>in 1912, Congress had empowered the secretary of commerce to grant broadcasting licenses, though without any ability to condition those licenses, let alone refuse to grant them. When he became commerce secretary during the growth period of radio stations, Herbert Hoover tried to ignore these restrictions until a court decision forced his hand.33 In the wake of the resulting chaos (planned or unplanned), Congress in 1927 created the Federal Radio Commission (soon to become the FCC) to hand out channels through administrative proceedings. Radio was to be regulated as a public utility, and licenses were to be granted in light of \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" as defined by the commission. This regulation misallocated resources into lobbying and persuading the FCC, a process that favored the large incumbents, notably RCA; prevented the market from moving resources from less- to more-valuable uses; and encouraged favoritism and corruption.34 In flagrant contravention of the First Amendment, it also gave the FCC the power to control the content of broadcasting, which the FCC restricted to wholesome, mainstream, nondissident fare. The FCC's technological force field quickly surrounded broadcasting as well, resulting in, among other things, decades-long delays in the adoption of FM radio, cable television, and satellite radio (Wu 2010; Hazlett 2017).</p><p>It is important to note that the problem was not centralization of broadcasting by the FCC; the problem was the choice of a central-planning system over a system of well-defined property rights. Indeed, the FCC insisted on a forced decentralization: stations must be local and low powered in order to produce local content (and, of course, to please political constituencies). Concentration of content in the hands of a few big networks was actually the (unintended?) consequence of this localism, as the small broadcasters found that they needed to affiliate with a network in order to obtain better content than they could produce themselves, and the more locally isolated the broadcaster, the greater the incentive to affiliate with the largest network. Had the FCC instead permitted a handful of powerful regional stations, the Dumont network might not have been driven out of business (Hazlett 2017, 93).</p><p>This history has lessons for the drama unfolding today at the FCC: net neutrality. Tim Wu (2010), the leading proponent of net neutrality, has chronicled the FCC's history of misregulation. He announces himself as a Schumpeterian and an evolutionary thinker, citing the likes ofF. A. Hayek (1945) and Richard R. Nelson and Sidney G. Winter (1982). But Wu doesn't seem to like Schumpeterian processes when he sees them today; and he is decidedly not a Coasean. His mental model derives from the FCC's failure in the postwar period to allow the interconnection to the phone system of \"foreign\" devices such as faxes, modems, and telephones not made by Western Electric. Thus, he thinks that the way to regulate the Internet is to prohibit service providers from discriminating in their treatment of uses for the Internet (Wu 2003). (Faxes and modems were \"uses\" of the phone system.) Rather than helping to create a system of well-defined property rights, however, this approach actually removes important aspects of property rights, making the Internet an unowned commons.35 More significantly, it places barricades in front of an unforeseeable number of forms in which beneficial Schumpeterian competition might manifest itself. Predictably, the first to be accused of violating net neutrality was not one of the Big Five, whom it arguably advantages, but rather MetroPCS, a small cell phone provider that had wanted to offer unlimited access to YouTube as part of one of its service plans (Hazlett 2011).</p><p>At this writing, net neutrality has been repealed, though several states are threatening to impose it at their level. Because net neutrality is predicated on a particular static architecture, however, it may be rendered irrelevant before long in any case by technological change.36 Not so the more general demands for government-managed barriers to competition that emanate from Khan's proposals. So we do have to think hard about competition policy. Competition policy may or may not require the Chicago School of Bork, Posner, and Stigler. But it very much needs both Schumpeter and Coase.</p><p>Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers.

This is an example of what is now called Ramsey pricing: charging higher prices for products inelastically demanded and lower prices for products elastically demanded. It is an efficient solution to pricing in a multiproduct context in the face of high fixed costs (Baumol and Bradford 1970).</p><p>5. Gabriel Kolko (1965) famously argued that this legislation was the work of and redounded exclusively to the benefit of the railroads. More recent scholars think otherwise; indeed, if anything, it was the short-haul shippers who benefited most from the legislation (Gilligan, Marshall, and Weingast 1989). The ICC gained teeth only in the early twentieth century, when it was given rate-making authority and was promptly captured by shipping interests. The result was the decline of American railroads, which could no longer raise the capital necessary to maintain and expand facilities (Martin 1971).</p><p>6. Douglas Irwin (2007) has calculated that tariffs in the late nineteenth century amounted to an export tax of 10 percent, redistributing some 8 percent of gross domestic product between sectors.</p><p>7. This was in fact the accepted historiography of the Sherman Act for much of the twentieth century (Stephenson 1930; J. Clark 1931; Fainsod and Gordon 1941), though it went into decline after the success of Hans Thorelli's (1955) Progressive Whig history. Thomas DiLorenzo (1985) and Thomas Hazlett (1992) have resuscitated the older view.</p><p>8. in the three years after the formation of the Standard Oil trust in 1882, John D. Rockefeller had succeeded in consolidating what had been fifty-three refineries into twenty-one highly efficient ones, lowering the average cost of refining from 1.5 cents to 0.5 cents per barrel (Williamson and Daum 1959).</p><p>9. 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71-7 (1890).</p><p>10. The common-law language referred instead to practices such as forestalling, regrating, and engrossing, which were forms of speculation and arbitrage. Although usually economically efficient, these practices would sometimes have the effect of transferring rents to merchants at the expense of city dwellers, and forbidding them was, remarkably, one of the few instances in which the common law penalized pecuniary rather than technological externalities. Under the influence of Enlightenment thinkers like Adam Smith, Britain had removed these provisions by 1844.</p><p>11. And he chose badly. Roosevelt's preeminent good corporation was U.S. Steel, which is one of the few trusts that approximated what modern-day economists think a trust is. In the nineteenth century, Andrew Carnegie had been in steel the equivalent of Rockefeller in oil: a ruthless price cutter bent on innovation and efficiency. But unlike Rockefeller, Carnegie suddenly desired to change his life and become a full-time philanthropist. The House of Morgan brokered a deal with several other steel concerns, and under Judge Elbert H. Gary the new colossus stabilized prices, declined to innovate, and maintained the status quo-precisely because it feared antitrust prosecution (McCraw and Reinhardt 1989). For this, it was rewarded by the Supreme Court with a not-guilty verdict. In the through-the-looking-glass world of American antitrust policy, the best way to avoid being anticompetitive, it turned out, is not to compete. With hammer and claw, Roosevelt went after Standard Oil, which was a far more aggressive competitor and was under pressure from new finds of oil around the world.</p><p>12. The author of the Federal Trade Commission bill was actually Brandeis's associate George Rublee, who was a fervent supporter of the Bull Moose Party and a proponent of the strong commission Roosevelt favored.</p><p>13. Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911).</p><p>14. There are two reasons RPM is efficient. Manufacturers maywant to eliminate reseller competition along the price margin in order to force competition to take place along various nonprice margins, especially sales effort and pre- or postsales service. If some resellers are allowed to discount, customers can free-ride on the services of the nondiscounters and then buy from the discounters, which will create an incentive for no one to provide the services and sales effort (Telser 1960). Manufacturers may also want to control the resale price in order to send a quality signal (Marvel and McCafferty 1984). Be careful to note that this discussion is about voluntary RPM contracts, which are often confused with so-called fair-trade laws that legally require RPM. Fair-trade laws, pushed strongly by small retail druggists who faced competition from discounters (Hawley 1966,254-69), were among the manypro-cyclical policies ushered in during the Depression by the New Deal.</p><p>15. As Brandeis put it in a letter to Commerce Secretary William C. Redfield in 1913, by restricting vertical contracting, antitrust policy was \"playing into the hands\" of the large department stores and chain stores that were beginning to arise in the early twentieth century and was giving advantage to large concerns such as Standard Oil that could \"retail an article as well as manufacture\" it (qtd. in McCraw 1981, 47).</p><p>16. Janusz Ordover and Garth Saloner define \"anticompetitive or predatory those aggressive and exclusionary business strategies that, when deployed, have the effect oflowering a properly evaluated measure of social welfare\" (1989, 539).</p><p>17. Khan also cites a book by John Kwoka (2015) that is actually about mergers, not predatory pricing, and she waves vaguely at some recent claims that entrepreneurship and firm formation are declining in the United States.</p><p>18. And one might add that formal strategic-behavior models are the blackboard economist's blackboard economics-\"blackboard economics gone loco,\" as McCloskey puts it (1997, 244).</p><p>19. This is unlike the economist's model of \"perfect\" competition, in which firms are infinitely decentralized and powerless, because in that (abstract and largely irrelevant) model decentralization increases welfare.</p><p>20. As Jonathan Hughes wryly puts it in a related context, \"American capitalism is normally a world of structured economic power in which competition is ever endangered and . . . competition cannot survive in this world unless it is constantly protected from market forces\" (1977, 122).</p><p>21.

This was inverse Ramsey pricing: charging a higher price to the elastically demanded service (long distance) and a lower price to the inelastically demanded service (local phone).</p><p>31. The slow pace of technological change in both telephony and broadcasting was masked to Americans to some extent because European countries had handed those industries over to state-owned monopolies, which were even less innovative. AT&amp;T made sure to innovate in a slow, nondisruptive way, though the company suppressed disruptive technologies, famously including magnetic-tape recording, which Bell Labs developed in 1934 (M. Clark 1993). AT&amp;T officials believed that users would fear having their secret conversations recorded, to such an extent that it would destroy telephony.</p><p>32. Tribune Co. v.

When the wife of a young congressman offered to buy it, authorization was forthcoming in twenty-four days. The congressman soon intervened to save the FCC's budget request. His name was Lyndon Baines Johnson, and he and his wife, Lady Bird, became rich as owners of radio and later television licenses (Caro 1990, 88-94).</p><p>35. Again, an unowned commons, like an open-ocean fishery or a busy highway without tolls, is inefficient because it creates an incentive to overuse the resource and to allocate the resource to low-value uses. A larger and more subtle issue with the nondiscrimination rule is that it discourages innovation by restricting possible value-creating business models. Many if not most of the greatest Schumpeterian innovations in information technology-thinkApple's iTunes-have been \"walled garden\" business models in which services are tied to a platform. Unlike the rules actually implemented, Wu's original proposal (Wu 2003) would have allowed (nondiscriminatory) congestion pricing of bandwidth, though it would have forbidden walled gardens.</p><p>36. The likely successor to today's infrastructure appears to be 5G cellular technology, now in development, which may offer Internet services at high speed over the airwaves in competition with cable. Alarmingly if not surprisingly, the Trump administration has made noises about nationalizing 5G on grounds of national security. Tim Wu (2018) thinks it a splendid idea to create a state-owned \"Tennessee Valley Authority\" of 5G to bring this service to rural areas. Quite apart from the issue of why city dwellers ought to be made to subsidize the countryside, one may wonder what the benefits ofa Tennessee Valley 5G Authority might look like when we live in the world of 7G, 8G, 9G, or some G not yet imagined.</p><p>References</p><p>Aldrich, Mark. 2013.

But the stocks that have long held appeal as more conservative, chaste alternatives -- those that pay dividends -- are getting scarce. And companies that do pay dividends tend to offer stingier yields.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The combination of those trends is unwelcome news for investors, because dividends have traditionally helped bolster stock returns, and that's especially valuable in a laggardly stock market.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Though dividends have been a solace to investors in hard times before, companies today are invoking the economy as an excuse to cut their payouts. Standard &amp; Poor's predicts the drop-off in dividend payouts this year will be the steepest since 1942, because so many cash-poor companies have been chopping dividends to save money. For the first six months of 2001, dividends on the S&amp;P 500 index fell 7.1% from the year-earlier level.\u00a0</p><p>Even before the downturn, companies had grown increasingly miserly with dividend payouts. Twenty years ago, the average yield of a dividend-paying member of the S&amp;P 500 was 5.5%; today it's a meager 2.0%. That's not enough to punch up a stock's return by much.\u00a0</p><p>Also, of course, fewer companies are paying dividends at all. Dividends have traditionally been the province of more mature companies, but the market in recent years has tilted toward younger, growth-oriented companies that prefer to reinvest profits in their business. According to one academic study, the proportion of companies that paid dividends peaked at 66.5% in 1978, then started dropping. By 1999, only 20.8% of firms paid dividends.\u00a0</p><p>Even once-staid industries like telecommunications, which used to reliably crank out dividends for the widows-and-orphans crowd, have curbed or eliminated payouts. Pushed to be more competitive in the wake of deregulation, telecom outfits have channeled the money instead into projects for internal growth or acquisitions. Lately, in the face of sharply dropping revenues, these companies have gotten more tight-fisted with their dividends. This week Nortel said it would ax its dividend, joining Corning. Last year AT&amp;T stunned investors when it announced it would cut dividends by three-quarters.\u00a0</p><p>To a lesser extent, the same trend can be seen among regulated utilities, another traditional haunt of dividend investors. Instead of handing profits back to investors, they're more likely to invest some of the money in unregulated businesses with the potential for faster growth.\u00a0</p><p>Of the remaining stocks that still boast high dividend yields, many hail from the REITs sector. Investors in REITs don't have to worry about having their dividends obliterated, because the structure of the companies dictates that they pay out 90% of their earnings as dividends.\u00a0</p><p>But like any stocks, REITs can still suffer capital losses. In 1998, for example, the average REIT fund finished down about 15%, despite the dividend. And because REITs represent one narrow sector, investors shouldn't allocate more than about 10% of their portfolios to them.\u00a0</p><p><table pgwide=\"616\"><tgroup cols=\"4\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"224\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"2\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"3\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"4\" colwidth=\"64\"/><tbody><row><entry nameend=\"4\" namest=\"1\">REITS Dominate the Ranks of Companies With Big Dividend Yields. *</entry></row><row><entry>Stock</entry><entry>Dividend yield %</entry><entry>Type of stock</entry><entry>3-Year %</entry></row><row><entry>Return Hospitality Properties</entry><entry>9.8</entry><entry>REIT</entry><entry>7.7</entry></row><row><entry>Amerigas Partners</entry><entry>9.5</entry><entry>Oil/gas</entry><entry>10.1</entry></row><row><entry>Health Care Property</entry><entry>8.8</entry><entry>REIT</entry><entry>9.1</entry></row><row><entry>Franchise Finance Corp.</entry><entry>8.7</entry><entry>REIT</entry><entry>7.0</entry></row><row><entry>Healthcare Realty Trust</entry><entry>8.6</entry><entry>REIT</entry><entry>9.5</entry></row><row><entry>Highwoods Properties</entry><entry>8.6</entry><entry>REIT</entry><entry>2.4</entry></row><row><entry>Mack-Cali Realty</entry><entry>8.5</entry><entry>REIT</entry><entry>2.0</entry></row><row><entry>Allied Capital</entry><entry>8.3</entry><entry>Mortgages</entry><entry>11.0</entry></row><row><entry>Post Properties</entry><entry>8.1</entry><entry>REIT</entry><entry>6.1</entry></row><row><entry>Plum Creek Timber</entry><entry>8.3</entry><entry>Forestry and wood products</entry><entry>8.1</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"4\" namest=\"1\">*Screen limited to domestic stocks with a market cap of at least $<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1 billion, with dividends yields and three-year total return greater than or equal to the S&amp;P 500.

Despite their frowzy image, over time dividend-paying stocks have made lots more money for investors than stocks that don't pay out in this way.\u00a0</p><p>Over the 50-year period ending in 2000, S&amp;P 500 companies had annualized returns of 8.7% based on capital appreciation alone -- but if dividends were reinvested, returns leaped to 12.75%. \"That's because back then, stocks did have enormous yields,\" says Howard Silverblatt, editor of quantitative services for Standard &amp; Poor's. Compounded over time, dividends could give a tremendous lift to returns.\u00a0</p><p>Though dividend-payers tend to be cast as slow-breathing, dullard investments, in the past they've been a boon to investors in risky companies. A study by finance professors Kathleen Fuller at the University of Georgia and Michael Goldstein at Babson College found that of the riskiest 10% of companies (measured by beta), those that paid dividends posted 100% higher returns than those that didn't.\u00a0</p><p>Between 1970 and 2000, risky stocks that paid dividends returned an average of 1.4% a month, while those that did not returned only 0.7%.\u00a0</p><p>But today it may be difficult for investors to apply those findings to their own portfolios, because riskier, growth-oriented companies are increasingly unlikely to pay worthwhile dividends. Most tech companies, for example, offer pretty meager dividend yields.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/><table pgwide=\"472\"><tgroup cols=\"3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"5\" colwidth=\"208\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"6\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"7\" colwidth=\"128\"/><tbody><row><entry nameend=\"3\" namest=\"1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">High-Return Big Tech Stocks With the Biggest Dividend Yields*</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stock</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dividend yield %</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3-year return %</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Diebold</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.0</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.1</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Avnet</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.3</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-7.5</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electronic Data Systems</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.0</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">20.8</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pioneer-Standard Electron</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0.9</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">8.7</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Harris</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0.7</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-7.9</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AVX</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0.7</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">39.6</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sharp ADR</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0.7</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">16.1</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Autodesk</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0.6</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.5</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IBM</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0.5</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">18.4</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Linear Technology</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0.3</emphasis></entry><entry><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">39.8</emphasis></entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"3\" namest=\"1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">*Screen of tech stocks with 1-year and 3- year returns greater than sector average and revenues greater than or equal to $</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">500 million.</emphasis></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><br/>\u00a0<br/>Today, Income-Seekers Look Elsewhere\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>The trend toward ever-lower yields may be impossible to reverse. Instead of handing money back to shareholders, managers today are ideologically inclined to funnel residual profits into buying back stock or making acquisitions.\u00a0</p><p>One reason is that dividends aren't tax-efficient. They're taxed twice, when a company pays income tax and when shareholders do.\u00a0</p><p>Another reason is that investors today approve of companies retaining the money, provided they have a profitable use for it. Throughout the '90s, that strategy made sense: As companies increasingly reinvested their profits, stock prices surged. Capital appreciation more than offset the dwindling value of dividends. \"If I'm getting a 20% to 50% return on stocks every year, I don't care about dividends,\" says Silverblatt.\u00a0</p><p>Even now, though dividends are more valuable in a down market, investors don't seem to be clamoring for their return. \"It's good for a company to have the cash flow and ability to pay dividends,\" says Steve Fossel, manager of the Berger Large-Cap Growth fund. \"But if they choose to reinvest the money in other ways, that's probably even more positive than paying out the dividend. If a company has the opportunity to invest in high-return projects rather than pay money out to the shareholder, I think that's great.\"\u00a0</p><p>Despite their historic contribution to high stock returns, dividend stocks have steadily lost favor with portfolio managers. In January, the large-cap growth fund Fossel manages underwent a name change; it was previously called a growth and income fund, which meant it had to have 65% of its holdings in dividend-producing stocks. The income tag \"seemed like a constraint because the dividend yield on a lot of stocks was not high to begin with,\" he explains. Plus, it was hard to find dividend-generating growth stocks. \"A deep value person might be more interested in dividends than a growth person would be,\" says Fossel.\u00a0</p><p>As the supply of dividend stocks has dried up, other fund companies have opted to rechristen funds. MFS Equity Income metamorphosed into MFS Value, while Janus Equity Income will become Janus Core Equity at the end of July.\u00a0</p><p>Financial advisers seem equally unhappy about current dividend offerings. \"The yields overall are lower, and there's more volatility in the payment of dividends,\" explains Eric Bruck, a certified financial planner at Bruck &amp; Caine Advisors in Culver City, Calif. Though he advised buying dividend stocks in the mid '80s until the early '90s, he hasn't done so since.\u00a0</p><p>Dividend stocks might be appropriate for an income-seeking investor in a low tax bracket, says Herbert Daroff, a certified financial planner at Baystate Financial Planning in Boston, Mass. But wealthier investors should avoid dividend stocks, because the income they throw off generates taxes. Because dividends are taxed at the ordinary rate, shareholders in the top tax bracket could end up paying taxes at twice the rate they pay for long-term capital gains. \"If you're in a high enough tax bracket, you may be better off with a muni bond than a dividend-paying stock,\" says Daroff.\u00a0</p><p>And it doesn't make sense to hold dividend stocks in a tax-deferred retirement account, because they typically offer little in the way of growth.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"The bottom line is if you're an equity investor, it's very hard to come by a meaningful dividend yield in a mutual fund,\" says Kunal Kapoor, a senior analyst at Morningstar. He recommends that investors seeking income look to bonds instead, perhaps investing in a hybrid mutual fund that includes both stocks and bonds.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><correction><correctionDescription><bodyText><p>A July 23 article, Hunting the Rare and Elusive Dividend Stock, mistakenly reported that real estate investment trusts must pay out 95% of their earnings as dividends.

TD Ameritrade surged as much as 26 percent Thursday - the most in 20 years - while Schwab rallied 14 percent.</p><p>Still, the market is fairly fragmented with smaller competitors and falling management fees have been a boon to investors, a trend that looks unlikely to change, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst David Ritter.</p><p>\"It's hard to imagine that that train is going to be slowed by one merger like this,\" he said.</p><p>One of the last major deals in the industry - TD Ameritrade's acquisition of Scottrade in 2017 - won approval from US antitrust officials without conditions. Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's second-largest lender by assets, owns a 43 percent stake in TD Ameritrade.</p><p>Although fees are going down for consumers, antitrust officials will focus on whether the deal will mean less competition for the interest paid to investors on their accounts and whether fees on other services could rise, said Robert Litan, a partner at Korein Tillery and a former official with the Justice Department's antitrust division. The tie-up will likely be reviewed by the Justice Department, he said, instead of the Federal Trade Commission, which also reviews mergers.</p><p>\"The intense competition in the industry has forced them to go to zero commissions, but that doesn't mean that the market still isn't susceptible to having consumers hurt as a result of further consolidation,\" he said.</p><p>Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note that the takeover will get significant scrutiny from regulators that could stretch into the third quarter of 2020, though he said he expects it will be completed before the next presidential inauguration.</p><p>\"The concern is that this becomes political,\" Seiberg said. \"Democratic candidates including Senator Elizabeth Warren have been railing against big tech and big banks. It is easy to see how this could get drawn into this anti-big business campaign.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>If Charles Schwab Corp. succeeds in acquiring TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., it would create a $5 trillion giant.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLBCM-UWXAVSAMVYI6VAYBDQ2CCYGPI4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLBCM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJR-W241-DXH7-53XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">469785</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"499\"/><timeReceived>12:34 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>bostonglobe.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009ANY</classCode><className>TD AMERITRADE HOLDING CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000283S</classCode><className>CHARLES SCHWAB CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001YMV</classCode><className>TD BANK FINANCIAL GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00028E1</classCode><className>FMR CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00081VT</classCode><className>KEEFE BRUYETTE &amp;
