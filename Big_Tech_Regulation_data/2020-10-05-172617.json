Do you have your own ability to bring a drone down? I will not go in detail about the abilities that we have. We have some abilities but it's not enough for us for the long run. </p><p>Actually we were hoping to see new strategies to help us bringing drones down but I did see also new threats because perhaps you noticed, there are a lot of drones that carry some sort of ball around them and some of the measures we take, it's attacking the rotors. The rotors are now protected by these balls so it actually poses us with another problem. So we're just fixing our drones. They got a little bit mangled in the last competition. This is actually already flattened again. How do you flatten it? She stands on them. You stand on them? Our primary strategy was to use brute force which is why we have this gigantic machine. Motors get hit, it can fly without. If it gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better. There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies in the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their solutions. This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also on its battery. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YL-40d6a5716a4d4cc58e83f219a7be5389</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPY-9561-DY08-30JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"749\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

CO2 gas pumps here firing at those drones as they come around the corner. They've got to get past this tennis ball machine which is going to fire balls. There is going to be a man with a gun that fires a net through this hole to try to take out those drones if they come round. </p><p>Lights will be flushing to try to blind the pilots but once they get down this corridor of doom, death and destruction, they get to their opponent's arena and a chance to take out the queen. With all this destruction of kit going on, it's perhaps surprising no-one is called the cops but that's because they are the ones sponsoring the event. In this contest, we hope to come across new creative ideas that we can adapt and use in our police matters. Do you have your own ability to bring a drone down? I will not go in detail about the abilities that we have. We have some abilities but it's not enough for us for the long run. Actually we were hoping to see new strategies to help us bringing drones down but I did see also new threats because perhaps you noticed, there are a lot of drones that carry some sort of ball around them and some of the measures we take, it's attacking the rotors. The rotors are now protected by these balls so it actually poses us with another problem. Enter a sideshow that involves this tiny drone. Tell me what this is. So we're just fixing our drones. They got a little bit mangled in the last competition. This is actually already flattened again. How do you flatten it? She stands on them. You stand on them? Our primary strategy was to use brute force which is why we have this gigantic machine. Motors get hit, it can fly without. If it gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better.

This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize.

She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture.

They got a little bit mangled in the last competition. This is actually already flattened again. How do you flatten it? She stands on them. You stand on them? Our primary strategy was to use brute force which is why we have this gigantic machine. Motors get hit, it can fly without. If it gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better. There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies in the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their solutions. This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also on its battery. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone.

In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize.

CO2 gas pumps here firing at those drones as they come around the corner. They've got to get past this tennis ball machine which is going to fire balls. There is going to be a man with a gun that fires a net through this hole to try to take out those drones if they come round. </p><p>Lights will be flushing to try to blind the pilots but once they get down this corridor of doom, death and destruction, they get to their opponent's arena and a chance to take out the queen. With all this destruction of kit going on, it's perhaps surprising no-one is called the cops but that's because they are the ones sponsoring the event. In this contest, we hope to come across new creative ideas that we can adapt and use in our police matters. Do you have your own ability to bring a drone down? I will not go in detail about the abilities that we have. We have some abilities but it's not enough for us for the long run. Actually we were hoping to see new strategies to help us bringing drones down but I did see also new threats because perhaps you noticed, there are a lot of drones that carry some sort of ball around them and some of the measures we take, it's attacking the rotors.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh was arrested while visiting Dubai with her teenage daughter last month. She had posted critical comments about her ex-husband's new wife three years ago.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh was arrested while visiting Dubai with her teenage daughter last month. She had posted critical comments about her ex-husband's new wife three years ago.

Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms.

Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh was arrested while visiting Dubai with her teenage daughter last month. She had posted critical comments about her ex-husband's new wife three years ago.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh was arrested while visiting Dubai with her teenage daughter last month. She had posted critical comments about her ex-husband's new wife three years ago.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh was arrested while visiting Dubai with her teenage daughter last month. She had posted critical comments about her ex-husband's new wife three years ago.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh was arrested while visiting Dubai with her teenage daughter last month. She had posted critical comments about her ex-husband's new wife three years ago.

So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. </p><p>Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh was arrested while visiting Dubai with her teenage daughter last month. She had posted critical comments about her ex-husband's new wife three years ago. Ministers should consider banning the use of 5G technology made by Huawei in Westminster and other sensitive areas, according to a government cyber official.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-82d2124c83984da09304b4349c1e515b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV4-5X51-JBH6-C2WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh was arrested while visiting Dubai with her teenage daughter last month. She had posted critical comments about her ex-husband's new wife three years ago.

Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh was arrested while visiting Dubai with her teenage daughter last month. She had posted critical comments about her ex-husband's new wife three years ago.

Pippin the cat is here along with this beautiful christening cake, also known as Flora. So mist and fog to clear and some showers in England and Wales but some brighter skies and I will tell you where 15 minutes. Good morning. </p><p>It's Monday April 8th. Our top story: For the first time, social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter could have their services blocked and face heavy fines if they don't stick to new internet safety laws. Under government proposals, bosses could be held responsible for sites failing to tackle terrorist propaganda and child abuse. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there is now a 12-week consultation. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. The new rules will apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcome the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Drivers of diesel cars over four years old and petrol cars registered more than 13 years ago will have to pay an extra #12.50 a day to drive into the centre of the city. Leeds and Birmingham are planning similar rules. In a few minutes we'll be talking to the Mayor of London about the new charge. It's thought Brexit talks between the Conservatives and Labour could continue later today. They failed to reach an agreement last week after three days of meetings. The Prime Minister says both parties will need to compromise if there's to be a deal. Theresa May is due at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday when EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, is in Westminster. Good morning. I heard from one minister that more talks will take place today. Lots of talk of compromise. Is it possible? These talks are spluttering along and there has been no breakthrough so far. Theresa May's big hope is that she can do some kind of deal with Labour which you can take to the European Union, and say, look, I can find a way through the impasse at Westminster. There is a way through to get the deal over the line. Cross-party consensus on what Brexit would look like in the future. That is what you are trying to do with Labour. Both she and the Labour leader are under pressure from their own side not to compromise, which is making the talks pretty difficult. And there is no guarantee at all that there will be face to face discussions today. Clearly these talks are not dead. They are continuing. This really is a big week for Brexit. As things stand, we are set to leave the European Union on Friday without a deal, but Theresa May is going to go to a summit of EU leaders on Wednesday and ask the more time again, another extension. She hopes until the end of June so that the UK can get its act together and try and get a Brexit agreement through. But I think she is likely to face quite a lot of resistance and questions from EU leaders who want to know why. What is she going to use the time for? Is there any guarantee that you can break the impasse at Westminster? It promises to be another significant week in Brexit. We said to have counted how many there have been! How many times have I said that? I would like to know! 802, I think. A British woman is facing a possible two yet jail sentence in Dubai for cybercrime posts that you posted right here in the UK. Laleh Shahravesh was arrested while visiting Dubai with her teenage daughter last month. She had posted critical comments about her ex-husband's new wife three years ago.

Our political correspondent Matt Cole joins us. Lots of tweets Michel Barnier yesterday and still Nunavut looking good. Yeah, we seem to be in a bit of a deadlock to say the least. </p><p>There is a big week ahead, Theresa May has to put her revised deal, if she has one, before the House of Commons on Tuesday. Remember when she first put to them about a month or so ago it got defeated by record amounts, a 230 vote majority against the plan. Since then, she has been going backwards and forwards to the EU looking for concessions, looking particularly for changes in terms of what can be done about the Northern Ireland border with the Republic, and particularly the insurance policy in case in the future there is not a trade deal done between Britain and the EU. There is a thing called back stop at the moment, that is the insurance plan that would keep both the UK and Northern Ireland as well in a customs union with the European Union is the goods and services can flow across the border between the Republican Northern Ireland until the deal is done. The last-minute offer from Michel Barnier was to say OK, the main part of the UK does not need to stay in that, you can you get out of that if that is so unpopular with Brexiteers who fear being trapped in the year for a very long time that you would have to leave Northern Ireland in it. That is the very thing that Theresa May had tried to get rid of it all the big negotiations when the withdrawal agreement was first signed, so the Brexit victory Stephen Barclay says no, we're going back to square one here. A lot of finger-pointing at each other, the blame game seems to be starting. Michel Barnier says he is not interested in that, he just wants to get deal done. Theresa May is getting ready to go before the MPs on Tuesday, the EU is saying look, we have done everything we can and therein lies the deadlock, we are not going anywhere very fast, it would seem. Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe.

The last-minute offer from Michel Barnier was to say OK, the main part of the UK does not need to stay in that, you can you get out of that if that is so unpopular with Brexiteers who fear being trapped in the year for a very long time that you would have to leave Northern Ireland in it. That is the very thing that Theresa May had tried to get rid of it all the big negotiations when the withdrawal agreement was first signed, so the Brexit victory Stephen Barclay says no, we're going back to square one here. A lot of finger-pointing at each other, the blame game seems to be starting. </p><p>Michel Barnier says he is not interested in that, he just wants to get deal done. Theresa May is getting ready to go before the MPs on Tuesday, the EU is saying look, we have done everything we can and therein lies the deadlock, we are not going anywhere very fast, it would seem. Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There is also a call for classification framework, similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to strictly regulate Internet companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harm. Events to mark the 60th birthday of Barbie are taking place across the world today. The doll is going to make an appearance at a number of locations, including a Barbie pop-up experience in New York. The toy's manufacturer, Mattel, describe her as \"the number one fashion doll\", designed to inspire girls. And obviously Ken there as well. We're so proud that Barbie has truly been inspiring girl 1951 -- 1959.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SO-9fb8785056d74b74ab50e888ceb107f9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-2DR1-DY08-3293-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The last-minute offer from Michel Barnier was to say OK, the main part of the UK does not need to stay in that, you can you get out of that if that is so unpopular with Brexiteers who fear being trapped in the year for a very long time that you would have to leave Northern Ireland in it. That is the very thing that Theresa May had tried to get rid of it all the big negotiations when the withdrawal agreement was first signed, so the Brexit victory Stephen Barclay says no, we're going back to square one here. A lot of finger-pointing at each other, the blame game seems to be starting. </p><p>Michel Barnier says he is not interested in that, he just wants to get deal done. Theresa May is getting ready to go before the MPs on Tuesday, the EU is saying look, we have done everything we can and therein lies the deadlock, we are not going anywhere very fast, it would seem. Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There is also a call for classification framework, similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to strictly regulate Internet companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harm. Events to mark the 60th birthday of Barbie are taking place across the world today. The doll is going to make an appearance at a number of locations, including a Barbie pop-up experience in New York. The toy's manufacturer, Mattel, describe her as \"the number one fashion doll\", designed to inspire girls. And obviously Ken there as well. We're so proud that Barbie has truly been inspiring girl 1951 -- 1959.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-d9771c4852334b9ead7234d55ed054b4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-2DR1-DY08-329S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The last-minute offer from Michel Barnier was to say OK, the main part of the UK does not need to stay in that, you can you get out of that if that is so unpopular with Brexiteers who fear being trapped in the year for a very long time that you would have to leave Northern Ireland in it. That is the very thing that Theresa May had tried to get rid of it all the big negotiations when the withdrawal agreement was first signed, so the Brexit victory Stephen Barclay says no, we're going back to square one here. A lot of finger-pointing at each other, the blame game seems to be starting. </p><p>Michel Barnier says he is not interested in that, he just wants to get deal done. Theresa May is getting ready to go before the MPs on Tuesday, the EU is saying look, we have done everything we can and therein lies the deadlock, we are not going anywhere very fast, it would seem. Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There is also a call for classification framework, similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to strictly regulate Internet companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harm. Events to mark the 60th birthday of Barbie are taking place across the world today. The doll is going to make an appearance at a number of locations, including a Barbie pop-up experience in New York. The toy's manufacturer, Mattel, describe her as \"the number one fashion doll\", designed to inspire girls. And obviously Ken there as well. We're so proud that Barbie has truly been inspiring girl 1951 -- 1959.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SW-3359b22fe800420eb313bef5c1188fe1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-2DR1-DY08-32B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The last-minute offer from Michel Barnier was to say OK, the main part of the UK does not need to stay in that, you can you get out of that if that is so unpopular with Brexiteers who fear being trapped in the year for a very long time that you would have to leave Northern Ireland in it. That is the very thing that Theresa May had tried to get rid of it all the big negotiations when the withdrawal agreement was first signed, so the Brexit victory Stephen Barclay says no, we're going back to square one here. A lot of finger-pointing at each other, the blame game seems to be starting. </p><p>Michel Barnier says he is not interested in that, he just wants to get deal done. Theresa May is getting ready to go before the MPs on Tuesday, the EU is saying look, we have done everything we can and therein lies the deadlock, we are not going anywhere very fast, it would seem. Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There is also a call for classification framework, similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to strictly regulate Internet companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harm. Events to mark the 60th birthday of Barbie are taking place across the world today. The doll is going to make an appearance at a number of locations, including a Barbie pop-up experience in New York. The toy's manufacturer, Mattel, describe her as \"the number one fashion doll\", designed to inspire girls. And obviously Ken there as well. We're so proud that Barbie has truly been inspiring girl 1951 -- 1959. She is the original girl empowerment</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-2c2929cda0a949878225ade0ff815197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-2DR1-DY08-32BC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The last-minute offer from Michel Barnier was to say OK, the main part of the UK does not need to stay in that, you can you get out of that if that is so unpopular with Brexiteers who fear being trapped in the year for a very long time that you would have to leave Northern Ireland in it. That is the very thing that Theresa May had tried to get rid of it all the big negotiations when the withdrawal agreement was first signed, so the Brexit victory Stephen Barclay says no, we're going back to square one here. A lot of finger-pointing at each other, the blame game seems to be starting. </p><p>Michel Barnier says he is not interested in that, he just wants to get deal done. Theresa May is getting ready to go before the MPs on Tuesday, the EU is saying look, we have done everything we can and therein lies the deadlock, we are not going anywhere very fast, it would seem. Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There is also a call for classification framework, similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to strictly regulate Internet companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harm. Events to mark the 60th birthday of Barbie are taking place across the world today. The doll is going to make an appearance at a number of locations, including a Barbie pop-up experience in New York. The toy's manufacturer, Mattel, describe her as \"the number one fashion doll\", designed to inspire girls. And obviously Ken there as well. We're so proud that Barbie has truly been inspiring girl 1951 -- 1959.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1YL-21b180d1e6fa4ad4942c515e5ac7dbae</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1YL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-2DR1-DY08-329Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The last-minute offer from Michel Barnier was to say OK, the main part of the UK does not need to stay in that, you can you get out of that if that is so unpopular with Brexiteers who fear being trapped in the year for a very long time that you would have to leave Northern Ireland in it. That is the very thing that Theresa May had tried to get rid of it all the big negotiations when the withdrawal agreement was first signed, so the Brexit victory Stephen Barclay says no, we're going back to square one here. A lot of finger-pointing at each other, the blame game seems to be starting. </p><p>Michel Barnier says he is not interested in that, he just wants to get deal done. Theresa May is getting ready to go before the MPs on Tuesday, the EU is saying look, we have done everything we can and therein lies the deadlock, we are not going anywhere very fast, it would seem. Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There is also a call for classification framework, similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to strictly regulate Internet companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harm. Events to mark the 60th birthday of Barbie are taking place across the world today. The doll is going to make an appearance at a number of locations, including a Barbie pop-up experience in New York. The toy's manufacturer, Mattel, describe her as \"the number one fashion doll\", designed to inspire girls. And obviously Ken there as well. We're so proud that Barbie has truly been inspiring girl 1951 -- 1959. She is the original girl empowerment</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EM-a7da2e3b3d774fa5a85213e0396df94b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-2DR1-DY08-32B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400421</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There is also a call for classification framework, similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to strictly regulate Internet companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harm. Events to mark the 60th birthday of Barbie are taking place across the world today. The doll is going to make an appearance at a number of locations, including a Barbie pop-up experience in New York. The toy's manufacturer, Mattel, describe her as \"the number one fashion doll\", designed to inspire girls. And obviously Ken there as well. We're so proud that Barbie has truly been inspiring girl 1951 -- 1959. She is the original girl empowerment</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-f64eb859c8a04b148b5820101673741f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-2DR1-DY08-32B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The last-minute offer from Michel Barnier was to say OK, the main part of the UK does not need to stay in that, you can you get out of that if that is so unpopular with Brexiteers who fear being trapped in the year for a very long time that you would have to leave Northern Ireland in it. That is the very thing that Theresa May had tried to get rid of it all the big negotiations when the withdrawal agreement was first signed, so the Brexit victory Stephen Barclay says no, we're going back to square one here. A lot of finger-pointing at each other, the blame game seems to be starting. </p><p>Michel Barnier says he is not interested in that, he just wants to get deal done. Theresa May is getting ready to go before the MPs on Tuesday, the EU is saying look, we have done everything we can and therein lies the deadlock, we are not going anywhere very fast, it would seem. Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe.

The last-minute offer from Michel Barnier was to say OK, the main part of the UK does not need to stay in that, you can you get out of that if that is so unpopular with Brexiteers who fear being trapped in the year for a very long time that you would have to leave Northern Ireland in it. That is the very thing that Theresa May had tried to get rid of it all the big negotiations when the withdrawal agreement was first signed, so the Brexit victory Stephen Barclay says no, we're going back to square one here. A lot of finger-pointing at each other, the blame game seems to be starting. </p><p>Michel Barnier says he is not interested in that, he just wants to get deal done. Theresa May is getting ready to go before the MPs on Tuesday, the EU is saying look, we have done everything we can and therein lies the deadlock, we are not going anywhere very fast, it would seem. Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There is also a call for classification framework, similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to strictly regulate Internet companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harm. Events to mark the 60th birthday of Barbie are taking place across the world today. The doll is going to make an appearance at a number of locations, including a Barbie pop-up experience in New York. The toy's manufacturer, Mattel, describe her as \"the number one fashion doll\", designed to inspire girls. And obviously Ken there as well. We're so proud that Barbie has truly been inspiring girl 1951 -- 1959. She is the original girl empowerment</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WA-a255b138c7d1475bb3fb188984010afc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-2DR1-DY08-329B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The last-minute offer from Michel Barnier was to say OK, the main part of the UK does not need to stay in that, you can you get out of that if that is so unpopular with Brexiteers who fear being trapped in the year for a very long time that you would have to leave Northern Ireland in it. That is the very thing that Theresa May had tried to get rid of it all the big negotiations when the withdrawal agreement was first signed, so the Brexit victory Stephen Barclay says no, we're going back to square one here. A lot of finger-pointing at each other, the blame game seems to be starting. </p><p>Michel Barnier says he is not interested in that, he just wants to get deal done. Theresa May is getting ready to go before the MPs on Tuesday, the EU is saying look, we have done everything we can and therein lies the deadlock, we are not going anywhere very fast, it would seem. Thank you. Head teachers are accusing the Education Minister of not meeting with them to discuss their concerns over funding. Yesterday, thousands of head teachers sent letters to parents, asking them to lobby the government for more money. The Government says school spending is at its highest ever level, and that the core budget has been ringfenced since 2010. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. Energy supplies are slowly being restored in Venezuela after the longest power black-out in living memory. The power cuts started on Thursday, with the President and the opposition blaming each other for the outage. Most of the country was without power for more than 24 hours. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses, compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a 9% increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. Internet users should have greater control over their personal data to ensure their safety online. That is part of a plan to change the way big tech companies are regulated. This follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee, that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had the graphic images about self harm online. Lolly's father has said he believed social media was partly to blame for death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nationstate, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies that if we feel they need to do some things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering digital world, no-one body has complete oversight, so the boards recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There is also a call for classification framework, similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to strictly regulate Internet companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harm. Events to mark the 60th birthday of Barbie are taking place across the world today. The doll is going to make an appearance at a number of locations, including a Barbie pop-up experience in New York. The toy's manufacturer, Mattel, describe her as \"the number one fashion doll\", designed to inspire girls.

I'm just trying to get a Thank you for your time this sense of scale over your criticism of the government at this point in time. Because many people have said the government isn't doing enough. We've heard that before. How great you see the problem? The problem is huge. I did my report in 2008, four children in the digital world, and I recommended there should be a voluntary code of practice so that social media companies could self regulate, but they needed to work together. UK Council for Child Internet Safety was set up following my recommendation so they could work together. Ten years later this hasn't happened and government now is saying, let's see if we can get a voluntary code of practice. It is now too late. We lost over -- got over 500 reports of sexual offences against children. That's 15 day in 2016 and 17 and last year when finally the law came in, the anti- grooming law, in six months we have 1300 offences against children. So it is enough now. The social media companies have been left to mark their own home work, they haven't done it. My recommendation was ten years ago, it hasn't been done. It's not good enough now to give them another ten years to see if they can get a voluntary code of practice up and running. We need a mandatory code and a regulator so that there is transparency and we can see annual reports about child safety, child endangerment, how it is being managed and we specific rules, so the social media companies are held to account and find if they don't stick to those rules around child protection and child safety online. Are you saying that the government's inertia on this has damaged or put at risk more young people? I think we know for example in the last four years tragically to young people we know have lost their lives because of online grooming, which led to contact abuse and murder. We know of the 1300 grooming offences in the past six months, as we've seen as the new law has come in. What is worrying with the internet safety strategy is that the green paper will come out at some stage and grooming will not be included in that paper. Grooming is seen under the jurisdiction of the Home Office. So already we are seeing that really important aspects are being left out and the point is this can be done. We know these big tech companies have bots and algorithms that can target advertising the people. In Germany, they will find social media companies that don't remove extremist content. We also know, as we recently heard, that a whistleblower said there was a backlog of child engage in reports. -- endangerment. It is not being done properly. We are talking about child safety and social media companies have had ten years and they haven't done anything in a joined up way that the public understands. It's not enough now for the to give them more time and then say, maybe we will think about legislation. Time is up. There are quotes from Theresa May. She was speaking in Davos.

In terms of a voluntary code, I think it would be better if we were to put something more permanent in law because I think you can't actually do enough for children's safety and for everyone's safety, so, yes, those things will be good. I understand why companies may not wish to have that, at a thinker would be good. reccomendations in that report ten Tanya Byron who made the original years ago joins us now from London. Thank you for your time this morning. I'm just trying to get a sense of scale over your criticism of the government at this point in time. Because many people have said the government isn't doing enough. We've heard that before. How great you see the problem? The problem is huge. I did my report in 2008, four children in the digital world, and I recommended there should be a voluntary code of practice so that social media companies could self regulate, but they needed to work together. UK Council for Child Internet Safety was set up following my recommendation so they could work together. Ten years later this hasn't happened and government now is saying, let's see if we can get a voluntary code of practice. It is now too late. We lost over -- got over 500 reports of sexual offences against children. That's 15 day in 2016 and 17 and last year when finally the law came in, the anti- grooming law, in six months we have 1300 offences against children. So it is enough now. The social media companies have been left to mark their own home work, they haven't done it. My recommendation was ten years ago, it hasn't been done. It's not good enough now to give them another ten years to see if they can get a voluntary code of practice up and running. We need a mandatory code and a regulator so that there is transparency and we can see annual reports about child safety, child endangerment, how it is being managed and we specific rules, so the social media companies are held to account and find if they don't stick to those rules around child protection and child safety online. Are you saying that the government's inertia on this has damaged or put at risk more young people? I think we know for example in the last four years tragically to young people we know have lost their lives because of online grooming, which led to contact abuse and murder. We know of the 1300 grooming offences in the past six months, as we've seen as the new law has come in. What is worrying with the internet safety strategy is that the green paper will come out at some stage and grooming will not be included in that paper. Grooming is seen under the jurisdiction of the Home Office. So already we are seeing that really important aspects are being left out and the point is this can be done. We know these big tech companies have bots and algorithms that can target advertising the people. In Germany, they will find social media companies that don't remove extremist content. We also know, as we recently heard, that a whistleblower said there was a backlog of child engage in reports. -- endangerment. It is not being done properly. We are talking about child safety and social media companies have had ten years and they haven't done anything in a joined up way that the public understands. It's not enough now for the to give them more time and then say, maybe we will think about legislation. Time is up. There are quotes from Theresa May. She was speaking in Davos. I suspect you followed this. The quote was, shareholders should pressure the Burmese to take their responsibility towards protecting their users seriously. screen. And on BBC radio London. I am back in 30 minutes. towards protecting their users seriously. I think the responsibility lies with everybody and I think you have had a great piece prior to talking to me with fantastic parents who obviously really preparing their children to use the online space safely and are aware of how their children are using the online space.
