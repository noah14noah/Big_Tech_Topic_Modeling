In the past three months, people have relied on their smartphones and computers to make sense of the so-called new normal in a socially distant world. From classrooms to boardroom meetings, shopping to medical appointments, the virtual space has helped us overcome disruptions and allowed us to continue working, learning, and getting business done. This is the future that the UAE has been preparing for 20 years. Now, as the world finds its calling through technology, more tectonic shifts could be underway. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council, in his speech to the UN's Roadmap for Digital Cooperation stressed that countries need to \"invest in what is to come, not what is already there.\" This is crucial if they have to prepare for future disruptions and can only be done through new global partnerships and alliances.</p><p>No one could have predicted the pace at which the world is shifting to digital technology. Just a few months ago, in 2019, there was rising scepticism about the growing influence of Big Tech. There was a great deal of distrust, and some leaders in the West even suggested breaking up Net monopolies to contain the virality of these technologies. None of the concerns have been resolved, yet most of the digital transformations that we see now are being enabled by tech firms. Governments are tying up with tech companies to develop contact tracing apps, and finding ways to tackle this pandemic. The sector's advances has proven to be beneficial for humanity, and this is why governments should use this crisis to build alliances and a framework for the larger good of humanity. Big Tech can truly make a difference to our lives, if guided by governments and policy makers. Common rules and regulations are key to protect the interest of users and their privacy. Digital collaborations across the world must be promoted and sustained. Every individual should have access to high-quality internet. Tech inclusivity is the aim of futuristic governments like the UAE who are ready for more disruptions that come their way. Millions in poor countries deserve to be digitally literate and it is a delight to note that the UAE is taking the lead to make these technologies more accessible to the masses. New and transformative digital connections have become a way of life and have driven social progress in a record three months. It's time to take the disruption forward.</p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/28/44/26/159211804346.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/28/44/26/159211804346.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-177041814</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:604G-7J31-F11P-X364-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"435\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

This legislation would restore the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Obama-era \"net neutrality\" regulations which were repealed in December 2017. If signed into law, this bill would reimpose regulations such as full government takeover of the internet, eventual taxation of the internet, future innovation would be restricted, and internet access for rural America would again be greatly limited.</p><p>\"I believe it is important we preserve a free and open internet and ensure all Americans have access to affordable and reliable internet. Instead, this bill would allow big tech companies like Google and Facebook to undermine the privacy of the American people. It also limits internet access to rural areas throughout West Tennessee. This bill does not represent the needs and values of the American people, especially West Tennessean's, and I was proud to vote against it,\" said Rep.

This legislation would restore the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Obama-era \"net neutrality\" regulations which were repealed in December 2017. If signed into law, this bill would reimpose regulations such as full government takeover of the internet, eventual taxation of the internet, future innovation would be restricted, and internet access for rural America would again be greatly limited.</p><p>\"I believe it is important we preserve a free and open internet and ensure all Americans have access to affordable and reliable internet. Instead, this bill would allow big tech companies like Google and Facebook to undermine the privacy of the American people. It also limits internet access to rural areas throughout West Tennessee. This bill does not represent the needs and values of the American people, especially West Tennessean's, and I was proud to vote against it,\" said Rep. Kustoff.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://kustoff.house.gov/media/press-releases/kustoff-votes-protect-our-free-and-open-internet\">https://kustoff.house.gov/media/press-releases/kustoff-votes-protect-our-free-and-open-internet</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHM4109A1A841197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVT-D411-JCCP-04X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"189\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 10, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is Barry Ritholtz and this week I am thrilled to have sat down with Jim Chanos, hedge fund manager at Kynikos Associates for a very interesting and in-depth conversation; after we were done recording the radio portion, Jim sat around and we kept the tape running. And there's a ton of podcast extras. So after the show is done, be sure and listen to the rest of it. I think it's about 14 hours. And it's really -- anytime you get the chance to sit at the knee of somebody like Jim Chanos and ask questions and see where they go, you don't want to stop the tape running. He spoke for a long time and it was absolutely fascinating.</p><p>I don't know how many of you who are listening to this know Jim Chanos or are familiar with his work. But really it's a fascinating legacy. This is a guy who was an early short seller, who was an early critic of some of the worst excesses of Wall Street, whether it was misbehavior of analysts or accounting fraud or things that companies were doing, that were defrauding and misleading investors.</p><p>Jim has the combination of a accountant's ability to dive into the numbers and detective's ability to sniff out nonsense. And he has done it throughout his whole career. He's identified a number of tremendous frauds and scams, whether it was Baldwin Piano, which ran an insurance scam on the side, Enron WorldCom, go down the whole list. He has really been crucial to investors in ferreting out fraud and using his skill set to make money for his investors by basically identifying short selling opportunities where there's some bad behavior, fraud, whatever it is.</p><p>So this is a wide-ranging and fascinating conversation that I was thrilled to have. Be sure and check out the podcast extras afterwards. And on with the show.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Today I am thrilled to bring you someone who you may not know who he is, but you actually should. His name is Jim Chanos. He is the manager of -- let me see if I'm pronouncing this correctly -- Kynikos Associates. That's Greek for \"cynic.\" And Jim has built a reputation over 30 years as a spotter of wrongdoing and fraud, a short seller, somebody who's identified a lot of problems with various companies in the market.</p><p>Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p>JAMES CHANOS, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, KYNIKOS ASSOCIATES: Thanks, Barry. Glad to be here.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So I've wanted to have you on for a long time because most of the people we speak to are long-term, mostly long only investors, who are looking at here's what you need to do to save money for retirement, or if you're a pension fund or an endowment, here's what you do -- need to do to make sure you stay ahead of inflation.</p><p>But your approach as a short seller is completely different.</p><p>Why don't you describe that so people have an idea of what you actually do in Kynikos Associates?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, one way to describe it, Barry, is that we are a long-term potential purchasers of equities.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I like that.</p><p>CHANOS: The whole idea of fundamental short selling really is select a portfolio of securities, mostly stocks, that are fundamentally overvalued no matter what the market does. that these are companies that, through the normal ebbs and flows of capitalism, are on the downside of their cycle.</p><p>And our clients, primarily, are institutions who use us as a hedge to their core equity portfolio. And so therefore it allows them to be a little bit more aggressive in their equity exposures, knowing that they have part of the portfolio in a small group of companies that will go down over time -- we hope and we think --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You expect. So the people who are listening to this, who are in the industry, certainly know who you are. But regular investors, radio listeners may not know who you are.</p><p>So let me discuss your curriculum vitae for a second. You first came into the public eye as an analyst at -- was it Gilford (ph) Securities way back when?</p><p>And you had identified one of Wall Street's favorite stocks, which at the time was an insurance company called Baldwin and you had essentially figured out that it was a sham. It was a giant insurance scam that was cooking their books -- this is a theme we'll come to again and again -- and people mocked the call, \"The Wall Street Journal\" had a pretty aggressive articulate that pretty much trashed your analysis and ultimately you had the last laugh, because it's almost quaint to say at the time, when Baldwin went bankrupt, at $9 billion, it was the largest bankruptcy in history, although we know, oh, $9 billion, that's adorable compared to what we've seen since then.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, back then it wasn't so adorable.</p><p>Well, Baldwin was -- Baldwin United was the old Baldwin Piano Company, which had morphed under very charismatic CEO into an aggressive seller of insurance products, particularly annuities, through Wall Street.</p><p>And therefore it became a Wall Street darling in the early '80s on the back of not only the rapid earnings growth, but also because Wall Street was being paid by Baldwin.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Five percent commission on a policy --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that buys a lot of goodwill on the street --</p><p>CHANOS: Well, it does. And particularly when you're offering yields on these insurance products that were as high as 14 percent. The problem was Baldwin wasn't earning anything close to that in its insurance portfolios. So they ultimately had to begin doing acquisitions and getting insurance department approval to fund those acquisitions with insurance company money, which is highly, highly unusual.</p><p>And that was the beginning of the end for them.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you were a kid then.</p><p>How old were you when you made that call?</p><p>CHANOS: I wrote -- my sense of timing was impeccable. I put out my first solo recommendation on the company on the absolute bottom of the market, the day that Henry Kaufman (ph) said buys stocks in August of 1982. I think it was August 17th of 1982.</p><p>I said sell the -- or sell this thing short. And --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: About 25 bucks, is that about right?</p><p>CHANOS: I think it was about $25. It went briefly to $20 and then straight to $55.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Doubled.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, it was a good -- it was a good initiation into fundamental short selling. But the interesting thing about that story was we -- first report when we did a follow-up report was that a lot of the radioactive aspect of Baldwin was hiding in plain sight. It was -- it was -- you could see it if you looked at the publicly available documents the SEC filings and their insurance company statements, which were public.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So here's the question you're going to hear me ask you repeatedly this afternoon.</p><p>How is it that this was in plain view, a $9 billion fraud, and nobody else could spot it?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, first of all, it wasn't in a lot of people's interest to spot it because the analysts who were covering the company most closely and had buy ratings on this thing were also working for the firms that sold the annuities. So it was also a good introduction to the whole concept of conflict of interest.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: To say the least.</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>And number two, you had to do a little bit of digging. And I think in many ways, not being insurance analysts, just being a young analyst who was learning about insurance, I just simply kept asking questions of things that didn't seem to make sense to me. And most of the answers had -- were logical but every once in a while, it would come back with something that was just simply nonsensical.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That sounds very familiar. That reminds me a little bit of what took place so in the future with Enron.</p><p>So this was '82. Most people probably this never entered their radar.</p><p>But Enron, on the other hand, entered a lot of people's radar and in fact that's probably how anyone who's a member of the public or the investing community who knows you probably found you through Enron, which is a remarkably similar story.</p><p>CHANOS: It was. And in what would seem even more interesting about it was that not only were the facts at Enron hiding in plain sight -- there's been a lot written about that -- but Enron, using their mark-to- model accounting, where they pulled forward future profit estimates, Baldwin was doing the same exact thing with its annuities. They were estimating a spread of income -- which they weren't earning, of course --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Which may or may not have existed, depending on future --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- and then they -- and then they estimate how long the policies would stay on the books and they took the present value and they sold the policy. And so --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right, not accounting for the fact that interest rates fluctuate and other factors --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they were writing this down as if it was money good.</p><p>CHANOS: Right, exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Coming up, we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, manager of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. And today I'm speaking to famed short seller Jim Chanos.</p><p>We were talking a little bit about how Enron was so similar to Baldwin. And you had mentioned, you read the 10(k), you read the annual report, you read the quarterly report three times. You still have no idea what they hell they do.</p><p>CHANOS: Right. The other -- the other interesting similarity was they both had charismatic leaders, who were very bright; Baldwin had a guy by the name of Morley Thompson (ph) and -- who went from literally peddling pianos door-to-door. (INAUDIBLE) good salesmen to sell pianos door-to- door.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And strong (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>CHANOS: And morphing into financial services and of course Enron had Jeff Skilling (ph) and to a lesser extent Ken Lay.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And so when we first started looking at Enron, Enron decided to make a market in everything from energy trading to you name it, they were going to take everything, turn it into a tradable commodity, whether or not it should be is a whole different discussion.</p><p>What was the first warning sign that you saw with Enron?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, it's actually -- it was a column written by John Wilde (ph). He wrote a piece in the Texas \"Wall Street Journal\" in the fall of 2000, where he pointed out that energy merchant banks had just gotten a favorable ruling from the SEC on this mark-to-model accounting. So much for the Baldwin type stuff.</p><p>And a friend of mine running a hedge fund in Dallas, Texas, called it to my attention. And of course email was rudimentary; he faxed it to me. And I read the piece and immediately --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: '97, '98 --</p><p>CHANOS: -- this was in 2000 --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- far along.</p><p>CHANOS: -- and immediate cracked the 1999 10(k) and March and June 10(q)s of Enron and immediately began to see all kinds of odd things. In addition we noticed right away that not only was there a lot of insider selling throughout 2000 in Enron stock, but there were a number of key high-level executive departures. And that's -- those two -- those two in conjunction, often there will be insider selling to start.</p><p>But when you see insider selling across the executive suite as well as executive departures, there's usually something wrong.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes. That's quite fascinating. And so you start digging in and what's the - -you begin working with Bethany McLean, then of -- still of \"Fortune.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- ultimately end up writing the book, \"Smartest Guys in the Room,\" and what were the next couple of things that you uncovered in digging into Enron?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the -- I had to -- two -- my partner at the time, Doug Millett (ph) and an analyst who's now my current partner, Chuck Hobbs (ph), we -- the three of us dug into the financials. And one of the first things Doug pointed out was this is nothing more than a leveraged hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline, which I think was the -- still the best apt description of Enron.</p><p>But as we dug into the numbers, there were a few odd things right away. We noticed that even with their sort of odd accounting, the company was only earning 6 percent pretax on its capital. And --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: In a period when everybody's just making --</p><p>CHANOS: Right. And in which people are -- were paying five times book for this -- the stock. So --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: For a 6 percent ROI on --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- five times NAV for a hedge fund that was earning 6 percent? No, you wouldn't.</p><p>So that was the first thing.</p><p>Number two, I noticed immediately they weren't matching their -- in that -- there's an accounting principle called matching similar gains and losses. And they had a merchant banking arm that did things like sell energy barges or construct utility plants.</p><p>And when they had a gain, they would put it through the merchant banking operating income line. But it appeared to me that when they looked like they were going to lose money on something, they held it as a discontinued asset, held for sale for a year, and then put it below the operating income line so people disregarded it as an extraordinary event.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So they buried what should have been an ordinary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- should have matched everything as net, net profit. Instead they basically showed their winners and tried you to disregard the losers. That was another flag.</p><p>The third one is -- were these odd footnotes that said there was a group of entities set up by an executive of Enron to trade with Enron or an executive -- senior executive of the company was the general partner of the entities. And, I mean, that was an immediate red flag to, well, what were these entities and why is a --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, how can you be a counterparty with himself?</p><p>CHANOS: -- this person conflicted.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And we now know those were the famous raptors and LJMs and these off-balance sheet entities --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right, side pockets and -- I believe it was McKenzie (ph) who came up with some of the concepts for that, if not those exact ones, but that philosophical structure came from --</p><p>CHANOS: -- came from --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- from McKenzie, that's right.</p><p>So quite fascinating.</p><p>And now let's fast forward. So ultimately Enron collapses after having a huge run-up. it takes a year to fall from about 89 bucks, 83 bucks, if memory serves, down to zero. It was -- it was glacial; if you're short, you must be champing at the bit. That's something I want to talk to you about a little later.</p><p>The mindset of how do you stay short a position fundamentally when it's running up against you and even when it starts -- I remember Lehman Brothers, when we were short, Lehman, when we watched it collapse, every time it fell and looked like it was about to just freefall, there would be this squeeze. There would be this move back up.</p><p>In '07, '08, you were short most of that whole area. We're talking about investment banks, builders, commercial banks. What else were you short in the credit sector before the collapse?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we have a rule that we don't -- we don't short anybody we do business with. And since we did agency business most of the brokers, we were not short Lehman or Bear. We actually were prime broker, a client of Bear. But there certainly -- in the credit area, there was a lot of -- a lot of things to do.</p><p>I mean, the Florida homebuilders, West Coast homebuilders, building supply companies, the credit rating agencies, a number of banks that were pretty aggressive --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Bond insurance companies?</p><p>CHANOS: -- bond insurance companies, yes, yes. Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And (INAUDIBLE) around the same time.</p><p>CHANOS: NBIA.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: NBIA was the other one. They all freefell down to single digits.</p><p>CHANOS: And the -- you're exactly right. I mean, typically, stocks that are fundamentally flawed, where the equity is worthless, you will have a number of vicious rallies, often 50-60 percent.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Unbelievable. And you look at that and you say, who the hell is buying this junk? This is a stock cut in half that should be going to zero and yet you end up with the floor underneath these freefalling stocks and those squeezes are incredibly painful to live through, if -- especially if you're counting your money before you close that position.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we never do that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's always a bad thing to do.</p><p>CHANOS: But I would point out that one of the ways that you alleviate that a little bit is that people tend to think about the short side very discretely. And often because a lot of money managers who actually do short stocks may only be short a handful of stocks versus quite a few longs.</p><p>And in our -- in our case, it's a whole portfolio. I mean, in the U.S., typically historically over 30 years, we've averaged about 50 names in the portfolio at any given time.</p><p>So no one position is an unusually large amount --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: 3-4-5 percent, is that --</p><p>CHANOS: Well, 5 percent would be the top. But I mean, typically average is 2 percent.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Coming up, we delve into the mind of the short seller as we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, chairman of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. I am privileged to be speaking to a master of the short side, Jim Chanos.</p><p>Earlier we were talking about the short in Baldwin and Enron, as well as all the financials heading into '08. I recall reading a fabulous profile of you in \"New York\" magazine, the end of 2008, and I don't know if they were talking about a specific fund or generally but they were saying you were up 50 percent for the year in '08. I know you may not be able to comment on numbers. We all work with compliance and lawyers and what have you.</p><p>But '08 turned out to be a pretty good year for you.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, but the way we gauge ourself (sic), Barry, is actually versus the market and, in fact, although we have partnerships and offshore funds that you can invest in that are -- appear short and the numbers are what they are, the bulk of our business is our managed account business, where we're a large pension fund or endowment or sovereign wealth fund, gives us assets to manage short.</p><p>And in those cases, we're benchmarked versus the market inversely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So if the market goes up 10 percent, your benchmark is -10 percent?</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly. And so to the extent -- for example, if the market goes up 20 percent and we're flat for that account, you know, it's as if we were up 20 percent. And we're compensated in performance view on that.</p><p>Conversely, if the market goes down 40 percent and we're up 40 percent, we make no performance --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's flat.</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly. So it's a crude alpha measure. And that's really the way the firm has survived in a market that's up 2,000 percent, as you point out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Since 1985, since you launched the firm, and this is the fascinating thing about running a short firm when, by the way, a lot of your colleagues who are in that space haven't survived as long as you have.</p><p>So since you launched in '85, the S&amp;P 500 is up over 2,000 percent and yet you've managed to thrive as a short seller.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. We're up -- on a stand-alone basis, our flagship fund, which goes back to '85 -- I think is up a couple percent compounded. But when you factor that into the fact that -- offset it on the long side and rebalance monthly, the alpha is somewhere in the mid-teens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's fantastic.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's actually what -- that's how we get paid and that's how people evaluate us. And so --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You exist to create a hedge to institutions, pension funds, endowments, who, by definition, are, for the most part, long only.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the -- another way to think of it is we're an insurance policy that actually pays like premiums --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: As opposed to the not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- being upset when you --</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Exactly. And so I think that's -- I've quipped that Kynikos is, in effect, an insurance business. And it's not -- it's not, I think, an unreasonable analogy.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's talk. We have a few minutes left in the segment.</p><p>Let's talk about what it's like to be upside down in a position that's running against you.</p><p>Baldwin is a perfect example. You put this out at 25, drops to 20. You feel like a genius for five points. Next thing you know, it more than doubles, it almost triples from there.</p><p>How do you have the constitution -- like I know a lot of guys who can compartmentalize. I think I can compartmentalize. But the vast majority of investors, you know, the old joke is how did you sleep with the -- all your positions going against you? Like a baby. I woke up every two hours, cried for Mommy and wet myself.</p><p>A lot of people don't have that constitution to -- so how do you sleep at night with positions running against you?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, I think the -- it is -- it is personality based. I think -- I used to think when I started the business that shorting stocks fundamentally was just simply the mirror image of going long. And I've said publicly many times, I don't think that's the case anymore. I think a lot of it's rooted in behavioral finance. I think we're all by and large, we're listeners to this show and others are the product of positive reinforcement cycles.</p><p>And most people's rational decision-making studies have shown breaks down in an environment negative reinforcement. And if you're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in other words when positions going against you, their discipline goes away when they need it --</p><p>CHANOS: -- well, and the ultimate example, which will be something like an interrogation. And so the ability to withhold information. So if you're long in the market, you're constantly -- when I come in every day, we have 50 stocks in the U.S., another 40 globally, you know, I can pretty much be sure that 20 percent of my names will have a research note out, a buy recommendation, earnings estimates raised.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Something's moving.</p><p>CHANOS: The CEO and Bloomberg, whatever the case might be. And most of that is noise. But it's the noise that most people in the market are used to. And I call it the Muzak of the investment business.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I'm going to pull a quote I was saving for before, because it's so dead-on.</p><p>You called it \"the cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: And so most people -- as I say, they're used to that. But if you're a short seller or you're a negative -- on a situation, you're being told constantly you're wrong. And here's why. And you know, 50-page research report to follow.</p><p>And I think that not everyone has the ability to simply drown that out and say, OK. That's all well and good. But that's in the price of the stock. Do we know that? And the facts that I have are very important and the market doesn't really know that or appreciate how important they are.</p><p>So I'm not sure. I think the research is the same. And I think that good research can be taught both on long and short side and should be the same. I think the ability to deal with the noise, the swing factors, the volatility, I think that's a different attribute.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We continue our conversation with famed short seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates. And we'll discuss the role of the short seller in modern markets. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. I'm thrilled to be speaking with Jim Chanos -- am I pronouncing Kynikos -- is that -- correctly?</p><p>CHANOS: Oh, you're ready to go to Greece --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Kynikos associates, Kynikos, which translates as \"cynic.\" And you have spent a couple of cynical but lucrative decades on Wall Street, calling out the nonsense that passes for ordinary Wall Street noise.</p><p>Let's talk a little bit about the role of the short seller in markets. And here it is. It's five years past the financial crisis. People forget it wasn't the banks overleveraged and writing all this junk CDS and AIG writing the $3 trillion worth of derivatives with exactly $0 reserved for it. It was you short sellers that caused the crisis.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, sure was.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: How do you defend yourself for bringing the world to the edge of the abyss?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, you never --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And by the way, that was at the highest levels of -- we heard that from the ECB, we heard that crap from Treasury. We heard that from everywhere. And it was just despite Enron and WorldCom and a whole slew of fraud uncovered by short sellers, including Lehman Brothers.</p><p>How does anybody actually say that?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, you remember, Barry, right after Bear Stearns collapsed, a group of bankers who shall go nameless from New York, went down to Washington and sat with senators from New York and elsewhere and with Treasury Secretary Paulson, whatever. And they asked for two things. They didn't ask for forgiveness for their crazy lending and leveraging, they didn't ask for forbearance on capital levels, which they were going to need.</p><p>Instead they asked for a relaxation of the accounting rules, a mark- to-market. And they asked for a ban or curbs on short selling of their shares. And that, to us, was very telling, because it told you where their mindset was. It wasn't about what actually they had done on their balance sheets and they way they had accounted for them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Repo 103?</p><p>CHANOS: Oh, and all kinds of --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- fine, moving stuff off balance sheet each quarter, what harm --</p><p>CHANOS: -- 105 was the least of it. But I mean, just saying they were more worried about it being uncovered and/or having to mark things profitably or -- excuse me, properly. In fact, I mean, a year earlier than that, at a G7 meeting, I was asked, along with Paul Singer -- and this is public information --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is the spring of '07?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes and --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before anything --</p><p>CHANOS: -- in April of '07, we actually briefed the G7 at their Washington meetings on -- we were asked to give a talk about hedge funds and the risks of hedge funds. And Paul and I gave a presentation on the looming credit crisis. He did it on the structure of structured finance and how unstable it was. And I did it on bank balance sheets and how loaded to the gills international banks were with the stuff Paul had just talked about.</p><p>And it was met with, you know, some would say, at best polite applause or, at most, a stifled yawn.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Now did these guys actually get it? Or were you talking way over their -- ?</p><p>CHANOS: No, no, they got it. I mean, there were -- there were people from the Fed there. There were people, you know, Gordon Brown, the future U.K. prime minister was in the room. You know, a future Treasury Secretary was in the room, future ECB central banker was in the room. I mean, these were serious people and I think that --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, which future Treasury Secretary or serious people, I think, an argument can be made that that Venn diagram has very little lovelife.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we'll leave it -- let you make that statement. But I'm just saying that that again -- I mean, for people to say that nobody warned or could see this coming, and Gillian Tett, in her book, \"Fool's Gold,\" has a chapter on that meeting, which I think is worth the read. But --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And she was one of the people in the \"FT,\" pounding away about this long before Lehman and AIG collapsed. And it was -- you had to willfully look away if you didn't want to see --</p><p>CHANOS: Willful blindness, which is a concept I teach in my financial fraud history class, willful blindness is a very, very strong argument.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- up in New Haven, if memory --</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I teach at Yale SOM.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's great. That sounds like it must be a fascinating -- how do you find the kids these days?</p><p>CHANOS: I think they're -- well, mine aren't kids, because they're mostly students in their late 20s, but --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Those are kids.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: I -- it's a great class and I get as much out of it as I hope they do. It's a good group and we basically look at some models, historically, of fraud, academic models and then do case-by-case, going back to the 1690s. And it's remarkable as to how these cycles actually keep repeating with many of the same methods, just right up to date.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So who's uncovered more fraud? Various regulatory agencies? Or hedge funds and others who short? How do you -- what's that scorecard look like?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I'd like to say that virtually all major frauds over the past 20-30 years have really been uncovered by either internal whistleblowers, journalists and/or short sellers. Very, very few have been uncovered by regulatory agencies or law enforcement, very few.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And yet the first thing that happens in the crisis is -- first things we do, blame all the short sellers.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Well, that's -- a friend of mine named Bob Sloan wrote a great book about that, a history, called \"Blame the Shorts.\" And it has a long, long storied history also going back to the 1600s where people really will point fingers to those who have profited when -- when they've lost money. And -- and that's human nature, I think.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So now let's sidestep a little bit or -- or just change a little bit. We've been talking about accounting fraud. We haven't even gotten to the role of the accountants, but clearly, the -- the big four, big five -- I don't even know how many are left -- are major enablers of what takes place with -- with many of these, uh, shorts, but now let's -- let's focus on the C-suite and corporate management.</p><p>You recently put out a commentary about buy-backs as little more than financial engineering and speculation in the market by the CEOs of America, whose track record in dabbling in market timing is especially awful.</p><p>What -- what don't you like about buy-backs?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, first of all, in -- in aggregate, every CEO, of course, always thinks their stock is undervalued. We -- we -- we know that.</p><p>But what...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Except when they're selling.</p><p>CHANOS: -- what worries -- well, well, we'll get to that in a second.</p><p>But what worries me is that corporate America, in aggregate, has pre- tax returns on capital in the mid to high teens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: The long-term expected rate of the equity markets is roughly half that. And when corporations are embarked on massive buy-backs across all industries and all companies, in effect, these CEOs are buying the stock market.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Right?</p><p>So what they're telling you then is -- is unequivocally that they think that either they're happy to earn the stock market rate of return or maybe something hopefully better...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Which -- which is half what you would expect...</p><p>CHANOS: -- or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- their rate of return...</p><p>CHANOS: -- or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>CHANOS: -- their rate of return on the margin of any new capital product is much, much lower -- in fact, half or less, of what -- of what is stated. And that does not bode well for the -- the future of profits or for the quality of earnings reported as current profits.</p><p>There's one additional problem with this whole thing, and that is, number one, the CEOs making this decision typically have a very short tenure at companies.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: They're not thinking long-term.</p><p>And number two, we're seeing an increase in insider selling concurrent with the increase in buy-backs.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So out of one side of the mouth...</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They're saying the...</p><p>CHANOS: They...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- the companies should be buying stock...</p><p>CHANOS: But maybe I should be lightening up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- but I'm going to -- right. That's -- that's it. You know, my...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- my favorite data point on stock buy-backs is that Dell, now a private company, spent more money on buy-backs than they earned over their entire...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- lifetime. That -- that's just an astonishing figure.</p><p>CHANOS: And I think that -- well, I think you see that in companies like sears, as well. But -- but the -- for a lot of companies, the other problem with this, of course, is is that CEOs are terrible market timers.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: They're always buying back stu -- the previous peak in corporate buy-back activity was the second quarter of 2007.</p><p>And -- and where was the low?</p><p>The second quarter 2009.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You see the same thing with acquisitions and mergers.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They love to do...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: With inflated stock -- to buy inflated stock...</p><p>CHANOS: Corporate activity...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) stuff is cheap...</p><p>CHANOS: -- follows the market -- basically follows or is coincident with the market.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: It's not a leading indicator.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So we have buy-backs as financial engineering.</p><p>What about dividends?</p><p>A little more credible than?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, a little bit more credible and -- and I think certainly where -- any time you see the actual cash go out the door, um, the other interesting observation we've -- we've made in looking at corporate financial transactions is that increasingly, we're seeing acquisitions which are not taken out of most analysts' free cash flow numbers, acquisitions are replacing CAPEX, corporal -- capital spending or R&amp;D. So companies are buying their -- their R&amp;D or their -- their -- their capital. And that should probably be properly deducted from the free cash flow, because, in aggregate, corporate America is not growing.</p><p>So they're -- by buying each other, you know, and buying divisions of each other, in effect, they're -- they're capitalizing their R&amp;D. Um, and, I think that that's an interesting obser -- and that particularly applies for big tech...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- which are perceived as very cheap companies. If you actually look at them, the only reason their revenues aren't declining at a -- at a reasonable rate is because they're -- they're buying other companies.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We sort of stated these in the pharmaceutical area...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They quote a bunch of genomics, molecular, go down the list, as opposed to plowing money into their own R&amp;D...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- OK, let's go out and buy these new...</p><p>CHANOS: And, again...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: -- and rather than expensing the R&amp;D, they're capitalizing by purchasing. They can set it up as goodwill. And so it's overstating their earnings. And that -- that's a key point that we were trying to hone in on, that -- that companies that grow this way by acquisition are most likely overstating their earnings meaningfully.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And we've seen a ton of acquisitions, maybe not as much as at other peaks, but the M&amp;A activity, along with the IPO activity has certainly picked up fairly appreciably in the past couple of quarters.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, and the M&amp;A activity gives rise, we worry -- we're -- we think and worry, on a really drop in the quality of earnings. And -- and that, I think, drives a lot of M&amp;A activity, the ability to write down inventories, write down receivables, write up liabilities and basically give yourself, in effect, what -- what Herb Greenberg has called a cookie jar going forward to help manage your earnings.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I've been speaking with James Chanos, chairman of Kynikos Associates. You can listen to more of our conversation with Jim in our podcast extra, which is available on Bloomberg View, on SoundCloud and at Apple iTunes, as well as the Bloomberg Radio Plus App.</p><p>Coming up next week, we sit down with former FDIC Chairperson Sheila Bair, which is a really fascinating conversation.</p><p>Be sure and check out my daily column on bloombergview.com or follow me on Twitter @ritholtz. At my blog, I posted a whole bunch of unrelated but interesting items. That's ritholtz.com.</p><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p>You're listening to Masters In Business on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This concludes the broadcast portion of our interview.</p><p>Coming up with our guest, the radio podcast extra.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Today, I've been speaking with James Chanos of Kynikos Associates.</p><p>And we've been talking generally about short-selling and what it's like to run short funds.</p><p>What I love to do in these segments, when we finish broadcasting on the air and go to the podcast, is talk a little bit about you.</p><p>You started in this business as an analyst. We talked about Baldwin and eventually Enron. But when you were an up-and-comer, when you were the age of the kids you're teaching at Yale, who were your influences?</p><p>Who -- who are formative to the Jim Chanos approach to investment?</p><p>CHANOS: Um, you know, it's -- it's hard to find lots of people that you can point to who -- who did what I did. I mean I -- I was blessed when I was a young analyst at -- at Gilford Securities doing Baldwin that, um, we had a number of -- of well-known hedge fund managers who actually were our clients, people like Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, um, and I got to meet shortly after that when I moved to New York in '83, Julian Robertson. One of the people that probably had the most influence on me just passed away, uh, and that was -- it was sort of the legendary Bob Wilson...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: -- who was a -- was a -- not only a great investor, but a -- but an amazing philanthropist. And, uh, I used to have -- I used to have dinner with him or lunch with him from time to time. And he was a -- he had -- he was written up by John Train in \"The Money Masters.\" But he was of the legendary Resorts International short squeeze.</p><p>But he was a tremendous investor on the long side. And, um, he introduced me to people like Dick Gilder here in New York and -- all of whom early, 30 years ago, you know, I learned from another fellow, Stephen Peck, who was an amazing investor, a client of mine, a good friend, of Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh, sure.</p><p>CHANOS: And all these people were just sort of, you know, as I was getting going in New York, not only were they helpful in terms of their wisdom and their experience and what not to do and -- but also introduced me to lots of other people.</p><p>And -- and I think that that, you know, I'm indebted to all of them and -- and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few people.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you mentioned George Soros, clients early on.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And Julian Robertson, another legendary hedge fund manager.</p><p>CHANOS: And Mike -- Mike Steinhardt.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Steinhardt. Again, another guy, called by some the greatest trader on Wall Street ever. I don't know if that's an exaggeration, but people have said that about him.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean they -- it -- I had the -- the pleasure of running money for all three of those men. And -- and they all were different and a different temperament and -- and -- and I would categorize them completely different people, but all -- all amazing investors.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Hmmm. Interesting.</p><p>So you began as an analyst. You worked with some of the most storied names. Obviously, the industry has changed a lot since '83.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: A little bit.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: To think that a relatively unknown analyst at the time and a relatively small firm could get an audience with a Robertson or a Soros, that's not the sort of universe that we exist these days.</p><p>CHANOS: I think it would be a lot harder, I mean but -- but, first of all, people -- there weren't people putting out short-side research in -- in '80, even in '82 and '83 and -- and, uh, so, you know, I think the -- the Baldwin piece, a number of them were -- were short. A few of the people I just mentioned were short that. So it got me an audience with them early on, which I think was helpful.</p><p>But, um, I think it would be a lot tougher today. I mean I started my -- my own fund when I was 27.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p>CHANOS: And -- yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's 30 -- 30 plus years...</p><p>CHANOS: 1985, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And so that's almost exactly 30 years ago.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that -- that was just you and a partner and -- and how big is Kynikos today?</p><p>How many employees...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean we have, I think, 33 employees in -- in New York and London. And, uh, and obviously a little bit more sophisticated.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: It was just three of us, uh, at first and the two partners and a secretary. And my partner, a wonderful partner at the time who I brought with me from Deutsche Bank a year into it came to me and said, you know, I just don't think I -- I can do shorting stocks. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And -- and -- and sold his half back to me, um, for a - - for a nominal amount of money. Uh, and, you know, just walked out the door and prospered, by the way, mightily since doing his own thing.</p><p>So it -- it -- even when you think you can do it, sometimes you can't. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so you mentioned Deutsche Bank in -- in passing. If memory serves, they kind of showed you the door, didn't they?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Yes. In the summer of -- of '85, um, there was a full page -- a front page...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: \"Journal.\"..</p><p>CHANOS: -- monster article talking about these evil short sellers and -- and how they were disrupting these great businesses. Um, and in the middle of the article was -- was sort of -- was me. And a...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: -- and a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And this is even after Baldwin...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- had collapsed and...</p><p>CHANOS: And after a number of other calls we had made as well. And it, um, and so my -- my bosses in Frankfurt woke up that morning to see that, you know, Satan was working in their New York office. And I...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: -- I was told a -- I was told, by the end of the day, my contract, which was coming up, would not be renewed. I mean they didn't fire me, but they just simply said, you know, time for you to do something else.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Thanks. Thanks. Thanks, uh, here's your hat. Watch (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And then the postscript was I think nine of the 10 companies that were mentioned in that piece ultimately either went bankrupt or were prosecuted for fraud.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And any mea culpa from the right...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you know, obviously, you know someone is pulling the strings behind the scenes with that journalist and sends them down the wrong path.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean we were -- we were -- we were famously short a -- a lot of companies being run by a very aggressive investment bank out of Beverly Hills at the time. And I suspect that -- that that may or may not have had something to do with it.</p><p>Having said all that, (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Are we -- are we talking about Drexel or are we talking about somebody else?</p><p>CHANOS: No, we're talking about Drexel.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p>CHANOS: And a -- but -- but a -- one of the -- the, you know, serendipitous aspects was I had a client who had wanted me to run money for them as -- as a money manager, but because I was at a bank and it was...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You couldn't do it.</p><p>CHANOS: -- (INAUDIBLE) -- I couldn't do it. And so when I told them, yes, I was going to be looking for work, they said, well, why don't we set you up in business?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh.</p><p>CHANOS: So that's -- that's how -- that's how Kynikos Associates got started.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's unbelievable. I love stories like that.</p><p>You know, Ray Dalio has a similar story. You talk to a number of people, Jeff Gundlach, there are a lot of people who start in this business in one direction and, for whatever reason, end up making a turn and it's enormously successful.</p><p>CHANOS: I've often taught not only the -- the people who work for me, but my students that -- that's one of the things about business that you have to appreciate is that when good fortune, or bad fortune, comes your way, you have to know how to deal with it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And the bad fortune, you have to -- you have to rebound, you have to pick yourself up. But when good fortune comes, you have to grab it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and take advantage of it, because it will happen a number of times in your career just out of chance. And if you don't take advantage of it, you miss that chance to move your career ahead on -- in a quantum leap...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- and I think that I was fortunate, at the time, in that I was young, I was not quite married yet. I was about to get married, but I didn't have kids. And often I tell people the time to take risks, actually, is not after you're established in your career, when you have a wife and kids and a mortgage...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Too much to lose.</p><p>CHANOS: -- and -- and it's when you're younger and you're given an opportunity.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p>CHANOS: Because if it...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: What...</p><p>CHANOS: -- works, it's great. If it doesn't, no one is going to hold it against you.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And you have the ability...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You -- you lose a year or two. You can (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: You have an ability to get back up. And in -- particularly in America, which is an aspirational society, I think people, in many cases, even if it doesn't work, will admire that you tried.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: When -- when we speak to people from overseas, when we speak to people in Europe especially, one of the things we hear time and again, that they admire the most about America is failure isn't a fatal...</p><p>CHANOS: No.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- scarlet letter here. You know, henry Ford had five failed companies...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before Ford Motor Company. And the stories at Edison are legendary. He had hundreds of failed inventions before that light bulb finally...</p><p>CHANOS: As long as your work ethic...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: -- is good and -- and you're honest, people will value your ideas. And -- and -- and that is one of the great things about our society, that -- that I think sets us apart from almost any other developed economy. You fail in most other developed economies, you're done.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: That's it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: No second -- no second chapters elsewhere.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's not the case here at all.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So we talked about when you first launched. It was two guys and a secretary. Today, obviously, a much more sophisticated multinational entity. Take us through a -- a day in the life of Jim Chanos.</p><p>What time do you start work?</p><p>What -- what is your work flow like?</p><p>What do you do throughout the day?</p><p>I get the sense that you're not chained to Bloomberg all day watching every tick.</p><p>CHANOS: No, I'm not. I mean I have a trading desk that does that. But our -- our portfolio only turns over about once a year, so -- which is glacial by hedge funds.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Sure.</p><p>CHANOS: We're really investors. So I mean time spent looking at every tick is not time well spent for me. Looking at companies is more important for me.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: By -- by the way, that's a theme that's been pretty consistent. I can't begin to tell you how many investors we've spoken to who all pretty much say, if you -- if you have a good idea and a high degree of confidence, the day to day noise, that cacophony you mentioned...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- those fluctuations, it's meaningless noise and you have to have the con -- courage of your conviction.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean you need -- you need to have an intelligence post, as we do -- and I have a good one -- to -- to -- to point it all out to you. But you also need filters and you need to understand.</p><p>And one of the big differences, Barry, in the business now from when we started was back then, getting the information gave you a leg up.</p><p>So if you read the 10-Q because you got it a day or two before the rest of the Street and you saw something buried in -- in management's discussion, you had a piece of information that was, A, public, and, B, material. And it might move the stock and -- and there were lots of instances of that.</p><p>Um, nowadays, the information comes at you with a fire hose.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: I mean it truly does. And -- and the key is having, A, the right filters and the right staff and the right ability to -- to pull out what is the real information from just the absolute, you know, torrent of water coming at you. And -- and so that has changed a lot.</p><p>So I mean I -- I'll get up, you know, obviously, the older I get -- and you might appreciate this, you know, I might get a few -- up a few times at night anyway, but I'll get up, you know, early in the morning and check the markets and if nothing earth-shaking is happening in Asia or Europe and we have a desk that's 24-7, you know, I'll go back to sleep.</p><p>And then typically, you know, up -- up again early in the morning and then it's going through morning news, filings, research that comes in internally overnight, research that's come in externally overnight, um, you know, and -- and then the day may, depending on -- on my schedule, whatever.</p><p>But unfortunately, it's -- it's 24-7, you know, in a way that you know in that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I get the sense you read a lot throughout your day.</p><p>CHANOS: I read an awful lot whether I'm on the move or whatever, so, unfortunately, you know, you -- you have to stay connected. I'm trying to get to the point now where I am able to do it for Saturdays, but I'm trying to make Sundays a non-e-mail, non-electric -- non-electronic day, um, to just disconnect one day out of the week. I think that is becoming a little bit more important and a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's just a recharge day, just a...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, it's just a recharge day...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) it up a little bit.</p><p>CHANOS: And in the spring for eight weeks on -- in the afternoons on Monday, I teach. And that's been, actually, a -- a wonderful, wonderful adjunct to what I'm doing for all kinds of good reasons. And -- and -- and I think that's been a -- been -- been a wonderful plus. And my clients and partners have been very supportive of that -- of that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It -- it's just a change in the routine and it allows you to mix it up a little bit.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And it -- and it's great to interreact and go back to history, whether it's my history or history from 300 years ago, though sometimes it feels like I've lived 300 years.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Um, and -- and, impart, some of the stuff back to a -- back to students.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so you're teaching at Yale School of Management.</p><p>Am I recalling correctly, did you go undergrad to Yale?</p><p>CHANOS: I did. I did.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You did. OK.</p><p>CHANOS: I did, years ago.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you're back -- back in the dorms, effectively?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, well...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- not quite, but I -- I have two -- two sons who went, as well, and when I told them I was going back to teach and that maybe we could...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They were horrified.</p><p>CHANOS: -- live together in -- in like in a con...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: -- in a condo like back to school...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: They wouldn't even...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- they looked to me horrified until I told them I was kidding.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's hilarious.</p><p>Um, they're at a -- I'm assuming they're out of school or?</p><p>CHANOS: One is. One is still there.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And, um, that's pretty funny.</p><p>So every -- you've been doing this how many years now over the...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in the springs?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I got on the -- I'm on my fourth year of teaching.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh, that's great.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And a -- and a -- it's a lot, as I say, a lot of fun and it's one afternoon for two months in -- in the spring. And Yale has got a brand new business school, so I'll give a plug for that. And an amazing new dean and a -- Yale SOM is on the way up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We have Bob Shiller coming in in a few weeks...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, he's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- he's one of my favorite...</p><p>CHANOS: -- he's one of my -- he's certainly a tenured -- a tenured and Nobel Prize winner.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: He's at a different level.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: He -- he's really fascinating...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: I'm the low man on the totem pole in the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You -- you talk about -- but you talk about the psychology of investing in behavioral economics...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and how (INAUDIBLE). Here's a guy teaching in the same place you're teaching who's been one of the key drivers of that philosophy for a good couple of decades.</p><p>You -- you mentioned the far -- the fund launched in '85.</p><p>CHANOS: Um-hmm.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's 30 years ago.</p><p>CHANOS: Almost.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: How has the hedge fund industry changed in that ensuing period?</p><p>What -- what do you see as big differences?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean the growth, first of all. I mean it -- we had a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Enormous.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: We had a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Over $2 trillion now.</p><p>CHANOS: We started with $16 million in '85 and by -- by 19 -- the end of 19 -- early '91, we were over $600 million in assets. And that put us in the top 10 globally of hedge funds...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: -- of (INAUDIBLE). And -- and so that -- that tells you just how small the industry was back then. Um, the dramatic growth was -- was in the late '90s and early millennium.</p><p>But it was truly a small handful of people. Everybody kind of knew each other in the '80s. There were...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: A hundred hedge funds, 200 hedge funds?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, maybe no more than 100...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Now it's 10,000...</p><p>CHANOS: -- maybe...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- something like that?</p><p>CHANOS: Maybe more than 100 and probably practically, 20 or 30.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and -- and everybody knew everybody. I mean truly. And there weren't a lot of -- a lot of real different strategies. I mean everybody was pretty much in the equity markets, give or take.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Long, short?</p><p>CHANOS: Long, short, maybe...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- and that was kind of it. And then -- and, you know, you had guys like -- like -- like Mike Steinhardt spec -- and Soros speculating in bonds and currencies, um, but -- but it was, by and large, an equity driven model. And a -- and everybody was, at that point, was fairly adept, both on the long and short side.</p><p>Um, getting institutional investors was a big deal back then. That he didn't really started until the '90s.</p><p>So...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So in the '80s, your clients were essentially just high net worth individuals...</p><p>CHANOS: High net worth or foreign families because the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So family offices but no sovereign wealth funds yet?</p><p>CHANOS: Typically not. You would -- typically not U.S. fun -- families and no sovereign wealth funds. No endowments. By and large, no pension funds.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's amazing.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And everything has completely changed. Now it's...</p><p>CHANOS: Completely changed. All of it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- dominated by big institutions.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Ten thousand hedge funds, although, if you look at the -- the Bell Curve, that is -- that is not a normal Gaussian distribution. It's effectively those 100 hedge funds capturing 80 percent of the alpha and then a long tail of underperformance.</p><p>CHANOS: That's probably -- that's probably right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The -- the numbers are pretty -- when you look at the Tremont data and you look at some of the other hedge fund data that's out there, the funds that are earning their keep are few and far between.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean true alpha is -- is hard to come by, as we all know.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: For -- for sure. Well, the -- you know, it's like expansion in -- in professional sports teams, you go from 22 to 26 teams and suddenly there's that much talent -- less talent on any one team. It's spread around. And there's sort of a uniform mediocrity.</p><p>But a handful of all stars, you know, there's 100 funds out there that are just...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- stealing it.</p><p>CHANOS: -- the only difference is you can't start your own NBA team. You can start your own hedge fund.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Very easily.</p><p>CHANOS: That makes it worse.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: All -- all you have to do is talk someone into giving you X dollars...</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And it's not even -- there's not even a $100 million minimum. You could -- you know, the SEC regulates RIAs and others. If you have 100 plus, you don't have to do state by state. It's one regulatory scheme. So that's a bogey for a lot of -- you don't even have that on the hedge fund side. Anyone with a couple of million dollars can launch a hedge fund.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Although it is harder. I mean to -- in -- in -- the cost of doing business, of getting a real prime broker, I mean...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- (INAUDIBLE) now that I think have -- have, I think, taken that true start-up out of the -- the industry.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE), in fact, you sort of do need a -- a critical mass to be considered a -- a, you know, a -- at least viable.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So, obviously the industry has changed dramatically over the past couple of years. Let me -- let me throw some of my favorite quotes, um, of yours -- of yours back at you and see what your...</p><p>CHANOS: OK.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- reaction is. Let -- let's talk about timing. \"In investing, you could be really right but temporarily quite wrong.\" I love that line, because I started in the business as a trader and I -- it was always drilled into my head, hey, either you're right or wrong.</p><p>If -- if you think you're right and the market is going against you, you're wrong. But when you're doing fundamental shorting, you're basically -- our friend Doug Kass calls it variant perception. You're identifying what people aren't seeing, or seeing incorrectly...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you're going to be wrong for a long time, almost by identifying that variant perception. You're wrong for a while by definition...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, and there's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before people catch on.</p><p>CHANOS: -- there's -- there's a big difference. If you're trading a position, you know, sort of because of a fundamental view and your time frame has shortened enough, price tells you everything, almost.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right.</p><p>CHANOS: And in a fundamental short position, not only are you analyzing the company or -- or the -- whatever it is you're analyzing, but in many cases, you have a management team interposed that's actively working to -- to -- to prove you're wrong through activities that aren't necessarily kosher.</p><p>And so there's an added level here of -- of sort of three-dimensional chess when you're on the fundamental short side because the market won't necessarily immediately see what you see. And, in fact, often doesn't. And -- and that's why most fundamental short sellers will tell you, they're -- they're often early.</p><p>One additional problem, you have to borrow the shares.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so the ability to effect a short position in reasonable size for a firm like ours, once everything is clear, may not be given to you. And so there -- there are additional hurdles that don't exist in traditional investing that exist on the short side.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, we mentioned -- I mentioned Doug Kass earlier. One of the things he taught me early on, which I would have wish I had known when I was shorting Lehman, was that you could be short the stock and you're going to get squeezed. But if you really want to make a run for it, you marry a put to that and if you close the short position, you could let the put run. It's never going to get called for you. You're never going to get squeezed. You could -- you're paying up for the option, but it's a way to get, um, that juiced return, because the -- on the short side, the most you can make is 100 percent. With options...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, that's actually not true. But go ahead with it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, what -- well, let's discuss that, because that's a standard line against short-selling.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, that's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Look, you're shorting at 50, you can only go to zero, that's 100 percent.</p><p>Why is that wrong?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, because...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Because of leverage and?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, because the ability of -- of -- if you start with a short position at 100 and -- and with no other cash in your account and you short the stock and it goes down to 50, OK, you can, without adding any more cash -- capital to the account, short additional shares. And if it keeps going your way, you -- you can compound your return.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But then you're running the risk of -- of...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- a margin call, a squeeze...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, that's fine.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: But I just want to...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: I want to get the statement (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you can...</p><p>CHANOS: That you can't make more than 100 percent on initial capital. That's not true.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you can -- with -- if you're actually using the gain in, um, value, falling stock creates, if you're short, you're then pyramiding that on top and -- and shorting that with that additional effort.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, you're shorting on -- on -- you're compounding your profit, in effect.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. So number two, I've also (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: By the way, I've heard that 100,000 times. You're the first person who's corrected that.</p><p>CHANOS: So -- so the -- the -- the other problem, of course, is is that, you know, I've seen a lot more stocks go to zero than -- than infamy -- invidimy (ph).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: That -- and that's the -- that's the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: But the -- the key point for your listener, of course, is is that for what we do, and -- and theoretically, don't try this at home, kids, we have a portfolio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And a portfolio changes the volatility nature, like any portfolio will. There's going to be things that are always working and things that aren't working. And so, you know, I -- I think that a -- that really tells you that -- that a -- that doing this as a professional with a portfolio approach and watching your country risk, your industry risk and all those things makes much more sense.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So this leads -- you mentioned something earlier and I want to address that. You mentioned you have management actively working against you in a number of ways.</p><p>One of the things that you were very much in the forefront of was working with investigative journalists, working with the media to help uncover fraud.</p><p>How did that first come about?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I'm a -- you know, clear up a misconception here. I mean we don't call up or e-mail reporters and say, hey, you ought to be looking at Enron. And in the case of Enron, Bethany McLean was talking to my partner at the time and he said -- and she said, you know, what do you - - what's interesting?</p><p>And -- and -- and Douglas Millett, do you ever really talk to Jim about Enron?</p><p>And he -- we -- we're real excited about it. And we -- we really think there's something there.</p><p>So I mean that -- that often reporters find a way to fundamental short sellers to -- to ask them, hey, what do you -- what do you think of this or are you working on something?</p><p>And -- and I think that I'll -- I think there are ways to do that and -- and not compromise anybody.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: On the other hand, I think there are ways not to do that. And I think you have to be mindful of -- of that. And I think there's approaches.</p><p>Having said all that, I -- I'm a firm believer in the \"U.S. Constitution\" and -- and anybody has the right to their opinions of interest. But you're -- you do not have the right to your own facts.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And I think that that's an important point. But if you're a publicly traded company, you have to understand that the marketplace is going to be a marketplace of ideas and a marketplace of opinions, of...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We've -- we've seen some litigation against short sellers. We've seen some litigation against analysts.</p><p>What do you think of that sort of stuff?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, as I say, no one has the right to -- to trade on or -- or induce others to trade on information they know to be false. And that's kind of the -- the bright line that -- that -- that certainly most -- that all investors need to understand about securities fraud.</p><p>But -- but an awful lot of companies seem to, you know, be upset when people don't have the approved opinion about that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And, you know, that -- that is not actionable in our court system.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: One...</p><p>CHANOS: A...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- one would hope.</p><p>CHANOS: One would hope. One would hope. But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so one of the...</p><p>CHANOS: The federal courts, by the way, have a pretty strong view on that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And they've been on the right side of this, for the most part...</p><p>CHANOS: Usually it's people that bring these cases are in state courts of -- of, you know, varying venues or questionable venues to try to get state, you know, put this before a jury in a state.</p><p>Federal judges, by and large, look at these things and, for the most part, toss them out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's the right way to do it.</p><p>So you mentioned earlier about long versus short. There's a -- a longer quote I really like, which is, \"I used to think that good short sellers could be trained like long focused...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- value investors. It's the same skill set. You're tearing into the numbers. You're valuing businesses. You're assigning a consolidated value and hopefully you see something the market doesn't.\"</p><p>But you've since learned, quote, \"There's a big difference between a long-focused value investor and a good short seller. And you mentioned the differences -- psychology and behavioral finance.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And it...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's a great -- that's a fabulous quote.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and I think that -- and I think that -- that -- as I said, I've run money for a lot of great investors who have farmed out the short side to me. And I've seen that, actually, some of the best value investors who I've had the pleasure of doing business with are not particularly good short sellers. And -- and shouldn't be selling short for that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The wrong constitution.</p><p>CHANOS: They're just -- just the -- they'll obsess over very tiny positions that have gone against them, you know, that...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- you know, that -- that fear of the stock going to infinity that we discussed. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: By the way, that's the other false statement. You -- we've talked about a stock can only lose 100 percent. I've heard that well when you're short, your losses are theoretically infinite.</p><p>Well, not if you have a stop loss. Not if you have a line in the sand...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, there's in you...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that you cover...</p><p>CHANOS: -- there's an even better little argument...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: There -- there's no lock limit up when it comes to equities.</p><p>CHANOS: There's an even better little limit that no one talks about. If you're in a partnership and you're a limited partner, you can only lose what you put up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right. That -- that's your limitation.</p><p>CHANOS: Which is an argument for investing with short sellers that way.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Typically a hedge fund as opposed to...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. You know, or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hiding...</p><p>CHANOS: -- or buying shares in an offshore corporation. And -- and - - and that's something, you know, we point out to people, too, that -- that, actually, you can, in effect, get the same limited -- limited down side by doing it in that structure. And the general partner takes the risk, but the prime broker will sell you out long before that ever happens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. That's right.</p><p>CHANOS: So, again, these are -- these are -- these are...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Myths.</p><p>CHANOS: -- examples of thinking -- well, they're not myths. They're -- they're accurate on the face, but in practicality, they're inaccurate...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- because -- because, again, you structure things to -- to not let that happen, A, and -- and, B, you can actually get protection through the structure of -- of the investment vehicle or whatever, to obviate the -- obviate the -- those risks.</p><p>But having said all that, they do play into behavioral finance. And - - and I remember very famously, a well-known investor who's an incredibly - - he's got an incredible track record. I was running some money for him. And it was in the midst of our disastrous short on America Online in the -- in the late '90s. And I had...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: A little early.</p><p>CHANOS: -- I had -- I had a small short portfolio I was running for him. And -- and AOL was never more than half of 1 percent or 1 percent of our portfolio, because it was so volatile. But it just kept doubling and doubling and doubling.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And we thought it was an accounting fraud, which it turned out to be.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: And this investor called me repeatedly losing sleep at night and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Over a half a percent (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: -- and this one -- and this -- this position was not moving the needle on his performance at all.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: But he was -- he was -- I think, to the detriment of him working on other ideas. And a -- and it -- and -- and that was a real concrete example, to me, of just why it is that -- that certain people shouldn't do this, um, because it was bothering him.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They just lack the constitution. They can't...</p><p>CHANOS: Right. It...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they can't compartmentalize.</p><p>CHANOS: They didn't -- they didn't need to because he -- he was such a good investor doing what he did well. And so for that person, you know, they shouldn't be doing it. And -- and I think that it gets back to exactly what you -- you've -- you've emphasized here, the psychological is completely different.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's -- let's talk about noise, since we -- we've touched on psychological, this is related to it. \"I listen to the noise to make sure there's no new information. I need to know. But I don't worry about most of it.\"</p><p>And I -- I thought that was an interesting con -- concept, when -- when you discussed, relevant to this, analysts' reports, news, rumor mills, that's where the phrase, \"For a short seller, this is a cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I -- I love that quote.</p><p>So how do you deal with that noise?</p><p>Do you filter all of it or do you have a staff that says, hey, out of these 1,000 things, these four or five you should...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hear?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I mean first of all, if we're getting a piece of new material or information from a research report, my staff is not doing their job. Um, and -- because certainly, I want them reading the company filings and company press releases going to conferences, you know, and -- and I -- I hope they -- you know, our team is very good -- that -- that I'm reading it in an internal memo before I'm reading it in a -- in a Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch research piece a week later.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's usually the case 99 percent of the time.</p><p>Having said all that, you have to be mindful of what the Street is saying. You have to be mindful of what you're going up against. And I -- and I think that that's important. And one of the things we do is we do talk to the Street. We have them into our offices. If we have an unusual thesis or hypothesis on a company, we'll have the sell side in and to lay it out...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They're pitching you the other side of the equation?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, well, we know what they're pitching. I mean you know, it's not -- and one of the good asymmetries of the short side -- and there aren't that many of them, one of the good ones is is that if you're fundamentally a short seller, you have no problem finding out what the bull case is.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: It's easy to find out.</p><p>But if you long that stock, you might have to really kind of dig to find out what the real bear case is on it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and a -- and so it's another one of these influential asymmetries that I think works for the fundamental short seller. There are a few others. We don't have to disclose our positions. I think that's a very important one, actually.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You know, there was a -- a movement afoot not too long ago to force short sellers to disclose their positions.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and the Europeans have it in terms of -- of certain thresholds, for example.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: Now the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But you're never short 10 percent of the outstanding stock?</p><p>CHANOS: No, although we've -- we've...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE) company...</p><p>CHANOS: -- we've crossed the European thresholds a few times, because the thresholds are very...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But that's a fairly low.</p><p>CHANOS: -- they're very -- they're very low.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Two percent, 3 percent, something like that?</p><p>CHANOS: Oh, I think it's a -- no, it's .5 percent or (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it that low?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. It's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I had no idea.</p><p>CHANOS: -- it's really low.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's a...</p><p>CHANOS: -- on some of them yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: It's quite low on some of them. Well, the reason is is that, first of all, the IRS doesn't look at short positions as positions. It looks at -- it looks at it as in a commercial transaction, where you're borrowing money, interestingly enough.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It -- it's a margin trade, it's a loan (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, because you don't own anything. You don't -- you -- you have a promise to -- to -- to pay something back.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: To repay...</p><p>CHANOS: Shares.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so it's considered...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: -- instituted indebtedness. Yes. And so -- and which is why the short sellers have no -- no standing at the bar, the securities bar. We don't own anything. And -- and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: -- now I would argue even further, I'm a little surprised that my brethren in the hedge fund world have not actually challenged the 13 F, G and H regime. I...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Sections of the SEC code?</p><p>CHANOS: Code -- mandating disclosure over $100 million of your long positions.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: Because, I mean I understand why the 13D need for change in corporate control. I think any reasonable person...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- would understand that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right.</p><p>CHANOS: But why is it that -- that all these great investors, every 90 days, should give the public a free look at what they're doing?</p><p>They're pay -- their clients pay for that. And if you don't trade a lot, say you're a value investor, um, well, if you don't trade a lot, that portfolio doesn't trade a lot. And there are people out there basically with services now to replicate your portfolio for nothing, or very little, that you have people paying good money for.</p><p>And I've always said, you know, Coca-Cola doesn't have to put its, you know, formula on -- on -- on the Web and Microsoft doesn't have to issue its source code, why should managers, either hedge fund or otherwise, have to tell the public what -- what -- what's the public's interests?</p><p>I understand the SEC and law enforcement should have every right to see it at any time.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: In other words, 13D filings go to the SEC and it stops there, they don't get put on the Web?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, 13D filings, I think, change in corporate control, that's fine. I mean people publicly should know that.</p><p>But why is it that a passive money manager should tell the public...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Six percent of -- more than 5 percent position, why...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- why disclose that?</p><p>CHANOS: You know, their -- all their positions, all of their positions.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK, so let's clarify that. I'm under the impression they do a filing at 5 percent?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, a 13D.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK. So let's say they have a 2 percent position.</p><p>They have to disclose that?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: What happens if they're offshore?</p><p>CHANOS: Of -- if you're a U.S. money manager, you've got to disclose your positions of $100 million.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Huh, that's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, so -- so -- so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it a fund above $100 million or a fund...</p><p>CHANOS: A position...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- a position above $100 million?</p><p>CHANOS: A fund $100 -- of $100 million.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Again, I don't understand why the money management industry hasn't gone and said this is, in effect, a, you know, possibly a takings clause in \"The Constitution.\"</p><p>Why is it that the public gets to see what I'm doing?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You're -- you're...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- forcing me to turn over my intellectual property with no compensation.</p><p>CHANOS: And if you don't short a lot of stocks, then if you're just a long lonely manager, you're giving away your entire business plan every 90 days.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's really interesting. And I hadn't thought of that in a...</p><p>CHANOS: Absolutely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in that context.</p><p>CHANOS: Absolutely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So the accusation is that Wall Street owns Congress and they can get DC to do whatever they want. And it's not all that far from the truth.</p><p>Why is this so difficult to change?</p><p>You would think, hey, any major change in ownership, anything over -- pick a percent. It doesn't even have to be 5 percent. If you owe more than 3 percent, you need to at least disclose it when you cross that line.</p><p>Um, but after that, why does it have to be completely...</p><p>CHANOS: I'm a little...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- disclosed?</p><p>CHANOS: -- you know, well, first of all, hedge funds don't have the clout that -- that -- when -- when you say Wall Street does...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- we're talking about major -- major banks and -- and investment banks. They're the ones with the clout. Hedge funds don't -- still don't have that much clout in Washington.</p><p>So I think that's number one.</p><p>But, again -- and -- and mutual funds, of course, like it because it actually helps their marketing.</p><p>You know, here's our portfolio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Absolutely.</p><p>CHANOS: I just -- but I -- I've always wondered at why a -- why hedge funds have just sort of rolled over on this and said well, you know, well, I guess, you know, we've got to do it. And you do have to do it. But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, I'll tell you what the answer is. The answer is merely knowing what Jim Chanos' long or short isn't the same as having Jim Chanos manage that position for you. And the same is true for any hedge fund that's out there. If it was the case, everybody would be generating alpha by imitating the Dalio's, Tepper's, obviously Renaissance Technology doesn't hold onto anything long enough for a filing to go through.</p><p>But still, if it was that easy just to say let me see what Chanos owns, great, I'll own that...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, one would argue that that's actually why the alphas may have dropped and a -- and so, I'm not so sure. It will...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Because everybody was...</p><p>CHANOS: -- clearly for trading...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) to it.</p><p>CHANOS: -- clearly for trading shops, it -- it's superfluous. And for shops that do a lot of fundamental shorting, it's -- it's meaningless, because, for example, you use...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You want that out there anyway?</p><p>CHANOS: When you see my longs, I file them in my Opportunity Fund, which is our long short. And if you look at my longs, you'll scratch your head and go why is Chanos long in that thing, that looks crazy?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And not understanding there's two shorts against it that are even crazier.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Right, and that happens to be the best system -- systematic hedge for that position.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Um, so it can be -- it can be very misleading to people. And that's the other reason then, why do it?</p><p>If it's misleading because you're both long and short, you're not doing anybody a service.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: If it's not misleading because the guy is just simply a long only person, why does the public have the right to that information for free?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Those are the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: There's a lot of arguments against this that -- and -- and the argument for it typically is well, it's for more -- don't we want more transparency?</p><p>And I would argue, no, not necessarily. Um, but I particularly if -- if you're basing a business on -- on intellectual capital and you're charging people for that, I don't see what the public interest is in putting out possibly misleading information.</p><p>One of the problems, when you have the limits where people have to disclose where they go through limits and up and down, you actually -- people can game that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- knowing themselves they've gone through the limits.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so I've explained that to the European regulators, that - - that these short threshold limits themselves can be disruptive just because they exist.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's veer into a dangerous territory. Let's talk a little bit about politics, Washington, DC, the regulatory environment.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You're known as a guy who's a pretty active, uh, participant in politics. You've made the comment that you've been -- I'm paraphrasing -- you've been fortunate enough in your career to have accumulated a sum of money and you feel obligated to respond, to give back, to participate in democracy.</p><p>What -- what attracted you to that given how dysfunctional DC has been?</p><p>Is it something you're still interested in?</p><p>Talk a little bit about that.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean I'm certainly not interested in politics personally. I -- I'm interested in the process. I always have been. I -- and first of all, let me say, I think the system is broken. I think the whole system of campaign finance is broken. And I would love a law that says I can't write any checks.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Well, the...</p><p>CHANOS: But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- Supreme Court has basically...</p><p>CHANOS: Has gone towy.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you could write, Jim Chanos...</p><p>CHANOS: It's free speech.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- who wants more than a couple of bucks, write...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- write all the money you want (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. I think -- and I think that that -- that while that may be a constitutional freedom, it's one we ought to reexamine, because it raises agency risks and lots of issues of inequality. But -- but we're not here to discuss that.</p><p>The problem is is that if that's -- if that's the legality of the game and -- and you feel strongly about -- about things politically, um, and you want to support them, fine. Uh, you know, I -- we pick our spots.</p><p>On the other hand, um, I think that -- that a -- that the country, you know, actually needs people to be involved in politics.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And I think that -- that it's not about access or influence, it's about, in our case, because we never asked for anything...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, stop a second. When you say you never ask for something, you want to influence the process a little bit, then you -- you derailed the question I was about to ask you, because you said you never ask for something, which was what would you like to see changed?</p><p>What area...</p><p>CHANOS: Well (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- of policy...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, for example...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- could you move on the needle on?</p><p>CHANOS: -- well, for example, I -- I've publicly said I -- I think that carried interest should be raised. The tax on carried interest should be raised.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So this -- this is the advantage that private equity and hedge fund managers have...</p><p>CHANOS: On long-term cap -- gain allocations and performance fees being treated as long-term capital gains.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So they're -- they're taxed at -- it used to be 15 percent, now it's 23...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, whatever.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- or so.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But it sure as hell ain't for -- the joke that Warren Buffett says as he pays a lower tax rate...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- than his secretary.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And I -- and I think a lot of these -- so -- so I would, you know, you would argue...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So why hasn't that been changed?</p><p>You would think that's the -- the most egregious stroke of the pen thing to change?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, you'll have to ask the people that don't want to change it. I don't know. The -- the -- there are a lot of issues that are out there like that that I think you would be kind of surprised as a Wall Streeter that I support, but I -- that are counterintuitive.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Give me -- give me another one. Let's -- let's...</p><p>CHANOS: Well...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You're -- you're one of these -- I can just hear Bill O'Reilly saying...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you're one of these limbers -- limer -- limousine liberals who really feels guilty about having money.</p><p>CHANOS: You know, I don't feel guilty at all about having money. I - - trust me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: I -- I feel blessed and -- and I know I'm fortunate. And -- and not at all. And the -- but I do think the level of discourse in this country needs to be reopened. And I think we -- we've -- we've put both parties in this -- this sort of truly bipolar area there where no one wants to meet in the middle anymore.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: A lot due to campaign finance reasons and -- and the primaries.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's the underlying problem that, you know, the old joke is that Reagan and Tip O'Neill would argue all day, they'd go out at night, have a beer and the next morning there would be legislation signed. That sort of cross-pollination...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, look, apparently that story was a bit apocryphal. Apparent, there wasn't -- it wasn't that simple with those two.</p><p>But -- but I know what you mean...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But they did get -- they did get...</p><p>CHANOS: I know what you mean.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they did get -- meet in the middle.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Well, what...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They did get things accomplished.</p><p>CHANOS: -- well, what's changed is the Senate, really, if you know Washington, in that -- that the House has always been pretty -- a pretty bipartisan place and -- and it's always been pretty raucous in terms of hardened attitudes and -- and -- and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, that's -- do you mean a partisan there's that...</p><p>CHANOS: It's much more partisan.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- the Senasin -- the Senate is bipartisan and the House was partisan.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the Senate -- the Senate, until about 20 or 30 years ago, was a place in which people crossed party lines all the time and voted their conscience and voted the way they really felt on the issues and weren't penalized for it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and -- and so senators really were that -- that upper house that said, OK, we -- we're a little bit older, a little bit more experienced, we're -- we -- we -- more confident of our reelection or our tenure and if -- if I want to vote on civil rights even though I'm -- I'm a hard -- I'm in the Republican Party, I -- I do. And that happened.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: But now the Senate is just as fractious as the House. And -- and senators worry about reelection or getting very liberal or very conservative challengers. Again, part of it's the campaign finance issue, part of it's the -- the redistricting of -- for the representatives.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Gerrymandering, as well.</p><p>CHANOS: And so -- so the -- the whole idea that there was an upper house that was sort of, you know...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The adult supervision.</p><p>CHANOS: The adults, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: The adults that were getting policy done is -- is changed, as well. And so it's added to the acrimony. It's added to the gridlock. And -- and I think it's just added -- it's -- it's not put us in a good place. And I think that that's -- and I've supported Republican candidates that I think are moderates, as well, so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. How -- how do we fix this?</p><p>How do we repair...</p><p>CHANOS: I think you...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- campaign finance?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I think you have to start, you know, with some sort of reform. And I think, you know, unfortunately, a family member who is -- who has been in politics also pointed this out correctly, you also have to do something about term limits, because other -- if you do have campaign finance limits, term limit -- anybody with an incumbency becomes more important.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so you have a do I -- you have an advantage being an incumbent...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Ninety-nine percent or 98 percent reelection rate...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. So...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in the House.</p><p>CHANOS: -- so I mean we -- that -- that -- it's -- it's a tricky issue. But just throwing more and more unlimited amounts of money, I think, doesn't help the issue. It makes -- I think it makes it worse.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And what do you do -- so, in other words, you have a system that's broken, nobody from either party is going to -- willing to work with the other party...</p><p>CHANOS: But nobody can turn the money down (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And at the same time the Supreme Court...</p><p>CHANOS: It's an arms race.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- is -- has -- has basically lit that fuse and said go for it then...</p><p>CHANOS: And it's an arms race. So therefore, I mean you can't -- if you don't spend, you're not going to have an equal chance -- seat at the table.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so it's just...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You have no choice, you have to.</p><p>CHANOS: -- it's just this vicious cycle. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So how do you break that?</p><p>How do you...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, as I say, I'd leave it up to the politicians and the legal scholars, but at some point, you're going to need a piece of legislation or a constitutional amendment or something that -- that's going to have to change this system. And I -- I don't know -- I don't know any other way around it. If you have a Supreme Court that keeps saying this is an a -- the legislation is unconstitutional, then you're going to have to change the \"Constitution.\"</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And -- and that's a challenge. That's quite a challenge...</p><p>CHANOS: It's a big challenge.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- to get that done. It probably has to get a lot worse before it gets better.</p><p>CHANOS: You know, that's a scary thought.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Let -- let me tack policy to one other place, because we spent this whole afternoon chatting and China has never come up.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly. Where's that?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And you, very famously, um, identified, I want to say four years ago, is that -- is that right?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, it was the end of '09, early 2010.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Basically said China is a -- a big house of cards, building these ghost cities, they're spending all this policy money, they're not that good at it. Their economy has been so robust that it's covered up a lot of these credit errors.</p><p>What do you think is going on with China today?</p><p>By the way, China's stock market today at a four or a six week high, but it's shellacked over that period.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It's down 40 percent. China, while the rest of the world has rallied substantially, has gone the exact opposite way.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Almost cut in half.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, people have always ask -- still ask us, well, what do you think, you know, when are you going to be right?</p><p>You've been early. And I keep saying if you look at the Chinese market...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It's got -- China has gotten crushed over the past few years.</p><p>CHANOS: It's the -- it was the best place to be short in the last four years.</p><p>Um, look, everything that we saw in China, at -- at the end of '09 and 2010 is basically now twice as bad. That's kind of the way I put it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It hasn't gotten better.</p><p>CHANOS: It -- it's gotten worse. The -- the debt to GDP has gone from over 100 percent of GDP to over 200 percent. Back in -- in '09, there was 5.6 billion square meters of high rises under development and (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: 5.6 billion?</p><p>CHANOS: -- 6 billion square meters. That's 60...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh-huh.</p><p>CHANOS: -- billion square feet.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: Now, the number is twice that. It's 10.6 billion square -- square meters under development at the end of 2013.</p><p>So everything that we saw then that was bad, and I think it -- it was bad, is, in effect, twice as bad now.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Don't they have...</p><p>CHANOS: When we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hundreds of millions of people to move off the farm?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the problem is, is the hundreds of millions of people can't afford the stuff that they're -- that's being built. They're building high end condos, uh, shopping malls, high speed rail. It's only the -- the top 5 percent of people in China that can afford that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's the -- that's the -- the sort of paradox here. I'll give you just an idea of -- of what's changed in four years. When we started looking at China, the Chinese GDP in dollar terms was about $7 trillion US. And the total...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Not too shabby.</p><p>CHANOS: Not -- and the to -- total amount of bank -- assets in the banking system in China was $9 trillion.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p>CHANOS: So it was a little bit over 100 percent.</p><p>Now, the GDP is about $9 trillion and the total assets in the Chinese banking system are about $24 trillion.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, a meaningful difference.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's a...</p><p>CHANOS: So they've had to employ...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that's a lot of...</p><p>CHANOS: -- they've had to employ more and more debt to get the growth.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I was going to say, this isn't capital, this is...</p><p>CHANOS: This is the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- credit.</p><p>CHANOS: -- total assets, total assets. It's just basically a proxy for -- for credit outstanding. And so increasingly, they've had to employ more and more debt to -- to drive their growth. And -- and -- and that's because the model is based on 50 percent investment to GDP.</p><p>So if you think about that, that means that -- that if they -- if it takes them two years to finish a project, that means that one quarter of your GDP every year rolls off and has to be replaced with a -- digging a new hole in the ground somewhere.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well -- well, that's while they were at 12 percent GDP growth four years ago and -- and the most recent data is closer to 6.5, 7 percent.</p><p>CHANOS: Seven, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: It is, because it -- and -- and so the soft...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And by the way, we would kill for 7 percent GDP.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, well, the 7 percent is a little misleading, too, though, because, again, 7 percent, the consumer is still declining per GDP. So the 7 percent is only really coming from -- from the fact that they're still building stuff. And -- and now, it's beyond a shadow of a doubt, even -- even Chinese officials or died in the wool bulls will tell you, they've got to change that, they've got to reform this. And they've got to get away from this investment-driven model.</p><p>The question is, how?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: How and what do they replace it with?</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You know, the -- the key -- the fascinating thing about China, or let me flip that around, the interesting thing about U.S. manufacturing, we started seeing signs of this about five years ago, be fracking blew up, before natural gas was everywhere. But natural gas prices had dropped and we were hearing about companies relocating in the U.S., setting up a natural gas electrical generator. One of the big complaints you hear about China is a lack of consistent electrical availability.</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Not only 24-7, but a consistent amperage and wattage...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, peak -- peak usage.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and it fluctuates and...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you have to set up a series of electronics just to get a steady whatever it is, 120 and 60. So in the U.S., you run a natural gas pipeline near a factory, you set up an electrical code generation plant, you're effectively getting unlimited, very low cost energy and you don't have to take three weeks to ship your product to the States.</p><p>And that's...</p><p>CHANOS: Well...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- started as a -- as labor prices started to go up...</p><p>CHANOS: And Chinese wages have gone up, too.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- what happens when wages go from $1 a day to -- to $25 a day?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, that's -- that's what's happened. In fact, net -- net exports in China, when I first started looking at China, net exports were 12 percent of GDP, exports minus imports. Now, it's almost down to 0. Now, it's a couple percent.</p><p>And so -- so the impact that China, as an exporting engine, is already diminished on their GDP.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's amazing.</p><p>CHANOS: And they've offset it now -- they've offset it with more and more investment. So the story in China is not export anymore, the story in China is this giant building project, the property building.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Can -- can you grow a middle class in a -- a country that size and use that the way the U.S. post-World War II -- you know, we had a 50 year run after World War II, where the middle class boomed like never before. And it was a period of tremendous economic growth.</p><p>CHANOS: Right. But we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Can China do that?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we were already past the middle income trap at that point, though. We -- we passed that in the -- the late 19th, early 20th century.</p><p>I mean China is still facing that. And -- and how do you get people from the sort of $5,000 to $7,000 per capita...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- income level to -- to $30,000 or plus?</p><p>And -- and that's always the tricky point in -- in economic development is -- is the, you know, basically, there's four phases of economic development, Barry. You've got, basically, you educate the population from illiteracy to secondary school education.</p><p>Second, you move people from rural areas to urban.</p><p>Third, you employ capital where it never -- capital has never been employed. That's where we are in China right now.</p><p>And the fourth and the way that South Korea and Japan and post-war Germany, post-war is you finally begin to innovate and make products that the rest of the world wants and be more productive.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's the tricky part. And that's where most countries can't surmount. They get to the third point, but they can't get to the fourth point, where they become truly innovative and -- and -- and it -- the Asian tigers all fell by the wayside, for example, in the mid-'90s...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- with the exception of South Korea and -- and Singapore. The rest all -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, basically...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Vietnam...</p><p>CHANOS: -- stalled out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Um, that's where we are with China right now.</p><p>The three countries post-World War II were Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union. They all were pretty much destroyed by the war.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh-huh.</p><p>CHANOS: They had to rebuild. They had to start from scratch. You know, they already had educated workforces. They already had urban centers.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: But they had to basically put capital to work again, which they did. And Germany, in the '60s and Japan in the '70s began to innovate and produce world-class products that everybody wanted.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: For sure.</p><p>CHANOS: The Soviet Union didn't.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And China, the question is, will China ever be able to do - - be more than just a -- a high end...</p><p>CHANOS: A manufacturing base.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that's it.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and the -- and/or employ capital in a non-impressive way to build empty buildings and condos and things like that. And that's what they're doing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So the quote you had about China, I'll -- I'm curious if you still think this is true. \"The Chinese banking system is built on quicksand.\"</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. It's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it still true?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I just think it's -- it's more true than ever, um, in -- in that there's just -- the bad loans are there. There's legacy bad loans they didn't address from even 10 years ago. Um, they are telling you with a straight face that non-performing loans are, you know, less than 1 percent. Um, and -- and yet, you just see the madness of some of these projects and the fact that defaults are starting now left, right and center and they'll look at you with a straight face and say, oh, no, no, our non- performing loans are not a problem.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So I can sit here and continue speaking to you for a couple more hours.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But I know your assistant will kill me if I keep you here past 4:00. So I -- I just wanted to end on one last question. And before I forget, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. I know people are going to find this a fascinating conversation.</p><p>The -- the last question I want to ask you is really general and open- ended. Um, the industry of Wall Street, finance, investment banking, investing has changed dramatically over the past 30 years and especially over the past five years.</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: What do you see happening in this industry going forward?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I -- I kind of would like to think we're seeing our limits on it, because -- and it's always -- it's always a little bit hypocritical to talk -- talk, you know, negatively about what you do for a living, but I think that -- that the nature of finance, in and of itself, as a profit center or a big part of the economy is sort of self-defeating.</p><p>And -- and I think that we've gotten kind of to the limits, I suspect, of where finance can go to push the U.S. economy. I mean I think it hit its peak in '06-'07, uh, in terms of finance as a percent of corporate profits and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The argument is -- that I've made is the bailouts prevented that process of...</p><p>CHANOS: You know, clearing...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- converting back to...</p><p>CHANOS: -- of clearing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: -- the market clearing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, and I would agree with you on that. And I read, you know, I remember at the time you were writing that and you were right. And I agree with it. And I think that -- that unfortunately, finance becoming a big part of the economy in terms of taking deposits, making loans, all of that stuff, puts it in this too big to fail category broadly speaking, where -- where ironically enough, it cannot be subject to the -- the -- the whims of capitalism itself, creative destruction, because it would just be systemic.</p><p>And so we -- we build this monstrous Rube Goldberg like contraption that is completely ludicrous and then say we can't let it fall apart...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So...</p><p>CHANOS: -- because it will impact everything else.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- so too big to fail, too much leverage, too little capital...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and yet not subject to the laws of capital.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, let's leave it at this. If we look at those -- those dark days of '08 and '09, the one industry that actually went through bankruptcy was the auto industry. And I always chide my friends in White - - at the White House and -- who say, oh, well, the auto bailout was smart.</p><p>And I keep saying, you know, no, it wasn't an auto bailout. I was short the -- the auto stocks. Shareholders were wiped out...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- the boards were -- were dismissed. The executives were fired. They brought in new teams, they recapitalized the companies, the government put in debtor in possession financing...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- which was post-bankruptcy. Now, we can argue about the unions' role in that, that employees were given seniority. But in many bankruptcies, in...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's typical.</p><p>CHANOS: -- employees are...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's not atypical.</p><p>CHANOS: -- given preference.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and, in fact, we did exactly what capitalism should have said we did, we recapped the industry and we made it more viable going forward.</p><p>The people who took risks in the past, you know, paid the price.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. That's exactly right.</p><p>CHANOS: But it worked. It actually worked better, I think, than what we've had in finance coming out of this, which was...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, we had -- we had a Treasury secretary that was from finance. And so industry gets bankruptcy, finance gets bailouts. If it was reversed, if you had the head of a railroad or a head of a manufacturing plant, I can't guarantee you that GM and Chrysler would have been put through bankruptcy, but I can guarantee you that Citi and Bank of America and Merrill and Morgan would have been treated the way financiers treated manufacturers.</p><p>CHANOS: But then we might not have had this beautiful new Bloomberg headquarters.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh, I think this predates it. This was up long before that.</p><p>CHANOS: I know it was. I'm just kidding.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so listen, you know, the counter-argument, and this - - this is me talking literally in my book, the counter-argument is if you take -- my example is Bank America...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- Merrill Lynch, Countrywide, that giant...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- horrific blasphemy of a company...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- if you would have put them into bankruptcy, you spin out Merrill as a free-standing, clean balance sheet investment firm.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you spin out Bank America as a clean balance...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- money center bank. You spin out Countrywide as a mortgage underwriter.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You take all the bad paper -- I -- I'm fond of saying no such thing as toxic assets, only toxic prices.</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You sell all that crap that's dragging down their balance sheet all these years...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- at 15, 20 cents on the dollar...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- someone's a buyer of that...</p><p>CHANOS: Of course.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you also end up clearing all those home prices instead of having private equity come in and try and flip them, these home prices plummet and first time home buyers are buying houses at a reasonable price.</p><p>CHANOS: If you had wiped out the equity of these institutions, what, you know, to the -- 80 percent...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- subordinated that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Sixty percent on the mezzanine debt, 50 percent on other debt and the depositors were whole...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- I think not only would that have helped the whole process, it would have -- it would have meant that people learned the lessons going forward.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The -- the moral hazard gets avoided and we, in our economic recovery in 2014 would be...</p><p>CHANOS: Correct.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- years ahead of where we are (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: And the depositors understood that they -- the ones taking no risk were protected by the government...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- as they should be. But the more risk you took, the more at risk you were at, I undoubtedly think the system would be far healthier today than it is.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It's -- it's called risk for a reason.</p><p>CHANOS: And I've got it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Jim, thank you so much for your time.</p><p>CHANOS: Barry, thank you.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This has been absolutely fascinating.</p><p>You've been listening to Master of Finance series.</p><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p>This is Bloomberg Radio and we've been speaking to Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates.</p><p>Thanks so much for coming in, Jim.</p><p>CHANOS: My pleasure.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: You're listening to Masters In Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

This is Barry Ritholtz and this week I am thrilled to have sat down with Jim Chanos, hedge fund manager at Kynikos Associates for a very interesting and in-depth conversation; after we were done recording the radio portion, Jim sat around and we kept the tape running. And there's a ton of podcast extras. So after the show is done, be sure and listen to the rest of it. I think it's about 14 hours. And it's really -- anytime you get the chance to sit at the knee of somebody like Jim Chanos and ask questions and see where they go, you don't want to stop the tape running. He spoke for a long time and it was absolutely fascinating.</p><p/><p>I don't know how many of you who are listening to this know Jim Chanos or are familiar with his work. But really it's a fascinating legacy. This is a guy who was an early short seller, who was an early critic of some of the worst excesses of Wall Street, whether it was misbehavior of analysts or accounting fraud or things that companies were doing, that were defrauding and misleading investors.</p><p/><p>Jim has the combination of a accountant's ability to dive into the numbers and detective's ability to sniff out nonsense. And he has done it throughout his whole career. He's identified a number of tremendous frauds and scams, whether it was Baldwin Piano, which ran an insurance scam on the side, Enron WorldCom, go down the whole list. He has really been crucial to investors in ferreting out fraud and using his skill set to make money for his investors by basically identifying short selling opportunities where there's some bad behavior, fraud, whatever it is.</p><p/><p>So this is a wide-ranging and fascinating conversation that I was thrilled to have. Be sure and check out the podcast extras afterwards. And on with the show.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Today I am thrilled to bring you someone who you may not know who he is, but you actually should. His name is Jim Chanos. He is the manager of -- let me see if I'm pronouncing this correctly -- Kynikos Associates. That's Greek for \"cynic.\" And Jim has built a reputation over 30 years as a spotter of wrongdoing and fraud, a short seller, somebody who's identified a lot of problems with various companies in the market.</p><p/><p>Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p/><p>JAMES CHANOS, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, KYNIKOS ASSOCIATES: Thanks, Barry. Glad to be here.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So I've wanted to have you on for a long time because most of the people we speak to are long-term, mostly long only investors, who are looking at here's what you need to do to save money for retirement, or if you're a pension fund or an endowment, here's what you do -- need to do to make sure you stay ahead of inflation.</p><p/><p>But your approach as a short seller is completely different.</p><p/><p>Why don't you describe that so people have an idea of what you actually do in Kynikos Associates?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, one way to describe it, Barry, is that we are a long-term potential purchasers of equities.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: I like that.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: The whole idea of fundamental short selling really is select a portfolio of securities, mostly stocks, that are fundamentally overvalued no matter what the market does. that these are companies that, through the normal ebbs and flows of capitalism, are on the downside of their cycle.</p><p/><p>And our clients, primarily, are institutions who use us as a hedge to their core equity portfolio. And so therefore it allows them to be a little bit more aggressive in their equity exposures, knowing that they have part of the portfolio in a small group of companies that will go down over time -- we hope and we think --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You expect. So the people who are listening to this, who are in the industry, certainly know who you are. But regular investors, radio listeners may not know who you are.</p><p/><p>So let me discuss your curriculum vitae for a second. You first came into the public eye as an analyst at -- was it Gilford (ph) Securities way back when?</p><p/><p>And you had identified one of Wall Street's favorite stocks, which at the time was an insurance company called Baldwin and you had essentially figured out that it was a sham. It was a giant insurance scam that was cooking their books -- this is a theme we'll come to again and again -- and people mocked the call, \"The Wall Street Journal\" had a pretty aggressive articulate that pretty much trashed your analysis and ultimately you had the last laugh, because it's almost quaint to say at the time, when Baldwin went bankrupt, at $9 billion, it was the largest bankruptcy in history, although we know, oh, $9 billion, that's adorable compared to what we've seen since then.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, back then it wasn't so adorable.</p><p/><p>Well, Baldwin was -- Baldwin United was the old Baldwin Piano Company, which had morphed under very charismatic CEO into an aggressive seller of insurance products, particularly annuities, through Wall Street.</p><p/><p>And therefore it became a Wall Street darling in the early '80s on the back of not only the rapid earnings growth, but also because Wall Street was being paid by Baldwin.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Five percent commission on a policy --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that buys a lot of goodwill on the street --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, it does. And particularly when you're offering yields on these insurance products that were as high as 14 percent. The problem was Baldwin wasn't earning anything close to that in its insurance portfolios. So they ultimately had to begin doing acquisitions and getting insurance department approval to fund those acquisitions with insurance company money, which is highly, highly unusual.</p><p/><p>And that was the beginning of the end for them.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So you were a kid then.</p><p/><p>How old were you when you made that call?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I wrote -- my sense of timing was impeccable. I put out my first solo recommendation on the company on the absolute bottom of the market, the day that Henry Kaufman (ph) said buys stocks in August of 1982. I think it was August 17th of 1982.</p><p/><p>I said sell the -- or sell this thing short. And --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: About 25 bucks, is that about right?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I think it was about $25. It went briefly to $20 and then straight to $55.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Doubled.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, it was a good -- it was a good initiation into fundamental short selling. But the interesting thing about that story was we -- first report when we did a follow-up report was that a lot of the radioactive aspect of Baldwin was hiding in plain sight. It was -- it was -- you could see it if you looked at the publicly available documents the SEC filings and their insurance company statements, which were public.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So here's the question you're going to hear me ask you repeatedly this afternoon.</p><p/><p>How is it that this was in plain view, a $9 billion fraud, and nobody else could spot it?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, first of all, it wasn't in a lot of people's interest to spot it because the analysts who were covering the company most closely and had buy ratings on this thing were also working for the firms that sold the annuities. So it was also a good introduction to the whole concept of conflict of interest.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: To say the least.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p/><p>And number two, you had to do a little bit of digging. And I think in many ways, not being insurance analysts, just being a young analyst who was learning about insurance, I just simply kept asking questions of things that didn't seem to make sense to me. And most of the answers had -- were logical but every once in a while, it would come back with something that was just simply nonsensical.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That sounds very familiar. That reminds me a little bit of what took place so in the future with Enron.</p><p/><p>So this was '82. Most people probably this never entered their radar.</p><p/><p>But Enron, on the other hand, entered a lot of people's radar and in fact that's probably how anyone who's a member of the public or the investing community who knows you probably found you through Enron, which is a remarkably similar story.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It was. And in what would seem even more interesting about it was that not only were the facts at Enron hiding in plain sight -- there's been a lot written about that -- but Enron, using their mark-to- model accounting, where they pulled forward future profit estimates, Baldwin was doing the same exact thing with its annuities. They were estimating a spread of income -- which they weren't earning, of course --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Which may or may not have existed, depending on future --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- and then they -- and then they estimate how long the policies would stay on the books and they took the present value and they sold the policy. And so --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right, not accounting for the fact that interest rates fluctuate and other factors --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they were writing this down as if it was money good.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right, exactly.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Coming up, we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, manager of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. And today I'm speaking to famed short seller Jim Chanos.</p><p/><p>We were talking a little bit about how Enron was so similar to Baldwin. And you had mentioned, you read the 10(k), you read the annual report, you read the quarterly report three times. You still have no idea what they hell they do.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right. The other -- the other interesting similarity was they both had charismatic leaders, who were very bright; Baldwin had a guy by the name of Morley Thompson (ph) and -- who went from literally peddling pianos door-to-door. (INAUDIBLE) good salesmen to sell pianos door-to- door.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And strong (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And morphing into financial services and of course Enron had Jeff Skilling (ph) and to a lesser extent Ken Lay.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And so when we first started looking at Enron, Enron decided to make a market in everything from energy trading to you name it, they were going to take everything, turn it into a tradable commodity, whether or not it should be is a whole different discussion.</p><p/><p>What was the first warning sign that you saw with Enron?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, it's actually -- it was a column written by John Wilde (ph). He wrote a piece in the Texas \"Wall Street Journal\" in the fall of 2000, where he pointed out that energy merchant banks had just gotten a favorable ruling from the SEC on this mark-to-model accounting. So much for the Baldwin type stuff.</p><p/><p>And a friend of mine running a hedge fund in Dallas, Texas, called it to my attention. And of course email was rudimentary; he faxed it to me. And I read the piece and immediately --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: '97, '98 --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- this was in 2000 --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- far along.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- and immediate cracked the 1999 10(k) and March and June 10(q)s of Enron and immediately began to see all kinds of odd things. In addition we noticed right away that not only was there a lot of insider selling throughout 2000 in Enron stock, but there were a number of key high-level executive departures. And that's -- those two -- those two in conjunction, often there will be insider selling to start.</p><p/><p>But when you see insider selling across the executive suite as well as executive departures, there's usually something wrong.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes. That's quite fascinating. And so you start digging in and what's the - -you begin working with Bethany McLean, then of -- still of \"Fortune.\"</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- ultimately end up writing the book, \"Smartest Guys in the Room,\" and what were the next couple of things that you uncovered in digging into Enron?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, the -- I had to -- two -- my partner at the time, Doug Millett (ph) and an analyst who's now my current partner, Chuck Hobbs (ph), we -- the three of us dug into the financials. And one of the first things Doug pointed out was this is nothing more than a leveraged hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline, which I think was the -- still the best apt description of Enron.</p><p/><p>But as we dug into the numbers, there were a few odd things right away. We noticed that even with their sort of odd accounting, the company was only earning 6 percent pretax on its capital. And --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: In a period when everybody's just making --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right. And in which people are -- were paying five times book for this -- the stock. So --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: For a 6 percent ROI on --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- five times NAV for a hedge fund that was earning 6 percent? No, you wouldn't.</p><p/><p>So that was the first thing.</p><p/><p>Number two, I noticed immediately they weren't matching their -- in that -- there's an accounting principle called matching similar gains and losses. And they had a merchant banking arm that did things like sell energy barges or construct utility plants.</p><p/><p>And when they had a gain, they would put it through the merchant banking operating income line. But it appeared to me that when they looked like they were going to lose money on something, they held it as a discontinued asset, held for sale for a year, and then put it below the operating income line so people disregarded it as an extraordinary event.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So they buried what should have been an ordinary --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- should have matched everything as net, net profit. Instead they basically showed their winners and tried you to disregard the losers. That was another flag.</p><p/><p>The third one is -- were these odd footnotes that said there was a group of entities set up by an executive of Enron to trade with Enron or an executive -- senior executive of the company was the general partner of the entities. And, I mean, that was an immediate red flag to, well, what were these entities and why is a --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, how can you be a counterparty with himself?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- this person conflicted.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And we now know those were the famous raptors and LJMs and these off-balance sheet entities --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right, side pockets and -- I believe it was McKenzie (ph) who came up with some of the concepts for that, if not those exact ones, but that philosophical structure came from --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- came from --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- from McKenzie, that's right.</p><p/><p>So quite fascinating.</p><p/><p>And now let's fast forward. So ultimately Enron collapses after having a huge run-up. it takes a year to fall from about 89 bucks, 83 bucks, if memory serves, down to zero. It was -- it was glacial; if you're short, you must be champing at the bit. That's something I want to talk to you about a little later.</p><p/><p>The mindset of how do you stay short a position fundamentally when it's running up against you and even when it starts -- I remember Lehman Brothers, when we were short, Lehman, when we watched it collapse, every time it fell and looked like it was about to just freefall, there would be this squeeze. There would be this move back up.</p><p/><p>In '07, '08, you were short most of that whole area. We're talking about investment banks, builders, commercial banks. What else were you short in the credit sector before the collapse?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, we have a rule that we don't -- we don't short anybody we do business with. And since we did agency business most of the brokers, we were not short Lehman or Bear. We actually were prime broker, a client of Bear. But there certainly -- in the credit area, there was a lot of -- a lot of things to do.</p><p/><p>I mean, the Florida homebuilders, West Coast homebuilders, building supply companies, the credit rating agencies, a number of banks that were pretty aggressive --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Bond insurance companies?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- bond insurance companies, yes, yes. Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And (INAUDIBLE) around the same time.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: NBIA.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: NBIA was the other one. They all freefell down to single digits.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And the -- you're exactly right. I mean, typically, stocks that are fundamentally flawed, where the equity is worthless, you will have a number of vicious rallies, often 50-60 percent.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Unbelievable. And you look at that and you say, who the hell is buying this junk? This is a stock cut in half that should be going to zero and yet you end up with the floor underneath these freefalling stocks and those squeezes are incredibly painful to live through, if -- especially if you're counting your money before you close that position.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, we never do that.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's always a bad thing to do.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But I would point out that one of the ways that you alleviate that a little bit is that people tend to think about the short side very discretely. And often because a lot of money managers who actually do short stocks may only be short a handful of stocks versus quite a few longs.</p><p/><p>And in our -- in our case, it's a whole portfolio. I mean, in the U.S., typically historically over 30 years, we've averaged about 50 names in the portfolio at any given time.</p><p/><p>So no one position is an unusually large amount --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: 3-4-5 percent, is that --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, 5 percent would be the top. But I mean, typically average is 2 percent.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Coming up, we delve into the mind of the short seller as we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, chairman of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. I am privileged to be speaking to a master of the short side, Jim Chanos.</p><p/><p>Earlier we were talking about the short in Baldwin and Enron, as well as all the financials heading into '08. I recall reading a fabulous profile of you in \"New York\" magazine, the end of 2008, and I don't know if they were talking about a specific fund or generally but they were saying you were up 50 percent for the year in '08. I know you may not be able to comment on numbers. We all work with compliance and lawyers and what have you.</p><p/><p>But '08 turned out to be a pretty good year for you.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, but the way we gauge ourself (sic), Barry, is actually versus the market and, in fact, although we have partnerships and offshore funds that you can invest in that are -- appear short and the numbers are what they are, the bulk of our business is our managed account business, where we're a large pension fund or endowment or sovereign wealth fund, gives us assets to manage short.</p><p/><p>And in those cases, we're benchmarked versus the market inversely.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So if the market goes up 10 percent, your benchmark is -10 percent?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Exactly. And so to the extent -- for example, if the market goes up 20 percent and we're flat for that account, you know, it's as if we were up 20 percent. And we're compensated in performance view on that.</p><p/><p>Conversely, if the market goes down 40 percent and we're up 40 percent, we make no performance --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's flat.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Exactly. So it's a crude alpha measure. And that's really the way the firm has survived in a market that's up 2,000 percent, as you point out.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Since 1985, since you launched the firm, and this is the fascinating thing about running a short firm when, by the way, a lot of your colleagues who are in that space haven't survived as long as you have.</p><p/><p>So since you launched in '85, the S&amp;P 500 is up over 2,000 percent and yet you've managed to thrive as a short seller.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. We're up -- on a stand-alone basis, our flagship fund, which goes back to '85 -- I think is up a couple percent compounded. But when you factor that into the fact that -- offset it on the long side and rebalance monthly, the alpha is somewhere in the mid-teens.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's fantastic.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And that's actually what -- that's how we get paid and that's how people evaluate us. And so --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You exist to create a hedge to institutions, pension funds, endowments, who, by definition, are, for the most part, long only.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, the -- another way to think of it is we're an insurance policy that actually pays like premiums --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: As opposed to the not --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- being upset when you --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. Exactly. And so I think that's -- I've quipped that Kynikos is, in effect, an insurance business. And it's not -- it's not, I think, an unreasonable analogy.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's talk. We have a few minutes left in the segment.</p><p/><p>Let's talk about what it's like to be upside down in a position that's running against you.</p><p/><p>Baldwin is a perfect example. You put this out at 25, drops to 20. You feel like a genius for five points. Next thing you know, it more than doubles, it almost triples from there.</p><p/><p>How do you have the constitution -- like I know a lot of guys who can compartmentalize. I think I can compartmentalize. But the vast majority of investors, you know, the old joke is how did you sleep with the -- all your positions going against you? Like a baby. I woke up every two hours, cried for Mommy and wet myself.</p><p/><p>A lot of people don't have that constitution to -- so how do you sleep at night with positions running against you?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, I think the -- it is -- it is personality based. I think -- I used to think when I started the business that shorting stocks fundamentally was just simply the mirror image of going long. And I've said publicly many times, I don't think that's the case anymore. I think a lot of it's rooted in behavioral finance. I think we're all by and large, we're listeners to this show and others are the product of positive reinforcement cycles.</p><p/><p>And most people's rational decision-making studies have shown breaks down in an environment negative reinforcement. And if you're --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in other words when positions going against you, their discipline goes away when they need it --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- well, and the ultimate example, which will be something like an interrogation. And so the ability to withhold information. So if you're long in the market, you're constantly -- when I come in every day, we have 50 stocks in the U.S., another 40 globally, you know, I can pretty much be sure that 20 percent of my names will have a research note out, a buy recommendation, earnings estimates raised.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Something's moving.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: The CEO and Bloomberg, whatever the case might be. And most of that is noise. But it's the noise that most people in the market are used to. And I call it the Muzak of the investment business.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: I'm going to pull a quote I was saving for before, because it's so dead-on.</p><p/><p>You called it \"the cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And so most people -- as I say, they're used to that. But if you're a short seller or you're a negative -- on a situation, you're being told constantly you're wrong. And here's why. And you know, 50-page research report to follow.</p><p/><p>And I think that not everyone has the ability to simply drown that out and say, OK. That's all well and good. But that's in the price of the stock. Do we know that? And the facts that I have are very important and the market doesn't really know that or appreciate how important they are.</p><p/><p>So I'm not sure. I think the research is the same. And I think that good research can be taught both on long and short side and should be the same. I think the ability to deal with the noise, the swing factors, the volatility, I think that's a different attribute.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: We continue our conversation with famed short seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates. And we'll discuss the role of the short seller in modern markets. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p/><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. I'm thrilled to be speaking with Jim Chanos -- am I pronouncing Kynikos -- is that -- correctly?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Oh, you're ready to go to Greece --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Kynikos associates, Kynikos, which translates as \"cynic.\" And you have spent a couple of cynical but lucrative decades on Wall Street, calling out the nonsense that passes for ordinary Wall Street noise.</p><p/><p>Let's talk a little bit about the role of the short seller in markets. And here it is. It's five years past the financial crisis. People forget it wasn't the banks overleveraged and writing all this junk CDS and AIG writing the $3 trillion worth of derivatives with exactly $0 reserved for it. It was you short sellers that caused the crisis.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, sure was.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: How do you defend yourself for bringing the world to the edge of the abyss?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, you never --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And by the way, that was at the highest levels of -- we heard that from the ECB, we heard that crap from Treasury. We heard that from everywhere. And it was just despite Enron and WorldCom and a whole slew of fraud uncovered by short sellers, including Lehman Brothers.</p><p/><p>How does anybody actually say that?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, you remember, Barry, right after Bear Stearns collapsed, a group of bankers who shall go nameless from New York, went down to Washington and sat with senators from New York and elsewhere and with Treasury Secretary Paulson, whatever. And they asked for two things. They didn't ask for forgiveness for their crazy lending and leveraging, they didn't ask for forbearance on capital levels, which they were going to need.</p><p/><p>Instead they asked for a relaxation of the accounting rules, a mark- to-market. And they asked for a ban or curbs on short selling of their shares. And that, to us, was very telling, because it told you where their mindset was. It wasn't about what actually they had done on their balance sheets and they way they had accounted for them.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Repo 103?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Oh, and all kinds of --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- fine, moving stuff off balance sheet each quarter, what harm --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- 105 was the least of it. But I mean, just saying they were more worried about it being uncovered and/or having to mark things profitably or -- excuse me, properly. In fact, I mean, a year earlier than that, at a G7 meeting, I was asked, along with Paul Singer -- and this is public information --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: This is the spring of '07?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes and --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before anything --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- in April of '07, we actually briefed the G7 at their Washington meetings on -- we were asked to give a talk about hedge funds and the risks of hedge funds. And Paul and I gave a presentation on the looming credit crisis. He did it on the structure of structured finance and how unstable it was. And I did it on bank balance sheets and how loaded to the gills international banks were with the stuff Paul had just talked about.</p><p/><p>And it was met with, you know, some would say, at best polite applause or, at most, a stifled yawn.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Now did these guys actually get it? Or were you talking way over their -- ?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: No, no, they got it. I mean, there were -- there were people from the Fed there. There were people, you know, Gordon Brown, the future U.K. prime minister was in the room. You know, a future Treasury Secretary was in the room, future ECB central banker was in the room. I mean, these were serious people and I think that --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, which future Treasury Secretary or serious people, I think, an argument can be made that that Venn diagram has very little lovelife.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, we'll leave it -- let you make that statement. But I'm just saying that that again -- I mean, for people to say that nobody warned or could see this coming, and Gillian Tett, in her book, \"Fool's Gold,\" has a chapter on that meeting, which I think is worth the read. But --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And she was one of the people in the \"FT,\" pounding away about this long before Lehman and AIG collapsed. And it was -- you had to willfully look away if you didn't want to see --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Willful blindness, which is a concept I teach in my financial fraud history class, willful blindness is a very, very strong argument.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- up in New Haven, if memory --</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, I teach at Yale SOM.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's great. That sounds like it must be a fascinating -- how do you find the kids these days?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I think they're -- well, mine aren't kids, because they're mostly students in their late 20s, but --</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Those are kids.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I -- it's a great class and I get as much out of it as I hope they do. It's a good group and we basically look at some models, historically, of fraud, academic models and then do case-by-case, going back to the 1690s. And it's remarkable as to how these cycles actually keep repeating with many of the same methods, just right up to date.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So who's uncovered more fraud? Various regulatory agencies? Or hedge funds and others who short? How do you -- what's that scorecard look like?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I'd like to say that virtually all major frauds over the past 20-30 years have really been uncovered by either internal whistleblowers, journalists and/or short sellers. Very, very few have been uncovered by regulatory agencies or law enforcement, very few.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And yet the first thing that happens in the crisis is -- first things we do, blame all the short sellers.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. Well, that's -- a friend of mine named Bob Sloan wrote a great book about that, a history, called \"Blame the Shorts.\" And it has a long, long storied history also going back to the 1600s where people really will point fingers to those who have profited when -- when they've lost money. And -- and that's human nature, I think.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So now let's sidestep a little bit or -- or just change a little bit. We've been talking about accounting fraud. We haven't even gotten to the role of the accountants, but clearly, the -- the big four, big five -- I don't even know how many are left -- are major enablers of what takes place with -- with many of these, uh, shorts, but now let's -- let's focus on the C-suite and corporate management.</p><p/><p>You recently put out a commentary about buy-backs as little more than financial engineering and speculation in the market by the CEOs of America, whose track record in dabbling in market timing is especially awful.</p><p/><p>What -- what don't you like about buy-backs?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, first of all, in -- in aggregate, every CEO, of course, always thinks their stock is undervalued. We -- we -- we know that.</p><p/><p>But what...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Except when they're selling.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- what worries -- well, well, we'll get to that in a second.</p><p/><p>But what worries me is that corporate America, in aggregate, has pre- tax returns on capital in the mid to high teens.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: The long-term expected rate of the equity markets is roughly half that. And when corporations are embarked on massive buy-backs across all industries and all companies, in effect, these CEOs are buying the stock market.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right?</p><p/><p>So what they're telling you then is -- is unequivocally that they think that either they're happy to earn the stock market rate of return or maybe something hopefully better...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Which -- which is half what you would expect...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- or...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- their rate of return...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- or...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- their rate of return on the margin of any new capital product is much, much lower -- in fact, half or less, of what -- of what is stated. And that does not bode well for the -- the future of profits or for the quality of earnings reported as current profits.</p><p/><p>There's one additional problem with this whole thing, and that is, number one, the CEOs making this decision typically have a very short tenure at companies.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: They're not thinking long-term.</p><p/><p>And number two, we're seeing an increase in insider selling concurrent with the increase in buy-backs.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So out of one side of the mouth...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: They're saying the...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: They...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- the companies should be buying stock...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But maybe I should be lightening up.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- but I'm going to -- right. That's -- that's it. You know, my...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- my favorite data point on stock buy-backs is that Dell, now a private company, spent more money on buy-backs than they earned over their entire...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- lifetime. That -- that's just an astonishing figure.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And I think that -- well, I think you see that in companies like sears, as well. But -- but the -- for a lot of companies, the other problem with this, of course, is is that CEOs are terrible market timers.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: They're always buying back stu -- the previous peak in corporate buy-back activity was the second quarter of 2007.</p><p/><p>And -- and where was the low?</p><p/><p>The second quarter 2009.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You see the same thing with acquisitions and mergers.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: They love to do...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: With inflated stock -- to buy inflated stock...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Corporate activity...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) stuff is cheap...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- follows the market -- basically follows or is coincident with the market.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It's not a leading indicator.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So we have buy-backs as financial engineering.</p><p/><p>What about dividends?</p><p/><p>A little more credible than?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, a little bit more credible and -- and I think certainly where -- any time you see the actual cash go out the door, um, the other interesting observation we've -- we've made in looking at corporate financial transactions is that increasingly, we're seeing acquisitions which are not taken out of most analysts' free cash flow numbers, acquisitions are replacing CAPEX, corporal -- capital spending or R&amp;D. So companies are buying their -- their R&amp;D or their -- their -- their capital. And that should probably be properly deducted from the free cash flow, because, in aggregate, corporate America is not growing.</p><p/><p>So they're -- by buying each other, you know, and buying divisions of each other, in effect, they're -- they're capitalizing their R&amp;D. Um, and, I think that that's an interesting obser -- and that particularly applies for big tech...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- which are perceived as very cheap companies. If you actually look at them, the only reason their revenues aren't declining at a -- at a reasonable rate is because they're -- they're buying other companies.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: We sort of stated these in the pharmaceutical area...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: They quote a bunch of genomics, molecular, go down the list, as opposed to plowing money into their own R&amp;D...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- OK, let's go out and buy these new...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And, again...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- and rather than expensing the R&amp;D, they're capitalizing by purchasing. They can set it up as goodwill. And so it's overstating their earnings. And that -- that's a key point that we were trying to hone in on, that -- that companies that grow this way by acquisition are most likely overstating their earnings meaningfully.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And we've seen a ton of acquisitions, maybe not as much as at other peaks, but the M&amp;A activity, along with the IPO activity has certainly picked up fairly appreciably in the past couple of quarters.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, and the M&amp;A activity gives rise, we worry -- we're -- we think and worry, on a really drop in the quality of earnings. And -- and that, I think, drives a lot of M&amp;A activity, the ability to write down inventories, write down receivables, write up liabilities and basically give yourself, in effect, what -- what Herb Greenberg has called a cookie jar going forward to help manage your earnings.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: I've been speaking with James Chanos, chairman of Kynikos Associates. You can listen to more of our conversation with Jim in our podcast extra, which is available on Bloomberg View, on SoundCloud and at Apple iTunes, as well as the Bloomberg Radio Plus App.</p><p/><p>Coming up next week, we sit down with former FDIC Chairperson Sheila Bair, which is a really fascinating conversation.</p><p/><p>Be sure and check out my daily column on bloombergview.com or follow me on Twitter @ritholtz. At my blog, I posted a whole bunch of unrelated but interesting items. That's ritholtz.com.</p><p/><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p/><p>You're listening to Masters In Business on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This concludes the broadcast portion of our interview.</p><p/><p>Coming up with our guest, the radio podcast extra.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Today, I've been speaking with James Chanos of Kynikos Associates.</p><p/><p>And we've been talking generally about short-selling and what it's like to run short funds.</p><p/><p>What I love to do in these segments, when we finish broadcasting on the air and go to the podcast, is talk a little bit about you.</p><p/><p>You started in this business as an analyst. We talked about Baldwin and eventually Enron. But when you were an up-and-comer, when you were the age of the kids you're teaching at Yale, who were your influences?</p><p/><p>Who -- who are formative to the Jim Chanos approach to investment?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Um, you know, it's -- it's hard to find lots of people that you can point to who -- who did what I did. I mean I -- I was blessed when I was a young analyst at -- at Gilford Securities doing Baldwin that, um, we had a number of -- of well-known hedge fund managers who actually were our clients, people like Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, um, and I got to meet shortly after that when I moved to New York in '83, Julian Robertson. One of the people that probably had the most influence on me just passed away, uh, and that was -- it was sort of the legendary Bob Wilson...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- who was a -- was a -- not only a great investor, but a -- but an amazing philanthropist. And, uh, I used to have -- I used to have dinner with him or lunch with him from time to time. And he was a -- he had -- he was written up by John Train in \"The Money Masters.\" But he was of the legendary Resorts International short squeeze.</p><p/><p>But he was a tremendous investor on the long side. And, um, he introduced me to people like Dick Gilder here in New York and -- all of whom early, 30 years ago, you know, I learned from another fellow, Stephen Peck, who was an amazing investor, a client of mine, a good friend, of Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh, sure.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And all these people were just sort of, you know, as I was getting going in New York, not only were they helpful in terms of their wisdom and their experience and what not to do and -- but also introduced me to lots of other people.</p><p/><p>And -- and I think that that, you know, I'm indebted to all of them and -- and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few people.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So you mentioned George Soros, clients early on.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And Julian Robertson, another legendary hedge fund manager.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And Mike -- Mike Steinhardt.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Steinhardt. Again, another guy, called by some the greatest trader on Wall Street ever. I don't know if that's an exaggeration, but people have said that about him.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean they -- it -- I had the -- the pleasure of running money for all three of those men. And -- and they all were different and a different temperament and -- and -- and I would categorize them completely different people, but all -- all amazing investors.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Hmmm. Interesting.</p><p/><p>So you began as an analyst. You worked with some of the most storied names. Obviously, the industry has changed a lot since '83.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: A little bit.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: To think that a relatively unknown analyst at the time and a relatively small firm could get an audience with a Robertson or a Soros, that's not the sort of universe that we exist these days.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I think it would be a lot harder, I mean but -- but, first of all, people -- there weren't people putting out short-side research in -- in '80, even in '82 and '83 and -- and, uh, so, you know, I think the -- the Baldwin piece, a number of them were -- were short. A few of the people I just mentioned were short that. So it got me an audience with them early on, which I think was helpful.</p><p/><p>But, um, I think it would be a lot tougher today. I mean I started my -- my own fund when I was 27.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And -- yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's 30 -- 30 plus years...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: 1985, yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And so that's almost exactly 30 years ago.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And that -- that was just you and a partner and -- and how big is Kynikos today?</p><p/><p>How many employees...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean we have, I think, 33 employees in -- in New York and London. And, uh, and obviously a little bit more sophisticated.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It was just three of us, uh, at first and the two partners and a secretary. And my partner, a wonderful partner at the time who I brought with me from Deutsche Bank a year into it came to me and said, you know, I just don't think I -- I can do shorting stocks. And...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. And -- and -- and sold his half back to me, um, for a - - for a nominal amount of money. Uh, and, you know, just walked out the door and prospered, by the way, mightily since doing his own thing.</p><p/><p>So it -- it -- even when you think you can do it, sometimes you can't. And...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so you mentioned Deutsche Bank in -- in passing. If memory serves, they kind of showed you the door, didn't they?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. Yes. In the summer of -- of '85, um, there was a full page -- a front page...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: \"Journal.\"..</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- monster article talking about these evil short sellers and -- and how they were disrupting these great businesses. Um, and in the middle of the article was -- was sort of -- was me. And a...</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- and a...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And this is even after Baldwin...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- had collapsed and...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And after a number of other calls we had made as well. And it, um, and so my -- my bosses in Frankfurt woke up that morning to see that, you know, Satan was working in their New York office. And I...</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- I was told a -- I was told, by the end of the day, my contract, which was coming up, would not be renewed. I mean they didn't fire me, but they just simply said, you know, time for you to do something else.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Thanks. Thanks. Thanks, uh, here's your hat. Watch (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. And then the postscript was I think nine of the 10 companies that were mentioned in that piece ultimately either went bankrupt or were prosecuted for fraud.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And any mea culpa from the right...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you know, obviously, you know someone is pulling the strings behind the scenes with that journalist and sends them down the wrong path.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean we were -- we were -- we were famously short a -- a lot of companies being run by a very aggressive investment bank out of Beverly Hills at the time. And I suspect that -- that that may or may not have had something to do with it.</p><p/><p>Having said all that, (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Are we -- are we talking about Drexel or are we talking about somebody else?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: No, we're talking about Drexel.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And a -- but -- but a -- one of the -- the, you know, serendipitous aspects was I had a client who had wanted me to run money for them as -- as a money manager, but because I was at a bank and it was...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You couldn't do it.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- (INAUDIBLE) -- I couldn't do it. And so when I told them, yes, I was going to be looking for work, they said, well, why don't we set you up in business?</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: So that's -- that's how -- that's how Kynikos Associates got started.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's unbelievable. I love stories like that.</p><p/><p>You know, Ray Dalio has a similar story. You talk to a number of people, Jeff Gundlach, there are a lot of people who start in this business in one direction and, for whatever reason, end up making a turn and it's enormously successful.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I've often taught not only the -- the people who work for me, but my students that -- that's one of the things about business that you have to appreciate is that when good fortune, or bad fortune, comes your way, you have to know how to deal with it.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And the bad fortune, you have to -- you have to rebound, you have to pick yourself up. But when good fortune comes, you have to grab it.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And -- and take advantage of it, because it will happen a number of times in your career just out of chance. And if you don't take advantage of it, you miss that chance to move your career ahead on -- in a quantum leap...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- and I think that I was fortunate, at the time, in that I was young, I was not quite married yet. I was about to get married, but I didn't have kids. And often I tell people the time to take risks, actually, is not after you're established in your career, when you have a wife and kids and a mortgage...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Too much to lose.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- and -- and it's when you're younger and you're given an opportunity.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Because if it...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: What...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- works, it's great. If it doesn't, no one is going to hold it against you.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And you have the ability...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You -- you lose a year or two. You can (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: You have an ability to get back up. And in -- particularly in America, which is an aspirational society, I think people, in many cases, even if it doesn't work, will admire that you tried.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: When -- when we speak to people from overseas, when we speak to people in Europe especially, one of the things we hear time and again, that they admire the most about America is failure isn't a fatal...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: No.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- scarlet letter here. You know, henry Ford had five failed companies...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before Ford Motor Company. And the stories at Edison are legendary. He had hundreds of failed inventions before that light bulb finally...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: As long as your work ethic...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- is good and -- and you're honest, people will value your ideas. And -- and -- and that is one of the great things about our society, that -- that I think sets us apart from almost any other developed economy. You fail in most other developed economies, you're done.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: That's it.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: No second -- no second chapters elsewhere.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And that's not the case here at all.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So we talked about when you first launched. It was two guys and a secretary. Today, obviously, a much more sophisticated multinational entity. Take us through a -- a day in the life of Jim Chanos.</p><p/><p>What time do you start work?</p><p/><p>What -- what is your work flow like?</p><p/><p>What do you do throughout the day?</p><p/><p>I get the sense that you're not chained to Bloomberg all day watching every tick.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: No, I'm not. I mean I have a trading desk that does that. But our -- our portfolio only turns over about once a year, so -- which is glacial by hedge funds.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Sure.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: We're really investors. So I mean time spent looking at every tick is not time well spent for me. Looking at companies is more important for me.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: By -- by the way, that's a theme that's been pretty consistent. I can't begin to tell you how many investors we've spoken to who all pretty much say, if you -- if you have a good idea and a high degree of confidence, the day to day noise, that cacophony you mentioned...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- those fluctuations, it's meaningless noise and you have to have the con -- courage of your conviction.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean you need -- you need to have an intelligence post, as we do -- and I have a good one -- to -- to -- to point it all out to you. But you also need filters and you need to understand.</p><p/><p>And one of the big differences, Barry, in the business now from when we started was back then, getting the information gave you a leg up.</p><p/><p>So if you read the 10-Q because you got it a day or two before the rest of the Street and you saw something buried in -- in management's discussion, you had a piece of information that was, A, public, and, B, material. And it might move the stock and -- and there were lots of instances of that.</p><p/><p>Um, nowadays, the information comes at you with a fire hose.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I mean it truly does. And -- and the key is having, A, the right filters and the right staff and the right ability to -- to pull out what is the real information from just the absolute, you know, torrent of water coming at you. And -- and so that has changed a lot.</p><p/><p>So I mean I -- I'll get up, you know, obviously, the older I get -- and you might appreciate this, you know, I might get a few -- up a few times at night anyway, but I'll get up, you know, early in the morning and check the markets and if nothing earth-shaking is happening in Asia or Europe and we have a desk that's 24-7, you know, I'll go back to sleep.</p><p/><p>And then typically, you know, up -- up again early in the morning and then it's going through morning news, filings, research that comes in internally overnight, research that's come in externally overnight, um, you know, and -- and then the day may, depending on -- on my schedule, whatever.</p><p/><p>But unfortunately, it's -- it's 24-7, you know, in a way that you know in that...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: I get the sense you read a lot throughout your day.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I read an awful lot whether I'm on the move or whatever, so, unfortunately, you know, you -- you have to stay connected. I'm trying to get to the point now where I am able to do it for Saturdays, but I'm trying to make Sundays a non-e-mail, non-electric -- non-electronic day, um, to just disconnect one day out of the week. I think that is becoming a little bit more important and a...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's just a recharge day, just a...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, it's just a recharge day...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) it up a little bit.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And in the spring for eight weeks on -- in the afternoons on Monday, I teach. And that's been, actually, a -- a wonderful, wonderful adjunct to what I'm doing for all kinds of good reasons. And -- and -- and I think that's been a -- been -- been a wonderful plus. And my clients and partners have been very supportive of that -- of that...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: It -- it's just a change in the routine and it allows you to mix it up a little bit.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. And it -- and it's great to interreact and go back to history, whether it's my history or history from 300 years ago, though sometimes it feels like I've lived 300 years.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Um, and -- and, impart, some of the stuff back to a -- back to students.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so you're teaching at Yale School of Management.</p><p/><p>Am I recalling correctly, did you go undergrad to Yale?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I did. I did.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You did. OK.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I did, years ago.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So you're back -- back in the dorms, effectively?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, well...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- not quite, but I -- I have two -- two sons who went, as well, and when I told them I was going back to teach and that maybe we could...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: They were horrified.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- live together in -- in like in a con...</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- in a condo like back to school...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CHANOS: They wouldn't even...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- they looked to me horrified until I told them I was kidding.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's hilarious.</p><p/><p>Um, they're at a -- I'm assuming they're out of school or?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: One is. One is still there.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And, um, that's pretty funny.</p><p/><p>So every -- you've been doing this how many years now over the...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in the springs?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- I got on the -- I'm on my fourth year of teaching.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh, that's great.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. And a -- and a -- it's a lot, as I say, a lot of fun and it's one afternoon for two months in -- in the spring. And Yale has got a brand new business school, so I'll give a plug for that. And an amazing new dean and a -- Yale SOM is on the way up.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: We have Bob Shiller coming in in a few weeks...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, he's...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- he's one of my favorite...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- he's one of my -- he's certainly a tenured -- a tenured and Nobel Prize winner.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: He's at a different level.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: He -- he's really fascinating...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I'm the low man on the totem pole in the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You -- you talk about -- but you talk about the psychology of investing in behavioral economics...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and how (INAUDIBLE). Here's a guy teaching in the same place you're teaching who's been one of the key drivers of that philosophy for a good couple of decades.</p><p/><p>You -- you mentioned the far -- the fund launched in '85.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's 30 years ago.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Almost.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: How has the hedge fund industry changed in that ensuing period?</p><p/><p>What -- what do you see as big differences?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean the growth, first of all. I mean it -- we had a...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Enormous.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: We had a...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Over $2 trillion now.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: We started with $16 million in '85 and by -- by 19 -- the end of 19 -- early '91, we were over $600 million in assets. And that put us in the top 10 globally of hedge funds...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- of (INAUDIBLE). And -- and so that -- that tells you just how small the industry was back then. Um, the dramatic growth was -- was in the late '90s and early millennium.</p><p/><p>But it was truly a small handful of people. Everybody kind of knew each other in the '80s. There were...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: A hundred hedge funds, 200 hedge funds?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, maybe no more than 100...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Now it's 10,000...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- maybe...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- something like that?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Maybe more than 100 and probably practically, 20 or 30.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And -- and -- and everybody knew everybody. I mean truly. And there weren't a lot of -- a lot of real different strategies. I mean everybody was pretty much in the equity markets, give or take.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Long, short?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Long, short, maybe...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- and that was kind of it. And then -- and, you know, you had guys like -- like -- like Mike Steinhardt spec -- and Soros speculating in bonds and currencies, um, but -- but it was, by and large, an equity driven model. And a -- and everybody was, at that point, was fairly adept, both on the long and short side.</p><p/><p>Um, getting institutional investors was a big deal back then. That he didn't really started until the '90s.</p><p/><p>So...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So in the '80s, your clients were essentially just high net worth individuals...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: High net worth or foreign families because the...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So family offices but no sovereign wealth funds yet?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Typically not. You would -- typically not U.S. fun -- families and no sovereign wealth funds. No endowments. By and large, no pension funds.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's amazing.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And everything has completely changed. Now it's...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Completely changed. All of it.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- dominated by big institutions.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Ten thousand hedge funds, although, if you look at the -- the Bell Curve, that is -- that is not a normal Gaussian distribution. It's effectively those 100 hedge funds capturing 80 percent of the alpha and then a long tail of underperformance.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: That's probably -- that's probably right.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: The -- the numbers are pretty -- when you look at the Tremont data and you look at some of the other hedge fund data that's out there, the funds that are earning their keep are few and far between.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean true alpha is -- is hard to come by, as we all know.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: For -- for sure. Well, the -- you know, it's like expansion in -- in professional sports teams, you go from 22 to 26 teams and suddenly there's that much talent -- less talent on any one team. It's spread around. And there's sort of a uniform mediocrity.</p><p/><p>But a handful of all stars, you know, there's 100 funds out there that are just...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, the...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- stealing it.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- the only difference is you can't start your own NBA team. You can start your own hedge fund.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Very easily.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: That makes it worse.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: All -- all you have to do is talk someone into giving you X dollars...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And it's not even -- there's not even a $100 million minimum. You could -- you know, the SEC regulates RIAs and others. If you have 100 plus, you don't have to do state by state. It's one regulatory scheme. So that's a bogey for a lot of -- you don't even have that on the hedge fund side. Anyone with a couple of million dollars can launch a hedge fund.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. Although it is harder. I mean to -- in -- in -- the cost of doing business, of getting a real prime broker, I mean...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- (INAUDIBLE) now that I think have -- have, I think, taken that true start-up out of the -- the industry.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE), in fact, you sort of do need a -- a critical mass to be considered a -- a, you know, a -- at least viable.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So, obviously the industry has changed dramatically over the past couple of years. Let me -- let me throw some of my favorite quotes, um, of yours -- of yours back at you and see what your...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: OK.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- reaction is. Let -- let's talk about timing. \"In investing, you could be really right but temporarily quite wrong.\" I love that line, because I started in the business as a trader and I -- it was always drilled into my head, hey, either you're right or wrong.</p><p/><p>If -- if you think you're right and the market is going against you, you're wrong. But when you're doing fundamental shorting, you're basically -- our friend Doug Kass calls it variant perception. You're identifying what people aren't seeing, or seeing incorrectly...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you're going to be wrong for a long time, almost by identifying that variant perception. You're wrong for a while by definition...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, and there's...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before people catch on.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- there's -- there's a big difference. If you're trading a position, you know, sort of because of a fundamental view and your time frame has shortened enough, price tells you everything, almost.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And in a fundamental short position, not only are you analyzing the company or -- or the -- whatever it is you're analyzing, but in many cases, you have a management team interposed that's actively working to -- to -- to prove you're wrong through activities that aren't necessarily kosher.</p><p/><p>And so there's an added level here of -- of sort of three-dimensional chess when you're on the fundamental short side because the market won't necessarily immediately see what you see. And, in fact, often doesn't. And -- and that's why most fundamental short sellers will tell you, they're -- they're often early.</p><p/><p>One additional problem, you have to borrow the shares.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And so the ability to effect a short position in reasonable size for a firm like ours, once everything is clear, may not be given to you. And so there -- there are additional hurdles that don't exist in traditional investing that exist on the short side.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, we mentioned -- I mentioned Doug Kass earlier. One of the things he taught me early on, which I would have wish I had known when I was shorting Lehman, was that you could be short the stock and you're going to get squeezed. But if you really want to make a run for it, you marry a put to that and if you close the short position, you could let the put run. It's never going to get called for you. You're never going to get squeezed. You could -- you're paying up for the option, but it's a way to get, um, that juiced return, because the -- on the short side, the most you can make is 100 percent. With options...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, that's actually not true. But go ahead with it.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, what -- well, let's discuss that, because that's a standard line against short-selling.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, that's...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Look, you're shorting at 50, you can only go to zero, that's 100 percent.</p><p/><p>Why is that wrong?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, because...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Because of leverage and?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, because the ability of -- of -- if you start with a short position at 100 and -- and with no other cash in your account and you short the stock and it goes down to 50, OK, you can, without adding any more cash -- capital to the account, short additional shares. And if it keeps going your way, you -- you can compound your return.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: But then you're running the risk of -- of...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- a margin call, a squeeze...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, that's fine.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But I just want to...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I want to get the statement (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So you can...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: That you can't make more than 100 percent on initial capital. That's not true.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So you can -- with -- if you're actually using the gain in, um, value, falling stock creates, if you're short, you're then pyramiding that on top and -- and shorting that with that additional effort.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, you're shorting on -- on -- you're compounding your profit, in effect.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. So number two, I've also (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: By the way, I've heard that 100,000 times. You're the first person who's corrected that.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: So -- so the -- the -- the other problem, of course, is is that, you know, I've seen a lot more stocks go to zero than -- than infamy -- invidimy (ph).</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: That -- and that's the -- that's the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But the -- the key point for your listener, of course, is is that for what we do, and -- and theoretically, don't try this at home, kids, we have a portfolio.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And a portfolio changes the volatility nature, like any portfolio will. There's going to be things that are always working and things that aren't working. And so, you know, I -- I think that a -- that really tells you that -- that a -- that doing this as a professional with a portfolio approach and watching your country risk, your industry risk and all those things makes much more sense.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So this leads -- you mentioned something earlier and I want to address that. You mentioned you have management actively working against you in a number of ways.</p><p/><p>One of the things that you were very much in the forefront of was working with investigative journalists, working with the media to help uncover fraud.</p><p/><p>How did that first come about?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I'm a -- you know, clear up a misconception here. I mean we don't call up or e-mail reporters and say, hey, you ought to be looking at Enron. And in the case of Enron, Bethany McLean was talking to my partner at the time and he said -- and she said, you know, what do you - - what's interesting?</p><p/><p>And -- and -- and Douglas Millett, do you ever really talk to Jim about Enron?</p><p/><p>And he -- we -- we're real excited about it. And we -- we really think there's something there.</p><p/><p>So I mean that -- that often reporters find a way to fundamental short sellers to -- to ask them, hey, what do you -- what do you think of this or are you working on something?</p><p/><p>And -- and I think that I'll -- I think there are ways to do that and -- and not compromise anybody.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: On the other hand, I think there are ways not to do that. And I think you have to be mindful of -- of that. And I think there's approaches.</p><p/><p>Having said all that, I -- I'm a firm believer in the \"U.S. Constitution\" and -- and anybody has the right to their opinions of interest. But you're -- you do not have the right to your own facts.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And I think that that's an important point. But if you're a publicly traded company, you have to understand that the marketplace is going to be a marketplace of ideas and a marketplace of opinions, of...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: We've -- we've seen some litigation against short sellers. We've seen some litigation against analysts.</p><p/><p>What do you think of that sort of stuff?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, as I say, no one has the right to -- to trade on or -- or induce others to trade on information they know to be false. And that's kind of the -- the bright line that -- that -- that certainly most -- that all investors need to understand about securities fraud.</p><p/><p>But -- but an awful lot of companies seem to, you know, be upset when people don't have the approved opinion about that.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And, you know, that -- that is not actionable in our court system.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: One...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: A...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- one would hope.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: One would hope. One would hope. But...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so one of the...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: The federal courts, by the way, have a pretty strong view on that.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And they've been on the right side of this, for the most part...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Usually it's people that bring these cases are in state courts of -- of, you know, varying venues or questionable venues to try to get state, you know, put this before a jury in a state.</p><p/><p>Federal judges, by and large, look at these things and, for the most part, toss them out.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's the right way to do it.</p><p/><p>So you mentioned earlier about long versus short. There's a -- a longer quote I really like, which is, \"I used to think that good short sellers could be trained like long focused...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- value investors. It's the same skill set. You're tearing into the numbers. You're valuing businesses. You're assigning a consolidated value and hopefully you see something the market doesn't.\"</p><p/><p>But you've since learned, quote, \"There's a big difference between a long-focused value investor and a good short seller. And you mentioned the differences -- psychology and behavioral finance.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. And it...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's a great -- that's a fabulous quote.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And -- and I think that -- and I think that -- that -- as I said, I've run money for a lot of great investors who have farmed out the short side to me. And I've seen that, actually, some of the best value investors who I've had the pleasure of doing business with are not particularly good short sellers. And -- and shouldn't be selling short for that...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: The wrong constitution.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: They're just -- just the -- they'll obsess over very tiny positions that have gone against them, you know, that...</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- you know, that -- that fear of the stock going to infinity that we discussed. And...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: By the way, that's the other false statement. You -- we've talked about a stock can only lose 100 percent. I've heard that well when you're short, your losses are theoretically infinite.</p><p/><p>Well, not if you have a stop loss. Not if you have a line in the sand...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, there's in you...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that you cover...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- there's an even better little argument...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: There -- there's no lock limit up when it comes to equities.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: There's an even better little limit that no one talks about. If you're in a partnership and you're a limited partner, you can only lose what you put up.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right. That -- that's your limitation.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Which is an argument for investing with short sellers that way.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And so...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Typically a hedge fund as opposed to...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. You know, or...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hiding...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- or buying shares in an offshore corporation. And -- and - - and that's something, you know, we point out to people, too, that -- that, actually, you can, in effect, get the same limited -- limited down side by doing it in that structure. And the general partner takes the risk, but the prime broker will sell you out long before that ever happens.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. That's right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: So, again, these are -- these are -- these are...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Myths.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- examples of thinking -- well, they're not myths. They're -- they're accurate on the face, but in practicality, they're inaccurate...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- because -- because, again, you structure things to -- to not let that happen, A, and -- and, B, you can actually get protection through the structure of -- of the investment vehicle or whatever, to obviate the -- obviate the -- those risks.</p><p/><p>But having said all that, they do play into behavioral finance. And - - and I remember very famously, a well-known investor who's an incredibly - - he's got an incredible track record. I was running some money for him. And it was in the midst of our disastrous short on America Online in the -- in the late '90s. And I had...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: A little early.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- I had -- I had a small short portfolio I was running for him. And -- and AOL was never more than half of 1 percent or 1 percent of our portfolio, because it was so volatile. But it just kept doubling and doubling and doubling.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And we thought it was an accounting fraud, which it turned out to be.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And this investor called me repeatedly losing sleep at night and...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Over a half a percent (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- and this one -- and this -- this position was not moving the needle on his performance at all.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But he was -- he was -- I think, to the detriment of him working on other ideas. And a -- and it -- and -- and that was a real concrete example, to me, of just why it is that -- that certain people shouldn't do this, um, because it was bothering him.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: They just lack the constitution. They can't...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right. It...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they can't compartmentalize.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: They didn't -- they didn't need to because he -- he was such a good investor doing what he did well. And so for that person, you know, they shouldn't be doing it. And -- and I think that it gets back to exactly what you -- you've -- you've emphasized here, the psychological is completely different.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's -- let's talk about noise, since we -- we've touched on psychological, this is related to it. \"I listen to the noise to make sure there's no new information. I need to know. But I don't worry about most of it.\"</p><p/><p>And I -- I thought that was an interesting con -- concept, when -- when you discussed, relevant to this, analysts' reports, news, rumor mills, that's where the phrase, \"For a short seller, this is a cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: I -- I love that quote.</p><p/><p>So how do you deal with that noise?</p><p/><p>Do you filter all of it or do you have a staff that says, hey, out of these 1,000 things, these four or five you should...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, we...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hear?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- I mean first of all, if we're getting a piece of new material or information from a research report, my staff is not doing their job. Um, and -- because certainly, I want them reading the company filings and company press releases going to conferences, you know, and -- and I -- I hope they -- you know, our team is very good -- that -- that I'm reading it in an internal memo before I'm reading it in a -- in a Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch research piece a week later.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And that's usually the case 99 percent of the time.</p><p/><p>Having said all that, you have to be mindful of what the Street is saying. You have to be mindful of what you're going up against. And I -- and I think that that's important. And one of the things we do is we do talk to the Street. We have them into our offices. If we have an unusual thesis or hypothesis on a company, we'll have the sell side in and to lay it out...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: They're pitching you the other side of the equation?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, well, we know what they're pitching. I mean you know, it's not -- and one of the good asymmetries of the short side -- and there aren't that many of them, one of the good ones is is that if you're fundamentally a short seller, you have no problem finding out what the bull case is.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It's easy to find out.</p><p/><p>But if you long that stock, you might have to really kind of dig to find out what the real bear case is on it.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And -- and a -- and so it's another one of these influential asymmetries that I think works for the fundamental short seller. There are a few others. We don't have to disclose our positions. I think that's a very important one, actually.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You know, there was a -- a movement afoot not too long ago to force short sellers to disclose their positions.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And -- and the Europeans have it in terms of -- of certain thresholds, for example.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Now the...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: But you're never short 10 percent of the outstanding stock?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: No, although we've -- we've...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE) company...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- we've crossed the European thresholds a few times, because the thresholds are very...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: But that's a fairly low.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- they're very -- they're very low.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Two percent, 3 percent, something like that?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Oh, I think it's a -- no, it's .5 percent or (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it that low?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. It's...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: I had no idea.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- it's really low.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's a...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- on some of them yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It's quite low on some of them. Well, the reason is is that, first of all, the IRS doesn't look at short positions as positions. It looks at -- it looks at it as in a commercial transaction, where you're borrowing money, interestingly enough.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: It -- it's a margin trade, it's a loan (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, because you don't own anything. You don't -- you -- you have a promise to -- to -- to pay something back.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: To repay...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Shares.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And so it's considered...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- instituted indebtedness. Yes. And so -- and which is why the short sellers have no -- no standing at the bar, the securities bar. We don't own anything. And -- and...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- now I would argue even further, I'm a little surprised that my brethren in the hedge fund world have not actually challenged the 13 F, G and H regime. I...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Sections of the SEC code?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Code -- mandating disclosure over $100 million of your long positions.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Because, I mean I understand why the 13D need for change in corporate control. I think any reasonable person...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- would understand that.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But why is it that -- that all these great investors, every 90 days, should give the public a free look at what they're doing?</p><p/><p>They're pay -- their clients pay for that. And if you don't trade a lot, say you're a value investor, um, well, if you don't trade a lot, that portfolio doesn't trade a lot. And there are people out there basically with services now to replicate your portfolio for nothing, or very little, that you have people paying good money for.</p><p/><p>And I've always said, you know, Coca-Cola doesn't have to put its, you know, formula on -- on -- on the Web and Microsoft doesn't have to issue its source code, why should managers, either hedge fund or otherwise, have to tell the public what -- what -- what's the public's interests?</p><p/><p>I understand the SEC and law enforcement should have every right to see it at any time.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: In other words, 13D filings go to the SEC and it stops there, they don't get put on the Web?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, 13D filings, I think, change in corporate control, that's fine. I mean people publicly should know that.</p><p/><p>But why is it that a passive money manager should tell the public...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Six percent of -- more than 5 percent position, why...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- why disclose that?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: You know, their -- all their positions, all of their positions.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: OK, so let's clarify that. I'm under the impression they do a filing at 5 percent?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, a 13D.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: OK. So let's say they have a 2 percent position.</p><p/><p>They have to disclose that?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: What happens if they're offshore?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Of -- if you're a U.S. money manager, you've got to disclose your positions of $100 million.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Huh, that's interesting.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, so -- so -- so...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it a fund above $100 million or a fund...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: A position...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- a position above $100 million?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: A fund $100 -- of $100 million.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. Again, I don't understand why the money management industry hasn't gone and said this is, in effect, a, you know, possibly a takings clause in \"The Constitution.\"</p><p/><p>Why is it that the public gets to see what I'm doing?</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You're -- you're...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- forcing me to turn over my intellectual property with no compensation.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And if you don't short a lot of stocks, then if you're just a long lonely manager, you're giving away your entire business plan every 90 days.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's really interesting. And I hadn't thought of that in a...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in that context.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So the accusation is that Wall Street owns Congress and they can get DC to do whatever they want. And it's not all that far from the truth.</p><p/><p>Why is this so difficult to change?</p><p/><p>You would think, hey, any major change in ownership, anything over -- pick a percent. It doesn't even have to be 5 percent. If you owe more than 3 percent, you need to at least disclose it when you cross that line.</p><p/><p>Um, but after that, why does it have to be completely...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I'm a little...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- disclosed?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- you know, well, first of all, hedge funds don't have the clout that -- that -- when -- when you say Wall Street does...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- we're talking about major -- major banks and -- and investment banks. They're the ones with the clout. Hedge funds don't -- still don't have that much clout in Washington.</p><p/><p>So I think that's number one.</p><p/><p>But, again -- and -- and mutual funds, of course, like it because it actually helps their marketing.</p><p/><p>You know, here's our portfolio.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I just -- but I -- I've always wondered at why a -- why hedge funds have just sort of rolled over on this and said well, you know, well, I guess, you know, we've got to do it. And you do have to do it. But...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, I'll tell you what the answer is. The answer is merely knowing what Jim Chanos' long or short isn't the same as having Jim Chanos manage that position for you. And the same is true for any hedge fund that's out there. If it was the case, everybody would be generating alpha by imitating the Dalio's, Tepper's, obviously Renaissance Technology doesn't hold onto anything long enough for a filing to go through.</p><p/><p>But still, if it was that easy just to say let me see what Chanos owns, great, I'll own that...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, one would argue that that's actually why the alphas may have dropped and a -- and so, I'm not so sure. It will...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Because everybody was...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- clearly for trading...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) to it.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- clearly for trading shops, it -- it's superfluous. And for shops that do a lot of fundamental shorting, it's -- it's meaningless, because, for example, you use...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You want that out there anyway?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: When you see my longs, I file them in my Opportunity Fund, which is our long short. And if you look at my longs, you'll scratch your head and go why is Chanos long in that thing, that looks crazy?</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And not understanding there's two shorts against it that are even crazier.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right, and that happens to be the best system -- systematic hedge for that position.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Um, so it can be -- it can be very misleading to people. And that's the other reason then, why do it?</p><p/><p>If it's misleading because you're both long and short, you're not doing anybody a service.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: If it's not misleading because the guy is just simply a long only person, why does the public have the right to that information for free?</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Those are the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CHANOS: There's a lot of arguments against this that -- and -- and the argument for it typically is well, it's for more -- don't we want more transparency?</p><p/><p>And I would argue, no, not necessarily. Um, but I particularly if -- if you're basing a business on -- on intellectual capital and you're charging people for that, I don't see what the public interest is in putting out possibly misleading information.</p><p/><p>One of the problems, when you have the limits where people have to disclose where they go through limits and up and down, you actually -- people can game that...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- knowing themselves they've gone through the limits.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And so I've explained that to the European regulators, that - - that these short threshold limits themselves can be disruptive just because they exist.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's veer into a dangerous territory. Let's talk a little bit about politics, Washington, DC, the regulatory environment.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You're known as a guy who's a pretty active, uh, participant in politics. You've made the comment that you've been -- I'm paraphrasing -- you've been fortunate enough in your career to have accumulated a sum of money and you feel obligated to respond, to give back, to participate in democracy.</p><p/><p>What -- what attracted you to that given how dysfunctional DC has been?</p><p/><p>Is it something you're still interested in?</p><p/><p>Talk a little bit about that.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean I'm certainly not interested in politics personally. I -- I'm interested in the process. I always have been. I -- and first of all, let me say, I think the system is broken. I think the whole system of campaign finance is broken. And I would love a law that says I can't write any checks.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Well, the...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- Supreme Court has basically...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Has gone towy.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you could write, Jim Chanos...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It's free speech.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- who wants more than a couple of bucks, write...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- write all the money you want (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. I think -- and I think that that -- that while that may be a constitutional freedom, it's one we ought to reexamine, because it raises agency risks and lots of issues of inequality. But -- but we're not here to discuss that.</p><p/><p>The problem is is that if that's -- if that's the legality of the game and -- and you feel strongly about -- about things politically, um, and you want to support them, fine. Uh, you know, I -- we pick our spots.</p><p/><p>On the other hand, um, I think that -- that a -- that the country, you know, actually needs people to be involved in politics.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And I think that -- that it's not about access or influence, it's about, in our case, because we never asked for anything...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, stop a second. When you say you never ask for something, you want to influence the process a little bit, then you -- you derailed the question I was about to ask you, because you said you never ask for something, which was what would you like to see changed?</p><p/><p>What area...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- of policy...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, for example...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- could you move on the needle on?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- well, for example, I -- I've publicly said I -- I think that carried interest should be raised. The tax on carried interest should be raised.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So this -- this is the advantage that private equity and hedge fund managers have...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: On long-term cap -- gain allocations and performance fees being treated as long-term capital gains.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So they're -- they're taxed at -- it used to be 15 percent, now it's 23...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, whatever.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- or so.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: But it sure as hell ain't for -- the joke that Warren Buffett says as he pays a lower tax rate...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- than his secretary.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. And I -- and I think a lot of these -- so -- so I would, you know, you would argue...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So why hasn't that been changed?</p><p/><p>You would think that's the -- the most egregious stroke of the pen thing to change?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, you'll have to ask the people that don't want to change it. I don't know. The -- the -- there are a lot of issues that are out there like that that I think you would be kind of surprised as a Wall Streeter that I support, but I -- that are counterintuitive.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Give me -- give me another one. Let's -- let's...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You're -- you're one of these -- I can just hear Bill O'Reilly saying...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you're one of these limbers -- limer -- limousine liberals who really feels guilty about having money.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: You know, I don't feel guilty at all about having money. I - - trust me.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I -- I feel blessed and -- and I know I'm fortunate. And -- and not at all. And the -- but I do think the level of discourse in this country needs to be reopened. And I think we -- we've -- we've put both parties in this -- this sort of truly bipolar area there where no one wants to meet in the middle anymore.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: A lot due to campaign finance reasons and -- and the primaries.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's the underlying problem that, you know, the old joke is that Reagan and Tip O'Neill would argue all day, they'd go out at night, have a beer and the next morning there would be legislation signed. That sort of cross-pollination...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, look, apparently that story was a bit apocryphal. Apparent, there wasn't -- it wasn't that simple with those two.</p><p/><p>But -- but I know what you mean...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: But they did get -- they did get...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I know what you mean.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they did get -- meet in the middle.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. Well, what...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: They did get things accomplished.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- well, what's changed is the Senate, really, if you know Washington, in that -- that the House has always been pretty -- a pretty bipartisan place and -- and it's always been pretty raucous in terms of hardened attitudes and -- and -- and...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, that's -- do you mean a partisan there's that...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It's much more partisan.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- the Senasin -- the Senate is bipartisan and the House was partisan.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, the Senate -- the Senate, until about 20 or 30 years ago, was a place in which people crossed party lines all the time and voted their conscience and voted the way they really felt on the issues and weren't penalized for it.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And -- and -- and so senators really were that -- that upper house that said, OK, we -- we're a little bit older, a little bit more experienced, we're -- we -- we -- more confident of our reelection or our tenure and if -- if I want to vote on civil rights even though I'm -- I'm a hard -- I'm in the Republican Party, I -- I do. And that happened.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But now the Senate is just as fractious as the House. And -- and senators worry about reelection or getting very liberal or very conservative challengers. Again, part of it's the campaign finance issue, part of it's the -- the redistricting of -- for the representatives.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Gerrymandering, as well.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And so -- so the -- the whole idea that there was an upper house that was sort of, you know...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: The adult supervision.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: The adults, yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: The adults that were getting policy done is -- is changed, as well. And so it's added to the acrimony. It's added to the gridlock. And -- and I think it's just added -- it's -- it's not put us in a good place. And I think that that's -- and I've supported Republican candidates that I think are moderates, as well, so...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. How -- how do we fix this?</p><p/><p>How do we repair...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I think you...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- campaign finance?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- I think you have to start, you know, with some sort of reform. And I think, you know, unfortunately, a family member who is -- who has been in politics also pointed this out correctly, you also have to do something about term limits, because other -- if you do have campaign finance limits, term limit -- anybody with an incumbency becomes more important.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And so you have a do I -- you have an advantage being an incumbent...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Ninety-nine percent or 98 percent reelection rate...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. So...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in the House.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- so I mean we -- that -- that -- it's -- it's a tricky issue. But just throwing more and more unlimited amounts of money, I think, doesn't help the issue. It makes -- I think it makes it worse.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And what do you do -- so, in other words, you have a system that's broken, nobody from either party is going to -- willing to work with the other party...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But nobody can turn the money down (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And at the same time the Supreme Court...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It's an arms race.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- is -- has -- has basically lit that fuse and said go for it then...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And it's an arms race. So therefore, I mean you can't -- if you don't spend, you're not going to have an equal chance -- seat at the table.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And so it's just...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You have no choice, you have to.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- it's just this vicious cycle. And...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So how do you break that?</p><p/><p>How do you...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, as I say, I'd leave it up to the politicians and the legal scholars, but at some point, you're going to need a piece of legislation or a constitutional amendment or something that -- that's going to have to change this system. And I -- I don't know -- I don't know any other way around it. If you have a Supreme Court that keeps saying this is an a -- the legislation is unconstitutional, then you're going to have to change the \"Constitution.\"</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And -- and that's a challenge. That's quite a challenge...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It's a big challenge.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- to get that done. It probably has to get a lot worse before it gets better.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: You know, that's a scary thought.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Let -- let me tack policy to one other place, because we spent this whole afternoon chatting and China has never come up.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Exactly. Where's that?</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And you, very famously, um, identified, I want to say four years ago, is that -- is that right?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, it was the end of '09, early 2010.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Basically said China is a -- a big house of cards, building these ghost cities, they're spending all this policy money, they're not that good at it. Their economy has been so robust that it's covered up a lot of these credit errors.</p><p/><p>What do you think is going on with China today?</p><p/><p>By the way, China's stock market today at a four or a six week high, but it's shellacked over that period.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: It's down 40 percent. China, while the rest of the world has rallied substantially, has gone the exact opposite way.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Almost cut in half.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, people have always ask -- still ask us, well, what do you think, you know, when are you going to be right?</p><p/><p>You've been early. And I keep saying if you look at the Chinese market...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: It's got -- China has gotten crushed over the past few years.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It's the -- it was the best place to be short in the last four years.</p><p/><p>Um, look, everything that we saw in China, at -- at the end of '09 and 2010 is basically now twice as bad. That's kind of the way I put it.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: It hasn't gotten better.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It -- it's gotten worse. The -- the debt to GDP has gone from over 100 percent of GDP to over 200 percent. Back in -- in '09, there was 5.6 billion square meters of high rises under development and (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: 5.6 billion?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- 6 billion square meters. That's 60...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- billion square feet.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Now, the number is twice that. It's 10.6 billion square -- square meters under development at the end of 2013.</p><p/><p>So everything that we saw then that was bad, and I think it -- it was bad, is, in effect, twice as bad now.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Don't they have...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: When we...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hundreds of millions of people to move off the farm?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, the problem is, is the hundreds of millions of people can't afford the stuff that they're -- that's being built. They're building high end condos, uh, shopping malls, high speed rail. It's only the -- the top 5 percent of people in China that can afford that.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And that's the -- that's the -- the sort of paradox here. I'll give you just an idea of -- of what's changed in four years. When we started looking at China, the Chinese GDP in dollar terms was about $7 trillion US. And the total...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Not too shabby.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Not -- and the to -- total amount of bank -- assets in the banking system in China was $9 trillion.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: So it was a little bit over 100 percent.</p><p/><p>Now, the GDP is about $9 trillion and the total assets in the Chinese banking system are about $24 trillion.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, a meaningful difference.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's a...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: So they've had to employ...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that's a lot of...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- they've had to employ more and more debt to get the growth.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: I was going to say, this isn't capital, this is...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: This is the...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- credit.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- total assets, total assets. It's just basically a proxy for -- for credit outstanding. And so increasingly, they've had to employ more and more debt to -- to drive their growth. And -- and -- and that's because the model is based on 50 percent investment to GDP.</p><p/><p>So if you think about that, that means that -- that if they -- if it takes them two years to finish a project, that means that one quarter of your GDP every year rolls off and has to be replaced with a -- digging a new hole in the ground somewhere.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Well -- well, that's while they were at 12 percent GDP growth four years ago and -- and the most recent data is closer to 6.5, 7 percent.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Seven, yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: It is, because it -- and -- and so the soft...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And by the way, we would kill for 7 percent GDP.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, well, the 7 percent is a little misleading, too, though, because, again, 7 percent, the consumer is still declining per GDP. So the 7 percent is only really coming from -- from the fact that they're still building stuff. And -- and now, it's beyond a shadow of a doubt, even -- even Chinese officials or died in the wool bulls will tell you, they've got to change that, they've got to reform this. And they've got to get away from this investment-driven model.</p><p/><p>The question is, how?</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: How and what do they replace it with?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You know, the -- the key -- the fascinating thing about China, or let me flip that around, the interesting thing about U.S. manufacturing, we started seeing signs of this about five years ago, be fracking blew up, before natural gas was everywhere. But natural gas prices had dropped and we were hearing about companies relocating in the U.S., setting up a natural gas electrical generator. One of the big complaints you hear about China is a lack of consistent electrical availability.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Not only 24-7, but a consistent amperage and wattage...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, peak -- peak usage.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and it fluctuates and...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you have to set up a series of electronics just to get a steady whatever it is, 120 and 60. So in the U.S., you run a natural gas pipeline near a factory, you set up an electrical code generation plant, you're effectively getting unlimited, very low cost energy and you don't have to take three weeks to ship your product to the States.</p><p/><p>And that's...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- started as a -- as labor prices started to go up...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And Chinese wages have gone up, too.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- what happens when wages go from $1 a day to -- to $25 a day?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, that's -- that's what's happened. In fact, net -- net exports in China, when I first started looking at China, net exports were 12 percent of GDP, exports minus imports. Now, it's almost down to 0. Now, it's a couple percent.</p><p/><p>And so -- so the impact that China, as an exporting engine, is already diminished on their GDP.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's amazing.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And they've offset it now -- they've offset it with more and more investment. So the story in China is not export anymore, the story in China is this giant building project, the property building.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Can -- can you grow a middle class in a -- a country that size and use that the way the U.S. post-World War II -- you know, we had a 50 year run after World War II, where the middle class boomed like never before. And it was a period of tremendous economic growth.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right. But we...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Can China do that?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, we were already past the middle income trap at that point, though. We -- we passed that in the -- the late 19th, early 20th century.</p><p/><p>I mean China is still facing that. And -- and how do you get people from the sort of $5,000 to $7,000 per capita...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- income level to -- to $30,000 or plus?</p><p/><p>And -- and that's always the tricky point in -- in economic development is -- is the, you know, basically, there's four phases of economic development, Barry. You've got, basically, you educate the population from illiteracy to secondary school education.</p><p/><p>Second, you move people from rural areas to urban.</p><p/><p>Third, you employ capital where it never -- capital has never been employed. That's where we are in China right now.</p><p/><p>And the fourth and the way that South Korea and Japan and post-war Germany, post-war is you finally begin to innovate and make products that the rest of the world wants and be more productive.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And that's the tricky part. And that's where most countries can't surmount. They get to the third point, but they can't get to the fourth point, where they become truly innovative and -- and -- and it -- the Asian tigers all fell by the wayside, for example, in the mid-'90s...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- with the exception of South Korea and -- and Singapore. The rest all -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, basically...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Vietnam...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- stalled out.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Um, that's where we are with China right now.</p><p/><p>The three countries post-World War II were Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union. They all were pretty much destroyed by the war.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh-huh.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: They had to rebuild. They had to start from scratch. You know, they already had educated workforces. They already had urban centers.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But they had to basically put capital to work again, which they did. And Germany, in the '60s and Japan in the '70s began to innovate and produce world-class products that everybody wanted.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: For sure.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: The Soviet Union didn't.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: And China, the question is, will China ever be able to do - - be more than just a -- a high end...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: A manufacturing base.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that's it.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And -- and the -- and/or employ capital in a non-impressive way to build empty buildings and condos and things like that. And that's what they're doing.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So the quote you had about China, I'll -- I'm curious if you still think this is true. \"The Chinese banking system is built on quicksand.\"</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes. It's...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it still true?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- I just think it's -- it's more true than ever, um, in -- in that there's just -- the bad loans are there. There's legacy bad loans they didn't address from even 10 years ago. Um, they are telling you with a straight face that non-performing loans are, you know, less than 1 percent. Um, and -- and yet, you just see the madness of some of these projects and the fact that defaults are starting now left, right and center and they'll look at you with a straight face and say, oh, no, no, our non- performing loans are not a problem.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So I can sit here and continue speaking to you for a couple more hours.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: But I know your assistant will kill me if I keep you here past 4:00. So I -- I just wanted to end on one last question. And before I forget, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. I know people are going to find this a fascinating conversation.</p><p/><p>The -- the last question I want to ask you is really general and open- ended. Um, the industry of Wall Street, finance, investment banking, investing has changed dramatically over the past 30 years and especially over the past five years.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: What do you see happening in this industry going forward?</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, I -- I kind of would like to think we're seeing our limits on it, because -- and it's always -- it's always a little bit hypocritical to talk -- talk, you know, negatively about what you do for a living, but I think that -- that the nature of finance, in and of itself, as a profit center or a big part of the economy is sort of self-defeating.</p><p/><p>And -- and I think that we've gotten kind of to the limits, I suspect, of where finance can go to push the U.S. economy. I mean I think it hit its peak in '06-'07, uh, in terms of finance as a percent of corporate profits and...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: The argument is -- that I've made is the bailouts prevented that process of...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: You know, clearing...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- converting back to...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- of clearing.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- the market clearing.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes, and I would agree with you on that. And I read, you know, I remember at the time you were writing that and you were right. And I agree with it. And I think that -- that unfortunately, finance becoming a big part of the economy in terms of taking deposits, making loans, all of that stuff, puts it in this too big to fail category broadly speaking, where -- where ironically enough, it cannot be subject to the -- the -- the whims of capitalism itself, creative destruction, because it would just be systemic.</p><p/><p>And so we -- we build this monstrous Rube Goldberg like contraption that is completely ludicrous and then say we can't let it fall apart...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- because it will impact everything else.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- so too big to fail, too much leverage, too little capital...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and yet not subject to the laws of capital.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Well, let's leave it at this. If we look at those -- those dark days of '08 and '09, the one industry that actually went through bankruptcy was the auto industry. And I always chide my friends in White - - at the White House and -- who say, oh, well, the auto bailout was smart.</p><p/><p>And I keep saying, you know, no, it wasn't an auto bailout. I was short the -- the auto stocks. Shareholders were wiped out...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- the boards were -- were dismissed. The executives were fired. They brought in new teams, they recapitalized the companies, the government put in debtor in possession financing...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- which was post-bankruptcy. Now, we can argue about the unions' role in that, that employees were given seniority. But in many bankruptcies, in...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's typical.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- employees are...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: That's not atypical.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- given preference.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And -- and, in fact, we did exactly what capitalism should have said we did, we recapped the industry and we made it more viable going forward.</p><p/><p>The people who took risks in the past, you know, paid the price.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. That's exactly right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But it worked. It actually worked better, I think, than what we've had in finance coming out of this, which was...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, we had -- we had a Treasury secretary that was from finance. And so industry gets bankruptcy, finance gets bailouts. If it was reversed, if you had the head of a railroad or a head of a manufacturing plant, I can't guarantee you that GM and Chrysler would have been put through bankruptcy, but I can guarantee you that Citi and Bank of America and Merrill and Morgan would have been treated the way financiers treated manufacturers.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: But then we might not have had this beautiful new Bloomberg headquarters.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh, I think this predates it. This was up long before that.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: I know it was. I'm just kidding.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so listen, you know, the counter-argument, and this - - this is me talking literally in my book, the counter-argument is if you take -- my example is Bank America...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- Merrill Lynch, Countrywide, that giant...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- horrific blasphemy of a company...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- if you would have put them into bankruptcy, you spin out Merrill as a free-standing, clean balance sheet investment firm.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you spin out Bank America as a clean balance...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- money center bank. You spin out Countrywide as a mortgage underwriter.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You take all the bad paper -- I -- I'm fond of saying no such thing as toxic assets, only toxic prices.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: You sell all that crap that's dragging down their balance sheet all these years...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- at 15, 20 cents on the dollar...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- someone's a buyer of that...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Of course.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you also end up clearing all those home prices instead of having private equity come in and try and flip them, these home prices plummet and first time home buyers are buying houses at a reasonable price.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: If you had wiped out the equity of these institutions, what, you know, to the -- 80 percent...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- subordinated that.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Sixty percent on the mezzanine debt, 50 percent on other debt and the depositors were whole...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- I think not only would that have helped the whole process, it would have -- it would have meant that people learned the lessons going forward.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: The -- the moral hazard gets avoided and we, in our economic recovery in 2014 would be...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Correct.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: -- years ahead of where we are (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And the depositors understood that they -- the ones taking no risk were protected by the government...</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: -- as they should be. But the more risk you took, the more at risk you were at, I undoubtedly think the system would be far healthier today than it is.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: It's -- it's called risk for a reason.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: And I've got it.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: Jim, thank you so much for your time.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: Barry, thank you.</p><p/><p>RITHOLTZ: This has been absolutely fascinating.</p><p/><p>You've been listening to Master of Finance series.</p><p/><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p/><p>This is Bloomberg Radio and we've been speaking to Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates.</p><p/><p>Thanks so much for coming in, Jim.</p><p/><p>CHANOS: My pleasure.</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: You're listening to Masters In Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p/><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p/><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

This is Barry Ritholtz and this week I am thrilled to have sat down  with Jim Chanos, hedge fund manager at Kynikos Associates for a very  interesting and in-depth conversation; after we were done recording the  radio portion, Jim sat around and we kept the tape running.  And there's a  ton of podcast extras.  So after the show is done, be sure and listen to  the rest of it.   I think it's about 14 hours.  And it's really -- anytime  you get the chance to sit at the knee of somebody like Jim Chanos and ask  questions and see where they go, you don't want to stop the tape running.   He spoke for a long time and it was absolutely fascinating.</p><p>I don't know how many of you who are listening to this know Jim Chanos  or are familiar with his work.  But really it's a fascinating legacy.  This  is a guy who was an early short seller, who was an early critic of some of  the worst excesses of Wall Street, whether it was misbehavior of analysts  or accounting fraud or things that companies were doing, that were  defrauding and misleading investors.</p><p>Jim has the combination of a accountant's ability to dive into the  numbers and detective's ability to sniff out nonsense.  And he has done it  throughout his whole career.  He's identified a number of tremendous frauds  and scams, whether it was Baldwin Piano, which ran an insurance scam on the  side, EnronWorldCom, go down the whole list.  He has really been crucial  to investors in ferreting out fraud and using his skill set to make money  for his investors by basically identifying short selling opportunities  where there's some bad behavior, fraud, whatever it is.</p><p>So this is a wide-ranging and fascinating conversation that I was  thrilled to have.  Be sure and check out the podcast extras afterwards.   And on with the show.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS with Barry Ritholtz on  Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Today I am thrilled to bring you someone who you may not  know who he is, but you actually should.  His name is Jim Chanos.  He is  the manager of -- let me see if I'm pronouncing this correctly -- Kynikos  Associates.  That's Greek for \"cynic.\"  And Jim has built a reputation over  30 years as a spotter of wrongdoing and fraud, a short seller, somebody  who's identified a lot of problems with various companies in the market.</p><p>Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p>JAMES CHANOS, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, KYNIKOS ASSOCIATES:  Thanks,  Barry.  Glad to be here.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So I've wanted to have you on for a long time because most  of the people we speak to are long-term, mostly long only investors, who  are looking at here's what you need to do to save money for retirement, or  if you're a pension fund or an endowment, here's what you do -- need to do  to make sure you stay ahead of inflation.</p><p>But your approach as a short seller is completely different.</p><p>Why don't you describe that so people have an idea of what you  actually do in Kynikos Associates?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean, one way to describe it, Barry, is that we are a  long-term potential purchasers of equities.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I like that.</p><p>CHANOS:  The whole idea of fundamental short selling really is select  a portfolio of securities, mostly stocks, that are fundamentally overvalued  no matter what the market does. that these are companies that, through the  normal ebbs and flows of capitalism, are on the downside of their cycle.</p><p>And our clients, primarily, are institutions who use us as a hedge to  their core equity portfolio.  And so therefore it allows them to be a  little bit more aggressive in their equity exposures, knowing that they  have part of the portfolio in a small group of companies that will go down  over time -- we hope and we think --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You expect.  So the people who are listening to this, who  are in the industry, certainly know who you are.  But regular investors,  radio listeners may not know who you are.</p><p>So let me discuss your curriculum vitae for a second.  You first came  into the public eye as an analyst at -- was it Gilford (ph) Securities way  back when?</p><p>And you had identified one of Wall Street's favorite stocks, which at  the time was an insurance company called Baldwin and you had essentially  figured out that it was a sham.  It was a giant insurance scam that was  cooking their books -- this is a theme we'll come to again and again -- and  people mocked the call, \"The Wall Street Journal\" had a pretty aggressive  articulate that pretty much trashed your analysis and ultimately you had  the last laugh, because it's almost quaint to say at the time, when Baldwin  went bankrupt, at $9 billion, it was the largest bankruptcy in history,  although we know, oh, $9 billion, that's adorable compared to what we've  seen since then.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, back then it wasn't so adorable.</p><p>Well, Baldwin was -- Baldwin United was the old Baldwin Piano Company,  which had morphed under very charismatic CEO into an aggressive seller of  insurance products, particularly annuities, through Wall Street.</p><p>And therefore it became a Wall Street darling in the early '80s on the  back of not only the rapid earnings growth, but also because Wall Street  was being paid by Baldwin.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Five percent commission on a policy --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- that buys a lot of goodwill on the street --</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, it does.  And particularly when you're offering yields  on these insurance products that were as high as 14 percent.  The problem  was Baldwin wasn't earning anything close to that in its insurance  portfolios.  So they ultimately had to begin doing acquisitions and getting  insurance department approval to fund those acquisitions with insurance  company money, which is highly, highly unusual.</p><p>And that was the beginning of the end for them.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So you were a kid then.</p><p>How old were you when you made that call?</p><p>CHANOS:  I wrote -- my sense of timing was impeccable.  I put out my  first solo recommendation on the company on the absolute bottom of the  market, the day that Henry Kaufman (ph) said buys stocks in August of 1982.   I think it was August 17th of 1982.</p><p>I said sell the -- or sell this thing short.  And --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  About 25 bucks, is that about right?</p><p>CHANOS:  I think it was about $25.  It went briefly to $20 and then  straight to $55.  </p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Doubled.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, it was a good -- it was a good initiation into  fundamental short selling.  But the interesting thing about that story was  we -- first report when we did a follow-up report was that a lot of the  radioactive aspect of Baldwin was hiding in plain sight.  It was -- it was  -- you could see it if you looked at the publicly available documents the  SEC filings and their insurance company statements, which were public.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So here's the question you're going to hear me ask you  repeatedly this afternoon.</p><p>How is it that this was in plain view, a $9 billion fraud, and nobody  else could spot it?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, first of all, it wasn't in a lot of people's interest  to spot it because the analysts who were covering the company most closely  and had buy ratings on this thing were also working for the firms that sold  the annuities.  So it was also a good introduction to the whole concept of  conflict of interest.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  To say the least.</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.</p><p>And number two, you had to do a little bit of digging.  And I think in  many ways, not being insurance analysts, just being a young analyst who was  learning about insurance, I just simply kept asking questions of things  that didn't seem to make sense to me.  And most of the answers had -- were  logical but every once in a while, it would come back with something that  was just simply nonsensical.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That sounds very familiar.  That reminds me a little bit of  what took place so in the future with Enron.</p><p>So this was '82.  Most people probably this never entered their radar.</p><p>But Enron, on the other hand, entered a lot of people's radar and in  fact that's probably how anyone who's a member of the public or the  investing community who knows you probably found you through Enron, which  is a remarkably similar story.</p><p>CHANOS:  It was.  And in what would seem even more interesting about  it was that not only were the facts at Enron hiding in plain sight --  there's been a lot written about that -- but Enron, using their mark-to- model accounting, where they pulled forward future profit estimates,  Baldwin was doing the same exact thing with its annuities.  They were  estimating a spread of income -- which they weren't earning, of course --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Which may or may not have existed, depending on future --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and then they -- and then they estimate how long the  policies would stay on the books and they took the present value and they  sold the policy.  And so --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right, not accounting for the fact that interest rates  fluctuate and other factors --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- they were writing this down as if it was money good.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right, exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Coming up, we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos,  manager of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  You're  listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  I'm Barry  Ritholtz.  And today I'm speaking to famed short seller Jim Chanos.</p><p>We were talking a little bit about how Enron was so similar to  Baldwin.  And you had mentioned, you read the 10(k), you read the annual  report, you read the quarterly report three times.  You still have no idea  what they hell they do.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.  The other -- the other interesting similarity was  they both had charismatic leaders, who were very bright; Baldwin had a guy  by the name of Morley Thompson (ph) and -- who went from literally peddling  pianos door-to-door.  (INAUDIBLE) good salesmen to sell pianos door-to- door.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  And strong (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>CHANOS:  And morphing into financial services and of course Enron had  Jeff Skilling (ph) and to a lesser extent Ken Lay.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  And so when we first started looking at Enron,  Enron decided to make a market in everything from energy trading to you  name it, they were going to take everything, turn it into a tradable  commodity, whether or not it should be is a whole different discussion.</p><p>What was the first warning sign that you saw with Enron?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, it's actually -- it was a column written by John Wilde  (ph).  He wrote a piece in the Texas \"Wall Street Journal\" in the fall of  2000, where he pointed out that energy merchant banks had just gotten a  favorable ruling from the SEC on this mark-to-model accounting.  So much  for the Baldwin type stuff.</p><p>And a friend of mine running a hedge fund in Dallas, Texas, called it  to my attention.  And of course email was rudimentary; he faxed it to me.   And I read the piece and immediately --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  '97, '98 --</p><p>CHANOS:  -- this was in 2000 --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- far along.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and immediate cracked the 1999 10(k) and March and June  10(q)s of Enron and immediately began to see all kinds of odd things.  In  addition we noticed right away that not only was there a lot of insider  selling throughout 2000 in Enron stock, but there were a number of key  high-level executive departures.  And that's -- those two -- those two in  conjunction, often there will be insider selling to start.</p><p>But when you see insider selling across the executive suite as well as  executive departures, there's usually something wrong.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Yes.  That's quite fascinating.  And so you start digging  in and what's the - -you begin working with Bethany McLean, then of --  still of \"Fortune.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- ultimately end up writing the book, \"Smartest Guys in  the Room,\" and what were the next couple of things that you uncovered in  digging into Enron?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, the -- I had to -- two -- my partner at the time, Doug  Millett (ph) and an analyst who's now my current partner, Chuck Hobbs (ph),  we -- the three of us dug into the financials.  And one of the first things  Doug pointed out was this is nothing more than a leveraged hedge fund  sitting on top of a pipeline, which I think was the -- still the best apt  description of Enron.</p><p>But as we dug into the numbers, there were a few odd things right  away.  We noticed that even with their sort of odd accounting, the company  was only earning 6 percent pretax on its capital.  And --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  In a period when everybody's just making --</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.  And in which people are -- were paying five times  book for this -- the stock.  So --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  For a 6 percent ROI on --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- five times NAV for a hedge fund that was earning 6  percent?  No, you wouldn't.</p><p>So that was the first thing.</p><p>Number two, I noticed immediately they weren't matching their -- in  that -- there's an accounting principle called matching similar gains and  losses.  And they had a merchant banking arm that did things like sell  energy barges or construct utility plants.</p><p>And when they had a gain, they would put it through the merchant  banking operating income line.  But it appeared to me that when they looked  like they were going to lose money on something, they held it as a  discontinued asset, held for sale for a year, and then put it below the  operating income line so people disregarded it as an extraordinary event.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So they buried what should have been an ordinary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- should have matched everything as net, net profit.   Instead they basically showed their winners and tried you to disregard the  losers.  That was another flag.</p><p>The third one is -- were these odd footnotes that said there was a  group of entities set up by an executive of Enron to trade with Enron or an  executive -- senior executive of the company was the general partner of the  entities.  And, I mean, that was an immediate red flag to, well, what were  these entities and why is a --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, how can you be a counterparty with himself?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- this person conflicted.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And we now know those were the famous raptors and LJMs and  these off-balance sheet entities --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right, side pockets and -- I believe it was McKenzie (ph)  who came up with some of the concepts for that, if not those exact ones,  but that philosophical structure came from --</p><p>CHANOS:  -- came from --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- from McKenzie, that's right.</p><p>So quite fascinating.</p><p>And now let's fast forward.  So ultimately Enron collapses after  having a huge run-up.  it takes a year to fall from about 89 bucks, 83  bucks, if memory serves, down to zero.  It was -- it was glacial; if you're  short, you must be champing at the bit.  That's something I want to talk to  you about a little later.</p><p>The mindset of how do you stay short a position fundamentally when  it's running up against you and even when it starts -- I remember Lehman  Brothers, when we were short, Lehman, when we watched it collapse, every  time it fell and looked like it was about to just freefall, there would be  this squeeze.  There would be this move back up.</p><p>In '07, '08, you were short most of that whole area.  We're talking  about investment banks, builders, commercial banks.  What else were you  short in the credit sector before the collapse?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, we have a rule that we don't -- we don't short anybody  we do business with.  And since we did agency business most of the brokers,  we were not short Lehman or Bear.  We actually were prime broker, a client  of Bear.  But there certainly -- in the credit area, there was a lot of --  a lot of things to do.</p><p>I mean, the Florida homebuilders, West Coast homebuilders, building  supply companies, the credit rating agencies, a number of banks that were  pretty aggressive --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Bond insurance companies?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- bond insurance companies, yes, yes.  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And (INAUDIBLE) around the same time.</p><p>CHANOS:  NBIA.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  NBIA was the other one.  They all freefell down to single  digits.</p><p>CHANOS:  And the -- you're exactly right.  I mean, typically, stocks  that are fundamentally flawed, where the equity is worthless, you will have  a number of vicious rallies, often 50-60 percent.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Unbelievable.  And you look at that and you say, who the  hell is buying this junk?  This is a stock cut in half that should be going  to zero and yet you end up with the floor underneath these freefalling  stocks and those squeezes are incredibly painful to live through, if --  especially if you're counting your money before you close that position.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, we never do that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's always a bad thing to do.</p><p>CHANOS:  But I would point out that one of the ways that you alleviate  that a little bit is that people tend to think about the short side very  discretely.  And often because a lot of money managers who actually do  short stocks may only be short a handful of stocks versus quite a few  longs.</p><p>And in our -- in our case, it's a whole portfolio.  I mean, in the  U.S., typically historically over 30 years, we've averaged about 50 names  in the portfolio at any given time.</p><p>So no one position is an unusually large amount --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  3-4-5 percent, is that --</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, 5 percent would be the top.  But I mean, typically  average is 2 percent.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Coming up, we delve into the mind of the short seller as we  continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, chairman of the hedge fund  Kynikos Associates.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  You're listening to MASTERS IN  BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  I'm Barry  Ritholtz.  I am privileged to be speaking to a master of the short side,  Jim Chanos.</p><p>Earlier we were talking about the short in Baldwin and Enron, as well  as all the financials heading into '08.  I recall reading a fabulous  profile of you in \"New York\" magazine, the end of 2008, and I don't know if  they were talking about a specific fund or generally but they were saying  you were up 50 percent for the year in '08.  I know you may not be able to  comment on numbers.  We all work with compliance and lawyers and what have  you.</p><p>But '08 turned out to be a pretty good year for you.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, but the way we gauge ourself (sic), Barry, is actually  versus the market and, in fact, although we have partnerships and offshore  funds that you can invest in that are -- appear short and the numbers are  what they are, the bulk of our business is our managed account business,  where we're a large pension fund or endowment or sovereign wealth fund,  gives us assets to manage short.</p><p>And in those cases, we're benchmarked versus the market inversely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So if the market goes up 10 percent, your benchmark is -10  percent?</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.  And so to the extent -- for example, if the market  goes up 20 percent and we're flat for that account, you know, it's as if we  were up 20 percent.  And we're compensated in performance view on that.</p><p>Conversely, if the market goes down 40 percent and we're up 40  percent, we make no performance --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's flat.</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.  So it's a crude alpha measure.  And that's really  the way the firm has survived in a market that's up 2,000 percent, as you  point out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  Since 1985, since you launched the firm, and this  is the fascinating thing about running a short firm when, by the way, a lot  of your colleagues who are in that space haven't survived as long as you  have.</p><p>So since you launched in '85, the S&amp;P 500 is up over 2,000 percent and  yet you've managed to thrive as a short seller.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  We're up -- on a stand-alone basis, our flagship fund,  which goes back to '85 -- I think is up a couple percent compounded.  But  when you factor that into the fact that -- offset it on the long side and  rebalance monthly, the alpha is somewhere in the mid-teens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's fantastic. </p><p>CHANOS:  And that's actually what -- that's how we get paid and that's  how people evaluate us.  And so --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You exist to create a hedge to institutions, pension funds,  endowments, who, by definition, are, for the most part, long only.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, the -- another way to think of it is we're an insurance  policy that actually pays like premiums --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  As opposed to the not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- being upset when you --</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Exactly.  And so I think that's -- I've quipped that  Kynikos is, in effect, an insurance business.  And it's not -- it's not, I  think, an unreasonable analogy.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So let's talk.  We have a few minutes left in the segment.</p><p>Let's talk about what it's like to be upside down in a position that's  running against you.</p><p>Baldwin is a perfect example.  You put this out at 25, drops to 20.   You feel like a genius for five points.  Next thing you know, it more than  doubles, it almost triples from there.</p><p>How do you have the constitution -- like I know a lot of guys who can  compartmentalize.  I think I can compartmentalize.  But the vast majority  of investors, you know, the old joke is how did you sleep with the -- all  your positions going against you?  Like a baby.  I woke up every two hours,  cried for Mommy and wet myself.</p><p>A lot of people don't have that constitution to -- so how do you sleep  at night with positions running against you?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean, I think the -- it is -- it is personality  based.  I think -- I used to think when I started the business that  shorting stocks fundamentally was just simply the mirror image of going  long.  And I've said publicly many times, I don't think that's the case  anymore.  I think a lot of it's rooted in behavioral finance.  I think  we're all by and large, we're listeners to this show and others are the  product of positive reinforcement cycles.</p><p>And most people's rational decision-making studies have shown breaks  down in an environment negative reinforcement.  And if you're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- in other words when positions going against you, their  discipline goes away when they need it --</p><p>CHANOS:  -- well, and the ultimate example, which will be something  like an interrogation.  And so the ability to withhold information.  So if  you're long in the market, you're constantly -- when I come in every day,  we have 50 stocks in the U.S., another 40 globally, you know, I can pretty  much be sure that 20 percent of my names will have a research note out, a  buy recommendation, earnings estimates raised.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Something's moving.</p><p>CHANOS:  The CEO and Bloomberg, whatever the case might be.  And most  of that is noise.  But it's the noise that most people in the market are  used to.  And I call it the Muzak of the investment business.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I'm going to pull a quote I was saving for before, because  it's so dead-on.</p><p>You called it \"the cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  And so most people -- as I say, they're used to that.  But if  you're a short seller or you're a negative -- on a situation, you're being  told constantly you're wrong.  And here's why.  And you know, 50-page  research report to follow.</p><p>And I think that not everyone has the ability to simply drown that out  and say, OK.  That's all well and good.  But that's in the price of the  stock.  Do we know that?  And the facts that I have are very important and  the market doesn't really know that or appreciate how important they are.</p><p>So I'm not sure.  I think the research is the same.  And I think that  good research can be taught both on long and short side and should be the  same.  I think the ability to deal with the noise, the swing factors, the  volatility, I think that's a different attribute.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  We continue our conversation with famed short seller Jim  Chanos of Kynikos Associates.  And we'll discuss the role of the short  seller in modern markets.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  You're listening to MASTERS  IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  I'm Barry  Ritholtz.  I'm thrilled to be speaking with Jim Chanos -- am I pronouncing  Kynikos -- is that -- correctly?</p><p>CHANOS:  Oh, you're ready to go to Greece --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Kynikos associates, Kynikos, which translates as \"cynic.\"   And you have spent a couple of cynical but lucrative decades on Wall  Street, calling out the nonsense that passes for ordinary Wall Street  noise.</p><p>Let's talk a little bit about the role of the short seller in markets.   And here it is.  It's five years past the financial crisis.  People forget  it wasn't the banks overleveraged and writing all this junk CDS and AIG  writing the $3 trillion worth of derivatives with exactly $0 reserved for  it.  It was you short sellers that caused the crisis.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, sure was.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  How do you defend yourself for bringing the world to the  edge of the abyss?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, you never --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And by the way, that was at the highest levels of -- we  heard that from the ECB, we heard that crap from Treasury.  We heard that  from everywhere.  And it was just despite Enron and WorldCom and a whole  slew of fraud uncovered by short sellers, including Lehman Brothers. </p><p>How does anybody actually say that?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean, you remember, Barry, right after Bear Stearns  collapsed, a group of bankers who shall go nameless from New York, went  down to Washington and sat with senators from New York and elsewhere and  with Treasury Secretary Paulson, whatever.  And they asked for two things.   They didn't ask for forgiveness for their crazy lending and leveraging,  they didn't ask for forbearance on capital levels, which they were going to  need. </p><p>Instead they asked for a relaxation of the accounting rules, a mark- to-market.  And they asked for a ban or curbs on short selling of their  shares.  And that, to us, was very telling, because it told you where their  mindset was.  It wasn't about what actually they had done on their balance  sheets and they way they had accounted for them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Repo 103?</p><p>CHANOS:  Oh, and all kinds of --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- fine, moving stuff off balance sheet each quarter, what  harm --</p><p>CHANOS:  -- 105 was the least of it.  But I mean, just saying they  were more worried about it being uncovered and/or having to mark things  profitably or -- excuse me, properly.  In fact, I mean, a year earlier than  that, at a G7 meeting, I was asked, along with Paul Singer -- and this is  public information --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  This is the spring of '07?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes and --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- before anything --</p><p>CHANOS:  -- in April of '07, we actually briefed the G7 at their  Washington meetings on -- we were asked to give a talk about hedge funds  and the risks of hedge funds.  And Paul and I gave a presentation on the  looming credit crisis. He did it on the structure of structured finance and  how unstable it was.  And I did it on bank balance sheets and how loaded to  the gills international banks were with the stuff Paul had just talked  about.</p><p>And it was met with, you know, some would say, at best polite applause  or, at most, a stifled yawn.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Now did these guys actually get it?  Or were you talking  way over their -- ?</p><p>CHANOS:  No, no, they got it.  I mean, there were -- there were people  from the Fed there.  There were people, you know, Gordon Brown, the future  U.K. prime minister was in the room.  You know, a future Treasury Secretary  was in the room, future ECB central banker was in the room.  I mean, these  were serious people and I think that --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, which future Treasury Secretary or serious people, I  think, an argument can be made that that Venn diagram has very little  lovelife.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, we'll leave it -- let you make that statement.  But I'm  just saying that that again -- I mean, for people to say that nobody warned  or could see this coming, and Gillian Tett, in her book, \"Fool's Gold,\" has  a chapter on that meeting, which I think is worth the read.  But --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And she was one of the people in the \"FT,\" pounding away  about this long before Lehman and AIG collapsed.  And it was -- you had to  willfully look away if you didn't want to see --</p><p>CHANOS:  Willful blindness, which is a concept I teach in my financial  fraud history class, willful blindness is a very, very strong argument.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- up in New Haven, if memory --</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, I teach at Yale SOM.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And that's great.  That sounds like it must be a  fascinating -- how do you find the kids these days?</p><p>CHANOS:  I think they're -- well, mine aren't kids, because they're  mostly students in their late 20s, but --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Those are kids.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  I -- it's a great class and I get as much out of it as I hope  they do.  It's a good group and we basically look at some models,  historically, of fraud, academic models and then do case-by-case, going  back to the 1690s.  And it's remarkable as to how these cycles actually  keep repeating with many of the same methods, just right up to date.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So who's uncovered more fraud?  Various regulatory  agencies?  Or hedge funds and others who short?  How do you -- what's that  scorecard look like?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I'd like to say that virtually all major frauds over  the past 20-30 years have really been uncovered by either internal  whistleblowers, journalists and/or short sellers.  Very, very few have been  uncovered by regulatory agencies or law enforcement, very few.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And yet the first thing that happens in the crisis is --  first things we do, blame all the short sellers.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Well, that's -- a friend of mine named Bob Sloan wrote  a great book about that, a history, called \"Blame the Shorts.\" And it has a  long, long storied history also going back to the 1600s where people really  will point fingers to those who have profited when -- when they've lost  money.  And -- and that's human nature, I think.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So now let's sidestep a little bit or -- or just change a  little bit.  We've been talking about accounting fraud.  We haven't even  gotten to the role of the accountants, but clearly, the -- the big four,  big five -- I don't even know how many are left -- are major enablers of  what takes place with -- with many of these, uh, shorts, but now let's --  let's focus on the C-suite and corporate management.</p><p>You recently put out a commentary about buy-backs as little more than  financial engineering and speculation in the market by the CEOs of America,  whose track record in dabbling in market timing is especially awful.</p><p>What -- what don't you like about buy-backs?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, first of all, in -- in aggregate, every CEO, of course,  always thinks their stock is undervalued.  We -- we -- we know that.</p><p>But what...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Except when they're selling.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- what worries -- well, well, we'll get to that in a second.</p><p>But what worries me is that corporate America, in aggregate, has pre- tax returns on capital in the mid to high teens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  The long-term expected rate of the equity markets is roughly  half that.  And when corporations are embarked on massive buy-backs across  all industries and all companies, in effect, these CEOs are buying the  stock market.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right?</p><p>So what they're telling you then is -- is unequivocally that they  think that either they're happy to earn the stock market rate of return or  maybe something hopefully better...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Which -- which is half what you would expect...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- their rate of return...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- their rate of return on the margin of any new capital  product is much, much lower -- in fact, half or less, of what -- of what is  stated.  And that does not bode well for the -- the future of profits or  for the quality of earnings reported as current profits.</p><p>There's one additional problem with this whole thing, and that is,  number one, the CEOs making this decision typically have a very short  tenure at companies.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  They're not thinking long-term.</p><p>And number two, we're seeing an increase in insider selling concurrent  with the increase in buy-backs.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So out of one side of the mouth...</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They're saying the...</p><p>CHANOS:  They...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- the companies should be buying stock...</p><p>CHANOS:  But maybe I should be lightening up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- but I'm going to -- right.  That's -- that's it.  You  know, my...</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- my favorite data point on stock buy-backs is that Dell,  now a private company, spent more money on buy-backs than they earned over  their entire...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- lifetime.  That -- that's just an astonishing figure.</p><p>CHANOS:  And I think that -- well, I think you see that in companies  like sears, as well.  But -- but the -- for a lot of companies, the other  problem with this, of course, is is that CEOs are terrible market timers.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  They're always buying back stu -- the previous peak in  corporate buy-back activity was the second quarter of 2007.</p><p>And -- and where was the low?</p><p>The second quarter 2009.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You see the same thing with acquisitions and mergers.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They love to do...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  With inflated stock -- to buy inflated stock...</p><p>CHANOS:  Corporate activity...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE) stuff is cheap...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- follows the market -- basically follows or is coincident  with the market.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  It's not a leading indicator.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So we have buy-backs as financial engineering.</p><p>What about dividends?</p><p>A little more credible than?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, a little bit more credible and -- and I think certainly  where -- any time you see the actual cash go out the door, um, the other  interesting observation we've -- we've made in looking at corporate  financial transactions is that increasingly, we're seeing acquisitions  which are not taken out of most analysts' free cash flow numbers,  acquisitions are replacing CAPEX, corporal -- capital spending or R&amp;D.  So  companies are buying their -- their R&amp;D or their -- their -- their capital.   And that should probably be properly deducted from the free cash flow,  because, in aggregate, corporate America is not growing.</p><p>So they're -- by buying each other, you know, and buying divisions of  each other, in effect, they're -- they're capitalizing their R&amp;D.  Um, and,  I think that that's an interesting obser -- and that particularly applies  for big tech...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- which are perceived as very cheap companies.  If you  actually look at them, the only reason their revenues aren't declining at a  -- at a reasonable rate is because they're -- they're buying other  companies.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  We sort of stated these in the pharmaceutical area...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They quote a bunch of genomics, molecular, go down the  list, as opposed to plowing money into their own R&amp;D...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- OK, let's go out and buy these new...</p><p>CHANOS:  And, again...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and rather than expensing the R&amp;D, they're capitalizing by  purchasing.  They can set it up as goodwill.  And so it's overstating their  earnings.  And that -- that's a key point that we were trying to hone in  on, that -- that companies that grow this way by acquisition are most  likely overstating their earnings meaningfully.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And we've seen a ton of acquisitions, maybe not as much as  at other peaks, but the M&amp;A activity, along with the IPO activity has  certainly picked up fairly appreciably in the past couple of quarters.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, and the M&amp;A activity gives rise, we worry -- we're --  we think and worry, on a really drop in the quality of earnings.  And --  and that, I think, drives a lot of M&amp;A activity, the ability to write down  inventories, write down receivables, write up liabilities and basically  give yourself, in effect, what -- what Herb Greenberg has called a cookie  jar going forward to help manage your earnings.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I've been speaking with James Chanos, chairman of Kynikos  Associates.  You can listen to more of our conversation with Jim in our  podcast extra, which is available on Bloomberg View, on SoundCloud and at  Apple iTunes, as well as the Bloomberg Radio Plus App.</p><p>Coming up next week, we sit down with former FDIC Chairperson Sheila  Bair, which is a really fascinating conversation.</p><p>Be sure and check out my daily column on bloombergview.com or follow  me on Twitter @ritholtz.  At my blog, I posted a whole bunch of unrelated  but interesting items.  That's ritholtz.com.</p><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p>You're listening to Masters In Business on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   This concludes the broadcast portion of our  interview.</p><p>Coming up with our guest, the radio podcast extra.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Today, I've been speaking with James Chanos of Kynikos  Associates.</p><p>And we've been talking generally about short-selling and what it's  like to run short funds.</p><p>What I love to do in these segments, when we finish broadcasting on  the air and go to the podcast, is talk a little bit about you.</p><p>You started in this business as an analyst.  We talked about Baldwin  and eventually Enron.  But when you were an up-and-comer, when you were the  age of the kids you're teaching at Yale, who were your influences?</p><p>Who -- who are formative to the Jim Chanos approach to investment?</p><p>CHANOS:  Um, you know, it's -- it's hard to find lots of people that  you can point to who -- who did what I did.  I mean I -- I was blessed when  I was a young analyst at -- at Gilford Securities doing Baldwin that, um,  we had a number of -- of well-known hedge fund managers who actually were  our clients, people like Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, um, and I got to  meet shortly after that when I moved to New York in '83, Julian Robertson.   One of the people that probably had the most influence on me just passed  away, uh, and that was -- it was sort of the legendary Bob Wilson...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- who was a -- was a -- not only a great investor, but a --  but an amazing philanthropist.  And, uh, I used to have -- I used to have  dinner with him or lunch with him from time to time.  And he was a -- he  had -- he was written up by John Train in \"The Money Masters.\" But he was  of the legendary Resorts International short squeeze.</p><p>But he was a tremendous investor on the long side.  And, um, he  introduced me to people like Dick Gilder here in New York and -- all of  whom early, 30 years ago, you know, I learned from another fellow, Stephen  Peck, who was an amazing investor, a client of mine, a good friend, of  Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Oh, sure.</p><p>CHANOS:  And all these people were just sort of, you know, as I was  getting going in New York, not only were they helpful in terms of their  wisdom and their experience and what not to do and -- but also introduced  me to lots of other people.</p><p>And -- and I think that that, you know, I'm indebted to all of them  and -- and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few people.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So you mentioned George Soros, clients early on.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And Julian Robertson, another legendary hedge fund manager.</p><p>CHANOS:  And Mike -- Mike Steinhardt.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Steinhardt.  Again, another guy, called by some the  greatest trader on Wall Street ever.  I don't know if that's an  exaggeration, but people have said that about him.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, I mean they -- it -- I had the -- the pleasure of  running money for all three of those men.  And -- and they all were  different and a different temperament and -- and -- and I would categorize  them completely different people, but all -- all amazing investors.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Hmmm.  Interesting.</p><p>So you began as an analyst.  You worked with some of the most storied  names.  Obviously, the industry has changed a lot since '83.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  A little bit.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  To think that a relatively unknown analyst at the time and  a relatively small firm could get an audience with a Robertson or a Soros,  that's not the sort of universe that we exist these days.</p><p>CHANOS:  I think it would be a lot harder, I mean but -- but, first of  all, people -- there weren't people putting out short-side research in --  in '80, even in '82 and '83 and -- and, uh, so, you know, I think the --  the Baldwin piece, a number of them were -- were short.  A few of the  people I just mentioned were short that.  So it got me an audience with  them early on, which I think was helpful.</p><p>But, um, I think it would be a lot tougher today.  I mean I started my  -- my own fund when I was 27.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Really?</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And that's 30 -- 30 plus years...</p><p>CHANOS:  1985, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And so that's almost exactly 30 years ago.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And that -- that was just you and a partner and -- and how  big is Kynikos today?</p><p>How many employees...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean we have, I think, 33 employees in -- in New York  and London.  And, uh, and obviously a little bit more sophisticated.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  It was just three of us, uh, at first and the two partners  and a secretary.  And my partner, a wonderful partner at the time who I  brought with me from Deutsche Bank a year into it came to me and said, you  know, I just don't think I -- I can do shorting stocks.  And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And -- and -- and sold his half back to me, um, for a - - for a nominal amount of money.  Uh, and, you know, just walked out the  door and prospered, by the way, mightily since doing his own thing.</p><p>So it -- it -- even when you think you can do it, sometimes you can't.   And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So -- so you mentioned Deutsche Bank in -- in passing.  If  memory serves, they kind of showed you the door, didn't they?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Yes.  In the summer of -- of '85, um, there was a full  page -- a front page...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  \"Journal.\"..</p><p>CHANOS:  -- monster article talking about these evil short sellers and  -- and how they were disrupting these great businesses.  Um, and in the  middle of the article was -- was sort of -- was me.  And a...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And this is even after Baldwin...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- had collapsed and...</p><p>CHANOS:  And after a number of other calls we had made as well.  And  it, um, and so my -- my bosses in Frankfurt woke up that morning to see  that, you know, Satan was working in their New York office.  And I...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I was told a -- I was told, by the end of the day, my  contract, which was coming up, would not be renewed.  I mean they didn't  fire me, but they just simply said, you know, time for you to do something  else.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks, uh, here's your hat.  Watch  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And then the postscript was I think nine of the 10  companies that were mentioned in that piece ultimately either went bankrupt  or were prosecuted for fraud.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And any mea culpa from the right...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- you know, obviously, you know someone is pulling the  strings behind the scenes with that journalist and sends them down the  wrong path.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, I mean we were -- we were -- we were famously short a --  a lot of companies being run by a very aggressive investment bank out of  Beverly Hills at the time.  And I suspect that -- that that may or may not  have had something to do with it.</p><p>Having said all that, (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Are we -- are we talking about Drexel or are we talking  about somebody else?</p><p>CHANOS:  No, we're talking about Drexel.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  OK.</p><p>CHANOS:  And a -- but -- but a -- one of the -- the, you know,  serendipitous aspects was I had a client who had wanted me to run money for  them as -- as a money manager, but because I was at a bank and it was...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You couldn't do it.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- (INAUDIBLE) -- I couldn't do it.  And so when I told them,  yes, I was going to be looking for work, they said, well, why don't we set  you up in business?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Oh.</p><p>CHANOS:  So that's -- that's how -- that's how Kynikos Associates got  started.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's unbelievable.  I love stories like that.</p><p>You know, Ray Dalio has a similar story.  You talk to a number of  people, Jeff Gundlach, there are a lot of people who start in this business  in one direction and, for whatever reason, end up making a turn and it's  enormously successful.</p><p>CHANOS:  I've often taught not only the -- the people who work for me,  but my students that -- that's one of the things about business that you  have to appreciate is that when good fortune, or bad fortune, comes your  way, you have to know how to deal with it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And the bad fortune, you have to -- you have to rebound, you  have to pick yourself up.  But when good fortune comes, you have to grab  it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and take advantage of it, because it will happen a  number of times in your career just out of chance.  And if you don't take  advantage of it, you miss that chance to move your career ahead on -- in a  quantum leap...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and I think that I was fortunate, at the time, in that I  was young, I was not quite married yet.  I was about to get married, but I  didn't have kids.  And often I tell people the time to take risks,  actually, is not after you're established in your career, when you have a  wife and kids and a mortgage...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Too much to lose.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and -- and it's when you're younger and you're given an  opportunity.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Sure.</p><p>CHANOS:  Because if it...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  What...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- works, it's great.  If it doesn't, no one is going to hold  it against you.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And you have the ability...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You -- you lose a year or two.  You can (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS:  You have an ability to get back up.  And in -- particularly  in America, which is an aspirational society, I think people, in many  cases, even if it doesn't work, will admire that you tried.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  When -- when we speak to people from overseas, when we  speak to people in Europe especially, one of the things we hear time and  again, that they admire the most about America is failure isn't a fatal...</p><p>CHANOS:  No.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- scarlet letter here.  You know, henry Ford had five  failed companies...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- before Ford Motor Company.  And the stories at Edison  are legendary.  He had hundreds of failed inventions before that light bulb  finally...</p><p>CHANOS:  As long as your work ethic...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  -- is good and -- and you're honest, people will value your  ideas.  And -- and -- and that is one of the great things about our  society, that -- that I think sets us apart from almost any other developed  economy.  You fail in most other developed economies, you're done.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  That's it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  No second -- no second chapters elsewhere.</p><p>CHANOS:  And that's not the case here at all.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So we talked about when you first launched.  It was two  guys and a secretary.  Today, obviously, a much more sophisticated  multinational entity.  Take us through a -- a day in the life of Jim  Chanos.</p><p>What time do you start work?</p><p>What -- what is your work flow like?</p><p>What do you do throughout the day?</p><p>I get the sense that you're not chained to Bloomberg all day watching  every tick.</p><p>CHANOS:  No, I'm not.  I mean I have a trading desk that does that.   But our -- our portfolio only turns over about once a year, so -- which is  glacial by hedge funds.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  Sure.</p><p>CHANOS:  We're really investors.  So I mean time spent looking at  every tick is not time well spent for me.  Looking at companies is more  important for me.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  By -- by the way, that's a theme that's been pretty  consistent.  I can't begin to tell you how many investors we've spoken to  who all pretty much say, if you -- if you have a good idea and a high  degree of confidence, the day to day noise, that cacophony you mentioned...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- those fluctuations, it's meaningless noise and you have  to have the con -- courage of your conviction.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, I mean you need -- you need to have an intelligence  post, as we do -- and I have a good one -- to -- to -- to point it all out  to you.  But you also need filters and you need to understand.</p><p>And one of the big differences, Barry, in the business now from when  we started was back then, getting the information gave you a leg up.</p><p>So if you read the 10-Q because you got it a day or two before the  rest of the Street and you saw something buried in -- in management's  discussion, you had a piece of information that was, A, public, and, B,  material.  And it might move the stock and -- and there were lots of  instances of that.</p><p>Um, nowadays, the information comes at you with a fire hose.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  I mean it truly does.  And -- and the key is having, A, the  right filters and the right staff and the right ability to -- to pull out  what is the real information from just the absolute, you know, torrent of  water coming at you.  And -- and so that has changed a lot.</p><p>So I mean I -- I'll get up, you know, obviously, the older I get --  and you might appreciate this, you know, I might get a few -- up a few  times at night anyway, but I'll get up, you know, early in the morning and  check the markets and if nothing earth-shaking is happening in Asia or  Europe and we have a desk that's 24-7, you know, I'll go back to sleep.</p><p>And then typically, you know, up -- up again early in the morning and  then it's going through morning news, filings, research that comes in  internally overnight, research that's come in externally overnight, um, you  know, and -- and then the day may, depending on -- on my schedule,  whatever.</p><p>But unfortunately, it's -- it's 24-7, you know, in a way that you know  in that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I get the sense you read a lot throughout your day.</p><p>CHANOS:  I read an awful lot whether I'm on the move or whatever, so,  unfortunately, you know, you -- you have to stay connected.  I'm trying to  get to the point now where I am able to do it for Saturdays, but I'm trying  to make Sundays a non-e-mail, non-electric -- non-electronic day, um, to  just disconnect one day out of the week.  I think that is becoming a little  bit more important and a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's just a recharge day, just a...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, it's just a recharge day...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE) it up a little bit.</p><p>CHANOS:  And in the spring for eight weeks on -- in the afternoons on  Monday, I teach.  And that's been, actually, a -- a wonderful, wonderful  adjunct to what I'm doing for all kinds of good reasons.  And -- and -- and  I think that's been a -- been -- been a wonderful plus.  And my clients and  partners have been very supportive of that -- of that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It -- it's just a change in the routine and it allows you  to mix it up a little bit.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And it -- and it's great to interreact and go back to  history, whether it's my history or history from 300 years ago, though  sometimes it feels like I've lived 300 years.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Um, and -- and, impart, some of the stuff back to a -- back  to students.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So -- so you're teaching at Yale School of Management.</p><p>Am I recalling correctly, did you go undergrad to Yale?</p><p>CHANOS:  I did.  I did.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You did.  OK.</p><p>CHANOS:  I did, years ago.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So you're back -- back in the dorms, effectively?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, well...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- not quite, but I -- I have two -- two sons who went, as  well, and when I told them I was going back to teach and that maybe we  could...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They were horrified.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- live together in -- in like in a con...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- in a condo like back to school...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  They wouldn't even...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- they looked to me horrified until I told them I was  kidding.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's hilarious.</p><p>Um, they're at a -- I'm assuming they're out of school or?</p><p>CHANOS:  One is.  One is still there.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And, um, that's pretty funny.</p><p>So every -- you've been doing this how many years now over the...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- in the springs?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I got on the -- I'm on my fourth year of teaching.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Oh, that's great.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And a -- and a -- it's a lot, as I say, a lot of fun  and it's one afternoon for two months in -- in the spring.  And Yale has  got a brand new business school, so I'll give a plug for that.  And an  amazing new dean and a -- Yale SOM is on the way up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  We have Bob Shiller coming in in a few weeks...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, he's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- he's one of my favorite...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- he's one of my -- he's certainly a tenured -- a tenured  and Nobel Prize winner.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  He's at a different level.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  He -- he's really fascinating...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  I'm the low man on the totem pole in the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You -- you talk about -- but you talk about the psychology  of investing in behavioral economics...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and how (INAUDIBLE).  Here's a guy teaching in the same  place you're teaching who's been one of the key drivers of that philosophy  for a good couple of decades.</p><p>You -- you mentioned the far -- the fund launched in '85.</p><p>CHANOS:  Um-hmm.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's 30 years ago.</p><p>CHANOS:  Almost.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  How has the hedge fund industry changed in that ensuing  period?</p><p>What -- what do you see as big differences?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean the growth, first of all.  I mean it -- we had  a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Enormous.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  We had a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Over $2 trillion now.</p><p>CHANOS:  We started with $16 million in '85 and by -- by 19 -- the end  of 19 -- early '91, we were over $600 million in assets.  And that put us  in the top 10 globally of hedge funds...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Wow!</p><p>CHANOS:  -- of (INAUDIBLE).  And -- and so that -- that tells you just  how small the industry was back then.  Um, the dramatic growth was -- was  in the late '90s and early millennium.</p><p>But it was truly a small handful of people.  Everybody kind of knew  each other in the '80s.  There were...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  A hundred hedge funds, 200 hedge funds?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, maybe no more than 100...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Now it's 10,000...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- maybe...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- something like that?</p><p>CHANOS:  Maybe more than 100 and probably practically, 20 or 30.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and -- and everybody knew everybody.  I mean truly.   And there weren't a lot of -- a lot of real different strategies.  I mean  everybody was pretty much in the equity markets, give or take.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Long, short?</p><p>CHANOS:  Long, short, maybe...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and that was kind of it.  And then -- and, you know, you  had guys like -- like -- like Mike Steinhardt spec -- and Soros speculating  in bonds and currencies, um, but -- but it was, by and large, an equity  driven model.  And a -- and everybody was, at that point, was fairly adept,  both on the long and short side.</p><p>Um, getting institutional investors was a big deal back then.  That he  didn't really started until the '90s.</p><p>So...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So in the '80s, your clients were essentially just high net  worth individuals...</p><p>CHANOS:  High net worth or foreign families because the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So family offices but no sovereign wealth funds yet?</p><p>CHANOS:  Typically not.  You would -- typically not U.S. fun --  families and no sovereign wealth funds.  No endowments.  By and large, no  pension funds.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's amazing.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And everything has completely changed.  Now it's...</p><p>CHANOS:  Completely changed.  All of it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- dominated by big institutions.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Ten thousand hedge funds, although, if you look at the --  the Bell Curve, that is -- that is not a normal Gaussian distribution.   It's effectively those 100 hedge funds capturing 80 percent of the alpha  and then a long tail of underperformance.</p><p>CHANOS:  That's probably -- that's probably right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  The -- the numbers are pretty -- when you look at the  Tremont data and you look at some of the other hedge fund data that's out  there, the funds that are earning their keep are few and far between.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean true alpha is -- is hard to come by, as we all  know.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  For -- for sure.  Well, the -- you know, it's like  expansion in -- in professional sports teams, you go from 22 to 26 teams  and suddenly there's that much talent -- less talent on any one team.  It's  spread around.  And there's sort of a uniform mediocrity.</p><p>But a handful of all stars, you know, there's 100 funds out there that  are just...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- stealing it.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- the only difference is you can't start your own NBA team.   You can start your own hedge fund.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Very easily.</p><p>CHANOS:  That makes it worse.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  All -- all you have to do is talk someone into giving you X  dollars...</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And it's not even -- there's not even a $100 million  minimum.  You could -- you know, the SEC regulates RIAs and others.  If you  have 100 plus, you don't have to do state by state.  It's one regulatory  scheme.  So that's a bogey for a lot of -- you don't even have that on the  hedge fund side.  Anyone with a couple of million dollars can launch a  hedge fund.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Although it is harder.  I mean to -- in -- in -- the  cost of doing business, of getting a real prime broker, I mean...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- (INAUDIBLE) now that I think have -- have, I think, taken  that true start-up out of the -- the industry.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE), in fact, you sort of do need a -- a critical  mass to be considered a -- a, you know, a -- at least viable.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So, obviously the industry has changed dramatically over  the past couple of years.  Let me -- let me throw some of my favorite  quotes, um, of yours -- of yours back at you and see what your...</p><p>CHANOS:  OK.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- reaction is.  Let -- let's talk about timing.  \"In  investing, you could be really right but temporarily quite wrong.\" I love  that line, because I started in the business as a trader and I -- it was  always drilled into my head, hey, either you're right or wrong.</p><p>If -- if you think you're right and the market is going against you,  you're wrong.  But when you're doing fundamental shorting, you're basically  -- our friend Doug Kass calls it variant perception.  You're identifying  what people aren't seeing, or seeing incorrectly...</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and you're going to be wrong for a long time, almost by  identifying that variant perception.  You're wrong for a while by  definition...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, and there's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- before people catch on.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- there's -- there's a big difference.  If you're trading a  position, you know, sort of because of a fundamental view and your time  frame has shortened enough, price tells you everything, almost.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And in a fundamental short position, not only are you  analyzing the company or -- or the -- whatever it is you're analyzing, but  in many cases, you have a management team interposed that's actively  working to -- to -- to prove you're wrong through activities that aren't  necessarily kosher.</p><p>And so there's an added level here of -- of sort of three-dimensional  chess when you're on the fundamental short side because the market won't  necessarily immediately see what you see.  And, in fact, often doesn't.   And -- and that's why most fundamental short sellers will tell you, they're  -- they're often early.</p><p>One additional problem, you have to borrow the shares.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so the ability to effect a short position in reasonable  size for a firm like ours, once everything is clear, may not be given to  you.  And so there -- there are additional hurdles that don't exist in  traditional investing that exist on the short side.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, we mentioned -- I mentioned Doug Kass earlier.  One  of the things he taught me early on, which I would have wish I had known  when I was shorting Lehman, was that you could be short the stock and  you're going to get squeezed.  But if you really want to make a run for it,  you marry a put to that and if you close the short position, you could let  the put run.  It's never going to get called for you.  You're never going  to get squeezed.  You could -- you're paying up for the option, but it's a  way to get, um, that juiced return, because the -- on the short side, the  most you can make is 100 percent.  With options...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, that's actually not true.  But go ahead with it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, what -- well, let's discuss that, because that's a  standard line against short-selling.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, that's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Look, you're shorting at 50, you can only go to zero,  that's 100 percent.</p><p>Why is that wrong?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, because...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Because of leverage and?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, because the ability of -- of -- if you start with a  short position at 100 and -- and with no other cash in your account and you  short the stock and it goes down to 50, OK, you can, without adding any  more cash -- capital to the account, short additional shares.  And if it  keeps going your way, you -- you can compound your return.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But then you're running the risk of -- of...</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- a margin call, a squeeze...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, that's fine.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  But I just want to...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  I want to get the statement (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So you can...</p><p>CHANOS:  That you can't make more than 100 percent on initial capital.   That's not true.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So you can -- with -- if you're actually using the gain in,  um, value, falling stock creates, if you're short, you're then pyramiding  that on top and -- and shorting that with that additional effort.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, you're shorting on -- on -- you're compounding your  profit, in effect.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  So number two, I've also (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  By the way, I've heard that 100,000 times.  You're the  first person who's corrected that.</p><p>CHANOS:  So -- so the -- the -- the other problem, of course, is is  that, you know, I've seen a lot more stocks go to zero than -- than infamy  -- invidimy (ph).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  That -- and that's the -- that's the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  But the -- the key point for your listener, of course, is is  that for what we do, and -- and theoretically, don't try this at home,  kids, we have a portfolio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And a portfolio changes the volatility nature, like any  portfolio will.  There's going to be things that are always working and  things that aren't working.  And so, you know, I -- I think that a -- that  really tells you that -- that a -- that doing this as a professional with a  portfolio approach and watching your country risk, your industry risk and  all those things makes much more sense.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So this leads -- you mentioned something earlier and I want  to address that.  You mentioned you have management actively working  against you in a number of ways.</p><p>One of the things that you were very much in the forefront of was  working with investigative journalists, working with the media to help  uncover fraud.</p><p>How did that first come about?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I'm a -- you know, clear up a misconception here.  I  mean we don't call up or e-mail reporters and say, hey, you ought to be  looking at Enron.  And in the case of Enron, Bethany McLean was talking to  my partner at the time and he said -- and she said, you know, what do you - - what's interesting?</p><p>And -- and -- and Douglas Millett, do you ever really talk to Jim  about Enron?</p><p>And he -- we -- we're real excited about it.  And we -- we really  think there's something there.</p><p>So I mean that -- that often reporters find a way to fundamental short  sellers to -- to ask them, hey, what do you -- what do you think of this or  are you working on something?</p><p>And -- and I think that I'll -- I think there are ways to do that and  -- and not compromise anybody.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  On the other hand, I think there are ways not to do that.   And I think you have to be mindful of -- of that.  And I think there's  approaches.</p><p>Having said all that, I -- I'm a firm believer in the \"U.S.   Constitution\" and -- and anybody has the right to their opinions of  interest.  But you're -- you do not have the right to your own facts.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And I think that that's an important point.  But if you're a  publicly traded company, you have to understand that the marketplace is  going to be a marketplace of ideas and a marketplace of opinions, of...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  We've -- we've seen some litigation against short sellers.   We've seen some litigation against analysts.</p><p>What do you think of that sort of stuff?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean, as I say, no one has the right to -- to trade  on or -- or induce others to trade on information they know to be false.   And that's kind of the -- the bright line that -- that -- that certainly  most -- that all investors need to understand about securities fraud.</p><p>But -- but an awful lot of companies seem to, you know, be upset when  people don't have the approved opinion about that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And, you know, that -- that is not actionable in our court  system.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  One...</p><p>CHANOS:  A...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- one would hope.</p><p>CHANOS:  One would hope.  One would hope.  But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So -- so one of the...</p><p>CHANOS:  The federal courts, by the way, have a pretty strong view on  that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  And they've been on the right side of this, for the  most part...</p><p>CHANOS:  Usually it's people that bring these cases are in state  courts of -- of, you know, varying venues or questionable venues to try to  get state, you know, put this before a jury in a state.</p><p>Federal judges, by and large, look at these things and, for the most  part, toss them out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's the right way to do it.</p><p>So you mentioned earlier about long versus short.  There's a -- a  longer quote I really like, which is, \"I used to think that good short  sellers could be trained like long focused...</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- value investors.  It's the same skill set.  You're  tearing into the numbers.  You're valuing businesses.  You're assigning a  consolidated value and hopefully you see something the market doesn't.\"</p><p>But you've since learned, quote, \"There's a big difference between a  long-focused value investor and a good short seller.  And you mentioned the  differences -- psychology and behavioral finance.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And it...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's a great -- that's a fabulous quote.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and I think that -- and I think that -- that -- as I  said, I've run money for a lot of great investors who have farmed out the  short side to me.  And I've seen that, actually, some of the best value  investors who I've had the pleasure of doing business with are not  particularly good short sellers.  And -- and shouldn't be selling short for  that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  The wrong constitution.</p><p>CHANOS:  They're just -- just the -- they'll obsess over very tiny  positions that have gone against them, you know, that...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- you know, that -- that fear of the stock going to infinity  that we discussed.  And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  By the way, that's the other false statement.  You -- we've  talked about a stock can only lose 100 percent.  I've heard that well when  you're short, your losses are theoretically infinite.</p><p>Well, not if you have a stop loss.  Not if you have a line in the  sand...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, there's in you...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- that you cover...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- there's an even better little argument...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  There -- there's no lock limit up when it comes to  equities.</p><p>CHANOS:  There's an even better little limit that no one talks about.   If you're in a partnership and you're a limited partner, you can only lose  what you put up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's right.  That -- that's your limitation.</p><p>CHANOS:  Which is an argument for investing with short sellers that  way.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Typically a hedge fund as opposed to...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  You know, or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- hiding...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- or buying shares in an offshore corporation.  And -- and - - and that's something, you know, we point out to people, too, that --  that, actually, you can, in effect, get the same limited -- limited down  side by doing it in that structure.  And the general partner takes the  risk, but the prime broker will sell you out long before that ever happens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  That's right.</p><p>CHANOS:  So, again, these are -- these are -- these are...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Myths.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- examples of thinking -- well, they're not myths.  They're  -- they're accurate on the face, but in practicality, they're inaccurate...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- because -- because, again, you structure things to -- to  not let that happen, A, and -- and, B, you can actually get protection  through the structure of -- of the investment vehicle or whatever, to  obviate the -- obviate the -- those risks.</p><p>But having said all that, they do play into behavioral finance.  And - - and I remember very famously, a well-known investor who's an incredibly - - he's got an incredible track record.  I was running some money for him.   And it was in the midst of our disastrous short on America Online in the --  in the late '90s.  And I had...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  A little early.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I had -- I had a small short portfolio I was running for  him.  And -- and AOL was never more than half of 1 percent or 1 percent of  our portfolio, because it was so volatile.  But it just kept doubling and  doubling and doubling.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And we thought it was an accounting fraud, which it turned  out to be.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Yes.</p><p>CHANOS:  And this investor called me repeatedly losing sleep at night  and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Over a half a percent (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and this one -- and this -- this position was not moving  the needle on his performance at all.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  But he was -- he was -- I think, to the detriment of him  working on other ideas.  And a -- and it -- and -- and that was a real  concrete example, to me, of just why it is that -- that certain people  shouldn't do this, um, because it was bothering him.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They just lack the constitution.  They can't...</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.  It...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- they can't compartmentalize.</p><p>CHANOS:   They didn't -- they didn't need to because he -- he was such  a good investor doing what he did well.  And so for that person, you know,  they shouldn't be doing it.  And -- and I think that it gets back to  exactly what you -- you've -- you've emphasized here, the psychological is  completely different.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So let's -- let's talk about noise, since we -- we've  touched on psychological, this is related to it.  \"I listen to the noise to  make sure there's no new information.  I need to know.  But I don't worry  about most of it.\"</p><p>And I -- I thought that was an interesting con -- concept, when --  when you discussed, relevant to this, analysts' reports, news, rumor mills,  that's where the phrase, \"For a short seller, this is a cacophony of  negative reinforcement.\"</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I -- I love that quote.</p><p>So how do you deal with that noise?</p><p>Do you filter all of it or do you have a staff that says, hey, out of  these 1,000 things, these four or five you should...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- hear?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I mean first of all, if we're getting a piece of new  material or information from a research report, my staff is not doing their  job.  Um, and -- because certainly, I want them reading the company filings  and company press releases going to conferences, you know, and -- and I --  I hope they -- you know, our team is very good -- that -- that I'm reading  it in an internal memo before I'm reading it in a -- in a Goldman Sachs or  Merrill Lynch research piece a week later.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  And that's usually the case 99 percent of the time.</p><p>Having said all that, you have to be mindful of what the Street is  saying.  You have to be mindful of what you're going up against.  And I --  and I think that that's important.  And one of the things we do is we do  talk to the Street.  We have them into our offices.  If we have an unusual  thesis or hypothesis on a company, we'll have the sell side in and to lay  it out...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They're pitching you the other side of the equation?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, well, we know what they're pitching.  I mean you know,  it's not -- and one of the good asymmetries of the short side -- and there  aren't that many of them, one of the good ones is is that if you're  fundamentally a short seller, you have no problem finding out what the bull  case is.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  It's easy to find out.</p><p>But if you long that stock, you might have to really kind of dig to  find out what the real bear case is on it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and a -- and so it's another one of these influential  asymmetries that I think works for the fundamental short seller.  There are  a few others.  We don't have to disclose our positions.  I think that's a  very important one, actually.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You know, there was a -- a movement afoot not too long ago  to force short sellers to disclose their positions.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and the Europeans have it in terms of -- of certain  thresholds, for example.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  Now the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But you're never short 10 percent of the outstanding stock?</p><p>CHANOS:  No, although we've -- we've...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  (INAUDIBLE) company...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- we've crossed the European thresholds a few times, because  the thresholds are very...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But that's a fairly low.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- they're very -- they're very low.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Two percent, 3 percent, something like that?</p><p>CHANOS:  Oh, I think it's a -- no, it's .5 percent or (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Is it that low?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  It's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I had no idea.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- it's really low.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's a...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- on some of them yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Wow!</p><p>CHANOS:  It's quite low on some of them.  Well, the reason is is that,  first of all, the IRS doesn't look at short positions as positions.  It  looks at -- it looks at it as in a commercial transaction, where you're  borrowing money, interestingly enough.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It -- it's a margin trade, it's a loan (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, because you don't own anything.  You don't -- you -- you  have a promise to -- to -- to pay something back.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  To repay...</p><p>CHANOS:  Shares.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so it's considered...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- instituted indebtedness.  Yes.  And so -- and which is why  the short sellers have no -- no standing at the bar, the securities bar.   We don't own anything.  And -- and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- now I would argue even further, I'm a little surprised  that my brethren in the hedge fund world have not actually challenged the  13 F, G and H regime.  I...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Sections of the SEC code?</p><p>CHANOS:  Code -- mandating disclosure over $100 million of your long  positions.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  Because, I mean I understand why the 13D need for change in  corporate control.  I think any reasonable person...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- would understand that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's right.</p><p>CHANOS:  But why is it that -- that all these great investors, every  90 days, should give the public a free look at what they're doing?</p><p>They're pay -- their clients pay for that.  And if you don't trade a  lot, say you're a value investor, um, well, if you don't trade a lot, that  portfolio doesn't trade a lot.  And there are people out there basically  with services now to replicate your portfolio for nothing, or very little,  that you have people paying good money for.</p><p>And I've always said, you know, Coca-Cola doesn't have to put its, you  know, formula on -- on -- on the Web and Microsoft doesn't have to issue  its source code, why should managers, either hedge fund or otherwise, have  to tell the public what -- what -- what's the public's interests?</p><p>I understand the SEC and law enforcement should have every right to  see it at any time.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  In other words, 13D filings go to the SEC and it stops  there, they don't get put on the Web?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, 13D filings, I think, change in corporate control,  that's fine.  I mean people publicly should know that.</p><p>But why is it that a passive money manager should tell the public...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Six percent of -- more than 5 percent position, why...</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- why disclose that?</p><p>CHANOS:  You know, their -- all their positions, all of their  positions.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  OK, so let's clarify that.  I'm under the impression they  do a filing at 5 percent?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, a 13D.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  OK.  So let's say they have a 2 percent position.</p><p>They have to disclose that?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  What happens if they're offshore?</p><p>CHANOS:  Of -- if you're a U.S. money manager, you've got to disclose  your positions of $100 million.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Huh, that's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, so -- so -- so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Is it a fund above $100 million or a fund...</p><p>CHANOS:  A position...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- a position above $100 million?</p><p>CHANOS:  A fund $100 -- of $100 million.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Really?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Again, I don't understand why the money management  industry hasn't gone and said this is, in effect, a, you know, possibly a  takings clause in \"The Constitution.\"</p><p>Why is it that the public gets to see what I'm doing?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You're -- you're...</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- forcing me to turn over my intellectual property with no  compensation.</p><p>CHANOS:  And if you don't short a lot of stocks, then if you're just a  long lonely manager, you're giving away your entire business plan every 90  days.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's really interesting.  And I hadn't thought of that in  a...</p><p>CHANOS:  Absolutely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- in that context.</p><p>CHANOS:  Absolutely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So the accusation is that Wall Street owns Congress and  they can get DC to do whatever they want.  And it's not all that far from  the truth.</p><p>Why is this so difficult to change?</p><p>You would think, hey, any major change in ownership, anything over --  pick a percent.  It doesn't even have to be 5 percent.  If you owe more  than 3 percent, you need to at least disclose it when you cross that line.</p><p>Um, but after that, why does it have to be completely...</p><p>CHANOS:  I'm a little...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- disclosed?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- you know, well, first of all, hedge funds don't have the  clout that -- that -- when -- when you say Wall Street does...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- we're talking about major -- major banks and -- and  investment banks.  They're the ones with the clout.  Hedge funds don't --  still don't have that much clout in Washington.</p><p>So I think that's number one.</p><p>But, again -- and -- and mutual funds, of course, like it because it  actually helps their marketing.</p><p>You know, here's our portfolio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Sure.</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Absolutely.</p><p>CHANOS:  I just -- but I -- I've always wondered at why a -- why hedge  funds have just sort of rolled over on this and said well, you know, well,  I guess, you know, we've got to do it.  And you do have to do it.  But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, I'll tell you what the answer is.  The answer is  merely knowing what Jim Chanos' long or short isn't the same as having Jim  Chanos manage that position for you.  And the same is true for any hedge  fund that's out there.  If it was the case, everybody would be generating  alpha by imitating the Dalio's, Tepper's, obviously Renaissance Technology  doesn't hold onto anything long enough for a filing to go through.</p><p>But still, if it was that easy just to say let me see what Chanos  owns, great, I'll own that...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, one would argue that that's actually why the alphas may  have dropped and a -- and so, I'm not so sure.  It will...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Because everybody was...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- clearly for trading...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE) to it.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- clearly for trading shops, it -- it's superfluous.  And  for shops that do a lot of fundamental shorting, it's -- it's meaningless,  because, for example, you use...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You want that out there anyway?</p><p>CHANOS:  When you see my longs, I file them in my Opportunity Fund,  which is our long short.  And if you look at my longs, you'll scratch your  head and go why is Chanos long in that thing, that looks crazy?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And not understanding there's two shorts against it that are  even crazier.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right, and that happens to be the best system -- systematic  hedge for that position.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Um, so it can be -- it can be very misleading to people.  And  that's the other reason then, why do it?</p><p>If it's misleading because you're both long and short, you're not  doing anybody a service.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  If it's not misleading because the guy is just simply a long  only person, why does the public have the right to that information for  free?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Those are the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  There's a lot of arguments against this that -- and -- and  the argument for it typically is well, it's for more -- don't we want more  transparency?</p><p>And I would argue, no, not necessarily.  Um, but I particularly if --  if you're basing a business on -- on intellectual capital and you're  charging people for that, I don't see what the public interest is in  putting out possibly misleading information.</p><p>One of the problems, when you have the limits where people have to  disclose where they go through limits and up and down, you actually --  people can game that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- knowing themselves they've gone through the limits.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so I've explained that to the European regulators, that - - that these short threshold limits themselves can be disruptive just  because they exist.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So let's veer into a dangerous territory.  Let's talk a  little bit about politics, Washington, DC, the regulatory environment.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You're known as a guy who's a pretty active, uh,  participant in politics.  You've made the comment that you've been -- I'm  paraphrasing -- you've been fortunate enough in your career to have  accumulated a sum of money and you feel obligated to respond, to give back,  to participate in democracy.</p><p>What -- what attracted you to that given how dysfunctional DC has  been?</p><p>Is it something you're still interested in?</p><p>Talk a little bit about that.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean I'm certainly not interested in politics  personally.  I -- I'm interested in the process.  I always have been.  I --  and first of all, let me say, I think the system is broken.  I think the  whole system of campaign finance is broken.  And I would love a law that  says I can't write any checks.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  Well, the...</p><p>CHANOS:  But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- Supreme Court has basically...</p><p>CHANOS:  Has gone towy.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- you could write, Jim Chanos...</p><p>CHANOS:  It's free speech.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- who wants more than a couple of bucks, write...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- write all the money you want (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  I think -- and I think that that -- that while that may  be a constitutional freedom, it's one we ought to reexamine, because it  raises agency risks and lots of issues of inequality.  But -- but we're not  here to discuss that.</p><p>The problem is is that if that's -- if that's the legality of the game  and -- and you feel strongly about -- about things politically, um, and you  want to support them, fine.  Uh, you know, I -- we pick our spots.</p><p>On the other hand, um, I think that -- that a -- that the country, you  know, actually needs people to be involved in politics.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And I think that -- that it's not about access or influence,  it's about, in our case, because we never asked for anything...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, stop a second.  When you say you never ask for  something, you want to influence the process a little bit, then you -- you  derailed the question I was about to ask you, because you said you never  ask for something, which was what would you like to see changed?</p><p>What area...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- of policy...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, for example...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- could you move on the needle on?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- well, for example, I -- I've publicly said I -- I think  that carried interest should be raised.  The tax on carried interest should  be raised.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So this -- this is the advantage that private equity and  hedge fund managers have...</p><p>CHANOS:  On long-term cap -- gain allocations and performance fees  being treated as long-term capital gains.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So they're -- they're taxed at -- it used to be 15 percent,  now it's 23...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, whatever.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- or so.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But it sure as hell ain't for -- the joke that Warren  Buffett says as he pays a lower tax rate...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- than his secretary.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And I -- and I think a lot of these -- so -- so I  would, you know, you would argue...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So why hasn't that been changed?</p><p>You would think that's the -- the most egregious stroke of the pen  thing to change?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, you'll have to ask the people that don't want to change  it.  I don't know.  The -- the -- there are a lot of issues that are out  there like that that I think you would be kind of surprised as a Wall  Streeter that I support, but I -- that are counterintuitive.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Give me -- give me another one.  Let's -- let's...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You're -- you're one of these -- I can just hear Bill  O'Reilly saying...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- you're one of these limbers -- limer -- limousine  liberals who really feels guilty about having money.</p><p>CHANOS:  You know, I don't feel guilty at all about having money.  I - - trust me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  I -- I feel blessed and -- and I know I'm fortunate.  And --  and not at all.  And the -- but I do think the level of discourse in this  country needs to be reopened.  And I think we -- we've -- we've put both  parties in this -- this sort of truly bipolar area there where no one wants  to meet in the middle anymore.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  A lot due to campaign finance reasons and -- and the  primaries.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's the underlying problem that, you know, the old joke  is that Reagan and Tip O'Neill would argue all day, they'd go out at night,  have a beer and the next morning there would be legislation signed.  That  sort of cross-pollination...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, look, apparently that story was a bit apocryphal.   Apparent, there wasn't -- it wasn't that simple with those two.</p><p>But -- but I know what you mean...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But they did get -- they did get...</p><p>CHANOS:  I know what you mean.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- they did get -- meet in the middle.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Well, what...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They did get things accomplished.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- well, what's changed is the Senate, really, if you know  Washington, in that -- that the House has always been pretty -- a pretty  bipartisan place and -- and it's always been pretty raucous in terms of  hardened attitudes and -- and -- and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, that's -- do you mean a partisan there's that...</p><p>CHANOS:  It's much more partisan.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- the Senasin -- the Senate is bipartisan and the House  was partisan.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, the Senate -- the Senate, until about 20 or 30 years  ago, was a place in which people crossed party lines all the time and voted  their conscience and voted the way they really felt on the issues and  weren't penalized for it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and -- and so senators really were that -- that upper  house that said, OK, we -- we're a little bit older, a little bit more  experienced, we're -- we -- we -- more confident of our reelection or our  tenure and if -- if I want to vote on civil rights even though I'm -- I'm a  hard -- I'm in the Republican Party, I -- I do.  And that happened.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  But now the Senate is just as fractious as the House.  And --  and senators worry about reelection or getting very liberal or very  conservative challengers.  Again, part of it's the campaign finance issue,  part of it's the -- the redistricting of -- for the representatives.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Gerrymandering, as well.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so -- so the -- the whole idea that there was an upper  house that was sort of, you know...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  The adult supervision.</p><p>CHANOS:  The adults, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  The adults that were getting policy done is -- is changed, as  well.  And so it's added to the acrimony.  It's added to the gridlock.  And  -- and I think it's just added -- it's -- it's not put us in a good place.   And I think that that's -- and I've supported Republican candidates that I  think are moderates, as well, so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  How -- how do we fix this?</p><p>How do we repair...</p><p>CHANOS:  I think you...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- campaign finance?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I think you have to start, you know, with some sort of  reform.  And I think, you know, unfortunately, a family member who is --  who has been in politics also pointed this out correctly, you also have to  do something about term limits, because other -- if you do have campaign  finance limits, term limit -- anybody with an incumbency becomes more  important.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so you have a do I -- you have an advantage being an  incumbent...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Ninety-nine percent or 98 percent reelection rate...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  So...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- in the House.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- so I mean we -- that -- that -- it's -- it's a tricky  issue.  But just throwing more and more unlimited amounts of money, I  think, doesn't help the issue.  It makes -- I think it makes it worse.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And what do you do -- so, in other words, you have a system  that's broken, nobody from either party is going to -- willing to work with  the other party...</p><p>CHANOS:  But nobody can turn the money down (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And at the same time the Supreme Court...</p><p>CHANOS:  It's an arms race.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- is -- has -- has basically lit that fuse and said go for  it then...</p><p>CHANOS:  And it's an arms race.  So therefore, I mean you can't -- if  you don't spend, you're not going to have an equal chance -- seat at the  table.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so it's just...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You have no choice, you have to.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- it's just this vicious cycle.  And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So how do you break that?</p><p>How do you...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, as I say, I'd leave it up to the politicians and the  legal scholars, but at some point, you're going to need a piece of  legislation or a constitutional amendment or something that -- that's going  to have to change this system.  And I -- I don't know -- I don't know any  other way around it.  If you have a Supreme Court that keeps saying this is  an a -- the legislation is unconstitutional, then you're going to have to  change the \"Constitution.\"</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  And -- and that's a challenge.  That's quite a  challenge...</p><p>CHANOS:  It's a big challenge.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- to get that done.  It probably has to get a lot worse  before it gets better.</p><p>CHANOS:  You know, that's a scary thought.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Let -- let me tack policy to one other place, because we  spent this whole afternoon chatting and China has never come up.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.  Where's that?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And you, very famously, um, identified, I want to say four  years ago, is that -- is that right?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, it was the end of '09, early 2010.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Basically said China is a -- a big house of cards, building  these ghost cities, they're spending all this policy money, they're not  that good at it.  Their economy has been so robust that it's covered up a  lot of these credit errors.</p><p>What do you think is going on with China today?</p><p>By the way, China's stock market today at a four or a six week high,  but it's shellacked over that period.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It's down 40 percent.  China, while the rest of the world  has rallied substantially, has gone the exact opposite way.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Almost cut in half.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, people have always ask -- still ask us, well, what do  you think, you know, when are you going to be right?</p><p>You've been early.  And I keep saying if you look at the Chinese  market...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It's got -- China has gotten crushed over the past few  years.</p><p>CHANOS:  It's the -- it was the best place to be short in the last  four years.</p><p>Um, look, everything that we saw in China, at -- at the end of '09 and  2010 is basically now twice as bad.  That's kind of the way I put it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It hasn't gotten better.</p><p>CHANOS:  It -- it's gotten worse.  The -- the debt to GDP has gone  from over 100 percent of GDP to over 200 percent.  Back in -- in '09, there  was 5.6 billion square meters of high rises under development and  (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  5.6 billion?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- 6 billion square meters.  That's 60...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Uh-huh.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- billion square feet.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Wow!</p><p>CHANOS:  Now, the number is twice that.  It's 10.6 billion square --  square meters under development at the end of 2013.</p><p>So everything that we saw then that was bad, and I think it -- it was  bad, is, in effect, twice as bad now.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Don't they have...</p><p>CHANOS:  When we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- hundreds of millions of people to move off the farm?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, the problem is, is the hundreds of millions of people  can't afford the stuff that they're -- that's being built.  They're  building high end condos, uh, shopping malls, high speed rail.  It's only  the -- the top 5 percent of people in China that can afford that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And that's the -- that's the -- the sort of paradox here.   I'll give you just an idea of -- of what's changed in four years.  When we  started looking at China, the Chinese GDP in dollar terms was about $7  trillion US.  And the total...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Not too shabby.</p><p>CHANOS:  Not -- and the to -- total amount of bank -- assets in the  banking system in China was $9 trillion.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  OK.</p><p>CHANOS:  So it was a little bit over 100 percent.</p><p>Now, the GDP is about $9 trillion and the total assets in the Chinese  banking system are about $24 trillion.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Wow!</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, a meaningful difference.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And that's a...</p><p>CHANOS:  So they've had to employ...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- that's a lot of...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- they've had to employ more and more debt to get the  growth.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I was going to say, this isn't capital, this is...</p><p>CHANOS:  This is the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- credit.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- total assets, total assets.  It's just basically a proxy  for -- for credit outstanding.  And so increasingly, they've had to employ  more and more debt to -- to drive their growth.  And -- and -- and that's  because the model is based on 50 percent investment to GDP.</p><p>So if you think about that, that means that -- that if they -- if it  takes them two years to finish a project, that means that one quarter of  your GDP every year rolls off and has to be replaced with a -- digging a  new hole in the ground somewhere.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well -- well, that's while they were at 12 percent GDP  growth four years ago and -- and the most recent data is closer to 6.5, 7  percent.</p><p>CHANOS:  Seven, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Yes.</p><p>CHANOS:  It is, because it -- and -- and so the soft...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And by the way, we would kill for 7 percent GDP.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, well, the 7 percent is a little misleading, too, though,  because, again, 7 percent, the consumer is still declining per GDP.  So the  7 percent is only really coming from -- from the fact that they're still  building stuff.  And -- and now, it's beyond a shadow of a doubt, even --  even Chinese officials or died in the wool bulls will tell you, they've got  to change that, they've got to reform this.  And they've got to get away  from this investment-driven model.</p><p>The question is, how?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  How and what do they replace it with?</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You know, the -- the key -- the fascinating thing about  China, or let me flip that around, the interesting thing about U.S.  manufacturing, we started seeing signs of this about five years ago, be  fracking blew up, before natural gas was everywhere.  But natural gas  prices had dropped and we were hearing about companies relocating in the  U.S., setting up a natural gas electrical generator.  One of the big  complaints you hear about China is a lack of consistent electrical  availability.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Not only 24-7, but a consistent amperage and wattage...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, peak -- peak usage.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and it fluctuates and...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and you have to set up a series of electronics just to  get a steady whatever it is, 120 and 60.  So in the U.S., you run a natural  gas pipeline near a factory, you set up an electrical code generation  plant, you're effectively getting unlimited, very low cost energy and you  don't have to take three weeks to ship your product to the States.</p><p>And that's...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- started as a -- as labor prices started to go up...</p><p>CHANOS:  And Chinese wages have gone up, too.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- what happens when wages go from $1 a day to -- to $25 a  day?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, that's -- that's what's happened.  In fact, net -- net  exports in China, when I first started looking at China, net exports were  12 percent of GDP, exports minus imports.  Now, it's almost down to 0.   Now, it's a couple percent.</p><p>And so -- so the impact that China, as an exporting engine, is already  diminished on their GDP.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's amazing.</p><p>CHANOS:  And they've offset it now -- they've offset it with more and  more investment.  So the story in China is not export anymore, the story in  China is this giant building project, the property building.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Can -- can you grow a middle class in a -- a country that  size and use that the way the U.S. post-World War II -- you know, we had a  50 year run after World War II, where the middle class boomed like never  before.  And it was a period of tremendous economic growth.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.  But we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Can China do that?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, we were already past the middle income trap at that  point, though.  We -- we passed that in the -- the late 19th, early 20th  century.</p><p>I mean China is still facing that.  And -- and how do you get people  from the sort of $5,000 to $7,000 per capita...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- income level to -- to $30,000 or plus?</p><p>And -- and that's always the tricky point in -- in economic  development is -- is the, you know, basically, there's four phases of  economic development, Barry.  You've got, basically, you educate the  population from illiteracy to secondary school education.</p><p>Second, you move people from rural areas to urban.</p><p>Third, you employ capital where it never -- capital has never been  employed.  That's where we are in China right now.</p><p>And the fourth and the way that South Korea and Japan and post-war  Germany, post-war is you finally begin to innovate and make products that  the rest of the world wants and be more productive.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And that's the tricky part.  And that's where most countries  can't surmount.  They get to the third point, but they can't get to the  fourth point, where they become truly innovative and -- and -- and it --  the Asian tigers all fell by the wayside, for example, in the mid-'90s...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- with the exception of South Korea and -- and Singapore.   The rest all -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, basically...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Vietnam...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- stalled out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Um, that's where we are with China right now.</p><p>The three countries post-World War II were Japan, Germany and the  Soviet Union.  They all were pretty much destroyed by the war.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Uh-huh.</p><p>CHANOS:  They had to rebuild.  They had to start from scratch.  You  know, they already had educated workforces.  They already had urban  centers.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  But they had to basically put capital to work again, which  they did.  And Germany, in the '60s and Japan in the '70s began to innovate  and produce world-class products that everybody wanted.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  For sure.</p><p>CHANOS:  The Soviet Union didn't.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And China, the question is, will China ever be able to do - - be more than just a -- a high end...</p><p>CHANOS:  A manufacturing base.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- that's it.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and the -- and/or employ capital in a non-impressive  way to build empty buildings and condos and things like that.  And that's  what they're doing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So the quote you had about China, I'll -- I'm curious if  you still think this is true.  \"The Chinese banking system is built on  quicksand.\"</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  It's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Is it still true?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I just think it's -- it's more true than ever, um, in --  in that there's just -- the bad loans are there.  There's legacy bad loans  they didn't address from even 10 years ago.  Um, they are telling you with  a straight face that non-performing loans are, you know, less than 1  percent.  Um, and -- and yet, you just see the madness of some of these  projects and the fact that defaults are starting now left, right and center  and they'll look at you with a straight face and say, oh, no, no, our non- performing loans are not a problem.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So I can sit here and continue speaking to you for a couple  more hours.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But I know your assistant will kill me if I keep you here  past 4:00.  So I -- I just wanted to end on one last question.  And before  I forget, I want to thank you  for being so generous with your time.  I  know people are going to find this a fascinating conversation.</p><p>The -- the last question I want to ask you is really general and open- ended.  Um, the industry of Wall Street, finance, investment banking,  investing has changed dramatically over the past 30 years and especially  over the past five years.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  What do you see happening in this industry going forward?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I -- I kind of would like to think we're seeing our  limits on it, because -- and it's always -- it's always a little bit  hypocritical to talk -- talk, you know, negatively about what you do for a  living, but I think that -- that the nature of finance, in and of itself,  as a profit center or a big part of the economy is sort of self-defeating.</p><p>And -- and I think that we've gotten kind of to the limits, I suspect,  of where finance can go to push the U.S. economy.  I mean I think it hit  its peak in '06-'07, uh, in terms of finance as a percent of corporate  profits and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  The argument is -- that I've made is the bailouts prevented  that process of...</p><p>CHANOS:  You know, clearing...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- converting back to...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- of clearing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Yes.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- the market clearing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Yes.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, and I would agree with you on that.  And I read, you  know, I remember at the time you were writing that and you were right.  And  I agree with it.  And I think that -- that unfortunately, finance becoming  a big part of the economy in terms of taking deposits, making loans, all of  that stuff, puts it in this too big to fail category broadly speaking,  where -- where ironically enough, it cannot be subject to the -- the -- the  whims of capitalism itself, creative destruction, because it would just be  systemic.</p><p>And so we -- we build this monstrous Rube Goldberg like contraption  that is completely ludicrous and then say we can't let it fall apart...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- because it will impact everything else.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- so too big to fail, too much leverage, too little  capital...</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and yet not subject to the laws of capital.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, let's leave it at this.  If we look at those -- those  dark days of '08 and '09, the one industry that actually went through  bankruptcy was the auto industry.  And I always chide my friends in White - - at the White House and -- who say, oh, well, the auto bailout was smart.</p><p>And I keep saying, you know, no, it wasn't an auto bailout.  I was  short the -- the auto stocks.  Shareholders were wiped out...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- the boards were -- were dismissed.  The executives were  fired.  They brought in new teams, they recapitalized the companies, the  government put in debtor in possession financing...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- which was post-bankruptcy.  Now, we can argue about the  unions' role in that, that employees were given seniority.  But in many  bankruptcies, in...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's typical.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- employees are...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's not atypical.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- given preference.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and, in fact, we did exactly what capitalism should  have said we did, we recapped the industry and we made it more viable going  forward.</p><p>The people who took risks in the past, you know, paid the price.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  That's exactly right.</p><p>CHANOS:  But it worked.  It actually worked better, I think, than what  we've had in finance coming out of this, which was...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, we had -- we had a Treasury secretary that was from  finance.  And so industry gets bankruptcy, finance gets bailouts.  If it  was reversed, if you had the head of a railroad or a head of a  manufacturing plant, I can't guarantee you that GM and Chrysler would have  been put through bankruptcy, but I can guarantee you that Citi and Bank of  America and Merrill and Morgan would have been treated the way financiers  treated manufacturers.</p><p>CHANOS:  But then we might not have had this beautiful new Bloomberg  headquarters.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Uh, I think this predates it.  This was up long before  that.</p><p>CHANOS:  I know it was.  I'm just kidding.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So -- so listen, you know, the counter-argument, and this - - this is me talking literally in my book, the counter-argument is if you  take -- my example is Bank America...</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- Merrill Lynch, Countrywide, that giant...</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- horrific blasphemy of a company...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- if you would have put them into bankruptcy, you spin out  Merrill as a free-standing, clean balance sheet investment firm.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- you spin out Bank America as a clean balance...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- money center bank.  You spin out Countrywide as a  mortgage underwriter.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You take all the bad paper -- I -- I'm fond of saying no  such thing as toxic assets, only toxic prices.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You sell all that crap that's dragging down their balance  sheet all these years...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- at 15, 20 cents on the dollar...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- someone's a buyer of that...</p><p>CHANOS:  Of course.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and you also end up clearing all those home prices  instead of having private equity come in and try and flip them, these home  prices plummet and first time home buyers are buying houses at a reasonable  price.</p><p>CHANOS:  If you had wiped out the equity of these institutions, what,  you know, to the -- 80 percent...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- subordinated that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Sixty percent on the mezzanine debt, 50 percent on other debt  and the depositors were whole...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I think not only would that have helped the whole process,  it would have -- it would have meant that people learned the lessons going  forward.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  The -- the moral hazard gets avoided and we, in our  economic recovery in 2014 would be...</p><p>CHANOS:  Correct.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- years ahead of where we are (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS:  And the depositors understood that they -- the ones taking no  risk were protected by the government...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- as they should be.  But the more risk you took, the more  at risk you were at, I undoubtedly think the system would be far healthier  today than it is.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It's -- it's called risk for a reason.</p><p>CHANOS:  And I've got it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Jim, thank you so much for your time.</p><p>CHANOS:  Barry, thank you.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  This has been absolutely fascinating.</p><p>You've been listening to Master of Finance series.</p><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p>This is Bloomberg Radio and we've been speaking to Jim Chanos of  Kynikos Associates.</p><p>Thanks so much for coming in, Jim.</p><p>CHANOS:  My pleasure.</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  You're listening to Masters In Business with Barry  Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.  </p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

This is Barry Ritholtz and this week I am thrilled to have sat down with Jim Chanos, hedge fund manager at Kynikos Associates for a very interesting and in-depth conversation; after we were done recording the radio portion, Jim sat around and we kept the tape running. And there's a ton of podcast extras. So after the show is done, be sure and listen to the rest of it. I think it's about 14 hours. And it's really -- anytime you get the chance to sit at the knee of somebody like Jim Chanos and ask questions and see where they go, you don't want to stop the tape running. He spoke for a long time and it was absolutely fascinating.</p><p>I don't know how many of you who are listening to this know Jim Chanos or are familiar with his work. But really it's a fascinating legacy. This is a guy who was an early short seller, who was an early critic of some of the worst excesses of Wall Street, whether it was misbehavior of analysts or accounting fraud or things that companies were doing, that were defrauding and misleading investors.</p><p>Jim has the combination of a accountant's ability to dive into the numbers and detective's ability to sniff out nonsense. And he has done it throughout his whole career. He's identified a number of tremendous frauds and scams, whether it was Baldwin Piano, which ran an insurance scam on the side, Enron WorldCom, go down the whole list. He has really been crucial to investors in ferreting out fraud and using his skill set to make money for his investors by basically identifying short selling opportunities where there's some bad behavior, fraud, whatever it is.</p><p>So this is a wide-ranging and fascinating conversation that I was thrilled to have. Be sure and check out the podcast extras afterwards. And on with the show.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Today I am thrilled to bring you someone who you may not know who he is, but you actually should. His name is Jim Chanos. He is the manager of -- let me see if I'm pronouncing this correctly -- Kynikos Associates. That's Greek for \"cynic.\" And Jim has built a reputation over 30 years as a spotter of wrongdoing and fraud, a short seller, somebody who's identified a lot of problems with various companies in the market.</p><p>Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p>JAMES CHANOS, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, KYNIKOS ASSOCIATES: Thanks, Barry. Glad to be here.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So I've wanted to have you on for a long time because most of the people we speak to are long-term, mostly long only investors, who are looking at here's what you need to do to save money for retirement, or if you're a pension fund or an endowment, here's what you do -- need to do to make sure you stay ahead of inflation.</p><p>But your approach as a short seller is completely different.</p><p>Why don't you describe that so people have an idea of what you actually do in Kynikos Associates?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, one way to describe it, Barry, is that we are a long-term potential purchasers of equities.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I like that.</p><p>CHANOS: The whole idea of fundamental short selling really is select a portfolio of securities, mostly stocks, that are fundamentally overvalued no matter what the market does. that these are companies that, through the normal ebbs and flows of capitalism, are on the downside of their cycle.</p><p>And our clients, primarily, are institutions who use us as a hedge to their core equity portfolio. And so therefore it allows them to be a little bit more aggressive in their equity exposures, knowing that they have part of the portfolio in a small group of companies that will go down over time -- we hope and we think --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You expect. So the people who are listening to this, who are in the industry, certainly know who you are. But regular investors, radio listeners may not know who you are.</p><p>So let me discuss your curriculum vitae for a second. You first came into the public eye as an analyst at -- was it Gilford (ph) Securities way back when?</p><p>And you had identified one of Wall Street's favorite stocks, which at the time was an insurance company called Baldwin and you had essentially figured out that it was a sham. It was a giant insurance scam that was cooking their books -- this is a theme we'll come to again and again -- and people mocked the call, \"The Wall Street Journal\" had a pretty aggressive articulate that pretty much trashed your analysis and ultimately you had the last laugh, because it's almost quaint to say at the time, when Baldwin went bankrupt, at $9 billion, it was the largest bankruptcy in history, although we know, oh, $9 billion, that's adorable compared to what we've seen since then.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, back then it wasn't so adorable.</p><p>Well, Baldwin was -- Baldwin United was the old Baldwin Piano Company, which had morphed under very charismatic CEO into an aggressive seller of insurance products, particularly annuities, through Wall Street.</p><p>And therefore it became a Wall Street darling in the early '80s on the back of not only the rapid earnings growth, but also because Wall Street was being paid by Baldwin.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Five percent commission on a policy --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that buys a lot of goodwill on the street --</p><p>CHANOS: Well, it does. And particularly when you're offering yields on these insurance products that were as high as 14 percent. The problem was Baldwin wasn't earning anything close to that in its insurance portfolios. So they ultimately had to begin doing acquisitions and getting insurance department approval to fund those acquisitions with insurance company money, which is highly, highly unusual.</p><p>And that was the beginning of the end for them.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you were a kid then.</p><p>How old were you when you made that call?</p><p>CHANOS: I wrote -- my sense of timing was impeccable. I put out my first solo recommendation on the company on the absolute bottom of the market, the day that Henry Kaufman (ph) said buys stocks in August of 1982. I think it was August 17th of 1982.</p><p>I said sell the -- or sell this thing short. And --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: About 25 bucks, is that about right?</p><p>CHANOS: I think it was about $25. It went briefly to $20 and then straight to $55.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Doubled.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, it was a good -- it was a good initiation into fundamental short selling. But the interesting thing about that story was we -- first report when we did a follow-up report was that a lot of the radioactive aspect of Baldwin was hiding in plain sight. It was -- it was -- you could see it if you looked at the publicly available documents the SEC filings and their insurance company statements, which were public.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So here's the question you're going to hear me ask you repeatedly this afternoon.</p><p>How is it that this was in plain view, a $9 billion fraud, and nobody else could spot it?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, first of all, it wasn't in a lot of people's interest to spot it because the analysts who were covering the company most closely and had buy ratings on this thing were also working for the firms that sold the annuities. So it was also a good introduction to the whole concept of conflict of interest.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: To say the least.</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>And number two, you had to do a little bit of digging. And I think in many ways, not being insurance analysts, just being a young analyst who was learning about insurance, I just simply kept asking questions of things that didn't seem to make sense to me. And most of the answers had -- were logical but every once in a while, it would come back with something that was just simply nonsensical.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That sounds very familiar. That reminds me a little bit of what took place so in the future with Enron.</p><p>So this was '82. Most people probably this never entered their radar.</p><p>But Enron, on the other hand, entered a lot of people's radar and in fact that's probably how anyone who's a member of the public or the investing community who knows you probably found you through Enron, which is a remarkably similar story.</p><p>CHANOS: It was. And in what would seem even more interesting about it was that not only were the facts at Enron hiding in plain sight -- there's been a lot written about that -- but Enron, using their mark-to- model accounting, where they pulled forward future profit estimates, Baldwin was doing the same exact thing with its annuities. They were estimating a spread of income -- which they weren't earning, of course --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Which may or may not have existed, depending on future --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- and then they -- and then they estimate how long the policies would stay on the books and they took the present value and they sold the policy. And so --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right, not accounting for the fact that interest rates fluctuate and other factors --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they were writing this down as if it was money good.</p><p>CHANOS: Right, exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Coming up, we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, manager of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. And today I'm speaking to famed short seller Jim Chanos.</p><p>We were talking a little bit about how Enron was so similar to Baldwin. And you had mentioned, you read the 10(k), you read the annual report, you read the quarterly report three times. You still have no idea what they hell they do.</p><p>CHANOS: Right. The other -- the other interesting similarity was they both had charismatic leaders, who were very bright; Baldwin had a guy by the name of Morley Thompson (ph) and -- who went from literally peddling pianos door-to-door. (INAUDIBLE) good salesmen to sell pianos door-to- door.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And strong (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>CHANOS: And morphing into financial services and of course Enron had Jeff Skilling (ph) and to a lesser extent Ken Lay.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And so when we first started looking at Enron, Enron decided to make a market in everything from energy trading to you name it, they were going to take everything, turn it into a tradable commodity, whether or not it should be is a whole different discussion.</p><p>What was the first warning sign that you saw with Enron?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, it's actually -- it was a column written by John Wilde (ph). He wrote a piece in the Texas \"Wall Street Journal\" in the fall of 2000, where he pointed out that energy merchant banks had just gotten a favorable ruling from the SEC on this mark-to-model accounting. So much for the Baldwin type stuff.</p><p>And a friend of mine running a hedge fund in Dallas, Texas, called it to my attention. And of course email was rudimentary; he faxed it to me. And I read the piece and immediately --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: '97, '98 --</p><p>CHANOS: -- this was in 2000 --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- far along.</p><p>CHANOS: -- and immediate cracked the 1999 10(k) and March and June 10(q)s of Enron and immediately began to see all kinds of odd things. In addition we noticed right away that not only was there a lot of insider selling throughout 2000 in Enron stock, but there were a number of key high-level executive departures. And that's -- those two -- those two in conjunction, often there will be insider selling to start.</p><p>But when you see insider selling across the executive suite as well as executive departures, there's usually something wrong.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes. That's quite fascinating. And so you start digging in and what's the - -you begin working with Bethany McLean, then of -- still of \"Fortune.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- ultimately end up writing the book, \"Smartest Guys in the Room,\" and what were the next couple of things that you uncovered in digging into Enron?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the -- I had to -- two -- my partner at the time, Doug Millett (ph) and an analyst who's now my current partner, Chuck Hobbs (ph), we -- the three of us dug into the financials. And one of the first things Doug pointed out was this is nothing more than a leveraged hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline, which I think was the -- still the best apt description of Enron.</p><p>But as we dug into the numbers, there were a few odd things right away. We noticed that even with their sort of odd accounting, the company was only earning 6 percent pretax on its capital. And --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: In a period when everybody's just making --</p><p>CHANOS: Right. And in which people are -- were paying five times book for this -- the stock. So --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: For a 6 percent ROI on --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- five times NAV for a hedge fund that was earning 6 percent? No, you wouldn't.</p><p>So that was the first thing.</p><p>Number two, I noticed immediately they weren't matching their -- in that -- there's an accounting principle called matching similar gains and losses. And they had a merchant banking arm that did things like sell energy barges or construct utility plants.</p><p>And when they had a gain, they would put it through the merchant banking operating income line. But it appeared to me that when they looked like they were going to lose money on something, they held it as a discontinued asset, held for sale for a year, and then put it below the operating income line so people disregarded it as an extraordinary event.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So they buried what should have been an ordinary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- should have matched everything as net, net profit. Instead they basically showed their winners and tried you to disregard the losers. That was another flag.</p><p>The third one is -- were these odd footnotes that said there was a group of entities set up by an executive of Enron to trade with Enron or an executive -- senior executive of the company was the general partner of the entities. And, I mean, that was an immediate red flag to, well, what were these entities and why is a --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, how can you be a counterparty with himself?</p><p>CHANOS: -- this person conflicted.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And we now know those were the famous raptors and LJMs and these off-balance sheet entities --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right, side pockets and -- I believe it was McKenzie (ph) who came up with some of the concepts for that, if not those exact ones, but that philosophical structure came from --</p><p>CHANOS: -- came from --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- from McKenzie, that's right.</p><p>So quite fascinating.</p><p>And now let's fast forward. So ultimately Enron collapses after having a huge run-up. it takes a year to fall from about 89 bucks, 83 bucks, if memory serves, down to zero. It was -- it was glacial; if you're short, you must be champing at the bit. That's something I want to talk to you about a little later.</p><p>The mindset of how do you stay short a position fundamentally when it's running up against you and even when it starts -- I remember Lehman Brothers, when we were short, Lehman, when we watched it collapse, every time it fell and looked like it was about to just freefall, there would be this squeeze. There would be this move back up.</p><p>In '07, '08, you were short most of that whole area. We're talking about investment banks, builders, commercial banks. What else were you short in the credit sector before the collapse?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we have a rule that we don't -- we don't short anybody we do business with. And since we did agency business most of the brokers, we were not short Lehman or Bear. We actually were prime broker, a client of Bear. But there certainly -- in the credit area, there was a lot of -- a lot of things to do.</p><p>I mean, the Florida homebuilders, West Coast homebuilders, building supply companies, the credit rating agencies, a number of banks that were pretty aggressive --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Bond insurance companies?</p><p>CHANOS: -- bond insurance companies, yes, yes. Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And (INAUDIBLE) around the same time.</p><p>CHANOS: NBIA.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: NBIA was the other one. They all freefell down to single digits.</p><p>CHANOS: And the -- you're exactly right. I mean, typically, stocks that are fundamentally flawed, where the equity is worthless, you will have a number of vicious rallies, often 50-60 percent.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Unbelievable. And you look at that and you say, who the hell is buying this junk? This is a stock cut in half that should be going to zero and yet you end up with the floor underneath these freefalling stocks and those squeezes are incredibly painful to live through, if -- especially if you're counting your money before you close that position.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we never do that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's always a bad thing to do.</p><p>CHANOS: But I would point out that one of the ways that you alleviate that a little bit is that people tend to think about the short side very discretely. And often because a lot of money managers who actually do short stocks may only be short a handful of stocks versus quite a few longs.</p><p>And in our -- in our case, it's a whole portfolio. I mean, in the U.S., typically historically over 30 years, we've averaged about 50 names in the portfolio at any given time.</p><p>So no one position is an unusually large amount --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: 3-4-5 percent, is that --</p><p>CHANOS: Well, 5 percent would be the top. But I mean, typically average is 2 percent.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Coming up, we delve into the mind of the short seller as we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, chairman of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. I am privileged to be speaking to a master of the short side, Jim Chanos.</p><p>Earlier we were talking about the short in Baldwin and Enron, as well as all the financials heading into '08. I recall reading a fabulous profile of you in \"New York\" magazine, the end of 2008, and I don't know if they were talking about a specific fund or generally but they were saying you were up 50 percent for the year in '08. I know you may not be able to comment on numbers. We all work with compliance and lawyers and what have you.</p><p>But '08 turned out to be a pretty good year for you.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, but the way we gauge ourself (sic), Barry, is actually versus the market and, in fact, although we have partnerships and offshore funds that you can invest in that are -- appear short and the numbers are what they are, the bulk of our business is our managed account business, where we're a large pension fund or endowment or sovereign wealth fund, gives us assets to manage short.</p><p>And in those cases, we're benchmarked versus the market inversely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So if the market goes up 10 percent, your benchmark is -10 percent?</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly. And so to the extent -- for example, if the market goes up 20 percent and we're flat for that account, you know, it's as if we were up 20 percent. And we're compensated in performance view on that.</p><p>Conversely, if the market goes down 40 percent and we're up 40 percent, we make no performance --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's flat.</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly. So it's a crude alpha measure. And that's really the way the firm has survived in a market that's up 2,000 percent, as you point out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Since 1985, since you launched the firm, and this is the fascinating thing about running a short firm when, by the way, a lot of your colleagues who are in that space haven't survived as long as you have.</p><p>So since you launched in '85, the S&amp;P 500 is up over 2,000 percent and yet you've managed to thrive as a short seller.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. We're up -- on a stand-alone basis, our flagship fund, which goes back to '85 -- I think is up a couple percent compounded. But when you factor that into the fact that -- offset it on the long side and rebalance monthly, the alpha is somewhere in the mid-teens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's fantastic.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's actually what -- that's how we get paid and that's how people evaluate us. And so --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You exist to create a hedge to institutions, pension funds, endowments, who, by definition, are, for the most part, long only.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the -- another way to think of it is we're an insurance policy that actually pays like premiums --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: As opposed to the not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- being upset when you --</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Exactly. And so I think that's -- I've quipped that Kynikos is, in effect, an insurance business. And it's not -- it's not, I think, an unreasonable analogy.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's talk. We have a few minutes left in the segment.</p><p>Let's talk about what it's like to be upside down in a position that's running against you.</p><p>Baldwin is a perfect example. You put this out at 25, drops to 20. You feel like a genius for five points. Next thing you know, it more than doubles, it almost triples from there.</p><p>How do you have the constitution -- like I know a lot of guys who can compartmentalize. I think I can compartmentalize. But the vast majority of investors, you know, the old joke is how did you sleep with the -- all your positions going against you? Like a baby. I woke up every two hours, cried for Mommy and wet myself.</p><p>A lot of people don't have that constitution to -- so how do you sleep at night with positions running against you?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, I think the -- it is -- it is personality based. I think -- I used to think when I started the business that shorting stocks fundamentally was just simply the mirror image of going long. And I've said publicly many times, I don't think that's the case anymore. I think a lot of it's rooted in behavioral finance. I think we're all by and large, we're listeners to this show and others are the product of positive reinforcement cycles.</p><p>And most people's rational decision-making studies have shown breaks down in an environment negative reinforcement. And if you're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in other words when positions going against you, their discipline goes away when they need it --</p><p>CHANOS: -- well, and the ultimate example, which will be something like an interrogation. And so the ability to withhold information. So if you're long in the market, you're constantly -- when I come in every day, we have 50 stocks in the U.S., another 40 globally, you know, I can pretty much be sure that 20 percent of my names will have a research note out, a buy recommendation, earnings estimates raised.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Something's moving.</p><p>CHANOS: The CEO and Bloomberg, whatever the case might be. And most of that is noise. But it's the noise that most people in the market are used to. And I call it the Muzak of the investment business.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I'm going to pull a quote I was saving for before, because it's so dead-on.</p><p>You called it \"the cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: And so most people -- as I say, they're used to that. But if you're a short seller or you're a negative -- on a situation, you're being told constantly you're wrong. And here's why. And you know, 50-page research report to follow.</p><p>And I think that not everyone has the ability to simply drown that out and say, OK. That's all well and good. But that's in the price of the stock. Do we know that? And the facts that I have are very important and the market doesn't really know that or appreciate how important they are.</p><p>So I'm not sure. I think the research is the same. And I think that good research can be taught both on long and short side and should be the same. I think the ability to deal with the noise, the swing factors, the volatility, I think that's a different attribute.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We continue our conversation with famed short seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates. And we'll discuss the role of the short seller in modern markets. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. I'm thrilled to be speaking with Jim Chanos -- am I pronouncing Kynikos -- is that -- correctly?</p><p>CHANOS: Oh, you're ready to go to Greece --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Kynikos associates, Kynikos, which translates as \"cynic.\" And you have spent a couple of cynical but lucrative decades on Wall Street, calling out the nonsense that passes for ordinary Wall Street noise.</p><p>Let's talk a little bit about the role of the short seller in markets. And here it is. It's five years past the financial crisis. People forget it wasn't the banks overleveraged and writing all this junk CDS and AIG writing the $3 trillion worth of derivatives with exactly $0 reserved for it. It was you short sellers that caused the crisis.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, sure was.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: How do you defend yourself for bringing the world to the edge of the abyss?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, you never --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And by the way, that was at the highest levels of -- we heard that from the ECB, we heard that crap from Treasury. We heard that from everywhere. And it was just despite Enron and WorldCom and a whole slew of fraud uncovered by short sellers, including Lehman Brothers.</p><p>How does anybody actually say that?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, you remember, Barry, right after Bear Stearns collapsed, a group of bankers who shall go nameless from New York, went down to Washington and sat with senators from New York and elsewhere and with Treasury Secretary Paulson, whatever. And they asked for two things. They didn't ask for forgiveness for their crazy lending and leveraging, they didn't ask for forbearance on capital levels, which they were going to need.</p><p>Instead they asked for a relaxation of the accounting rules, a mark- to-market. And they asked for a ban or curbs on short selling of their shares. And that, to us, was very telling, because it told you where their mindset was. It wasn't about what actually they had done on their balance sheets and they way they had accounted for them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Repo 103?</p><p>CHANOS: Oh, and all kinds of --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- fine, moving stuff off balance sheet each quarter, what harm --</p><p>CHANOS: -- 105 was the least of it. But I mean, just saying they were more worried about it being uncovered and/or having to mark things profitably or -- excuse me, properly. In fact, I mean, a year earlier than that, at a G7 meeting, I was asked, along with Paul Singer -- and this is public information --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is the spring of '07?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes and --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before anything --</p><p>CHANOS: -- in April of '07, we actually briefed the G7 at their Washington meetings on -- we were asked to give a talk about hedge funds and the risks of hedge funds. And Paul and I gave a presentation on the looming credit crisis. He did it on the structure of structured finance and how unstable it was. And I did it on bank balance sheets and how loaded to the gills international banks were with the stuff Paul had just talked about.</p><p>And it was met with, you know, some would say, at best polite applause or, at most, a stifled yawn.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Now did these guys actually get it? Or were you talking way over their -- ?</p><p>CHANOS: No, no, they got it. I mean, there were -- there were people from the Fed there. There were people, you know, Gordon Brown, the future U.K. prime minister was in the room. You know, a future Treasury Secretary was in the room, future ECB central banker was in the room. I mean, these were serious people and I think that --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, which future Treasury Secretary or serious people, I think, an argument can be made that that Venn diagram has very little lovelife.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we'll leave it -- let you make that statement. But I'm just saying that that again -- I mean, for people to say that nobody warned or could see this coming, and Gillian Tett, in her book, \"Fool's Gold,\" has a chapter on that meeting, which I think is worth the read. But --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And she was one of the people in the \"FT,\" pounding away about this long before Lehman and AIG collapsed. And it was -- you had to willfully look away if you didn't want to see --</p><p>CHANOS: Willful blindness, which is a concept I teach in my financial fraud history class, willful blindness is a very, very strong argument.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- up in New Haven, if memory --</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I teach at Yale SOM.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's great. That sounds like it must be a fascinating -- how do you find the kids these days?</p><p>CHANOS: I think they're -- well, mine aren't kids, because they're mostly students in their late 20s, but --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Those are kids.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: I -- it's a great class and I get as much out of it as I hope they do. It's a good group and we basically look at some models, historically, of fraud, academic models and then do case-by-case, going back to the 1690s. And it's remarkable as to how these cycles actually keep repeating with many of the same methods, just right up to date.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So who's uncovered more fraud? Various regulatory agencies? Or hedge funds and others who short? How do you -- what's that scorecard look like?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I'd like to say that virtually all major frauds over the past 20-30 years have really been uncovered by either internal whistleblowers, journalists and/or short sellers. Very, very few have been uncovered by regulatory agencies or law enforcement, very few.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And yet the first thing that happens in the crisis is -- first things we do, blame all the short sellers.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Well, that's -- a friend of mine named Bob Sloan wrote a great book about that, a history, called \"Blame the Shorts.\" And it has a long, long storied history also going back to the 1600s where people really will point fingers to those who have profited when -- when they've lost money. And -- and that's human nature, I think.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So now let's sidestep a little bit or -- or just change a little bit. We've been talking about accounting fraud. We haven't even gotten to the role of the accountants, but clearly, the -- the big four, big five -- I don't even know how many are left -- are major enablers of what takes place with -- with many of these, uh, shorts, but now let's -- let's focus on the C-suite and corporate management.</p><p>You recently put out a commentary about buy-backs as little more than financial engineering and speculation in the market by the CEOs of America, whose track record in dabbling in market timing is especially awful.</p><p>What -- what don't you like about buy-backs?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, first of all, in -- in aggregate, every CEO, of course, always thinks their stock is undervalued. We -- we -- we know that.</p><p>But what...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Except when they're selling.</p><p>CHANOS: -- what worries -- well, well, we'll get to that in a second.</p><p>But what worries me is that corporate America, in aggregate, has pre- tax returns on capital in the mid to high teens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: The long-term expected rate of the equity markets is roughly half that. And when corporations are embarked on massive buy-backs across all industries and all companies, in effect, these CEOs are buying the stock market.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Right?</p><p>So what they're telling you then is -- is unequivocally that they think that either they're happy to earn the stock market rate of return or maybe something hopefully better...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Which -- which is half what you would expect...</p><p>CHANOS: -- or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- their rate of return...</p><p>CHANOS: -- or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>CHANOS: -- their rate of return on the margin of any new capital product is much, much lower -- in fact, half or less, of what -- of what is stated. And that does not bode well for the -- the future of profits or for the quality of earnings reported as current profits.</p><p>There's one additional problem with this whole thing, and that is, number one, the CEOs making this decision typically have a very short tenure at companies.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: They're not thinking long-term.</p><p>And number two, we're seeing an increase in insider selling concurrent with the increase in buy-backs.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So out of one side of the mouth...</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They're saying the...</p><p>CHANOS: They...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- the companies should be buying stock...</p><p>CHANOS: But maybe I should be lightening up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- but I'm going to -- right. That's -- that's it. You know, my...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- my favorite data point on stock buy-backs is that Dell, now a private company, spent more money on buy-backs than they earned over their entire...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- lifetime. That -- that's just an astonishing figure.</p><p>CHANOS: And I think that -- well, I think you see that in companies like sears, as well. But -- but the -- for a lot of companies, the other problem with this, of course, is is that CEOs are terrible market timers.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: They're always buying back stu -- the previous peak in corporate buy-back activity was the second quarter of 2007.</p><p>And -- and where was the low?</p><p>The second quarter 2009.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You see the same thing with acquisitions and mergers.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They love to do...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: With inflated stock -- to buy inflated stock...</p><p>CHANOS: Corporate activity...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) stuff is cheap...</p><p>CHANOS: -- follows the market -- basically follows or is coincident with the market.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: It's not a leading indicator.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So we have buy-backs as financial engineering.</p><p>What about dividends?</p><p>A little more credible than?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, a little bit more credible and -- and I think certainly where -- any time you see the actual cash go out the door, um, the other interesting observation we've -- we've made in looking at corporate financial transactions is that increasingly, we're seeing acquisitions which are not taken out of most analysts' free cash flow numbers, acquisitions are replacing CAPEX, corporal -- capital spending or R&amp;D. So companies are buying their -- their R&amp;D or their -- their -- their capital. And that should probably be properly deducted from the free cash flow, because, in aggregate, corporate America is not growing.</p><p>So they're -- by buying each other, you know, and buying divisions of each other, in effect, they're -- they're capitalizing their R&amp;D. Um, and, I think that that's an interesting obser -- and that particularly applies for big tech...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- which are perceived as very cheap companies. If you actually look at them, the only reason their revenues aren't declining at a -- at a reasonable rate is because they're -- they're buying other companies.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We sort of stated these in the pharmaceutical area...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They quote a bunch of genomics, molecular, go down the list, as opposed to plowing money into their own R&amp;D...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- OK, let's go out and buy these new...</p><p>CHANOS: And, again...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: -- and rather than expensing the R&amp;D, they're capitalizing by purchasing. They can set it up as goodwill. And so it's overstating their earnings. And that -- that's a key point that we were trying to hone in on, that -- that companies that grow this way by acquisition are most likely overstating their earnings meaningfully.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And we've seen a ton of acquisitions, maybe not as much as at other peaks, but the M&amp;A activity, along with the IPO activity has certainly picked up fairly appreciably in the past couple of quarters.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, and the M&amp;A activity gives rise, we worry -- we're -- we think and worry, on a really drop in the quality of earnings. And -- and that, I think, drives a lot of M&amp;A activity, the ability to write down inventories, write down receivables, write up liabilities and basically give yourself, in effect, what -- what Herb Greenberg has called a cookie jar going forward to help manage your earnings.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I've been speaking with James Chanos, chairman of Kynikos Associates. You can listen to more of our conversation with Jim in our podcast extra, which is available on Bloomberg View, on SoundCloud and at Apple iTunes, as well as the Bloomberg Radio Plus App.</p><p>Coming up next week, we sit down with former FDIC Chairperson Sheila Bair, which is a really fascinating conversation.</p><p>Be sure and check out my daily column on bloombergview.com or follow me on Twitter @ritholtz. At my blog, I posted a whole bunch of unrelated but interesting items. That's ritholtz.com.</p><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p>You're listening to Masters In Business on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This concludes the broadcast portion of our interview.</p><p>Coming up with our guest, the radio podcast extra.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Today, I've been speaking with James Chanos of Kynikos Associates.</p><p>And we've been talking generally about short-selling and what it's like to run short funds.</p><p>What I love to do in these segments, when we finish broadcasting on the air and go to the podcast, is talk a little bit about you.</p><p>You started in this business as an analyst. We talked about Baldwin and eventually Enron. But when you were an up-and-comer, when you were the age of the kids you're teaching at Yale, who were your influences?</p><p>Who -- who are formative to the Jim Chanos approach to investment?</p><p>CHANOS: Um, you know, it's -- it's hard to find lots of people that you can point to who -- who did what I did. I mean I -- I was blessed when I was a young analyst at -- at Gilford Securities doing Baldwin that, um, we had a number of -- of well-known hedge fund managers who actually were our clients, people like Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, um, and I got to meet shortly after that when I moved to New York in '83, Julian Robertson. One of the people that probably had the most influence on me just passed away, uh, and that was -- it was sort of the legendary Bob Wilson...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: -- who was a -- was a -- not only a great investor, but a -- but an amazing philanthropist. And, uh, I used to have -- I used to have dinner with him or lunch with him from time to time. And he was a -- he had -- he was written up by John Train in \"The Money Masters.\" But he was of the legendary Resorts International short squeeze.</p><p>But he was a tremendous investor on the long side. And, um, he introduced me to people like Dick Gilder here in New York and -- all of whom early, 30 years ago, you know, I learned from another fellow, Stephen Peck, who was an amazing investor, a client of mine, a good friend, of Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh, sure.</p><p>CHANOS: And all these people were just sort of, you know, as I was getting going in New York, not only were they helpful in terms of their wisdom and their experience and what not to do and -- but also introduced me to lots of other people.</p><p>And -- and I think that that, you know, I'm indebted to all of them and -- and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few people.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you mentioned George Soros, clients early on.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And Julian Robertson, another legendary hedge fund manager.</p><p>CHANOS: And Mike -- Mike Steinhardt.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Steinhardt. Again, another guy, called by some the greatest trader on Wall Street ever. I don't know if that's an exaggeration, but people have said that about him.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean they -- it -- I had the -- the pleasure of running money for all three of those men. And -- and they all were different and a different temperament and -- and -- and I would categorize them completely different people, but all -- all amazing investors.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Hmmm. Interesting.</p><p>So you began as an analyst. You worked with some of the most storied names. Obviously, the industry has changed a lot since '83.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: A little bit.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: To think that a relatively unknown analyst at the time and a relatively small firm could get an audience with a Robertson or a Soros, that's not the sort of universe that we exist these days.</p><p>CHANOS: I think it would be a lot harder, I mean but -- but, first of all, people -- there weren't people putting out short-side research in -- in '80, even in '82 and '83 and -- and, uh, so, you know, I think the -- the Baldwin piece, a number of them were -- were short. A few of the people I just mentioned were short that. So it got me an audience with them early on, which I think was helpful.</p><p>But, um, I think it would be a lot tougher today. I mean I started my -- my own fund when I was 27.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p>CHANOS: And -- yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's 30 -- 30 plus years...</p><p>CHANOS: 1985, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And so that's almost exactly 30 years ago.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that -- that was just you and a partner and -- and how big is Kynikos today?</p><p>How many employees...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean we have, I think, 33 employees in -- in New York and London. And, uh, and obviously a little bit more sophisticated.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: It was just three of us, uh, at first and the two partners and a secretary. And my partner, a wonderful partner at the time who I brought with me from Deutsche Bank a year into it came to me and said, you know, I just don't think I -- I can do shorting stocks. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And -- and -- and sold his half back to me, um, for a - - for a nominal amount of money. Uh, and, you know, just walked out the door and prospered, by the way, mightily since doing his own thing.</p><p>So it -- it -- even when you think you can do it, sometimes you can't. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so you mentioned Deutsche Bank in -- in passing. If memory serves, they kind of showed you the door, didn't they?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Yes. In the summer of -- of '85, um, there was a full page -- a front page...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: \"Journal.\"..</p><p>CHANOS: -- monster article talking about these evil short sellers and -- and how they were disrupting these great businesses. Um, and in the middle of the article was -- was sort of -- was me. And a...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: -- and a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And this is even after Baldwin...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- had collapsed and...</p><p>CHANOS: And after a number of other calls we had made as well. And it, um, and so my -- my bosses in Frankfurt woke up that morning to see that, you know, Satan was working in their New York office. And I...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: -- I was told a -- I was told, by the end of the day, my contract, which was coming up, would not be renewed. I mean they didn't fire me, but they just simply said, you know, time for you to do something else.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Thanks. Thanks. Thanks, uh, here's your hat. Watch (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And then the postscript was I think nine of the 10 companies that were mentioned in that piece ultimately either went bankrupt or were prosecuted for fraud.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And any mea culpa from the right...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you know, obviously, you know someone is pulling the strings behind the scenes with that journalist and sends them down the wrong path.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean we were -- we were -- we were famously short a -- a lot of companies being run by a very aggressive investment bank out of Beverly Hills at the time. And I suspect that -- that that may or may not have had something to do with it.</p><p>Having said all that, (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Are we -- are we talking about Drexel or are we talking about somebody else?</p><p>CHANOS: No, we're talking about Drexel.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p>CHANOS: And a -- but -- but a -- one of the -- the, you know, serendipitous aspects was I had a client who had wanted me to run money for them as -- as a money manager, but because I was at a bank and it was...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You couldn't do it.</p><p>CHANOS: -- (INAUDIBLE) -- I couldn't do it. And so when I told them, yes, I was going to be looking for work, they said, well, why don't we set you up in business?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh.</p><p>CHANOS: So that's -- that's how -- that's how Kynikos Associates got started.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's unbelievable. I love stories like that.</p><p>You know, Ray Dalio has a similar story. You talk to a number of people, Jeff Gundlach, there are a lot of people who start in this business in one direction and, for whatever reason, end up making a turn and it's enormously successful.</p><p>CHANOS: I've often taught not only the -- the people who work for me, but my students that -- that's one of the things about business that you have to appreciate is that when good fortune, or bad fortune, comes your way, you have to know how to deal with it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And the bad fortune, you have to -- you have to rebound, you have to pick yourself up. But when good fortune comes, you have to grab it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and take advantage of it, because it will happen a number of times in your career just out of chance. And if you don't take advantage of it, you miss that chance to move your career ahead on -- in a quantum leap...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- and I think that I was fortunate, at the time, in that I was young, I was not quite married yet. I was about to get married, but I didn't have kids. And often I tell people the time to take risks, actually, is not after you're established in your career, when you have a wife and kids and a mortgage...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Too much to lose.</p><p>CHANOS: -- and -- and it's when you're younger and you're given an opportunity.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p>CHANOS: Because if it...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: What...</p><p>CHANOS: -- works, it's great. If it doesn't, no one is going to hold it against you.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And you have the ability...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You -- you lose a year or two. You can (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: You have an ability to get back up. And in -- particularly in America, which is an aspirational society, I think people, in many cases, even if it doesn't work, will admire that you tried.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: When -- when we speak to people from overseas, when we speak to people in Europe especially, one of the things we hear time and again, that they admire the most about America is failure isn't a fatal...</p><p>CHANOS: No.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- scarlet letter here. You know, henry Ford had five failed companies...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before Ford Motor Company. And the stories at Edison are legendary. He had hundreds of failed inventions before that light bulb finally...</p><p>CHANOS: As long as your work ethic...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: -- is good and -- and you're honest, people will value your ideas. And -- and -- and that is one of the great things about our society, that -- that I think sets us apart from almost any other developed economy. You fail in most other developed economies, you're done.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: That's it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: No second -- no second chapters elsewhere.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's not the case here at all.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So we talked about when you first launched. It was two guys and a secretary. Today, obviously, a much more sophisticated multinational entity. Take us through a -- a day in the life of Jim Chanos.</p><p>What time do you start work?</p><p>What -- what is your work flow like?</p><p>What do you do throughout the day?</p><p>I get the sense that you're not chained to Bloomberg all day watching every tick.</p><p>CHANOS: No, I'm not. I mean I have a trading desk that does that. But our -- our portfolio only turns over about once a year, so -- which is glacial by hedge funds.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Sure.</p><p>CHANOS: We're really investors. So I mean time spent looking at every tick is not time well spent for me. Looking at companies is more important for me.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: By -- by the way, that's a theme that's been pretty consistent. I can't begin to tell you how many investors we've spoken to who all pretty much say, if you -- if you have a good idea and a high degree of confidence, the day to day noise, that cacophony you mentioned...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- those fluctuations, it's meaningless noise and you have to have the con -- courage of your conviction.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean you need -- you need to have an intelligence post, as we do -- and I have a good one -- to -- to -- to point it all out to you. But you also need filters and you need to understand.</p><p>And one of the big differences, Barry, in the business now from when we started was back then, getting the information gave you a leg up.</p><p>So if you read the 10-Q because you got it a day or two before the rest of the Street and you saw something buried in -- in management's discussion, you had a piece of information that was, A, public, and, B, material. And it might move the stock and -- and there were lots of instances of that.</p><p>Um, nowadays, the information comes at you with a fire hose.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: I mean it truly does. And -- and the key is having, A, the right filters and the right staff and the right ability to -- to pull out what is the real information from just the absolute, you know, torrent of water coming at you. And -- and so that has changed a lot.</p><p>So I mean I -- I'll get up, you know, obviously, the older I get -- and you might appreciate this, you know, I might get a few -- up a few times at night anyway, but I'll get up, you know, early in the morning and check the markets and if nothing earth-shaking is happening in Asia or Europe and we have a desk that's 24-7, you know, I'll go back to sleep.</p><p>And then typically, you know, up -- up again early in the morning and then it's going through morning news, filings, research that comes in internally overnight, research that's come in externally overnight, um, you know, and -- and then the day may, depending on -- on my schedule, whatever.</p><p>But unfortunately, it's -- it's 24-7, you know, in a way that you know in that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I get the sense you read a lot throughout your day.</p><p>CHANOS: I read an awful lot whether I'm on the move or whatever, so, unfortunately, you know, you -- you have to stay connected. I'm trying to get to the point now where I am able to do it for Saturdays, but I'm trying to make Sundays a non-e-mail, non-electric -- non-electronic day, um, to just disconnect one day out of the week. I think that is becoming a little bit more important and a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's just a recharge day, just a...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, it's just a recharge day...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) it up a little bit.</p><p>CHANOS: And in the spring for eight weeks on -- in the afternoons on Monday, I teach. And that's been, actually, a -- a wonderful, wonderful adjunct to what I'm doing for all kinds of good reasons. And -- and -- and I think that's been a -- been -- been a wonderful plus. And my clients and partners have been very supportive of that -- of that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It -- it's just a change in the routine and it allows you to mix it up a little bit.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And it -- and it's great to interreact and go back to history, whether it's my history or history from 300 years ago, though sometimes it feels like I've lived 300 years.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Um, and -- and, impart, some of the stuff back to a -- back to students.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so you're teaching at Yale School of Management.</p><p>Am I recalling correctly, did you go undergrad to Yale?</p><p>CHANOS: I did. I did.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You did. OK.</p><p>CHANOS: I did, years ago.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you're back -- back in the dorms, effectively?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, well...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- not quite, but I -- I have two -- two sons who went, as well, and when I told them I was going back to teach and that maybe we could...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They were horrified.</p><p>CHANOS: -- live together in -- in like in a con...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: -- in a condo like back to school...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: They wouldn't even...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- they looked to me horrified until I told them I was kidding.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's hilarious.</p><p>Um, they're at a -- I'm assuming they're out of school or?</p><p>CHANOS: One is. One is still there.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And, um, that's pretty funny.</p><p>So every -- you've been doing this how many years now over the...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in the springs?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I got on the -- I'm on my fourth year of teaching.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh, that's great.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And a -- and a -- it's a lot, as I say, a lot of fun and it's one afternoon for two months in -- in the spring. And Yale has got a brand new business school, so I'll give a plug for that. And an amazing new dean and a -- Yale SOM is on the way up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We have Bob Shiller coming in in a few weeks...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, he's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- he's one of my favorite...</p><p>CHANOS: -- he's one of my -- he's certainly a tenured -- a tenured and Nobel Prize winner.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: He's at a different level.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: He -- he's really fascinating...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: I'm the low man on the totem pole in the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You -- you talk about -- but you talk about the psychology of investing in behavioral economics...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and how (INAUDIBLE). Here's a guy teaching in the same place you're teaching who's been one of the key drivers of that philosophy for a good couple of decades.</p><p>You -- you mentioned the far -- the fund launched in '85.</p><p>CHANOS: Um-hmm.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's 30 years ago.</p><p>CHANOS: Almost.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: How has the hedge fund industry changed in that ensuing period?</p><p>What -- what do you see as big differences?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean the growth, first of all. I mean it -- we had a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Enormous.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: We had a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Over $2 trillion now.</p><p>CHANOS: We started with $16 million in '85 and by -- by 19 -- the end of 19 -- early '91, we were over $600 million in assets. And that put us in the top 10 globally of hedge funds...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: -- of (INAUDIBLE). And -- and so that -- that tells you just how small the industry was back then. Um, the dramatic growth was -- was in the late '90s and early millennium.</p><p>But it was truly a small handful of people. Everybody kind of knew each other in the '80s. There were...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: A hundred hedge funds, 200 hedge funds?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, maybe no more than 100...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Now it's 10,000...</p><p>CHANOS: -- maybe...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- something like that?</p><p>CHANOS: Maybe more than 100 and probably practically, 20 or 30.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and -- and everybody knew everybody. I mean truly. And there weren't a lot of -- a lot of real different strategies. I mean everybody was pretty much in the equity markets, give or take.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Long, short?</p><p>CHANOS: Long, short, maybe...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- and that was kind of it. And then -- and, you know, you had guys like -- like -- like Mike Steinhardt spec -- and Soros speculating in bonds and currencies, um, but -- but it was, by and large, an equity driven model. And a -- and everybody was, at that point, was fairly adept, both on the long and short side.</p><p>Um, getting institutional investors was a big deal back then. That he didn't really started until the '90s.</p><p>So...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So in the '80s, your clients were essentially just high net worth individuals...</p><p>CHANOS: High net worth or foreign families because the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So family offices but no sovereign wealth funds yet?</p><p>CHANOS: Typically not. You would -- typically not U.S. fun -- families and no sovereign wealth funds. No endowments. By and large, no pension funds.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's amazing.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And everything has completely changed. Now it's...</p><p>CHANOS: Completely changed. All of it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- dominated by big institutions.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Ten thousand hedge funds, although, if you look at the -- the Bell Curve, that is -- that is not a normal Gaussian distribution. It's effectively those 100 hedge funds capturing 80 percent of the alpha and then a long tail of underperformance.</p><p>CHANOS: That's probably -- that's probably right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The -- the numbers are pretty -- when you look at the Tremont data and you look at some of the other hedge fund data that's out there, the funds that are earning their keep are few and far between.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean true alpha is -- is hard to come by, as we all know.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: For -- for sure. Well, the -- you know, it's like expansion in -- in professional sports teams, you go from 22 to 26 teams and suddenly there's that much talent -- less talent on any one team. It's spread around. And there's sort of a uniform mediocrity.</p><p>But a handful of all stars, you know, there's 100 funds out there that are just...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- stealing it.</p><p>CHANOS: -- the only difference is you can't start your own NBA team. You can start your own hedge fund.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Very easily.</p><p>CHANOS: That makes it worse.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: All -- all you have to do is talk someone into giving you X dollars...</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And it's not even -- there's not even a $100 million minimum. You could -- you know, the SEC regulates RIAs and others. If you have 100 plus, you don't have to do state by state. It's one regulatory scheme. So that's a bogey for a lot of -- you don't even have that on the hedge fund side. Anyone with a couple of million dollars can launch a hedge fund.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Although it is harder. I mean to -- in -- in -- the cost of doing business, of getting a real prime broker, I mean...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- (INAUDIBLE) now that I think have -- have, I think, taken that true start-up out of the -- the industry.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE), in fact, you sort of do need a -- a critical mass to be considered a -- a, you know, a -- at least viable.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So, obviously the industry has changed dramatically over the past couple of years. Let me -- let me throw some of my favorite quotes, um, of yours -- of yours back at you and see what your...</p><p>CHANOS: OK.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- reaction is. Let -- let's talk about timing. \"In investing, you could be really right but temporarily quite wrong.\" I love that line, because I started in the business as a trader and I -- it was always drilled into my head, hey, either you're right or wrong.</p><p>If -- if you think you're right and the market is going against you, you're wrong. But when you're doing fundamental shorting, you're basically -- our friend Doug Kass calls it variant perception. You're identifying what people aren't seeing, or seeing incorrectly...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you're going to be wrong for a long time, almost by identifying that variant perception. You're wrong for a while by definition...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, and there's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before people catch on.</p><p>CHANOS: -- there's -- there's a big difference. If you're trading a position, you know, sort of because of a fundamental view and your time frame has shortened enough, price tells you everything, almost.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right.</p><p>CHANOS: And in a fundamental short position, not only are you analyzing the company or -- or the -- whatever it is you're analyzing, but in many cases, you have a management team interposed that's actively working to -- to -- to prove you're wrong through activities that aren't necessarily kosher.</p><p>And so there's an added level here of -- of sort of three-dimensional chess when you're on the fundamental short side because the market won't necessarily immediately see what you see. And, in fact, often doesn't. And -- and that's why most fundamental short sellers will tell you, they're -- they're often early.</p><p>One additional problem, you have to borrow the shares.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so the ability to effect a short position in reasonable size for a firm like ours, once everything is clear, may not be given to you. And so there -- there are additional hurdles that don't exist in traditional investing that exist on the short side.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, we mentioned -- I mentioned Doug Kass earlier. One of the things he taught me early on, which I would have wish I had known when I was shorting Lehman, was that you could be short the stock and you're going to get squeezed. But if you really want to make a run for it, you marry a put to that and if you close the short position, you could let the put run. It's never going to get called for you. You're never going to get squeezed. You could -- you're paying up for the option, but it's a way to get, um, that juiced return, because the -- on the short side, the most you can make is 100 percent. With options...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, that's actually not true. But go ahead with it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, what -- well, let's discuss that, because that's a standard line against short-selling.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, that's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Look, you're shorting at 50, you can only go to zero, that's 100 percent.</p><p>Why is that wrong?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, because...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Because of leverage and?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, because the ability of -- of -- if you start with a short position at 100 and -- and with no other cash in your account and you short the stock and it goes down to 50, OK, you can, without adding any more cash -- capital to the account, short additional shares. And if it keeps going your way, you -- you can compound your return.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But then you're running the risk of -- of...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- a margin call, a squeeze...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, that's fine.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: But I just want to...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: I want to get the statement (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you can...</p><p>CHANOS: That you can't make more than 100 percent on initial capital. That's not true.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you can -- with -- if you're actually using the gain in, um, value, falling stock creates, if you're short, you're then pyramiding that on top and -- and shorting that with that additional effort.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, you're shorting on -- on -- you're compounding your profit, in effect.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. So number two, I've also (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: By the way, I've heard that 100,000 times. You're the first person who's corrected that.</p><p>CHANOS: So -- so the -- the -- the other problem, of course, is is that, you know, I've seen a lot more stocks go to zero than -- than infamy -- invidimy (ph).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: That -- and that's the -- that's the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: But the -- the key point for your listener, of course, is is that for what we do, and -- and theoretically, don't try this at home, kids, we have a portfolio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And a portfolio changes the volatility nature, like any portfolio will. There's going to be things that are always working and things that aren't working. And so, you know, I -- I think that a -- that really tells you that -- that a -- that doing this as a professional with a portfolio approach and watching your country risk, your industry risk and all those things makes much more sense.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So this leads -- you mentioned something earlier and I want to address that. You mentioned you have management actively working against you in a number of ways.</p><p>One of the things that you were very much in the forefront of was working with investigative journalists, working with the media to help uncover fraud.</p><p>How did that first come about?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I'm a -- you know, clear up a misconception here. I mean we don't call up or e-mail reporters and say, hey, you ought to be looking at Enron. And in the case of Enron, Bethany McLean was talking to my partner at the time and he said -- and she said, you know, what do you - - what's interesting?</p><p>And -- and -- and Douglas Millett, do you ever really talk to Jim about Enron?</p><p>And he -- we -- we're real excited about it. And we -- we really think there's something there.</p><p>So I mean that -- that often reporters find a way to fundamental short sellers to -- to ask them, hey, what do you -- what do you think of this or are you working on something?</p><p>And -- and I think that I'll -- I think there are ways to do that and -- and not compromise anybody.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: On the other hand, I think there are ways not to do that. And I think you have to be mindful of -- of that. And I think there's approaches.</p><p>Having said all that, I -- I'm a firm believer in the \"U.S. Constitution\" and -- and anybody has the right to their opinions of interest. But you're -- you do not have the right to your own facts.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And I think that that's an important point. But if you're a publicly traded company, you have to understand that the marketplace is going to be a marketplace of ideas and a marketplace of opinions, of...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We've -- we've seen some litigation against short sellers. We've seen some litigation against analysts.</p><p>What do you think of that sort of stuff?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, as I say, no one has the right to -- to trade on or -- or induce others to trade on information they know to be false. And that's kind of the -- the bright line that -- that -- that certainly most -- that all investors need to understand about securities fraud.</p><p>But -- but an awful lot of companies seem to, you know, be upset when people don't have the approved opinion about that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And, you know, that -- that is not actionable in our court system.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: One...</p><p>CHANOS: A...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- one would hope.</p><p>CHANOS: One would hope. One would hope. But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so one of the...</p><p>CHANOS: The federal courts, by the way, have a pretty strong view on that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And they've been on the right side of this, for the most part...</p><p>CHANOS: Usually it's people that bring these cases are in state courts of -- of, you know, varying venues or questionable venues to try to get state, you know, put this before a jury in a state.</p><p>Federal judges, by and large, look at these things and, for the most part, toss them out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's the right way to do it.</p><p>So you mentioned earlier about long versus short. There's a -- a longer quote I really like, which is, \"I used to think that good short sellers could be trained like long focused...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- value investors. It's the same skill set. You're tearing into the numbers. You're valuing businesses. You're assigning a consolidated value and hopefully you see something the market doesn't.\"</p><p>But you've since learned, quote, \"There's a big difference between a long-focused value investor and a good short seller. And you mentioned the differences -- psychology and behavioral finance.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And it...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's a great -- that's a fabulous quote.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and I think that -- and I think that -- that -- as I said, I've run money for a lot of great investors who have farmed out the short side to me. And I've seen that, actually, some of the best value investors who I've had the pleasure of doing business with are not particularly good short sellers. And -- and shouldn't be selling short for that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The wrong constitution.</p><p>CHANOS: They're just -- just the -- they'll obsess over very tiny positions that have gone against them, you know, that...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- you know, that -- that fear of the stock going to infinity that we discussed. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: By the way, that's the other false statement. You -- we've talked about a stock can only lose 100 percent. I've heard that well when you're short, your losses are theoretically infinite.</p><p>Well, not if you have a stop loss. Not if you have a line in the sand...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, there's in you...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that you cover...</p><p>CHANOS: -- there's an even better little argument...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: There -- there's no lock limit up when it comes to equities.</p><p>CHANOS: There's an even better little limit that no one talks about. If you're in a partnership and you're a limited partner, you can only lose what you put up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right. That -- that's your limitation.</p><p>CHANOS: Which is an argument for investing with short sellers that way.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Typically a hedge fund as opposed to...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. You know, or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hiding...</p><p>CHANOS: -- or buying shares in an offshore corporation. And -- and - - and that's something, you know, we point out to people, too, that -- that, actually, you can, in effect, get the same limited -- limited down side by doing it in that structure. And the general partner takes the risk, but the prime broker will sell you out long before that ever happens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. That's right.</p><p>CHANOS: So, again, these are -- these are -- these are...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Myths.</p><p>CHANOS: -- examples of thinking -- well, they're not myths. They're -- they're accurate on the face, but in practicality, they're inaccurate...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- because -- because, again, you structure things to -- to not let that happen, A, and -- and, B, you can actually get protection through the structure of -- of the investment vehicle or whatever, to obviate the -- obviate the -- those risks.</p><p>But having said all that, they do play into behavioral finance. And - - and I remember very famously, a well-known investor who's an incredibly - - he's got an incredible track record. I was running some money for him. And it was in the midst of our disastrous short on America Online in the -- in the late '90s. And I had...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: A little early.</p><p>CHANOS: -- I had -- I had a small short portfolio I was running for him. And -- and AOL was never more than half of 1 percent or 1 percent of our portfolio, because it was so volatile. But it just kept doubling and doubling and doubling.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And we thought it was an accounting fraud, which it turned out to be.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: And this investor called me repeatedly losing sleep at night and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Over a half a percent (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: -- and this one -- and this -- this position was not moving the needle on his performance at all.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: But he was -- he was -- I think, to the detriment of him working on other ideas. And a -- and it -- and -- and that was a real concrete example, to me, of just why it is that -- that certain people shouldn't do this, um, because it was bothering him.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They just lack the constitution. They can't...</p><p>CHANOS: Right. It...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they can't compartmentalize.</p><p>CHANOS: They didn't -- they didn't need to because he -- he was such a good investor doing what he did well. And so for that person, you know, they shouldn't be doing it. And -- and I think that it gets back to exactly what you -- you've -- you've emphasized here, the psychological is completely different.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's -- let's talk about noise, since we -- we've touched on psychological, this is related to it. \"I listen to the noise to make sure there's no new information. I need to know. But I don't worry about most of it.\"</p><p>And I -- I thought that was an interesting con -- concept, when -- when you discussed, relevant to this, analysts' reports, news, rumor mills, that's where the phrase, \"For a short seller, this is a cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I -- I love that quote.</p><p>So how do you deal with that noise?</p><p>Do you filter all of it or do you have a staff that says, hey, out of these 1,000 things, these four or five you should...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hear?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I mean first of all, if we're getting a piece of new material or information from a research report, my staff is not doing their job. Um, and -- because certainly, I want them reading the company filings and company press releases going to conferences, you know, and -- and I -- I hope they -- you know, our team is very good -- that -- that I'm reading it in an internal memo before I'm reading it in a -- in a Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch research piece a week later.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's usually the case 99 percent of the time.</p><p>Having said all that, you have to be mindful of what the Street is saying. You have to be mindful of what you're going up against. And I -- and I think that that's important. And one of the things we do is we do talk to the Street. We have them into our offices. If we have an unusual thesis or hypothesis on a company, we'll have the sell side in and to lay it out...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They're pitching you the other side of the equation?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, well, we know what they're pitching. I mean you know, it's not -- and one of the good asymmetries of the short side -- and there aren't that many of them, one of the good ones is is that if you're fundamentally a short seller, you have no problem finding out what the bull case is.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: It's easy to find out.</p><p>But if you long that stock, you might have to really kind of dig to find out what the real bear case is on it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and a -- and so it's another one of these influential asymmetries that I think works for the fundamental short seller. There are a few others. We don't have to disclose our positions. I think that's a very important one, actually.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You know, there was a -- a movement afoot not too long ago to force short sellers to disclose their positions.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and the Europeans have it in terms of -- of certain thresholds, for example.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: Now the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But you're never short 10 percent of the outstanding stock?</p><p>CHANOS: No, although we've -- we've...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE) company...</p><p>CHANOS: -- we've crossed the European thresholds a few times, because the thresholds are very...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But that's a fairly low.</p><p>CHANOS: -- they're very -- they're very low.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Two percent, 3 percent, something like that?</p><p>CHANOS: Oh, I think it's a -- no, it's .5 percent or (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it that low?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. It's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I had no idea.</p><p>CHANOS: -- it's really low.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's a...</p><p>CHANOS: -- on some of them yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: It's quite low on some of them. Well, the reason is is that, first of all, the IRS doesn't look at short positions as positions. It looks at -- it looks at it as in a commercial transaction, where you're borrowing money, interestingly enough.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It -- it's a margin trade, it's a loan (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, because you don't own anything. You don't -- you -- you have a promise to -- to -- to pay something back.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: To repay...</p><p>CHANOS: Shares.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so it's considered...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: -- instituted indebtedness. Yes. And so -- and which is why the short sellers have no -- no standing at the bar, the securities bar. We don't own anything. And -- and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: -- now I would argue even further, I'm a little surprised that my brethren in the hedge fund world have not actually challenged the 13 F, G and H regime. I...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Sections of the SEC code?</p><p>CHANOS: Code -- mandating disclosure over $100 million of your long positions.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: Because, I mean I understand why the 13D need for change in corporate control. I think any reasonable person...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- would understand that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right.</p><p>CHANOS: But why is it that -- that all these great investors, every 90 days, should give the public a free look at what they're doing?</p><p>They're pay -- their clients pay for that. And if you don't trade a lot, say you're a value investor, um, well, if you don't trade a lot, that portfolio doesn't trade a lot. And there are people out there basically with services now to replicate your portfolio for nothing, or very little, that you have people paying good money for.</p><p>And I've always said, you know, Coca-Cola doesn't have to put its, you know, formula on -- on -- on the Web and Microsoft doesn't have to issue its source code, why should managers, either hedge fund or otherwise, have to tell the public what -- what -- what's the public's interests?</p><p>I understand the SEC and law enforcement should have every right to see it at any time.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: In other words, 13D filings go to the SEC and it stops there, they don't get put on the Web?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, 13D filings, I think, change in corporate control, that's fine. I mean people publicly should know that.</p><p>But why is it that a passive money manager should tell the public...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Six percent of -- more than 5 percent position, why...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- why disclose that?</p><p>CHANOS: You know, their -- all their positions, all of their positions.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK, so let's clarify that. I'm under the impression they do a filing at 5 percent?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, a 13D.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK. So let's say they have a 2 percent position.</p><p>They have to disclose that?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: What happens if they're offshore?</p><p>CHANOS: Of -- if you're a U.S. money manager, you've got to disclose your positions of $100 million.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Huh, that's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, so -- so -- so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it a fund above $100 million or a fund...</p><p>CHANOS: A position...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- a position above $100 million?</p><p>CHANOS: A fund $100 -- of $100 million.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Again, I don't understand why the money management industry hasn't gone and said this is, in effect, a, you know, possibly a takings clause in \"The Constitution.\"</p><p>Why is it that the public gets to see what I'm doing?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You're -- you're...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- forcing me to turn over my intellectual property with no compensation.</p><p>CHANOS: And if you don't short a lot of stocks, then if you're just a long lonely manager, you're giving away your entire business plan every 90 days.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's really interesting. And I hadn't thought of that in a...</p><p>CHANOS: Absolutely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in that context.</p><p>CHANOS: Absolutely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So the accusation is that Wall Street owns Congress and they can get DC to do whatever they want. And it's not all that far from the truth.</p><p>Why is this so difficult to change?</p><p>You would think, hey, any major change in ownership, anything over -- pick a percent. It doesn't even have to be 5 percent. If you owe more than 3 percent, you need to at least disclose it when you cross that line.</p><p>Um, but after that, why does it have to be completely...</p><p>CHANOS: I'm a little...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- disclosed?</p><p>CHANOS: -- you know, well, first of all, hedge funds don't have the clout that -- that -- when -- when you say Wall Street does...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- we're talking about major -- major banks and -- and investment banks. They're the ones with the clout. Hedge funds don't -- still don't have that much clout in Washington.</p><p>So I think that's number one.</p><p>But, again -- and -- and mutual funds, of course, like it because it actually helps their marketing.</p><p>You know, here's our portfolio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Absolutely.</p><p>CHANOS: I just -- but I -- I've always wondered at why a -- why hedge funds have just sort of rolled over on this and said well, you know, well, I guess, you know, we've got to do it. And you do have to do it. But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, I'll tell you what the answer is. The answer is merely knowing what Jim Chanos' long or short isn't the same as having Jim Chanos manage that position for you. And the same is true for any hedge fund that's out there. If it was the case, everybody would be generating alpha by imitating the Dalio's, Tepper's, obviously Renaissance Technology doesn't hold onto anything long enough for a filing to go through.</p><p>But still, if it was that easy just to say let me see what Chanos owns, great, I'll own that...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, one would argue that that's actually why the alphas may have dropped and a -- and so, I'm not so sure. It will...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Because everybody was...</p><p>CHANOS: -- clearly for trading...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) to it.</p><p>CHANOS: -- clearly for trading shops, it -- it's superfluous. And for shops that do a lot of fundamental shorting, it's -- it's meaningless, because, for example, you use...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You want that out there anyway?</p><p>CHANOS: When you see my longs, I file them in my Opportunity Fund, which is our long short. And if you look at my longs, you'll scratch your head and go why is Chanos long in that thing, that looks crazy?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And not understanding there's two shorts against it that are even crazier.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Right, and that happens to be the best system -- systematic hedge for that position.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Um, so it can be -- it can be very misleading to people. And that's the other reason then, why do it?</p><p>If it's misleading because you're both long and short, you're not doing anybody a service.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: If it's not misleading because the guy is just simply a long only person, why does the public have the right to that information for free?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Those are the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: There's a lot of arguments against this that -- and -- and the argument for it typically is well, it's for more -- don't we want more transparency?</p><p>And I would argue, no, not necessarily. Um, but I particularly if -- if you're basing a business on -- on intellectual capital and you're charging people for that, I don't see what the public interest is in putting out possibly misleading information.</p><p>One of the problems, when you have the limits where people have to disclose where they go through limits and up and down, you actually -- people can game that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- knowing themselves they've gone through the limits.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so I've explained that to the European regulators, that - - that these short threshold limits themselves can be disruptive just because they exist.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's veer into a dangerous territory. Let's talk a little bit about politics, Washington, DC, the regulatory environment.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You're known as a guy who's a pretty active, uh, participant in politics. You've made the comment that you've been -- I'm paraphrasing -- you've been fortunate enough in your career to have accumulated a sum of money and you feel obligated to respond, to give back, to participate in democracy.</p><p>What -- what attracted you to that given how dysfunctional DC has been?</p><p>Is it something you're still interested in?</p><p>Talk a little bit about that.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean I'm certainly not interested in politics personally. I -- I'm interested in the process. I always have been. I -- and first of all, let me say, I think the system is broken. I think the whole system of campaign finance is broken. And I would love a law that says I can't write any checks.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Well, the...</p><p>CHANOS: But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- Supreme Court has basically...</p><p>CHANOS: Has gone towy.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you could write, Jim Chanos...</p><p>CHANOS: It's free speech.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- who wants more than a couple of bucks, write...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- write all the money you want (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. I think -- and I think that that -- that while that may be a constitutional freedom, it's one we ought to reexamine, because it raises agency risks and lots of issues of inequality. But -- but we're not here to discuss that.</p><p>The problem is is that if that's -- if that's the legality of the game and -- and you feel strongly about -- about things politically, um, and you want to support them, fine. Uh, you know, I -- we pick our spots.</p><p>On the other hand, um, I think that -- that a -- that the country, you know, actually needs people to be involved in politics.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And I think that -- that it's not about access or influence, it's about, in our case, because we never asked for anything...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, stop a second. When you say you never ask for something, you want to influence the process a little bit, then you -- you derailed the question I was about to ask you, because you said you never ask for something, which was what would you like to see changed?</p><p>What area...</p><p>CHANOS: Well (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- of policy...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, for example...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- could you move on the needle on?</p><p>CHANOS: -- well, for example, I -- I've publicly said I -- I think that carried interest should be raised. The tax on carried interest should be raised.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So this -- this is the advantage that private equity and hedge fund managers have...</p><p>CHANOS: On long-term cap -- gain allocations and performance fees being treated as long-term capital gains.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So they're -- they're taxed at -- it used to be 15 percent, now it's 23...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, whatever.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- or so.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But it sure as hell ain't for -- the joke that Warren Buffett says as he pays a lower tax rate...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- than his secretary.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And I -- and I think a lot of these -- so -- so I would, you know, you would argue...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So why hasn't that been changed?</p><p>You would think that's the -- the most egregious stroke of the pen thing to change?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, you'll have to ask the people that don't want to change it. I don't know. The -- the -- there are a lot of issues that are out there like that that I think you would be kind of surprised as a Wall Streeter that I support, but I -- that are counterintuitive.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Give me -- give me another one. Let's -- let's...</p><p>CHANOS: Well...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You're -- you're one of these -- I can just hear Bill O'Reilly saying...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you're one of these limbers -- limer -- limousine liberals who really feels guilty about having money.</p><p>CHANOS: You know, I don't feel guilty at all about having money. I - - trust me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: I -- I feel blessed and -- and I know I'm fortunate. And -- and not at all. And the -- but I do think the level of discourse in this country needs to be reopened. And I think we -- we've -- we've put both parties in this -- this sort of truly bipolar area there where no one wants to meet in the middle anymore.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: A lot due to campaign finance reasons and -- and the primaries.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's the underlying problem that, you know, the old joke is that Reagan and Tip O'Neill would argue all day, they'd go out at night, have a beer and the next morning there would be legislation signed. That sort of cross-pollination...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, look, apparently that story was a bit apocryphal. Apparent, there wasn't -- it wasn't that simple with those two.</p><p>But -- but I know what you mean...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But they did get -- they did get...</p><p>CHANOS: I know what you mean.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they did get -- meet in the middle.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Well, what...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They did get things accomplished.</p><p>CHANOS: -- well, what's changed is the Senate, really, if you know Washington, in that -- that the House has always been pretty -- a pretty bipartisan place and -- and it's always been pretty raucous in terms of hardened attitudes and -- and -- and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, that's -- do you mean a partisan there's that...</p><p>CHANOS: It's much more partisan.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- the Senasin -- the Senate is bipartisan and the House was partisan.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the Senate -- the Senate, until about 20 or 30 years ago, was a place in which people crossed party lines all the time and voted their conscience and voted the way they really felt on the issues and weren't penalized for it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and -- and so senators really were that -- that upper house that said, OK, we -- we're a little bit older, a little bit more experienced, we're -- we -- we -- more confident of our reelection or our tenure and if -- if I want to vote on civil rights even though I'm -- I'm a hard -- I'm in the Republican Party, I -- I do. And that happened.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: But now the Senate is just as fractious as the House. And -- and senators worry about reelection or getting very liberal or very conservative challengers. Again, part of it's the campaign finance issue, part of it's the -- the redistricting of -- for the representatives.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Gerrymandering, as well.</p><p>CHANOS: And so -- so the -- the whole idea that there was an upper house that was sort of, you know...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The adult supervision.</p><p>CHANOS: The adults, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: The adults that were getting policy done is -- is changed, as well. And so it's added to the acrimony. It's added to the gridlock. And -- and I think it's just added -- it's -- it's not put us in a good place. And I think that that's -- and I've supported Republican candidates that I think are moderates, as well, so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. How -- how do we fix this?</p><p>How do we repair...</p><p>CHANOS: I think you...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- campaign finance?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I think you have to start, you know, with some sort of reform. And I think, you know, unfortunately, a family member who is -- who has been in politics also pointed this out correctly, you also have to do something about term limits, because other -- if you do have campaign finance limits, term limit -- anybody with an incumbency becomes more important.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so you have a do I -- you have an advantage being an incumbent...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Ninety-nine percent or 98 percent reelection rate...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. So...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in the House.</p><p>CHANOS: -- so I mean we -- that -- that -- it's -- it's a tricky issue. But just throwing more and more unlimited amounts of money, I think, doesn't help the issue. It makes -- I think it makes it worse.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And what do you do -- so, in other words, you have a system that's broken, nobody from either party is going to -- willing to work with the other party...</p><p>CHANOS: But nobody can turn the money down (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And at the same time the Supreme Court...</p><p>CHANOS: It's an arms race.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- is -- has -- has basically lit that fuse and said go for it then...</p><p>CHANOS: And it's an arms race. So therefore, I mean you can't -- if you don't spend, you're not going to have an equal chance -- seat at the table.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so it's just...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You have no choice, you have to.</p><p>CHANOS: -- it's just this vicious cycle. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So how do you break that?</p><p>How do you...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, as I say, I'd leave it up to the politicians and the legal scholars, but at some point, you're going to need a piece of legislation or a constitutional amendment or something that -- that's going to have to change this system. And I -- I don't know -- I don't know any other way around it. If you have a Supreme Court that keeps saying this is an a -- the legislation is unconstitutional, then you're going to have to change the \"Constitution.\"</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And -- and that's a challenge. That's quite a challenge...</p><p>CHANOS: It's a big challenge.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- to get that done. It probably has to get a lot worse before it gets better.</p><p>CHANOS: You know, that's a scary thought.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Let -- let me tack policy to one other place, because we spent this whole afternoon chatting and China has never come up.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly. Where's that?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And you, very famously, um, identified, I want to say four years ago, is that -- is that right?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, it was the end of '09, early 2010.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Basically said China is a -- a big house of cards, building these ghost cities, they're spending all this policy money, they're not that good at it. Their economy has been so robust that it's covered up a lot of these credit errors.</p><p>What do you think is going on with China today?</p><p>By the way, China's stock market today at a four or a six week high, but it's shellacked over that period.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It's down 40 percent. China, while the rest of the world has rallied substantially, has gone the exact opposite way.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Almost cut in half.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, people have always ask -- still ask us, well, what do you think, you know, when are you going to be right?</p><p>You've been early. And I keep saying if you look at the Chinese market...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It's got -- China has gotten crushed over the past few years.</p><p>CHANOS: It's the -- it was the best place to be short in the last four years.</p><p>Um, look, everything that we saw in China, at -- at the end of '09 and 2010 is basically now twice as bad. That's kind of the way I put it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It hasn't gotten better.</p><p>CHANOS: It -- it's gotten worse. The -- the debt to GDP has gone from over 100 percent of GDP to over 200 percent. Back in -- in '09, there was 5.6 billion square meters of high rises under development and (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: 5.6 billion?</p><p>CHANOS: -- 6 billion square meters. That's 60...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh-huh.</p><p>CHANOS: -- billion square feet.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: Now, the number is twice that. It's 10.6 billion square -- square meters under development at the end of 2013.</p><p>So everything that we saw then that was bad, and I think it -- it was bad, is, in effect, twice as bad now.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Don't they have...</p><p>CHANOS: When we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hundreds of millions of people to move off the farm?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the problem is, is the hundreds of millions of people can't afford the stuff that they're -- that's being built. They're building high end condos, uh, shopping malls, high speed rail. It's only the -- the top 5 percent of people in China that can afford that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's the -- that's the -- the sort of paradox here. I'll give you just an idea of -- of what's changed in four years. When we started looking at China, the Chinese GDP in dollar terms was about $7 trillion US. And the total...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Not too shabby.</p><p>CHANOS: Not -- and the to -- total amount of bank -- assets in the banking system in China was $9 trillion.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p>CHANOS: So it was a little bit over 100 percent.</p><p>Now, the GDP is about $9 trillion and the total assets in the Chinese banking system are about $24 trillion.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, a meaningful difference.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's a...</p><p>CHANOS: So they've had to employ...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that's a lot of...</p><p>CHANOS: -- they've had to employ more and more debt to get the growth.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I was going to say, this isn't capital, this is...</p><p>CHANOS: This is the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- credit.</p><p>CHANOS: -- total assets, total assets. It's just basically a proxy for -- for credit outstanding. And so increasingly, they've had to employ more and more debt to -- to drive their growth. And -- and -- and that's because the model is based on 50 percent investment to GDP.</p><p>So if you think about that, that means that -- that if they -- if it takes them two years to finish a project, that means that one quarter of your GDP every year rolls off and has to be replaced with a -- digging a new hole in the ground somewhere.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well -- well, that's while they were at 12 percent GDP growth four years ago and -- and the most recent data is closer to 6.5, 7 percent.</p><p>CHANOS: Seven, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: It is, because it -- and -- and so the soft...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And by the way, we would kill for 7 percent GDP.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, well, the 7 percent is a little misleading, too, though, because, again, 7 percent, the consumer is still declining per GDP. So the 7 percent is only really coming from -- from the fact that they're still building stuff. And -- and now, it's beyond a shadow of a doubt, even -- even Chinese officials or died in the wool bulls will tell you, they've got to change that, they've got to reform this. And they've got to get away from this investment-driven model.</p><p>The question is, how?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: How and what do they replace it with?</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You know, the -- the key -- the fascinating thing about China, or let me flip that around, the interesting thing about U.S. manufacturing, we started seeing signs of this about five years ago, be fracking blew up, before natural gas was everywhere. But natural gas prices had dropped and we were hearing about companies relocating in the U.S., setting up a natural gas electrical generator. One of the big complaints you hear about China is a lack of consistent electrical availability.</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Not only 24-7, but a consistent amperage and wattage...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, peak -- peak usage.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and it fluctuates and...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you have to set up a series of electronics just to get a steady whatever it is, 120 and 60. So in the U.S., you run a natural gas pipeline near a factory, you set up an electrical code generation plant, you're effectively getting unlimited, very low cost energy and you don't have to take three weeks to ship your product to the States.</p><p>And that's...</p><p>CHANOS: Well...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- started as a -- as labor prices started to go up...</p><p>CHANOS: And Chinese wages have gone up, too.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- what happens when wages go from $1 a day to -- to $25 a day?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, that's -- that's what's happened. In fact, net -- net exports in China, when I first started looking at China, net exports were 12 percent of GDP, exports minus imports. Now, it's almost down to 0. Now, it's a couple percent.</p><p>And so -- so the impact that China, as an exporting engine, is already diminished on their GDP.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's amazing.</p><p>CHANOS: And they've offset it now -- they've offset it with more and more investment. So the story in China is not export anymore, the story in China is this giant building project, the property building.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Can -- can you grow a middle class in a -- a country that size and use that the way the U.S. post-World War II -- you know, we had a 50 year run after World War II, where the middle class boomed like never before. And it was a period of tremendous economic growth.</p><p>CHANOS: Right. But we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Can China do that?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we were already past the middle income trap at that point, though. We -- we passed that in the -- the late 19th, early 20th century.</p><p>I mean China is still facing that. And -- and how do you get people from the sort of $5,000 to $7,000 per capita...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- income level to -- to $30,000 or plus?</p><p>And -- and that's always the tricky point in -- in economic development is -- is the, you know, basically, there's four phases of economic development, Barry. You've got, basically, you educate the population from illiteracy to secondary school education.</p><p>Second, you move people from rural areas to urban.</p><p>Third, you employ capital where it never -- capital has never been employed. That's where we are in China right now.</p><p>And the fourth and the way that South Korea and Japan and post-war Germany, post-war is you finally begin to innovate and make products that the rest of the world wants and be more productive.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's the tricky part. And that's where most countries can't surmount. They get to the third point, but they can't get to the fourth point, where they become truly innovative and -- and -- and it -- the Asian tigers all fell by the wayside, for example, in the mid-'90s...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- with the exception of South Korea and -- and Singapore. The rest all -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, basically...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Vietnam...</p><p>CHANOS: -- stalled out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Um, that's where we are with China right now.</p><p>The three countries post-World War II were Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union. They all were pretty much destroyed by the war.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh-huh.</p><p>CHANOS: They had to rebuild. They had to start from scratch. You know, they already had educated workforces. They already had urban centers.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: But they had to basically put capital to work again, which they did. And Germany, in the '60s and Japan in the '70s began to innovate and produce world-class products that everybody wanted.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: For sure.</p><p>CHANOS: The Soviet Union didn't.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And China, the question is, will China ever be able to do - - be more than just a -- a high end...</p><p>CHANOS: A manufacturing base.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that's it.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and the -- and/or employ capital in a non-impressive way to build empty buildings and condos and things like that. And that's what they're doing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So the quote you had about China, I'll -- I'm curious if you still think this is true. \"The Chinese banking system is built on quicksand.\"</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. It's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it still true?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I just think it's -- it's more true than ever, um, in -- in that there's just -- the bad loans are there. There's legacy bad loans they didn't address from even 10 years ago. Um, they are telling you with a straight face that non-performing loans are, you know, less than 1 percent. Um, and -- and yet, you just see the madness of some of these projects and the fact that defaults are starting now left, right and center and they'll look at you with a straight face and say, oh, no, no, our non- performing loans are not a problem.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So I can sit here and continue speaking to you for a couple more hours.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But I know your assistant will kill me if I keep you here past 4:00. So I -- I just wanted to end on one last question. And before I forget, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. I know people are going to find this a fascinating conversation.</p><p>The -- the last question I want to ask you is really general and open- ended. Um, the industry of Wall Street, finance, investment banking, investing has changed dramatically over the past 30 years and especially over the past five years.</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: What do you see happening in this industry going forward?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I -- I kind of would like to think we're seeing our limits on it, because -- and it's always -- it's always a little bit hypocritical to talk -- talk, you know, negatively about what you do for a living, but I think that -- that the nature of finance, in and of itself, as a profit center or a big part of the economy is sort of self-defeating.</p><p>And -- and I think that we've gotten kind of to the limits, I suspect, of where finance can go to push the U.S. economy. I mean I think it hit its peak in '06-'07, uh, in terms of finance as a percent of corporate profits and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The argument is -- that I've made is the bailouts prevented that process of...</p><p>CHANOS: You know, clearing...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- converting back to...</p><p>CHANOS: -- of clearing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: -- the market clearing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, and I would agree with you on that. And I read, you know, I remember at the time you were writing that and you were right. And I agree with it. And I think that -- that unfortunately, finance becoming a big part of the economy in terms of taking deposits, making loans, all of that stuff, puts it in this too big to fail category broadly speaking, where -- where ironically enough, it cannot be subject to the -- the -- the whims of capitalism itself, creative destruction, because it would just be systemic.</p><p>And so we -- we build this monstrous Rube Goldberg like contraption that is completely ludicrous and then say we can't let it fall apart...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So...</p><p>CHANOS: -- because it will impact everything else.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- so too big to fail, too much leverage, too little capital...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and yet not subject to the laws of capital.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, let's leave it at this. If we look at those -- those dark days of '08 and '09, the one industry that actually went through bankruptcy was the auto industry. And I always chide my friends in White - - at the White House and -- who say, oh, well, the auto bailout was smart.</p><p>And I keep saying, you know, no, it wasn't an auto bailout. I was short the -- the auto stocks. Shareholders were wiped out...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- the boards were -- were dismissed. The executives were fired. They brought in new teams, they recapitalized the companies, the government put in debtor in possession financing...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- which was post-bankruptcy. Now, we can argue about the unions' role in that, that employees were given seniority. But in many bankruptcies, in...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's typical.</p><p>CHANOS: -- employees are...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's not atypical.</p><p>CHANOS: -- given preference.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and, in fact, we did exactly what capitalism should have said we did, we recapped the industry and we made it more viable going forward.</p><p>The people who took risks in the past, you know, paid the price.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. That's exactly right.</p><p>CHANOS: But it worked. It actually worked better, I think, than what we've had in finance coming out of this, which was...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, we had -- we had a Treasury secretary that was from finance. And so industry gets bankruptcy, finance gets bailouts. If it was reversed, if you had the head of a railroad or a head of a manufacturing plant, I can't guarantee you that GM and Chrysler would have been put through bankruptcy, but I can guarantee you that Citi and Bank of America and Merrill and Morgan would have been treated the way financiers treated manufacturers.</p><p>CHANOS: But then we might not have had this beautiful new Bloomberg headquarters.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh, I think this predates it. This was up long before that.</p><p>CHANOS: I know it was. I'm just kidding.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so listen, you know, the counter-argument, and this - - this is me talking literally in my book, the counter-argument is if you take -- my example is Bank America...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- Merrill Lynch, Countrywide, that giant...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- horrific blasphemy of a company...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- if you would have put them into bankruptcy, you spin out Merrill as a free-standing, clean balance sheet investment firm.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you spin out Bank America as a clean balance...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- money center bank. You spin out Countrywide as a mortgage underwriter.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You take all the bad paper -- I -- I'm fond of saying no such thing as toxic assets, only toxic prices.</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You sell all that crap that's dragging down their balance sheet all these years...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- at 15, 20 cents on the dollar...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- someone's a buyer of that...</p><p>CHANOS: Of course.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you also end up clearing all those home prices instead of having private equity come in and try and flip them, these home prices plummet and first time home buyers are buying houses at a reasonable price.</p><p>CHANOS: If you had wiped out the equity of these institutions, what, you know, to the -- 80 percent...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- subordinated that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Sixty percent on the mezzanine debt, 50 percent on other debt and the depositors were whole...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- I think not only would that have helped the whole process, it would have -- it would have meant that people learned the lessons going forward.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The -- the moral hazard gets avoided and we, in our economic recovery in 2014 would be...</p><p>CHANOS: Correct.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- years ahead of where we are (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: And the depositors understood that they -- the ones taking no risk were protected by the government...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- as they should be. But the more risk you took, the more at risk you were at, I undoubtedly think the system would be far healthier today than it is.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It's -- it's called risk for a reason.</p><p>CHANOS: And I've got it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Jim, thank you so much for your time.</p><p>CHANOS: Barry, thank you.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This has been absolutely fascinating.</p><p>You've been listening to Master of Finance series.</p><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p>This is Bloomberg Radio and we've been speaking to Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates.</p><p>Thanks so much for coming in, Jim.</p><p>CHANOS: My pleasure.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: You're listening to Masters In Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

This is Barry Ritholtz and this week I am thrilled to have sat down  with Jim Chanos, hedge fund manager at Kynikos Associates for a very  interesting and in-depth conversation; after we were done recording the  radio portion, Jim sat around and we kept the tape running.  And there's a  ton of podcast extras.  So after the show is done, be sure and listen to  the rest of it.   I think it's about 14 hours.  And it's really -- anytime  you get the chance to sit at the knee of somebody like Jim Chanos and ask  questions and see where they go, you don't want to stop the tape running.   He spoke for a long time and it was absolutely fascinating.</p><p>I don't know how many of you who are listening to this know Jim Chanos  or are familiar with his work.  But really it's a fascinating legacy.  This  is a guy who was an early short seller, who was an early critic of some of  the worst excesses of Wall Street, whether it was misbehavior of analysts  or accounting fraud or things that companies were doing, that were  defrauding and misleading investors.</p><p>Jim has the combination of a accountant's ability to dive into the  numbers and detective's ability to sniff out nonsense.  And he has done it  throughout his whole career.  He's identified a number of tremendous frauds  and scams, whether it was Baldwin Piano, which ran an insurance scam on the  side, EnronWorldCom, go down the whole list.  He has really been crucial  to investors in ferreting out fraud and using his skill set to make money  for his investors by basically identifying short selling opportunities  where there's some bad behavior, fraud, whatever it is.</p><p>So this is a wide-ranging and fascinating conversation that I was  thrilled to have.  Be sure and check out the podcast extras afterwards.   And on with the show.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS with Barry Ritholtz on  Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Today I am thrilled to bring you someone who you may not  know who he is, but you actually should.  His name is Jim Chanos.  He is  the manager of -- let me see if I'm pronouncing this correctly -- Kynikos  Associates.  That's Greek for \"cynic.\"  And Jim has built a reputation over  30 years as a spotter of wrongdoing and fraud, a short seller, somebody  who's identified a lot of problems with various companies in the market.</p><p>Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p>JAMES CHANOS, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, KYNIKOS ASSOCIATES:  Thanks,  Barry.  Glad to be here.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So I've wanted to have you on for a long time because most  of the people we speak to are long-term, mostly long only investors, who  are looking at here's what you need to do to save money for retirement, or  if you're a pension fund or an endowment, here's what you do -- need to do  to make sure you stay ahead of inflation.</p><p>But your approach as a short seller is completely different.</p><p>Why don't you describe that so people have an idea of what you  actually do in Kynikos Associates?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean, one way to describe it, Barry, is that we are a  long-term potential purchasers of equities.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I like that.</p><p>CHANOS:  The whole idea of fundamental short selling really is select  a portfolio of securities, mostly stocks, that are fundamentally overvalued  no matter what the market does. that these are companies that, through the  normal ebbs and flows of capitalism, are on the downside of their cycle.</p><p>And our clients, primarily, are institutions who use us as a hedge to  their core equity portfolio.  And so therefore it allows them to be a  little bit more aggressive in their equity exposures, knowing that they  have part of the portfolio in a small group of companies that will go down  over time -- we hope and we think --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You expect.  So the people who are listening to this, who  are in the industry, certainly know who you are.  But regular investors,  radio listeners may not know who you are.</p><p>So let me discuss your curriculum vitae for a second.  You first came  into the public eye as an analyst at -- was it Gilford (ph) Securities way  back when?</p><p>And you had identified one of Wall Street's favorite stocks, which at  the time was an insurance company called Baldwin and you had essentially  figured out that it was a sham.  It was a giant insurance scam that was  cooking their books -- this is a theme we'll come to again and again -- and  people mocked the call, \"The Wall Street Journal\" had a pretty aggressive  articulate that pretty much trashed your analysis and ultimately you had  the last laugh, because it's almost quaint to say at the time, when Baldwin  went bankrupt, at $9 billion, it was the largest bankruptcy in history,  although we know, oh, $9 billion, that's adorable compared to what we've  seen since then.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, back then it wasn't so adorable.</p><p>Well, Baldwin was -- Baldwin United was the old Baldwin Piano Company,  which had morphed under very charismatic CEO into an aggressive seller of  insurance products, particularly annuities, through Wall Street.</p><p>And therefore it became a Wall Street darling in the early '80s on the  back of not only the rapid earnings growth, but also because Wall Street  was being paid by Baldwin.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Five percent commission on a policy --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- that buys a lot of goodwill on the street --</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, it does.  And particularly when you're offering yields  on these insurance products that were as high as 14 percent.  The problem  was Baldwin wasn't earning anything close to that in its insurance  portfolios.  So they ultimately had to begin doing acquisitions and getting  insurance department approval to fund those acquisitions with insurance  company money, which is highly, highly unusual.</p><p>And that was the beginning of the end for them.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So you were a kid then.</p><p>How old were you when you made that call?</p><p>CHANOS:  I wrote -- my sense of timing was impeccable.  I put out my  first solo recommendation on the company on the absolute bottom of the  market, the day that Henry Kaufman (ph) said buys stocks in August of 1982.   I think it was August 17th of 1982.</p><p>I said sell the -- or sell this thing short.  And --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  About 25 bucks, is that about right?</p><p>CHANOS:  I think it was about $25.  It went briefly to $20 and then  straight to $55.  </p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Doubled.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, it was a good -- it was a good initiation into  fundamental short selling.  But the interesting thing about that story was  we -- first report when we did a follow-up report was that a lot of the  radioactive aspect of Baldwin was hiding in plain sight.  It was -- it was  -- you could see it if you looked at the publicly available documents the  SEC filings and their insurance company statements, which were public.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So here's the question you're going to hear me ask you  repeatedly this afternoon.</p><p>How is it that this was in plain view, a $9 billion fraud, and nobody  else could spot it?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, first of all, it wasn't in a lot of people's interest  to spot it because the analysts who were covering the company most closely  and had buy ratings on this thing were also working for the firms that sold  the annuities.  So it was also a good introduction to the whole concept of  conflict of interest.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  To say the least.</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.</p><p>And number two, you had to do a little bit of digging.  And I think in  many ways, not being insurance analysts, just being a young analyst who was  learning about insurance, I just simply kept asking questions of things  that didn't seem to make sense to me.  And most of the answers had -- were  logical but every once in a while, it would come back with something that  was just simply nonsensical.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That sounds very familiar.  That reminds me a little bit of  what took place so in the future with Enron.</p><p>So this was '82.  Most people probably this never entered their radar.</p><p>But Enron, on the other hand, entered a lot of people's radar and in  fact that's probably how anyone who's a member of the public or the  investing community who knows you probably found you through Enron, which  is a remarkably similar story.</p><p>CHANOS:  It was.  And in what would seem even more interesting about  it was that not only were the facts at Enron hiding in plain sight --  there's been a lot written about that -- but Enron, using their mark-to- model accounting, where they pulled forward future profit estimates,  Baldwin was doing the same exact thing with its annuities.  They were  estimating a spread of income -- which they weren't earning, of course --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Which may or may not have existed, depending on future --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and then they -- and then they estimate how long the  policies would stay on the books and they took the present value and they  sold the policy.  And so --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right, not accounting for the fact that interest rates  fluctuate and other factors --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- they were writing this down as if it was money good.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right, exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Coming up, we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos,  manager of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  You're  listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  I'm Barry  Ritholtz.  And today I'm speaking to famed short seller Jim Chanos.</p><p>We were talking a little bit about how Enron was so similar to  Baldwin.  And you had mentioned, you read the 10(k), you read the annual  report, you read the quarterly report three times.  You still have no idea  what they hell they do.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.  The other -- the other interesting similarity was  they both had charismatic leaders, who were very bright; Baldwin had a guy  by the name of Morley Thompson (ph) and -- who went from literally peddling  pianos door-to-door.  (INAUDIBLE) good salesmen to sell pianos door-to- door.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  And strong (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>CHANOS:  And morphing into financial services and of course Enron had  Jeff Skilling (ph) and to a lesser extent Ken Lay.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  And so when we first started looking at Enron,  Enron decided to make a market in everything from energy trading to you  name it, they were going to take everything, turn it into a tradable  commodity, whether or not it should be is a whole different discussion.</p><p>What was the first warning sign that you saw with Enron?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, it's actually -- it was a column written by John Wilde  (ph).  He wrote a piece in the Texas \"Wall Street Journal\" in the fall of  2000, where he pointed out that energy merchant banks had just gotten a  favorable ruling from the SEC on this mark-to-model accounting.  So much  for the Baldwin type stuff.</p><p>And a friend of mine running a hedge fund in Dallas, Texas, called it  to my attention.  And of course email was rudimentary; he faxed it to me.   And I read the piece and immediately --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  '97, '98 --</p><p>CHANOS:  -- this was in 2000 --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- far along.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and immediate cracked the 1999 10(k) and March and June  10(q)s of Enron and immediately began to see all kinds of odd things.  In  addition we noticed right away that not only was there a lot of insider  selling throughout 2000 in Enron stock, but there were a number of key  high-level executive departures.  And that's -- those two -- those two in  conjunction, often there will be insider selling to start.</p><p>But when you see insider selling across the executive suite as well as  executive departures, there's usually something wrong.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Yes.  That's quite fascinating.  And so you start digging  in and what's the - -you begin working with Bethany McLean, then of --  still of \"Fortune.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- ultimately end up writing the book, \"Smartest Guys in  the Room,\" and what were the next couple of things that you uncovered in  digging into Enron?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, the -- I had to -- two -- my partner at the time, Doug  Millett (ph) and an analyst who's now my current partner, Chuck Hobbs (ph),  we -- the three of us dug into the financials.  And one of the first things  Doug pointed out was this is nothing more than a leveraged hedge fund  sitting on top of a pipeline, which I think was the -- still the best apt  description of Enron.</p><p>But as we dug into the numbers, there were a few odd things right  away.  We noticed that even with their sort of odd accounting, the company  was only earning 6 percent pretax on its capital.  And --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  In a period when everybody's just making --</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.  And in which people are -- were paying five times  book for this -- the stock.  So --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  For a 6 percent ROI on --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- five times NAV for a hedge fund that was earning 6  percent?  No, you wouldn't.</p><p>So that was the first thing.</p><p>Number two, I noticed immediately they weren't matching their -- in  that -- there's an accounting principle called matching similar gains and  losses.  And they had a merchant banking arm that did things like sell  energy barges or construct utility plants.</p><p>And when they had a gain, they would put it through the merchant  banking operating income line.  But it appeared to me that when they looked  like they were going to lose money on something, they held it as a  discontinued asset, held for sale for a year, and then put it below the  operating income line so people disregarded it as an extraordinary event.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So they buried what should have been an ordinary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- should have matched everything as net, net profit.   Instead they basically showed their winners and tried you to disregard the  losers.  That was another flag.</p><p>The third one is -- were these odd footnotes that said there was a  group of entities set up by an executive of Enron to trade with Enron or an  executive -- senior executive of the company was the general partner of the  entities.  And, I mean, that was an immediate red flag to, well, what were  these entities and why is a --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, how can you be a counterparty with himself?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- this person conflicted.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And we now know those were the famous raptors and LJMs and  these off-balance sheet entities --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right, side pockets and -- I believe it was McKenzie (ph)  who came up with some of the concepts for that, if not those exact ones,  but that philosophical structure came from --</p><p>CHANOS:  -- came from --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- from McKenzie, that's right.</p><p>So quite fascinating.</p><p>And now let's fast forward.  So ultimately Enron collapses after  having a huge run-up.  it takes a year to fall from about 89 bucks, 83  bucks, if memory serves, down to zero.  It was -- it was glacial; if you're  short, you must be champing at the bit.  That's something I want to talk to  you about a little later.</p><p>The mindset of how do you stay short a position fundamentally when  it's running up against you and even when it starts -- I remember Lehman  Brothers, when we were short, Lehman, when we watched it collapse, every  time it fell and looked like it was about to just freefall, there would be  this squeeze.  There would be this move back up.</p><p>In '07, '08, you were short most of that whole area.  We're talking  about investment banks, builders, commercial banks.  What else were you  short in the credit sector before the collapse?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, we have a rule that we don't -- we don't short anybody  we do business with.  And since we did agency business most of the brokers,  we were not short Lehman or Bear.  We actually were prime broker, a client  of Bear.  But there certainly -- in the credit area, there was a lot of --  a lot of things to do.</p><p>I mean, the Florida homebuilders, West Coast homebuilders, building  supply companies, the credit rating agencies, a number of banks that were  pretty aggressive --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Bond insurance companies?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- bond insurance companies, yes, yes.  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And (INAUDIBLE) around the same time.</p><p>CHANOS:  NBIA.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  NBIA was the other one.  They all freefell down to single  digits.</p><p>CHANOS:  And the -- you're exactly right.  I mean, typically, stocks  that are fundamentally flawed, where the equity is worthless, you will have  a number of vicious rallies, often 50-60 percent.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Unbelievable.  And you look at that and you say, who the  hell is buying this junk?  This is a stock cut in half that should be going  to zero and yet you end up with the floor underneath these freefalling  stocks and those squeezes are incredibly painful to live through, if --  especially if you're counting your money before you close that position.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, we never do that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's always a bad thing to do.</p><p>CHANOS:  But I would point out that one of the ways that you alleviate  that a little bit is that people tend to think about the short side very  discretely.  And often because a lot of money managers who actually do  short stocks may only be short a handful of stocks versus quite a few  longs.</p><p>And in our -- in our case, it's a whole portfolio.  I mean, in the  U.S., typically historically over 30 years, we've averaged about 50 names  in the portfolio at any given time.</p><p>So no one position is an unusually large amount --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  3-4-5 percent, is that --</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, 5 percent would be the top.  But I mean, typically  average is 2 percent.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Coming up, we delve into the mind of the short seller as we  continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, chairman of the hedge fund  Kynikos Associates.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  You're listening to MASTERS IN  BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  I'm Barry  Ritholtz.  I am privileged to be speaking to a master of the short side,  Jim Chanos.</p><p>Earlier we were talking about the short in Baldwin and Enron, as well  as all the financials heading into '08.  I recall reading a fabulous  profile of you in \"New York\" magazine, the end of 2008, and I don't know if  they were talking about a specific fund or generally but they were saying  you were up 50 percent for the year in '08.  I know you may not be able to  comment on numbers.  We all work with compliance and lawyers and what have  you.</p><p>But '08 turned out to be a pretty good year for you.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, but the way we gauge ourself (sic), Barry, is actually  versus the market and, in fact, although we have partnerships and offshore  funds that you can invest in that are -- appear short and the numbers are  what they are, the bulk of our business is our managed account business,  where we're a large pension fund or endowment or sovereign wealth fund,  gives us assets to manage short.</p><p>And in those cases, we're benchmarked versus the market inversely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So if the market goes up 10 percent, your benchmark is -10  percent?</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.  And so to the extent -- for example, if the market  goes up 20 percent and we're flat for that account, you know, it's as if we  were up 20 percent.  And we're compensated in performance view on that.</p><p>Conversely, if the market goes down 40 percent and we're up 40  percent, we make no performance --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's flat.</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.  So it's a crude alpha measure.  And that's really  the way the firm has survived in a market that's up 2,000 percent, as you  point out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  Since 1985, since you launched the firm, and this  is the fascinating thing about running a short firm when, by the way, a lot  of your colleagues who are in that space haven't survived as long as you  have.</p><p>So since you launched in '85, the S&amp;P 500 is up over 2,000 percent and  yet you've managed to thrive as a short seller.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  We're up -- on a stand-alone basis, our flagship fund,  which goes back to '85 -- I think is up a couple percent compounded.  But  when you factor that into the fact that -- offset it on the long side and  rebalance monthly, the alpha is somewhere in the mid-teens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's fantastic. </p><p>CHANOS:  And that's actually what -- that's how we get paid and that's  how people evaluate us.  And so --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You exist to create a hedge to institutions, pension funds,  endowments, who, by definition, are, for the most part, long only.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, the -- another way to think of it is we're an insurance  policy that actually pays like premiums --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  As opposed to the not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- being upset when you --</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Exactly.  And so I think that's -- I've quipped that  Kynikos is, in effect, an insurance business.  And it's not -- it's not, I  think, an unreasonable analogy.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So let's talk.  We have a few minutes left in the segment.</p><p>Let's talk about what it's like to be upside down in a position that's  running against you.</p><p>Baldwin is a perfect example.  You put this out at 25, drops to 20.   You feel like a genius for five points.  Next thing you know, it more than  doubles, it almost triples from there.</p><p>How do you have the constitution -- like I know a lot of guys who can  compartmentalize.  I think I can compartmentalize.  But the vast majority  of investors, you know, the old joke is how did you sleep with the -- all  your positions going against you?  Like a baby.  I woke up every two hours,  cried for Mommy and wet myself.</p><p>A lot of people don't have that constitution to -- so how do you sleep  at night with positions running against you?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean, I think the -- it is -- it is personality  based.  I think -- I used to think when I started the business that  shorting stocks fundamentally was just simply the mirror image of going  long.  And I've said publicly many times, I don't think that's the case  anymore.  I think a lot of it's rooted in behavioral finance.  I think  we're all by and large, we're listeners to this show and others are the  product of positive reinforcement cycles.</p><p>And most people's rational decision-making studies have shown breaks  down in an environment negative reinforcement.  And if you're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- in other words when positions going against you, their  discipline goes away when they need it --</p><p>CHANOS:  -- well, and the ultimate example, which will be something  like an interrogation.  And so the ability to withhold information.  So if  you're long in the market, you're constantly -- when I come in every day,  we have 50 stocks in the U.S., another 40 globally, you know, I can pretty  much be sure that 20 percent of my names will have a research note out, a  buy recommendation, earnings estimates raised.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Something's moving.</p><p>CHANOS:  The CEO and Bloomberg, whatever the case might be.  And most  of that is noise.  But it's the noise that most people in the market are  used to.  And I call it the Muzak of the investment business.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I'm going to pull a quote I was saving for before, because  it's so dead-on.</p><p>You called it \"the cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  And so most people -- as I say, they're used to that.  But if  you're a short seller or you're a negative -- on a situation, you're being  told constantly you're wrong.  And here's why.  And you know, 50-page  research report to follow.</p><p>And I think that not everyone has the ability to simply drown that out  and say, OK.  That's all well and good.  But that's in the price of the  stock.  Do we know that?  And the facts that I have are very important and  the market doesn't really know that or appreciate how important they are.</p><p>So I'm not sure.  I think the research is the same.  And I think that  good research can be taught both on long and short side and should be the  same.  I think the ability to deal with the noise, the swing factors, the  volatility, I think that's a different attribute.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  We continue our conversation with famed short seller Jim  Chanos of Kynikos Associates.  And we'll discuss the role of the short  seller in modern markets.  I'm Barry Ritholtz.  You're listening to MASTERS  IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.  I'm Barry  Ritholtz.  I'm thrilled to be speaking with Jim Chanos -- am I pronouncing  Kynikos -- is that -- correctly?</p><p>CHANOS:  Oh, you're ready to go to Greece --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Kynikos associates, Kynikos, which translates as \"cynic.\"   And you have spent a couple of cynical but lucrative decades on Wall  Street, calling out the nonsense that passes for ordinary Wall Street  noise.</p><p>Let's talk a little bit about the role of the short seller in markets.   And here it is.  It's five years past the financial crisis.  People forget  it wasn't the banks overleveraged and writing all this junk CDS and AIG  writing the $3 trillion worth of derivatives with exactly $0 reserved for  it.  It was you short sellers that caused the crisis.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, sure was.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  How do you defend yourself for bringing the world to the  edge of the abyss?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, you never --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And by the way, that was at the highest levels of -- we  heard that from the ECB, we heard that crap from Treasury.  We heard that  from everywhere.  And it was just despite Enron and WorldCom and a whole  slew of fraud uncovered by short sellers, including Lehman Brothers. </p><p>How does anybody actually say that?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean, you remember, Barry, right after Bear Stearns  collapsed, a group of bankers who shall go nameless from New York, went  down to Washington and sat with senators from New York and elsewhere and  with Treasury Secretary Paulson, whatever.  And they asked for two things.   They didn't ask for forgiveness for their crazy lending and leveraging,  they didn't ask for forbearance on capital levels, which they were going to  need. </p><p>Instead they asked for a relaxation of the accounting rules, a mark- to-market.  And they asked for a ban or curbs on short selling of their  shares.  And that, to us, was very telling, because it told you where their  mindset was.  It wasn't about what actually they had done on their balance  sheets and they way they had accounted for them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Repo 103?</p><p>CHANOS:  Oh, and all kinds of --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- fine, moving stuff off balance sheet each quarter, what  harm --</p><p>CHANOS:  -- 105 was the least of it.  But I mean, just saying they  were more worried about it being uncovered and/or having to mark things  profitably or -- excuse me, properly.  In fact, I mean, a year earlier than  that, at a G7 meeting, I was asked, along with Paul Singer -- and this is  public information --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  This is the spring of '07?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes and --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- before anything --</p><p>CHANOS:  -- in April of '07, we actually briefed the G7 at their  Washington meetings on -- we were asked to give a talk about hedge funds  and the risks of hedge funds.  And Paul and I gave a presentation on the  looming credit crisis. He did it on the structure of structured finance and  how unstable it was.  And I did it on bank balance sheets and how loaded to  the gills international banks were with the stuff Paul had just talked  about.</p><p>And it was met with, you know, some would say, at best polite applause  or, at most, a stifled yawn.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Now did these guys actually get it?  Or were you talking  way over their -- ?</p><p>CHANOS:  No, no, they got it.  I mean, there were -- there were people  from the Fed there.  There were people, you know, Gordon Brown, the future  U.K. prime minister was in the room.  You know, a future Treasury Secretary  was in the room, future ECB central banker was in the room.  I mean, these  were serious people and I think that --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, which future Treasury Secretary or serious people, I  think, an argument can be made that that Venn diagram has very little  lovelife.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, we'll leave it -- let you make that statement.  But I'm  just saying that that again -- I mean, for people to say that nobody warned  or could see this coming, and Gillian Tett, in her book, \"Fool's Gold,\" has  a chapter on that meeting, which I think is worth the read.  But --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And she was one of the people in the \"FT,\" pounding away  about this long before Lehman and AIG collapsed.  And it was -- you had to  willfully look away if you didn't want to see --</p><p>CHANOS:  Willful blindness, which is a concept I teach in my financial  fraud history class, willful blindness is a very, very strong argument.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- up in New Haven, if memory --</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, I teach at Yale SOM.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And that's great.  That sounds like it must be a  fascinating -- how do you find the kids these days?</p><p>CHANOS:  I think they're -- well, mine aren't kids, because they're  mostly students in their late 20s, but --</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Those are kids.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  I -- it's a great class and I get as much out of it as I hope  they do.  It's a good group and we basically look at some models,  historically, of fraud, academic models and then do case-by-case, going  back to the 1690s.  And it's remarkable as to how these cycles actually  keep repeating with many of the same methods, just right up to date.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So who's uncovered more fraud?  Various regulatory  agencies?  Or hedge funds and others who short?  How do you -- what's that  scorecard look like?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I'd like to say that virtually all major frauds over  the past 20-30 years have really been uncovered by either internal  whistleblowers, journalists and/or short sellers.  Very, very few have been  uncovered by regulatory agencies or law enforcement, very few.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And yet the first thing that happens in the crisis is --  first things we do, blame all the short sellers.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Well, that's -- a friend of mine named Bob Sloan wrote  a great book about that, a history, called \"Blame the Shorts.\" And it has a  long, long storied history also going back to the 1600s where people really  will point fingers to those who have profited when -- when they've lost  money.  And -- and that's human nature, I think.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So now let's sidestep a little bit or -- or just change a  little bit.  We've been talking about accounting fraud.  We haven't even  gotten to the role of the accountants, but clearly, the -- the big four,  big five -- I don't even know how many are left -- are major enablers of  what takes place with -- with many of these, uh, shorts, but now let's --  let's focus on the C-suite and corporate management.</p><p>You recently put out a commentary about buy-backs as little more than  financial engineering and speculation in the market by the CEOs of America,  whose track record in dabbling in market timing is especially awful.</p><p>What -- what don't you like about buy-backs?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, first of all, in -- in aggregate, every CEO, of course,  always thinks their stock is undervalued.  We -- we -- we know that.</p><p>But what...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Except when they're selling.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- what worries -- well, well, we'll get to that in a second.</p><p>But what worries me is that corporate America, in aggregate, has pre- tax returns on capital in the mid to high teens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  The long-term expected rate of the equity markets is roughly  half that.  And when corporations are embarked on massive buy-backs across  all industries and all companies, in effect, these CEOs are buying the  stock market.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right?</p><p>So what they're telling you then is -- is unequivocally that they  think that either they're happy to earn the stock market rate of return or  maybe something hopefully better...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Which -- which is half what you would expect...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- their rate of return...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- their rate of return on the margin of any new capital  product is much, much lower -- in fact, half or less, of what -- of what is  stated.  And that does not bode well for the -- the future of profits or  for the quality of earnings reported as current profits.</p><p>There's one additional problem with this whole thing, and that is,  number one, the CEOs making this decision typically have a very short  tenure at companies.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  They're not thinking long-term.</p><p>And number two, we're seeing an increase in insider selling concurrent  with the increase in buy-backs.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So out of one side of the mouth...</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They're saying the...</p><p>CHANOS:  They...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- the companies should be buying stock...</p><p>CHANOS:  But maybe I should be lightening up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- but I'm going to -- right.  That's -- that's it.  You  know, my...</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- my favorite data point on stock buy-backs is that Dell,  now a private company, spent more money on buy-backs than they earned over  their entire...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- lifetime.  That -- that's just an astonishing figure.</p><p>CHANOS:  And I think that -- well, I think you see that in companies  like sears, as well.  But -- but the -- for a lot of companies, the other  problem with this, of course, is is that CEOs are terrible market timers.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  They're always buying back stu -- the previous peak in  corporate buy-back activity was the second quarter of 2007.</p><p>And -- and where was the low?</p><p>The second quarter 2009.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You see the same thing with acquisitions and mergers.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They love to do...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  With inflated stock -- to buy inflated stock...</p><p>CHANOS:  Corporate activity...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE) stuff is cheap...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- follows the market -- basically follows or is coincident  with the market.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  It's not a leading indicator.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So we have buy-backs as financial engineering.</p><p>What about dividends?</p><p>A little more credible than?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, a little bit more credible and -- and I think certainly  where -- any time you see the actual cash go out the door, um, the other  interesting observation we've -- we've made in looking at corporate  financial transactions is that increasingly, we're seeing acquisitions  which are not taken out of most analysts' free cash flow numbers,  acquisitions are replacing CAPEX, corporal -- capital spending or R&amp;D.  So  companies are buying their -- their R&amp;D or their -- their -- their capital.   And that should probably be properly deducted from the free cash flow,  because, in aggregate, corporate America is not growing.</p><p>So they're -- by buying each other, you know, and buying divisions of  each other, in effect, they're -- they're capitalizing their R&amp;D.  Um, and,  I think that that's an interesting obser -- and that particularly applies  for big tech...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- which are perceived as very cheap companies.  If you  actually look at them, the only reason their revenues aren't declining at a  -- at a reasonable rate is because they're -- they're buying other  companies.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  We sort of stated these in the pharmaceutical area...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They quote a bunch of genomics, molecular, go down the  list, as opposed to plowing money into their own R&amp;D...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- OK, let's go out and buy these new...</p><p>CHANOS:  And, again...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and rather than expensing the R&amp;D, they're capitalizing by  purchasing.  They can set it up as goodwill.  And so it's overstating their  earnings.  And that -- that's a key point that we were trying to hone in  on, that -- that companies that grow this way by acquisition are most  likely overstating their earnings meaningfully.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And we've seen a ton of acquisitions, maybe not as much as  at other peaks, but the M&amp;A activity, along with the IPO activity has  certainly picked up fairly appreciably in the past couple of quarters.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, and the M&amp;A activity gives rise, we worry -- we're --  we think and worry, on a really drop in the quality of earnings.  And --  and that, I think, drives a lot of M&amp;A activity, the ability to write down  inventories, write down receivables, write up liabilities and basically  give yourself, in effect, what -- what Herb Greenberg has called a cookie  jar going forward to help manage your earnings.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I've been speaking with James Chanos, chairman of Kynikos  Associates.

That's ritholtz.com.</p><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p>You're listening to Masters In Business on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   This concludes the broadcast portion of our  interview.</p><p>Coming up with our guest, the radio podcast extra.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Today, I've been speaking with James Chanos of Kynikos  Associates.</p><p>And we've been talking generally about short-selling and what it's  like to run short funds.</p><p>What I love to do in these segments, when we finish broadcasting on  the air and go to the podcast, is talk a little bit about you.</p><p>You started in this business as an analyst.  We talked about Baldwin  and eventually Enron.  But when you were an up-and-comer, when you were the  age of the kids you're teaching at Yale, who were your influences?</p><p>Who -- who are formative to the Jim Chanos approach to investment?</p><p>CHANOS:  Um, you know, it's -- it's hard to find lots of people that  you can point to who -- who did what I did.  I mean I -- I was blessed when  I was a young analyst at -- at Gilford Securities doing Baldwin that, um,  we had a number of -- of well-known hedge fund managers who actually were  our clients, people like Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, um, and I got to  meet shortly after that when I moved to New York in '83, Julian Robertson.   One of the people that probably had the most influence on me just passed  away, uh, and that was -- it was sort of the legendary Bob Wilson...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- who was a -- was a -- not only a great investor, but a --  but an amazing philanthropist.  And, uh, I used to have -- I used to have  dinner with him or lunch with him from time to time.  And he was a -- he  had -- he was written up by John Train in \"The Money Masters.\" But he was  of the legendary Resorts International short squeeze.</p><p>But he was a tremendous investor on the long side.  And, um, he  introduced me to people like Dick Gilder here in New York and -- all of  whom early, 30 years ago, you know, I learned from another fellow, Stephen  Peck, who was an amazing investor, a client of mine, a good friend, of  Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Oh, sure.</p><p>CHANOS:  And all these people were just sort of, you know, as I was  getting going in New York, not only were they helpful in terms of their  wisdom and their experience and what not to do and -- but also introduced  me to lots of other people.</p><p>And -- and I think that that, you know, I'm indebted to all of them  and -- and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few people.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So you mentioned George Soros, clients early on.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And Julian Robertson, another legendary hedge fund manager.</p><p>CHANOS:  And Mike -- Mike Steinhardt.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Steinhardt.  Again, another guy, called by some the  greatest trader on Wall Street ever.  I don't know if that's an  exaggeration, but people have said that about him.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, I mean they -- it -- I had the -- the pleasure of  running money for all three of those men.  And -- and they all were  different and a different temperament and -- and -- and I would categorize  them completely different people, but all -- all amazing investors.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Hmmm.  Interesting.</p><p>So you began as an analyst.  You worked with some of the most storied  names.  Obviously, the industry has changed a lot since '83.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  A little bit.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  To think that a relatively unknown analyst at the time and  a relatively small firm could get an audience with a Robertson or a Soros,  that's not the sort of universe that we exist these days.</p><p>CHANOS:  I think it would be a lot harder, I mean but -- but, first of  all, people -- there weren't people putting out short-side research in --  in '80, even in '82 and '83 and -- and, uh, so, you know, I think the --  the Baldwin piece, a number of them were -- were short.  A few of the  people I just mentioned were short that.  So it got me an audience with  them early on, which I think was helpful.</p><p>But, um, I think it would be a lot tougher today.  I mean I started my  -- my own fund when I was 27.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Really?</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And that's 30 -- 30 plus years...</p><p>CHANOS:  1985, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And so that's almost exactly 30 years ago.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And that -- that was just you and a partner and -- and how  big is Kynikos today?</p><p>How many employees...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean we have, I think, 33 employees in -- in New York  and London.  And, uh, and obviously a little bit more sophisticated.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  It was just three of us, uh, at first and the two partners  and a secretary.  And my partner, a wonderful partner at the time who I  brought with me from Deutsche Bank a year into it came to me and said, you  know, I just don't think I -- I can do shorting stocks.  And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And -- and -- and sold his half back to me, um, for a - - for a nominal amount of money.  Uh, and, you know, just walked out the  door and prospered, by the way, mightily since doing his own thing.</p><p>So it -- it -- even when you think you can do it, sometimes you can't.   And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So -- so you mentioned Deutsche Bank in -- in passing.  If  memory serves, they kind of showed you the door, didn't they?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Yes.  In the summer of -- of '85, um, there was a full  page -- a front page...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  \"Journal.\"..</p><p>CHANOS:  -- monster article talking about these evil short sellers and  -- and how they were disrupting these great businesses.  Um, and in the  middle of the article was -- was sort of -- was me.  And a...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And this is even after Baldwin...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- had collapsed and...</p><p>CHANOS:  And after a number of other calls we had made as well.  And  it, um, and so my -- my bosses in Frankfurt woke up that morning to see  that, you know, Satan was working in their New York office.  And I...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I was told a -- I was told, by the end of the day, my  contract, which was coming up, would not be renewed.  I mean they didn't  fire me, but they just simply said, you know, time for you to do something  else.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks, uh, here's your hat.  Watch  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And then the postscript was I think nine of the 10  companies that were mentioned in that piece ultimately either went bankrupt  or were prosecuted for fraud.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And any mea culpa from the right...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- you know, obviously, you know someone is pulling the  strings behind the scenes with that journalist and sends them down the  wrong path.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, I mean we were -- we were -- we were famously short a --  a lot of companies being run by a very aggressive investment bank out of  Beverly Hills at the time.  And I suspect that -- that that may or may not  have had something to do with it.</p><p>Having said all that, (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Are we -- are we talking about Drexel or are we talking  about somebody else?</p><p>CHANOS:  No, we're talking about Drexel.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  OK.</p><p>CHANOS:  And a -- but -- but a -- one of the -- the, you know,  serendipitous aspects was I had a client who had wanted me to run money for  them as -- as a money manager, but because I was at a bank and it was...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You couldn't do it.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- (INAUDIBLE) -- I couldn't do it.  And so when I told them,  yes, I was going to be looking for work, they said, well, why don't we set  you up in business?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Oh.</p><p>CHANOS:  So that's -- that's how -- that's how Kynikos Associates got  started.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's unbelievable.  I love stories like that.</p><p>You know, Ray Dalio has a similar story.  You talk to a number of  people, Jeff Gundlach, there are a lot of people who start in this business  in one direction and, for whatever reason, end up making a turn and it's  enormously successful.</p><p>CHANOS:  I've often taught not only the -- the people who work for me,  but my students that -- that's one of the things about business that you  have to appreciate is that when good fortune, or bad fortune, comes your  way, you have to know how to deal with it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And the bad fortune, you have to -- you have to rebound, you  have to pick yourself up.  But when good fortune comes, you have to grab  it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and take advantage of it, because it will happen a  number of times in your career just out of chance.  And if you don't take  advantage of it, you miss that chance to move your career ahead on -- in a  quantum leap...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and I think that I was fortunate, at the time, in that I  was young, I was not quite married yet.  I was about to get married, but I  didn't have kids.  And often I tell people the time to take risks,  actually, is not after you're established in your career, when you have a  wife and kids and a mortgage...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Too much to lose.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and -- and it's when you're younger and you're given an  opportunity.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Sure.</p><p>CHANOS:  Because if it...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  What...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- works, it's great.  If it doesn't, no one is going to hold  it against you.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And you have the ability...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You -- you lose a year or two.  You can (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS:  You have an ability to get back up.  And in -- particularly  in America, which is an aspirational society, I think people, in many  cases, even if it doesn't work, will admire that you tried.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  When -- when we speak to people from overseas, when we  speak to people in Europe especially, one of the things we hear time and  again, that they admire the most about America is failure isn't a fatal...</p><p>CHANOS:  No.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- scarlet letter here.  You know, henry Ford had five  failed companies...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- before Ford Motor Company.  And the stories at Edison  are legendary.  He had hundreds of failed inventions before that light bulb  finally...</p><p>CHANOS:  As long as your work ethic...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  -- is good and -- and you're honest, people will value your  ideas.  And -- and -- and that is one of the great things about our  society, that -- that I think sets us apart from almost any other developed  economy.  You fail in most other developed economies, you're done.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  That's it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  No second -- no second chapters elsewhere.</p><p>CHANOS:  And that's not the case here at all.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So we talked about when you first launched.  It was two  guys and a secretary.  Today, obviously, a much more sophisticated  multinational entity.  Take us through a -- a day in the life of Jim  Chanos.</p><p>What time do you start work?</p><p>What -- what is your work flow like?</p><p>What do you do throughout the day?</p><p>I get the sense that you're not chained to Bloomberg all day watching  every tick.</p><p>CHANOS:  No, I'm not.  I mean I have a trading desk that does that.   But our -- our portfolio only turns over about once a year, so -- which is  glacial by hedge funds.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  Sure.</p><p>CHANOS:  We're really investors.  So I mean time spent looking at  every tick is not time well spent for me.  Looking at companies is more  important for me.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  By -- by the way, that's a theme that's been pretty  consistent.  I can't begin to tell you how many investors we've spoken to  who all pretty much say, if you -- if you have a good idea and a high  degree of confidence, the day to day noise, that cacophony you mentioned...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- those fluctuations, it's meaningless noise and you have  to have the con -- courage of your conviction.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, I mean you need -- you need to have an intelligence  post, as we do -- and I have a good one -- to -- to -- to point it all out  to you.  But you also need filters and you need to understand.</p><p>And one of the big differences, Barry, in the business now from when  we started was back then, getting the information gave you a leg up.</p><p>So if you read the 10-Q because you got it a day or two before the  rest of the Street and you saw something buried in -- in management's  discussion, you had a piece of information that was, A, public, and, B,  material.  And it might move the stock and -- and there were lots of  instances of that.</p><p>Um, nowadays, the information comes at you with a fire hose.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  I mean it truly does.  And -- and the key is having, A, the  right filters and the right staff and the right ability to -- to pull out  what is the real information from just the absolute, you know, torrent of  water coming at you.  And -- and so that has changed a lot.</p><p>So I mean I -- I'll get up, you know, obviously, the older I get --  and you might appreciate this, you know, I might get a few -- up a few  times at night anyway, but I'll get up, you know, early in the morning and  check the markets and if nothing earth-shaking is happening in Asia or  Europe and we have a desk that's 24-7, you know, I'll go back to sleep.</p><p>And then typically, you know, up -- up again early in the morning and  then it's going through morning news, filings, research that comes in  internally overnight, research that's come in externally overnight, um, you  know, and -- and then the day may, depending on -- on my schedule,  whatever.</p><p>But unfortunately, it's -- it's 24-7, you know, in a way that you know  in that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I get the sense you read a lot throughout your day.</p><p>CHANOS:  I read an awful lot whether I'm on the move or whatever, so,  unfortunately, you know, you -- you have to stay connected.  I'm trying to  get to the point now where I am able to do it for Saturdays, but I'm trying  to make Sundays a non-e-mail, non-electric -- non-electronic day, um, to  just disconnect one day out of the week.  I think that is becoming a little  bit more important and a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's just a recharge day, just a...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, it's just a recharge day...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE) it up a little bit.</p><p>CHANOS:  And in the spring for eight weeks on -- in the afternoons on  Monday, I teach.  And that's been, actually, a -- a wonderful, wonderful  adjunct to what I'm doing for all kinds of good reasons.  And -- and -- and  I think that's been a -- been -- been a wonderful plus.  And my clients and  partners have been very supportive of that -- of that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It -- it's just a change in the routine and it allows you  to mix it up a little bit.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And it -- and it's great to interreact and go back to  history, whether it's my history or history from 300 years ago, though  sometimes it feels like I've lived 300 years.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Um, and -- and, impart, some of the stuff back to a -- back  to students.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So -- so you're teaching at Yale School of Management.</p><p>Am I recalling correctly, did you go undergrad to Yale?</p><p>CHANOS:  I did.  I did.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You did.  OK.</p><p>CHANOS:  I did, years ago.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So you're back -- back in the dorms, effectively?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, well...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- not quite, but I -- I have two -- two sons who went, as  well, and when I told them I was going back to teach and that maybe we  could...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They were horrified.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- live together in -- in like in a con...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- in a condo like back to school...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  They wouldn't even...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- they looked to me horrified until I told them I was  kidding.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's hilarious.</p><p>Um, they're at a -- I'm assuming they're out of school or?</p><p>CHANOS:  One is.  One is still there.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And, um, that's pretty funny.</p><p>So every -- you've been doing this how many years now over the...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- in the springs?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I got on the -- I'm on my fourth year of teaching.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Oh, that's great.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And a -- and a -- it's a lot, as I say, a lot of fun  and it's one afternoon for two months in -- in the spring.  And Yale has  got a brand new business school, so I'll give a plug for that.  And an  amazing new dean and a -- Yale SOM is on the way up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  We have Bob Shiller coming in in a few weeks...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, he's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- he's one of my favorite...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- he's one of my -- he's certainly a tenured -- a tenured  and Nobel Prize winner.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  He's at a different level.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  He -- he's really fascinating...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  I'm the low man on the totem pole in the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You -- you talk about -- but you talk about the psychology  of investing in behavioral economics...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and how (INAUDIBLE).  Here's a guy teaching in the same  place you're teaching who's been one of the key drivers of that philosophy  for a good couple of decades.</p><p>You -- you mentioned the far -- the fund launched in '85.</p><p>CHANOS:  Um-hmm.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's 30 years ago.</p><p>CHANOS:  Almost.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  How has the hedge fund industry changed in that ensuing  period?</p><p>What -- what do you see as big differences?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean the growth, first of all.  I mean it -- we had  a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Enormous.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  We had a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Over $2 trillion now.</p><p>CHANOS:  We started with $16 million in '85 and by -- by 19 -- the end  of 19 -- early '91, we were over $600 million in assets.  And that put us  in the top 10 globally of hedge funds...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Wow!</p><p>CHANOS:  -- of (INAUDIBLE).  And -- and so that -- that tells you just  how small the industry was back then.  Um, the dramatic growth was -- was  in the late '90s and early millennium.</p><p>But it was truly a small handful of people.  Everybody kind of knew  each other in the '80s.  There were...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  A hundred hedge funds, 200 hedge funds?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, maybe no more than 100...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Now it's 10,000...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- maybe...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- something like that?</p><p>CHANOS:  Maybe more than 100 and probably practically, 20 or 30.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and -- and everybody knew everybody.  I mean truly.   And there weren't a lot of -- a lot of real different strategies.  I mean  everybody was pretty much in the equity markets, give or take.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Long, short?</p><p>CHANOS:  Long, short, maybe...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and that was kind of it.  And then -- and, you know, you  had guys like -- like -- like Mike Steinhardt spec -- and Soros speculating  in bonds and currencies, um, but -- but it was, by and large, an equity  driven model.  And a -- and everybody was, at that point, was fairly adept,  both on the long and short side.</p><p>Um, getting institutional investors was a big deal back then.  That he  didn't really started until the '90s.</p><p>So...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So in the '80s, your clients were essentially just high net  worth individuals...</p><p>CHANOS:  High net worth or foreign families because the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So family offices but no sovereign wealth funds yet?</p><p>CHANOS:  Typically not.  You would -- typically not U.S. fun --  families and no sovereign wealth funds.  No endowments.  By and large, no  pension funds.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's amazing.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And everything has completely changed.  Now it's...</p><p>CHANOS:  Completely changed.  All of it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- dominated by big institutions.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Ten thousand hedge funds, although, if you look at the --  the Bell Curve, that is -- that is not a normal Gaussian distribution.   It's effectively those 100 hedge funds capturing 80 percent of the alpha  and then a long tail of underperformance.</p><p>CHANOS:  That's probably -- that's probably right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  The -- the numbers are pretty -- when you look at the  Tremont data and you look at some of the other hedge fund data that's out  there, the funds that are earning their keep are few and far between.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean true alpha is -- is hard to come by, as we all  know.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  For -- for sure.  Well, the -- you know, it's like  expansion in -- in professional sports teams, you go from 22 to 26 teams  and suddenly there's that much talent -- less talent on any one team.  It's  spread around.  And there's sort of a uniform mediocrity.</p><p>But a handful of all stars, you know, there's 100 funds out there that  are just...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- stealing it.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- the only difference is you can't start your own NBA team.   You can start your own hedge fund.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Very easily.</p><p>CHANOS:  That makes it worse.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  All -- all you have to do is talk someone into giving you X  dollars...</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And it's not even -- there's not even a $100 million  minimum.  You could -- you know, the SEC regulates RIAs and others.  If you  have 100 plus, you don't have to do state by state.  It's one regulatory  scheme.  So that's a bogey for a lot of -- you don't even have that on the  hedge fund side.  Anyone with a couple of million dollars can launch a  hedge fund.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Although it is harder.  I mean to -- in -- in -- the  cost of doing business, of getting a real prime broker, I mean...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- (INAUDIBLE) now that I think have -- have, I think, taken  that true start-up out of the -- the industry.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE), in fact, you sort of do need a -- a critical  mass to be considered a -- a, you know, a -- at least viable.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So, obviously the industry has changed dramatically over  the past couple of years.  Let me -- let me throw some of my favorite  quotes, um, of yours -- of yours back at you and see what your...</p><p>CHANOS:  OK.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- reaction is.  Let -- let's talk about timing.  \"In  investing, you could be really right but temporarily quite wrong.\" I love  that line, because I started in the business as a trader and I -- it was  always drilled into my head, hey, either you're right or wrong.</p><p>If -- if you think you're right and the market is going against you,  you're wrong.  But when you're doing fundamental shorting, you're basically  -- our friend Doug Kass calls it variant perception.  You're identifying  what people aren't seeing, or seeing incorrectly...</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and you're going to be wrong for a long time, almost by  identifying that variant perception.  You're wrong for a while by  definition...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, and there's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- before people catch on.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- there's -- there's a big difference.  If you're trading a  position, you know, sort of because of a fundamental view and your time  frame has shortened enough, price tells you everything, almost.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And in a fundamental short position, not only are you  analyzing the company or -- or the -- whatever it is you're analyzing, but  in many cases, you have a management team interposed that's actively  working to -- to -- to prove you're wrong through activities that aren't  necessarily kosher.</p><p>And so there's an added level here of -- of sort of three-dimensional  chess when you're on the fundamental short side because the market won't  necessarily immediately see what you see.  And, in fact, often doesn't.   And -- and that's why most fundamental short sellers will tell you, they're  -- they're often early.</p><p>One additional problem, you have to borrow the shares.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so the ability to effect a short position in reasonable  size for a firm like ours, once everything is clear, may not be given to  you.  And so there -- there are additional hurdles that don't exist in  traditional investing that exist on the short side.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, we mentioned -- I mentioned Doug Kass earlier.  One  of the things he taught me early on, which I would have wish I had known  when I was shorting Lehman, was that you could be short the stock and  you're going to get squeezed.  But if you really want to make a run for it,  you marry a put to that and if you close the short position, you could let  the put run.  It's never going to get called for you.  You're never going  to get squeezed.  You could -- you're paying up for the option, but it's a  way to get, um, that juiced return, because the -- on the short side, the  most you can make is 100 percent.  With options...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, that's actually not true.  But go ahead with it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, what -- well, let's discuss that, because that's a  standard line against short-selling.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, that's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Look, you're shorting at 50, you can only go to zero,  that's 100 percent.</p><p>Why is that wrong?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, because...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Because of leverage and?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, because the ability of -- of -- if you start with a  short position at 100 and -- and with no other cash in your account and you  short the stock and it goes down to 50, OK, you can, without adding any  more cash -- capital to the account, short additional shares.  And if it  keeps going your way, you -- you can compound your return.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But then you're running the risk of -- of...</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- a margin call, a squeeze...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, that's fine.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  But I just want to...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  I want to get the statement (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So you can...</p><p>CHANOS:  That you can't make more than 100 percent on initial capital.   That's not true.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So you can -- with -- if you're actually using the gain in,  um, value, falling stock creates, if you're short, you're then pyramiding  that on top and -- and shorting that with that additional effort.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, you're shorting on -- on -- you're compounding your  profit, in effect.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  So number two, I've also (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  By the way, I've heard that 100,000 times.  You're the  first person who's corrected that.</p><p>CHANOS:  So -- so the -- the -- the other problem, of course, is is  that, you know, I've seen a lot more stocks go to zero than -- than infamy  -- invidimy (ph).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  That -- and that's the -- that's the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  But the -- the key point for your listener, of course, is is  that for what we do, and -- and theoretically, don't try this at home,  kids, we have a portfolio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And a portfolio changes the volatility nature, like any  portfolio will.  There's going to be things that are always working and  things that aren't working.  And so, you know, I -- I think that a -- that  really tells you that -- that a -- that doing this as a professional with a  portfolio approach and watching your country risk, your industry risk and  all those things makes much more sense.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So this leads -- you mentioned something earlier and I want  to address that.  You mentioned you have management actively working  against you in a number of ways.</p><p>One of the things that you were very much in the forefront of was  working with investigative journalists, working with the media to help  uncover fraud.</p><p>How did that first come about?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I'm a -- you know, clear up a misconception here.  I  mean we don't call up or e-mail reporters and say, hey, you ought to be  looking at Enron.  And in the case of Enron, Bethany McLean was talking to  my partner at the time and he said -- and she said, you know, what do you - - what's interesting?</p><p>And -- and -- and Douglas Millett, do you ever really talk to Jim  about Enron?</p><p>And he -- we -- we're real excited about it.  And we -- we really  think there's something there.</p><p>So I mean that -- that often reporters find a way to fundamental short  sellers to -- to ask them, hey, what do you -- what do you think of this or  are you working on something?</p><p>And -- and I think that I'll -- I think there are ways to do that and  -- and not compromise anybody.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  On the other hand, I think there are ways not to do that.   And I think you have to be mindful of -- of that.  And I think there's  approaches.</p><p>Having said all that, I -- I'm a firm believer in the \"U.S.   Constitution\" and -- and anybody has the right to their opinions of  interest.  But you're -- you do not have the right to your own facts.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And I think that that's an important point.  But if you're a  publicly traded company, you have to understand that the marketplace is  going to be a marketplace of ideas and a marketplace of opinions, of...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  We've -- we've seen some litigation against short sellers.   We've seen some litigation against analysts.</p><p>What do you think of that sort of stuff?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean, as I say, no one has the right to -- to trade  on or -- or induce others to trade on information they know to be false.   And that's kind of the -- the bright line that -- that -- that certainly  most -- that all investors need to understand about securities fraud.</p><p>But -- but an awful lot of companies seem to, you know, be upset when  people don't have the approved opinion about that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And, you know, that -- that is not actionable in our court  system.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  One...</p><p>CHANOS:  A...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- one would hope.</p><p>CHANOS:  One would hope.  One would hope.  But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So -- so one of the...</p><p>CHANOS:  The federal courts, by the way, have a pretty strong view on  that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  And they've been on the right side of this, for the  most part...</p><p>CHANOS:  Usually it's people that bring these cases are in state  courts of -- of, you know, varying venues or questionable venues to try to  get state, you know, put this before a jury in a state.</p><p>Federal judges, by and large, look at these things and, for the most  part, toss them out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's the right way to do it.</p><p>So you mentioned earlier about long versus short.  There's a -- a  longer quote I really like, which is, \"I used to think that good short  sellers could be trained like long focused...</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- value investors.  It's the same skill set.  You're  tearing into the numbers.  You're valuing businesses.  You're assigning a  consolidated value and hopefully you see something the market doesn't.\"</p><p>But you've since learned, quote, \"There's a big difference between a  long-focused value investor and a good short seller.  And you mentioned the  differences -- psychology and behavioral finance.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And it...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's a great -- that's a fabulous quote.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and I think that -- and I think that -- that -- as I  said, I've run money for a lot of great investors who have farmed out the  short side to me.  And I've seen that, actually, some of the best value  investors who I've had the pleasure of doing business with are not  particularly good short sellers.  And -- and shouldn't be selling short for  that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  The wrong constitution.</p><p>CHANOS:  They're just -- just the -- they'll obsess over very tiny  positions that have gone against them, you know, that...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- you know, that -- that fear of the stock going to infinity  that we discussed.  And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  By the way, that's the other false statement.  You -- we've  talked about a stock can only lose 100 percent.  I've heard that well when  you're short, your losses are theoretically infinite.</p><p>Well, not if you have a stop loss.  Not if you have a line in the  sand...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, there's in you...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- that you cover...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- there's an even better little argument...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  There -- there's no lock limit up when it comes to  equities.</p><p>CHANOS:  There's an even better little limit that no one talks about.   If you're in a partnership and you're a limited partner, you can only lose  what you put up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's right.  That -- that's your limitation.</p><p>CHANOS:  Which is an argument for investing with short sellers that  way.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Typically a hedge fund as opposed to...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  You know, or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- hiding...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- or buying shares in an offshore corporation.  And -- and - - and that's something, you know, we point out to people, too, that --  that, actually, you can, in effect, get the same limited -- limited down  side by doing it in that structure.  And the general partner takes the  risk, but the prime broker will sell you out long before that ever happens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  That's right.</p><p>CHANOS:  So, again, these are -- these are -- these are...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Myths.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- examples of thinking -- well, they're not myths.  They're  -- they're accurate on the face, but in practicality, they're inaccurate...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- because -- because, again, you structure things to -- to  not let that happen, A, and -- and, B, you can actually get protection  through the structure of -- of the investment vehicle or whatever, to  obviate the -- obviate the -- those risks.</p><p>But having said all that, they do play into behavioral finance.  And - - and I remember very famously, a well-known investor who's an incredibly - - he's got an incredible track record.  I was running some money for him.   And it was in the midst of our disastrous short on America Online in the --  in the late '90s.  And I had...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  A little early.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I had -- I had a small short portfolio I was running for  him.  And -- and AOL was never more than half of 1 percent or 1 percent of  our portfolio, because it was so volatile.  But it just kept doubling and  doubling and doubling.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And we thought it was an accounting fraud, which it turned  out to be.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Yes.</p><p>CHANOS:  And this investor called me repeatedly losing sleep at night  and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Over a half a percent (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- and this one -- and this -- this position was not moving  the needle on his performance at all.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  But he was -- he was -- I think, to the detriment of him  working on other ideas.  And a -- and it -- and -- and that was a real  concrete example, to me, of just why it is that -- that certain people  shouldn't do this, um, because it was bothering him.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They just lack the constitution.  They can't...</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.  It...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- they can't compartmentalize.</p><p>CHANOS:   They didn't -- they didn't need to because he -- he was such  a good investor doing what he did well.  And so for that person, you know,  they shouldn't be doing it.  And -- and I think that it gets back to  exactly what you -- you've -- you've emphasized here, the psychological is  completely different.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So let's -- let's talk about noise, since we -- we've  touched on psychological, this is related to it.  \"I listen to the noise to  make sure there's no new information.  I need to know.  But I don't worry  about most of it.\"</p><p>And I -- I thought that was an interesting con -- concept, when --  when you discussed, relevant to this, analysts' reports, news, rumor mills,  that's where the phrase, \"For a short seller, this is a cacophony of  negative reinforcement.\"</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I -- I love that quote.</p><p>So how do you deal with that noise?</p><p>Do you filter all of it or do you have a staff that says, hey, out of  these 1,000 things, these four or five you should...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- hear?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I mean first of all, if we're getting a piece of new  material or information from a research report, my staff is not doing their  job.  Um, and -- because certainly, I want them reading the company filings  and company press releases going to conferences, you know, and -- and I --  I hope they -- you know, our team is very good -- that -- that I'm reading  it in an internal memo before I'm reading it in a -- in a Goldman Sachs or  Merrill Lynch research piece a week later.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  And that's usually the case 99 percent of the time.</p><p>Having said all that, you have to be mindful of what the Street is  saying.  You have to be mindful of what you're going up against.  And I --  and I think that that's important.  And one of the things we do is we do  talk to the Street.  We have them into our offices.  If we have an unusual  thesis or hypothesis on a company, we'll have the sell side in and to lay  it out...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They're pitching you the other side of the equation?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, well, we know what they're pitching.  I mean you know,  it's not -- and one of the good asymmetries of the short side -- and there  aren't that many of them, one of the good ones is is that if you're  fundamentally a short seller, you have no problem finding out what the bull  case is.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  It's easy to find out.</p><p>But if you long that stock, you might have to really kind of dig to  find out what the real bear case is on it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and a -- and so it's another one of these influential  asymmetries that I think works for the fundamental short seller.  There are  a few others.  We don't have to disclose our positions.  I think that's a  very important one, actually.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You know, there was a -- a movement afoot not too long ago  to force short sellers to disclose their positions.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and the Europeans have it in terms of -- of certain  thresholds, for example.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  Now the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But you're never short 10 percent of the outstanding stock?</p><p>CHANOS:  No, although we've -- we've...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  (INAUDIBLE) company...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- we've crossed the European thresholds a few times, because  the thresholds are very...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But that's a fairly low.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- they're very -- they're very low.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Two percent, 3 percent, something like that?</p><p>CHANOS:  Oh, I think it's a -- no, it's .5 percent or (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Is it that low?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  It's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I had no idea.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- it's really low.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's a...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- on some of them yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Wow!</p><p>CHANOS:  It's quite low on some of them.  Well, the reason is is that,  first of all, the IRS doesn't look at short positions as positions.  It  looks at -- it looks at it as in a commercial transaction, where you're  borrowing money, interestingly enough.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It -- it's a margin trade, it's a loan (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, because you don't own anything.  You don't -- you -- you  have a promise to -- to -- to pay something back.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  To repay...</p><p>CHANOS:  Shares.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so it's considered...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- instituted indebtedness.  Yes.  And so -- and which is why  the short sellers have no -- no standing at the bar, the securities bar.   We don't own anything.  And -- and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- now I would argue even further, I'm a little surprised  that my brethren in the hedge fund world have not actually challenged the  13 F, G and H regime.  I...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Sections of the SEC code?</p><p>CHANOS:  Code -- mandating disclosure over $100 million of your long  positions.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  Because, I mean I understand why the 13D need for change in  corporate control.  I think any reasonable person...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- would understand that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's right.</p><p>CHANOS:  But why is it that -- that all these great investors, every  90 days, should give the public a free look at what they're doing?</p><p>They're pay -- their clients pay for that.  And if you don't trade a  lot, say you're a value investor, um, well, if you don't trade a lot, that  portfolio doesn't trade a lot.  And there are people out there basically  with services now to replicate your portfolio for nothing, or very little,  that you have people paying good money for.</p><p>And I've always said, you know, Coca-Cola doesn't have to put its, you  know, formula on -- on -- on the Web and Microsoft doesn't have to issue  its source code, why should managers, either hedge fund or otherwise, have  to tell the public what -- what -- what's the public's interests?</p><p>I understand the SEC and law enforcement should have every right to  see it at any time.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  In other words, 13D filings go to the SEC and it stops  there, they don't get put on the Web?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, 13D filings, I think, change in corporate control,  that's fine.  I mean people publicly should know that.</p><p>But why is it that a passive money manager should tell the public...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Six percent of -- more than 5 percent position, why...</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- why disclose that?</p><p>CHANOS:  You know, their -- all their positions, all of their  positions.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  OK, so let's clarify that.  I'm under the impression they  do a filing at 5 percent?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, a 13D.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  OK.  So let's say they have a 2 percent position.</p><p>They have to disclose that?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  What happens if they're offshore?</p><p>CHANOS:  Of -- if you're a U.S. money manager, you've got to disclose  your positions of $100 million.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Huh, that's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, so -- so -- so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Is it a fund above $100 million or a fund...</p><p>CHANOS:  A position...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- a position above $100 million?</p><p>CHANOS:  A fund $100 -- of $100 million.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Really?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Again, I don't understand why the money management  industry hasn't gone and said this is, in effect, a, you know, possibly a  takings clause in \"The Constitution.\"</p><p>Why is it that the public gets to see what I'm doing?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You're -- you're...</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- forcing me to turn over my intellectual property with no  compensation.</p><p>CHANOS:  And if you don't short a lot of stocks, then if you're just a  long lonely manager, you're giving away your entire business plan every 90  days.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's really interesting.  And I hadn't thought of that in  a...</p><p>CHANOS:  Absolutely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- in that context.</p><p>CHANOS:  Absolutely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So the accusation is that Wall Street owns Congress and  they can get DC to do whatever they want.  And it's not all that far from  the truth.</p><p>Why is this so difficult to change?</p><p>You would think, hey, any major change in ownership, anything over --  pick a percent.  It doesn't even have to be 5 percent.  If you owe more  than 3 percent, you need to at least disclose it when you cross that line.</p><p>Um, but after that, why does it have to be completely...</p><p>CHANOS:  I'm a little...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- disclosed?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- you know, well, first of all, hedge funds don't have the  clout that -- that -- when -- when you say Wall Street does...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- we're talking about major -- major banks and -- and  investment banks.  They're the ones with the clout.  Hedge funds don't --  still don't have that much clout in Washington.</p><p>So I think that's number one.</p><p>But, again -- and -- and mutual funds, of course, like it because it  actually helps their marketing.</p><p>You know, here's our portfolio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Sure.</p><p>CHANOS:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Absolutely.</p><p>CHANOS:  I just -- but I -- I've always wondered at why a -- why hedge  funds have just sort of rolled over on this and said well, you know, well,  I guess, you know, we've got to do it.  And you do have to do it.  But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, I'll tell you what the answer is.  The answer is  merely knowing what Jim Chanos' long or short isn't the same as having Jim  Chanos manage that position for you.  And the same is true for any hedge  fund that's out there.  If it was the case, everybody would be generating  alpha by imitating the Dalio's, Tepper's, obviously Renaissance Technology  doesn't hold onto anything long enough for a filing to go through.</p><p>But still, if it was that easy just to say let me see what Chanos  owns, great, I'll own that...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, one would argue that that's actually why the alphas may  have dropped and a -- and so, I'm not so sure.  It will...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Because everybody was...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- clearly for trading...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- (INAUDIBLE) to it.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- clearly for trading shops, it -- it's superfluous.  And  for shops that do a lot of fundamental shorting, it's -- it's meaningless,  because, for example, you use...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You want that out there anyway?</p><p>CHANOS:  When you see my longs, I file them in my Opportunity Fund,  which is our long short.  And if you look at my longs, you'll scratch your  head and go why is Chanos long in that thing, that looks crazy?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And not understanding there's two shorts against it that are  even crazier.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right, and that happens to be the best system -- systematic  hedge for that position.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Um, so it can be -- it can be very misleading to people.  And  that's the other reason then, why do it?</p><p>If it's misleading because you're both long and short, you're not  doing anybody a service.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  If it's not misleading because the guy is just simply a long  only person, why does the public have the right to that information for  free?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Those are the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS:  There's a lot of arguments against this that -- and -- and  the argument for it typically is well, it's for more -- don't we want more  transparency?</p><p>And I would argue, no, not necessarily.  Um, but I particularly if --  if you're basing a business on -- on intellectual capital and you're  charging people for that, I don't see what the public interest is in  putting out possibly misleading information.</p><p>One of the problems, when you have the limits where people have to  disclose where they go through limits and up and down, you actually --  people can game that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- knowing themselves they've gone through the limits.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so I've explained that to the European regulators, that - - that these short threshold limits themselves can be disruptive just  because they exist.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So let's veer into a dangerous territory.  Let's talk a  little bit about politics, Washington, DC, the regulatory environment.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You're known as a guy who's a pretty active, uh,  participant in politics.  You've made the comment that you've been -- I'm  paraphrasing -- you've been fortunate enough in your career to have  accumulated a sum of money and you feel obligated to respond, to give back,  to participate in democracy.</p><p>What -- what attracted you to that given how dysfunctional DC has  been?</p><p>Is it something you're still interested in?</p><p>Talk a little bit about that.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I mean I'm certainly not interested in politics  personally.  I -- I'm interested in the process.  I always have been.  I --  and first of all, let me say, I think the system is broken.  I think the  whole system of campaign finance is broken.  And I would love a law that  says I can't write any checks.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  Well, the...</p><p>CHANOS:  But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- Supreme Court has basically...</p><p>CHANOS:  Has gone towy.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- you could write, Jim Chanos...</p><p>CHANOS:  It's free speech.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- who wants more than a couple of bucks, write...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- write all the money you want (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  I think -- and I think that that -- that while that may  be a constitutional freedom, it's one we ought to reexamine, because it  raises agency risks and lots of issues of inequality.  But -- but we're not  here to discuss that.</p><p>The problem is is that if that's -- if that's the legality of the game  and -- and you feel strongly about -- about things politically, um, and you  want to support them, fine.  Uh, you know, I -- we pick our spots.</p><p>On the other hand, um, I think that -- that a -- that the country, you  know, actually needs people to be involved in politics.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And I think that -- that it's not about access or influence,  it's about, in our case, because we never asked for anything...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, stop a second.  When you say you never ask for  something, you want to influence the process a little bit, then you -- you  derailed the question I was about to ask you, because you said you never  ask for something, which was what would you like to see changed?</p><p>What area...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- of policy...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, for example...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- could you move on the needle on?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- well, for example, I -- I've publicly said I -- I think  that carried interest should be raised.  The tax on carried interest should  be raised.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So this -- this is the advantage that private equity and  hedge fund managers have...</p><p>CHANOS:  On long-term cap -- gain allocations and performance fees  being treated as long-term capital gains.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So they're -- they're taxed at -- it used to be 15 percent,  now it's 23...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, whatever.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- or so.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But it sure as hell ain't for -- the joke that Warren  Buffett says as he pays a lower tax rate...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- than his secretary.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  And I -- and I think a lot of these -- so -- so I  would, you know, you would argue...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So why hasn't that been changed?</p><p>You would think that's the -- the most egregious stroke of the pen  thing to change?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, you'll have to ask the people that don't want to change  it.  I don't know.  The -- the -- there are a lot of issues that are out  there like that that I think you would be kind of surprised as a Wall  Streeter that I support, but I -- that are counterintuitive.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Give me -- give me another one.  Let's -- let's...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You're -- you're one of these -- I can just hear Bill  O'Reilly saying...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- you're one of these limbers -- limer -- limousine  liberals who really feels guilty about having money.</p><p>CHANOS:  You know, I don't feel guilty at all about having money.  I - - trust me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  I -- I feel blessed and -- and I know I'm fortunate.  And --  and not at all.  And the -- but I do think the level of discourse in this  country needs to be reopened.  And I think we -- we've -- we've put both  parties in this -- this sort of truly bipolar area there where no one wants  to meet in the middle anymore.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  A lot due to campaign finance reasons and -- and the  primaries.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's the underlying problem that, you know, the old joke  is that Reagan and Tip O'Neill would argue all day, they'd go out at night,  have a beer and the next morning there would be legislation signed.  That  sort of cross-pollination...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, look, apparently that story was a bit apocryphal.   Apparent, there wasn't -- it wasn't that simple with those two.</p><p>But -- but I know what you mean...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But they did get -- they did get...</p><p>CHANOS:  I know what you mean.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- they did get -- meet in the middle.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  Well, what...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  They did get things accomplished.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- well, what's changed is the Senate, really, if you know  Washington, in that -- that the House has always been pretty -- a pretty  bipartisan place and -- and it's always been pretty raucous in terms of  hardened attitudes and -- and -- and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, that's -- do you mean a partisan there's that...</p><p>CHANOS:  It's much more partisan.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- the Senasin -- the Senate is bipartisan and the House  was partisan.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, the Senate -- the Senate, until about 20 or 30 years  ago, was a place in which people crossed party lines all the time and voted  their conscience and voted the way they really felt on the issues and  weren't penalized for it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and -- and so senators really were that -- that upper  house that said, OK, we -- we're a little bit older, a little bit more  experienced, we're -- we -- we -- more confident of our reelection or our  tenure and if -- if I want to vote on civil rights even though I'm -- I'm a  hard -- I'm in the Republican Party, I -- I do.  And that happened.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS:  But now the Senate is just as fractious as the House.  And --  and senators worry about reelection or getting very liberal or very  conservative challengers.  Again, part of it's the campaign finance issue,  part of it's the -- the redistricting of -- for the representatives.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Gerrymandering, as well.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so -- so the -- the whole idea that there was an upper  house that was sort of, you know...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  The adult supervision.</p><p>CHANOS:  The adults, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  The adults that were getting policy done is -- is changed, as  well.  And so it's added to the acrimony.  It's added to the gridlock.  And  -- and I think it's just added -- it's -- it's not put us in a good place.   And I think that that's -- and I've supported Republican candidates that I  think are moderates, as well, so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  How -- how do we fix this?</p><p>How do we repair...</p><p>CHANOS:  I think you...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- campaign finance?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I think you have to start, you know, with some sort of  reform.  And I think, you know, unfortunately, a family member who is --  who has been in politics also pointed this out correctly, you also have to  do something about term limits, because other -- if you do have campaign  finance limits, term limit -- anybody with an incumbency becomes more  important.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so you have a do I -- you have an advantage being an  incumbent...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Ninety-nine percent or 98 percent reelection rate...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  So...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- in the House.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- so I mean we -- that -- that -- it's -- it's a tricky  issue.  But just throwing more and more unlimited amounts of money, I  think, doesn't help the issue.  It makes -- I think it makes it worse.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And what do you do -- so, in other words, you have a system  that's broken, nobody from either party is going to -- willing to work with  the other party...</p><p>CHANOS:  But nobody can turn the money down (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And at the same time the Supreme Court...</p><p>CHANOS:  It's an arms race.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- is -- has -- has basically lit that fuse and said go for  it then...</p><p>CHANOS:  And it's an arms race.  So therefore, I mean you can't -- if  you don't spend, you're not going to have an equal chance -- seat at the  table.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And so it's just...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You have no choice, you have to.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- it's just this vicious cycle.  And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So how do you break that?</p><p>How do you...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, as I say, I'd leave it up to the politicians and the  legal scholars, but at some point, you're going to need a piece of  legislation or a constitutional amendment or something that -- that's going  to have to change this system.  And I -- I don't know -- I don't know any  other way around it.  If you have a Supreme Court that keeps saying this is  an a -- the legislation is unconstitutional, then you're going to have to  change the \"Constitution.\"</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  And -- and that's a challenge.  That's quite a  challenge...</p><p>CHANOS:  It's a big challenge.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- to get that done.  It probably has to get a lot worse  before it gets better.</p><p>CHANOS:  You know, that's a scary thought.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Let -- let me tack policy to one other place, because we  spent this whole afternoon chatting and China has never come up.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.  Where's that?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And you, very famously, um, identified, I want to say four  years ago, is that -- is that right?</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, it was the end of '09, early 2010.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Basically said China is a -- a big house of cards, building  these ghost cities, they're spending all this policy money, they're not  that good at it.  Their economy has been so robust that it's covered up a  lot of these credit errors.</p><p>What do you think is going on with China today?</p><p>By the way, China's stock market today at a four or a six week high,  but it's shellacked over that period.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It's down 40 percent.  China, while the rest of the world  has rallied substantially, has gone the exact opposite way.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Almost cut in half.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, people have always ask -- still ask us, well, what do  you think, you know, when are you going to be right?</p><p>You've been early.  And I keep saying if you look at the Chinese  market...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It's got -- China has gotten crushed over the past few  years.</p><p>CHANOS:  It's the -- it was the best place to be short in the last  four years.</p><p>Um, look, everything that we saw in China, at -- at the end of '09 and  2010 is basically now twice as bad.  That's kind of the way I put it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  It hasn't gotten better.</p><p>CHANOS:  It -- it's gotten worse.  The -- the debt to GDP has gone  from over 100 percent of GDP to over 200 percent.  Back in -- in '09, there  was 5.6 billion square meters of high rises under development and  (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  5.6 billion?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- 6 billion square meters.  That's 60...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Uh-huh.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- billion square feet.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Wow!</p><p>CHANOS:  Now, the number is twice that.  It's 10.6 billion square --  square meters under development at the end of 2013.</p><p>So everything that we saw then that was bad, and I think it -- it was  bad, is, in effect, twice as bad now.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Don't they have...</p><p>CHANOS:  When we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- hundreds of millions of people to move off the farm?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, the problem is, is the hundreds of millions of people  can't afford the stuff that they're -- that's being built.  They're  building high end condos, uh, shopping malls, high speed rail.  It's only  the -- the top 5 percent of people in China that can afford that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And that's the -- that's the -- the sort of paradox here.   I'll give you just an idea of -- of what's changed in four years.  When we  started looking at China, the Chinese GDP in dollar terms was about $7  trillion US.  And the total...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Not too shabby.</p><p>CHANOS:  Not -- and the to -- total amount of bank -- assets in the  banking system in China was $9 trillion.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  OK.</p><p>CHANOS:  So it was a little bit over 100 percent.</p><p>Now, the GDP is about $9 trillion and the total assets in the Chinese  banking system are about $24 trillion.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Wow!</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, a meaningful difference.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And that's a...</p><p>CHANOS:  So they've had to employ...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- that's a lot of...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- they've had to employ more and more debt to get the  growth.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  I was going to say, this isn't capital, this is...</p><p>CHANOS:  This is the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- credit.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- total assets, total assets.  It's just basically a proxy  for -- for credit outstanding.  And so increasingly, they've had to employ  more and more debt to -- to drive their growth.  And -- and -- and that's  because the model is based on 50 percent investment to GDP.</p><p>So if you think about that, that means that -- that if they -- if it  takes them two years to finish a project, that means that one quarter of  your GDP every year rolls off and has to be replaced with a -- digging a  new hole in the ground somewhere.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well -- well, that's while they were at 12 percent GDP  growth four years ago and -- and the most recent data is closer to 6.5, 7  percent.</p><p>CHANOS:  Seven, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Yes.</p><p>CHANOS:  It is, because it -- and -- and so the soft...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And by the way, we would kill for 7 percent GDP.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, well, the 7 percent is a little misleading, too, though,  because, again, 7 percent, the consumer is still declining per GDP.  So the  7 percent is only really coming from -- from the fact that they're still  building stuff.  And -- and now, it's beyond a shadow of a doubt, even --  even Chinese officials or died in the wool bulls will tell you, they've got  to change that, they've got to reform this.  And they've got to get away  from this investment-driven model.</p><p>The question is, how?</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  How and what do they replace it with?</p><p>CHANOS:  Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  You know, the -- the key -- the fascinating thing about  China, or let me flip that around, the interesting thing about U.S.  manufacturing, we started seeing signs of this about five years ago, be  fracking blew up, before natural gas was everywhere.  But natural gas  prices had dropped and we were hearing about companies relocating in the  U.S., setting up a natural gas electrical generator.  One of the big  complaints you hear about China is a lack of consistent electrical  availability.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Not only 24-7, but a consistent amperage and wattage...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, peak -- peak usage.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and it fluctuates and...</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and you have to set up a series of electronics just to  get a steady whatever it is, 120 and 60.  So in the U.S., you run a natural  gas pipeline near a factory, you set up an electrical code generation  plant, you're effectively getting unlimited, very low cost energy and you  don't have to take three weeks to ship your product to the States.</p><p>And that's...</p><p>CHANOS:  Well...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- started as a -- as labor prices started to go up...</p><p>CHANOS:  And Chinese wages have gone up, too.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- what happens when wages go from $1 a day to -- to $25 a  day?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, that's -- that's what's happened.  In fact, net -- net  exports in China, when I first started looking at China, net exports were  12 percent of GDP, exports minus imports.  Now, it's almost down to 0.   Now, it's a couple percent.</p><p>And so -- so the impact that China, as an exporting engine, is already  diminished on their GDP.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's amazing.</p><p>CHANOS:  And they've offset it now -- they've offset it with more and  more investment.  So the story in China is not export anymore, the story in  China is this giant building project, the property building.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Can -- can you grow a middle class in a -- a country that  size and use that the way the U.S. post-World War II -- you know, we had a  50 year run after World War II, where the middle class boomed like never  before.  And it was a period of tremendous economic growth.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.  But we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Can China do that?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, we were already past the middle income trap at that  point, though.  We -- we passed that in the -- the late 19th, early 20th  century.</p><p>I mean China is still facing that.  And -- and how do you get people  from the sort of $5,000 to $7,000 per capita...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- income level to -- to $30,000 or plus?</p><p>And -- and that's always the tricky point in -- in economic  development is -- is the, you know, basically, there's four phases of  economic development, Barry.  You've got, basically, you educate the  population from illiteracy to secondary school education.</p><p>Second, you move people from rural areas to urban.</p><p>Third, you employ capital where it never -- capital has never been  employed.  That's where we are in China right now.</p><p>And the fourth and the way that South Korea and Japan and post-war  Germany, post-war is you finally begin to innovate and make products that  the rest of the world wants and be more productive.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And that's the tricky part.  And that's where most countries  can't surmount.  They get to the third point, but they can't get to the  fourth point, where they become truly innovative and -- and -- and it --  the Asian tigers all fell by the wayside, for example, in the mid-'90s...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- with the exception of South Korea and -- and Singapore.   The rest all -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, basically...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Vietnam...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- stalled out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  Um, that's where we are with China right now.</p><p>The three countries post-World War II were Japan, Germany and the  Soviet Union.  They all were pretty much destroyed by the war.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Uh-huh.</p><p>CHANOS:  They had to rebuild.  They had to start from scratch.  You  know, they already had educated workforces.  They already had urban  centers.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  But they had to basically put capital to work again, which  they did.  And Germany, in the '60s and Japan in the '70s began to innovate  and produce world-class products that everybody wanted.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  For sure.</p><p>CHANOS:  The Soviet Union didn't.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  And China, the question is, will China ever be able to do - - be more than just a -- a high end...</p><p>CHANOS:  A manufacturing base.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- that's it.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and the -- and/or employ capital in a non-impressive  way to build empty buildings and condos and things like that.  And that's  what they're doing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So the quote you had about China, I'll -- I'm curious if  you still think this is true.  \"The Chinese banking system is built on  quicksand.\"</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes.  It's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Is it still true?</p><p>CHANOS:  -- I just think it's -- it's more true than ever, um, in --  in that there's just -- the bad loans are there.  There's legacy bad loans  they didn't address from even 10 years ago.  Um, they are telling you with  a straight face that non-performing loans are, you know, less than 1  percent.  Um, and -- and yet, you just see the madness of some of these  projects and the fact that defaults are starting now left, right and center  and they'll look at you with a straight face and say, oh, no, no, our non- performing loans are not a problem.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So I can sit here and continue speaking to you for a couple  more hours.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  But I know your assistant will kill me if I keep you here  past 4:00.  So I -- I just wanted to end on one last question.  And before  I forget, I want to thank you  for being so generous with your time.  I  know people are going to find this a fascinating conversation.</p><p>The -- the last question I want to ask you is really general and open- ended.  Um, the industry of Wall Street, finance, investment banking,  investing has changed dramatically over the past 30 years and especially  over the past five years.</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  What do you see happening in this industry going forward?</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, I -- I kind of would like to think we're seeing our  limits on it, because -- and it's always -- it's always a little bit  hypocritical to talk -- talk, you know, negatively about what you do for a  living, but I think that -- that the nature of finance, in and of itself,  as a profit center or a big part of the economy is sort of self-defeating.</p><p>And -- and I think that we've gotten kind of to the limits, I suspect,  of where finance can go to push the U.S. economy.  I mean I think it hit  its peak in '06-'07, uh, in terms of finance as a percent of corporate  profits and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  The argument is -- that I've made is the bailouts prevented  that process of...</p><p>CHANOS:  You know, clearing...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- converting back to...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- of clearing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Yes.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- the market clearing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Yes.</p><p>CHANOS:  Yes, and I would agree with you on that.  And I read, you  know, I remember at the time you were writing that and you were right.  And  I agree with it.  And I think that -- that unfortunately, finance becoming  a big part of the economy in terms of taking deposits, making loans, all of  that stuff, puts it in this too big to fail category broadly speaking,  where -- where ironically enough, it cannot be subject to the -- the -- the  whims of capitalism itself, creative destruction, because it would just be  systemic.</p><p>And so we -- we build this monstrous Rube Goldberg like contraption  that is completely ludicrous and then say we can't let it fall apart...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  So...</p><p>CHANOS:  -- because it will impact everything else.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- so too big to fail, too much leverage, too little  capital...</p><p>CHANOS:  Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  -- and yet not subject to the laws of capital.</p><p>CHANOS:  Well, let's leave it at this.  If we look at those -- those  dark days of '08 and '09, the one industry that actually went through  bankruptcy was the auto industry.  And I always chide my friends in White - - at the White House and -- who say, oh, well, the auto bailout was smart.</p><p>And I keep saying, you know, no, it wasn't an auto bailout.  I was  short the -- the auto stocks.  Shareholders were wiped out...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- the boards were -- were dismissed.  The executives were  fired.  They brought in new teams, they recapitalized the companies, the  government put in debtor in possession financing...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- which was post-bankruptcy.  Now, we can argue about the  unions' role in that, that employees were given seniority.  But in many  bankruptcies, in...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's typical.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- employees are...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  That's not atypical.</p><p>CHANOS:  -- given preference.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.</p><p>CHANOS:  And -- and, in fact, we did exactly what capitalism should  have said we did, we recapped the industry and we made it more viable going  forward.</p><p>The people who took risks in the past, you know, paid the price.</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Right.  That's exactly right.</p><p>CHANOS:  But it worked.  It actually worked better, I think, than what  we've had in finance coming out of this, which was...</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Well, we had -- we had a Treasury secretary that was from  finance.  And so industry gets bankruptcy, finance gets bailouts.  If it  was reversed, if you had the head of a railroad or a head of a  manufacturing plant, I can't guarantee you that GM and Chrysler would have  been put through bankruptcy, but I can guarantee you that Citi and Bank of  America and Merrill and Morgan would have been treated the way financiers  treated manufacturers.</p><p>CHANOS:  But then we might not have had this beautiful new Bloomberg  headquarters.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ:  Uh, I think this predates it.  This was up long before  that.</p><p>CHANOS:  I know it was.

This is Barry Ritholtz and this week I am thrilled to have sat down with Jim Chanos, hedge fund manager at Kynikos Associates for a very interesting and in-depth conversation; after we were done recording the radio portion, Jim sat around and we kept the tape running. And there's a ton of podcast extras. So after the show is done, be sure and listen to the rest of it. I think it's about 14 hours. And it's really -- anytime you get the chance to sit at the knee of somebody like Jim Chanos and ask questions and see where they go, you don't want to stop the tape running. He spoke for a long time and it was absolutely fascinating.</p><p>I don't know how many of you who are listening to this know Jim Chanos or are familiar with his work. But really it's a fascinating legacy. This is a guy who was an early short seller, who was an early critic of some of the worst excesses of Wall Street, whether it was misbehavior of analysts or accounting fraud or things that companies were doing, that were defrauding and misleading investors.</p><p>Jim has the combination of a accountant's ability to dive into the numbers and detective's ability to sniff out nonsense. And he has done it throughout his whole career. He's identified a number of tremendous frauds and scams, whether it was Baldwin Piano, which ran an insurance scam on the side, Enron WorldCom, go down the whole list. He has really been crucial to investors in ferreting out fraud and using his skill set to make money for his investors by basically identifying short selling opportunities where there's some bad behavior, fraud, whatever it is.</p><p>So this is a wide-ranging and fascinating conversation that I was thrilled to have. Be sure and check out the podcast extras afterwards. And on with the show.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Today I am thrilled to bring you someone who you may not know who he is, but you actually should. His name is Jim Chanos. He is the manager of -- let me see if I'm pronouncing this correctly -- Kynikos Associates. That's Greek for \"cynic.\" And Jim has built a reputation over 30 years as a spotter of wrongdoing and fraud, a short seller, somebody who's identified a lot of problems with various companies in the market.</p><p>Jim, welcome to the show.</p><p>JAMES CHANOS, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, KYNIKOS ASSOCIATES: Thanks, Barry. Glad to be here.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So I've wanted to have you on for a long time because most of the people we speak to are long-term, mostly long only investors, who are looking at here's what you need to do to save money for retirement, or if you're a pension fund or an endowment, here's what you do -- need to do to make sure you stay ahead of inflation.</p><p>But your approach as a short seller is completely different.</p><p>Why don't you describe that so people have an idea of what you actually do in Kynikos Associates?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, one way to describe it, Barry, is that we are a long-term potential purchasers of equities.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I like that.</p><p>CHANOS: The whole idea of fundamental short selling really is select a portfolio of securities, mostly stocks, that are fundamentally overvalued no matter what the market does. that these are companies that, through the normal ebbs and flows of capitalism, are on the downside of their cycle.</p><p>And our clients, primarily, are institutions who use us as a hedge to their core equity portfolio. And so therefore it allows them to be a little bit more aggressive in their equity exposures, knowing that they have part of the portfolio in a small group of companies that will go down over time -- we hope and we think --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You expect. So the people who are listening to this, who are in the industry, certainly know who you are. But regular investors, radio listeners may not know who you are.</p><p>So let me discuss your curriculum vitae for a second. You first came into the public eye as an analyst at -- was it Gilford (ph) Securities way back when?</p><p>And you had identified one of Wall Street's favorite stocks, which at the time was an insurance company called Baldwin and you had essentially figured out that it was a sham. It was a giant insurance scam that was cooking their books -- this is a theme we'll come to again and again -- and people mocked the call, \"The Wall Street Journal\" had a pretty aggressive articulate that pretty much trashed your analysis and ultimately you had the last laugh, because it's almost quaint to say at the time, when Baldwin went bankrupt, at $9 billion, it was the largest bankruptcy in history, although we know, oh, $9 billion, that's adorable compared to what we've seen since then.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, back then it wasn't so adorable.</p><p>Well, Baldwin was -- Baldwin United was the old Baldwin Piano Company, which had morphed under very charismatic CEO into an aggressive seller of insurance products, particularly annuities, through Wall Street.</p><p>And therefore it became a Wall Street darling in the early '80s on the back of not only the rapid earnings growth, but also because Wall Street was being paid by Baldwin.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Five percent commission on a policy --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that buys a lot of goodwill on the street --</p><p>CHANOS: Well, it does. And particularly when you're offering yields on these insurance products that were as high as 14 percent. The problem was Baldwin wasn't earning anything close to that in its insurance portfolios. So they ultimately had to begin doing acquisitions and getting insurance department approval to fund those acquisitions with insurance company money, which is highly, highly unusual.</p><p>And that was the beginning of the end for them.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you were a kid then.</p><p>How old were you when you made that call?</p><p>CHANOS: I wrote -- my sense of timing was impeccable. I put out my first solo recommendation on the company on the absolute bottom of the market, the day that Henry Kaufman (ph) said buys stocks in August of 1982. I think it was August 17th of 1982.</p><p>I said sell the -- or sell this thing short. And --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: About 25 bucks, is that about right?</p><p>CHANOS: I think it was about $25. It went briefly to $20 and then straight to $55.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Doubled.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, it was a good -- it was a good initiation into fundamental short selling. But the interesting thing about that story was we -- first report when we did a follow-up report was that a lot of the radioactive aspect of Baldwin was hiding in plain sight. It was -- it was -- you could see it if you looked at the publicly available documents the SEC filings and their insurance company statements, which were public.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So here's the question you're going to hear me ask you repeatedly this afternoon.</p><p>How is it that this was in plain view, a $9 billion fraud, and nobody else could spot it?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, first of all, it wasn't in a lot of people's interest to spot it because the analysts who were covering the company most closely and had buy ratings on this thing were also working for the firms that sold the annuities. So it was also a good introduction to the whole concept of conflict of interest.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: To say the least.</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>And number two, you had to do a little bit of digging. And I think in many ways, not being insurance analysts, just being a young analyst who was learning about insurance, I just simply kept asking questions of things that didn't seem to make sense to me. And most of the answers had -- were logical but every once in a while, it would come back with something that was just simply nonsensical.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That sounds very familiar. That reminds me a little bit of what took place so in the future with Enron.</p><p>So this was '82. Most people probably this never entered their radar.</p><p>But Enron, on the other hand, entered a lot of people's radar and in fact that's probably how anyone who's a member of the public or the investing community who knows you probably found you through Enron, which is a remarkably similar story.</p><p>CHANOS: It was. And in what would seem even more interesting about it was that not only were the facts at Enron hiding in plain sight -- there's been a lot written about that -- but Enron, using their mark-to- model accounting, where they pulled forward future profit estimates, Baldwin was doing the same exact thing with its annuities. They were estimating a spread of income -- which they weren't earning, of course --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Which may or may not have existed, depending on future --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- and then they -- and then they estimate how long the policies would stay on the books and they took the present value and they sold the policy. And so --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right, not accounting for the fact that interest rates fluctuate and other factors --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they were writing this down as if it was money good.</p><p>CHANOS: Right, exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Coming up, we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, manager of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. And today I'm speaking to famed short seller Jim Chanos.</p><p>We were talking a little bit about how Enron was so similar to Baldwin. And you had mentioned, you read the 10(k), you read the annual report, you read the quarterly report three times. You still have no idea what they hell they do.</p><p>CHANOS: Right. The other -- the other interesting similarity was they both had charismatic leaders, who were very bright; Baldwin had a guy by the name of Morley Thompson (ph) and -- who went from literally peddling pianos door-to-door. (INAUDIBLE) good salesmen to sell pianos door-to- door.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And strong (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>CHANOS: And morphing into financial services and of course Enron had Jeff Skilling (ph) and to a lesser extent Ken Lay.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And so when we first started looking at Enron, Enron decided to make a market in everything from energy trading to you name it, they were going to take everything, turn it into a tradable commodity, whether or not it should be is a whole different discussion.</p><p>What was the first warning sign that you saw with Enron?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, it's actually -- it was a column written by John Wilde (ph). He wrote a piece in the Texas \"Wall Street Journal\" in the fall of 2000, where he pointed out that energy merchant banks had just gotten a favorable ruling from the SEC on this mark-to-model accounting. So much for the Baldwin type stuff.</p><p>And a friend of mine running a hedge fund in Dallas, Texas, called it to my attention. And of course email was rudimentary; he faxed it to me. And I read the piece and immediately --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: '97, '98 --</p><p>CHANOS: -- this was in 2000 --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- far along.</p><p>CHANOS: -- and immediate cracked the 1999 10(k) and March and June 10(q)s of Enron and immediately began to see all kinds of odd things. In addition we noticed right away that not only was there a lot of insider selling throughout 2000 in Enron stock, but there were a number of key high-level executive departures. And that's -- those two -- those two in conjunction, often there will be insider selling to start.</p><p>But when you see insider selling across the executive suite as well as executive departures, there's usually something wrong.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes. That's quite fascinating. And so you start digging in and what's the - -you begin working with Bethany McLean, then of -- still of \"Fortune.\"</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- ultimately end up writing the book, \"Smartest Guys in the Room,\" and what were the next couple of things that you uncovered in digging into Enron?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the -- I had to -- two -- my partner at the time, Doug Millett (ph) and an analyst who's now my current partner, Chuck Hobbs (ph), we -- the three of us dug into the financials. And one of the first things Doug pointed out was this is nothing more than a leveraged hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline, which I think was the -- still the best apt description of Enron.</p><p>But as we dug into the numbers, there were a few odd things right away. We noticed that even with their sort of odd accounting, the company was only earning 6 percent pretax on its capital. And --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: In a period when everybody's just making --</p><p>CHANOS: Right. And in which people are -- were paying five times book for this -- the stock. So --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: For a 6 percent ROI on --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- five times NAV for a hedge fund that was earning 6 percent? No, you wouldn't.</p><p>So that was the first thing.</p><p>Number two, I noticed immediately they weren't matching their -- in that -- there's an accounting principle called matching similar gains and losses. And they had a merchant banking arm that did things like sell energy barges or construct utility plants.</p><p>And when they had a gain, they would put it through the merchant banking operating income line. But it appeared to me that when they looked like they were going to lose money on something, they held it as a discontinued asset, held for sale for a year, and then put it below the operating income line so people disregarded it as an extraordinary event.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So they buried what should have been an ordinary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- should have matched everything as net, net profit. Instead they basically showed their winners and tried you to disregard the losers. That was another flag.</p><p>The third one is -- were these odd footnotes that said there was a group of entities set up by an executive of Enron to trade with Enron or an executive -- senior executive of the company was the general partner of the entities. And, I mean, that was an immediate red flag to, well, what were these entities and why is a --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, how can you be a counterparty with himself?</p><p>CHANOS: -- this person conflicted.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And we now know those were the famous raptors and LJMs and these off-balance sheet entities --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right, side pockets and -- I believe it was McKenzie (ph) who came up with some of the concepts for that, if not those exact ones, but that philosophical structure came from --</p><p>CHANOS: -- came from --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- from McKenzie, that's right.</p><p>So quite fascinating.</p><p>And now let's fast forward. So ultimately Enron collapses after having a huge run-up. it takes a year to fall from about 89 bucks, 83 bucks, if memory serves, down to zero. It was -- it was glacial; if you're short, you must be champing at the bit. That's something I want to talk to you about a little later.</p><p>The mindset of how do you stay short a position fundamentally when it's running up against you and even when it starts -- I remember Lehman Brothers, when we were short, Lehman, when we watched it collapse, every time it fell and looked like it was about to just freefall, there would be this squeeze. There would be this move back up.</p><p>In '07, '08, you were short most of that whole area. We're talking about investment banks, builders, commercial banks. What else were you short in the credit sector before the collapse?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we have a rule that we don't -- we don't short anybody we do business with. And since we did agency business most of the brokers, we were not short Lehman or Bear. We actually were prime broker, a client of Bear. But there certainly -- in the credit area, there was a lot of -- a lot of things to do.</p><p>I mean, the Florida homebuilders, West Coast homebuilders, building supply companies, the credit rating agencies, a number of banks that were pretty aggressive --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Bond insurance companies?</p><p>CHANOS: -- bond insurance companies, yes, yes. Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And (INAUDIBLE) around the same time.</p><p>CHANOS: NBIA.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: NBIA was the other one. They all freefell down to single digits.</p><p>CHANOS: And the -- you're exactly right. I mean, typically, stocks that are fundamentally flawed, where the equity is worthless, you will have a number of vicious rallies, often 50-60 percent.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Unbelievable. And you look at that and you say, who the hell is buying this junk? This is a stock cut in half that should be going to zero and yet you end up with the floor underneath these freefalling stocks and those squeezes are incredibly painful to live through, if -- especially if you're counting your money before you close that position.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we never do that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's always a bad thing to do.</p><p>CHANOS: But I would point out that one of the ways that you alleviate that a little bit is that people tend to think about the short side very discretely. And often because a lot of money managers who actually do short stocks may only be short a handful of stocks versus quite a few longs.</p><p>And in our -- in our case, it's a whole portfolio. I mean, in the U.S., typically historically over 30 years, we've averaged about 50 names in the portfolio at any given time.</p><p>So no one position is an unusually large amount --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: 3-4-5 percent, is that --</p><p>CHANOS: Well, 5 percent would be the top. But I mean, typically average is 2 percent.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Coming up, we delve into the mind of the short seller as we continue our conversation with Jim Chanos, chairman of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. I am privileged to be speaking to a master of the short side, Jim Chanos.</p><p>Earlier we were talking about the short in Baldwin and Enron, as well as all the financials heading into '08. I recall reading a fabulous profile of you in \"New York\" magazine, the end of 2008, and I don't know if they were talking about a specific fund or generally but they were saying you were up 50 percent for the year in '08. I know you may not be able to comment on numbers. We all work with compliance and lawyers and what have you.</p><p>But '08 turned out to be a pretty good year for you.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, but the way we gauge ourself (sic), Barry, is actually versus the market and, in fact, although we have partnerships and offshore funds that you can invest in that are -- appear short and the numbers are what they are, the bulk of our business is our managed account business, where we're a large pension fund or endowment or sovereign wealth fund, gives us assets to manage short.</p><p>And in those cases, we're benchmarked versus the market inversely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So if the market goes up 10 percent, your benchmark is -10 percent?</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly. And so to the extent -- for example, if the market goes up 20 percent and we're flat for that account, you know, it's as if we were up 20 percent. And we're compensated in performance view on that.</p><p>Conversely, if the market goes down 40 percent and we're up 40 percent, we make no performance --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's flat.</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly. So it's a crude alpha measure. And that's really the way the firm has survived in a market that's up 2,000 percent, as you point out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Since 1985, since you launched the firm, and this is the fascinating thing about running a short firm when, by the way, a lot of your colleagues who are in that space haven't survived as long as you have.</p><p>So since you launched in '85, the S&amp;P 500 is up over 2,000 percent and yet you've managed to thrive as a short seller.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. We're up -- on a stand-alone basis, our flagship fund, which goes back to '85 -- I think is up a couple percent compounded. But when you factor that into the fact that -- offset it on the long side and rebalance monthly, the alpha is somewhere in the mid-teens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's fantastic.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's actually what -- that's how we get paid and that's how people evaluate us. And so --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You exist to create a hedge to institutions, pension funds, endowments, who, by definition, are, for the most part, long only.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the -- another way to think of it is we're an insurance policy that actually pays like premiums --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: As opposed to the not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- being upset when you --</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Exactly. And so I think that's -- I've quipped that Kynikos is, in effect, an insurance business. And it's not -- it's not, I think, an unreasonable analogy.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's talk. We have a few minutes left in the segment.</p><p>Let's talk about what it's like to be upside down in a position that's running against you.</p><p>Baldwin is a perfect example. You put this out at 25, drops to 20. You feel like a genius for five points. Next thing you know, it more than doubles, it almost triples from there.</p><p>How do you have the constitution -- like I know a lot of guys who can compartmentalize. I think I can compartmentalize. But the vast majority of investors, you know, the old joke is how did you sleep with the -- all your positions going against you? Like a baby. I woke up every two hours, cried for Mommy and wet myself.</p><p>A lot of people don't have that constitution to -- so how do you sleep at night with positions running against you?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, I think the -- it is -- it is personality based. I think -- I used to think when I started the business that shorting stocks fundamentally was just simply the mirror image of going long. And I've said publicly many times, I don't think that's the case anymore. I think a lot of it's rooted in behavioral finance. I think we're all by and large, we're listeners to this show and others are the product of positive reinforcement cycles.</p><p>And most people's rational decision-making studies have shown breaks down in an environment negative reinforcement. And if you're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in other words when positions going against you, their discipline goes away when they need it --</p><p>CHANOS: -- well, and the ultimate example, which will be something like an interrogation. And so the ability to withhold information. So if you're long in the market, you're constantly -- when I come in every day, we have 50 stocks in the U.S., another 40 globally, you know, I can pretty much be sure that 20 percent of my names will have a research note out, a buy recommendation, earnings estimates raised.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Something's moving.</p><p>CHANOS: The CEO and Bloomberg, whatever the case might be. And most of that is noise. But it's the noise that most people in the market are used to. And I call it the Muzak of the investment business.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I'm going to pull a quote I was saving for before, because it's so dead-on.</p><p>You called it \"the cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: And so most people -- as I say, they're used to that. But if you're a short seller or you're a negative -- on a situation, you're being told constantly you're wrong. And here's why. And you know, 50-page research report to follow.</p><p>And I think that not everyone has the ability to simply drown that out and say, OK. That's all well and good. But that's in the price of the stock. Do we know that? And the facts that I have are very important and the market doesn't really know that or appreciate how important they are.</p><p>So I'm not sure. I think the research is the same. And I think that good research can be taught both on long and short side and should be the same. I think the ability to deal with the noise, the swing factors, the volatility, I think that's a different attribute.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We continue our conversation with famed short seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates. And we'll discuss the role of the short seller in modern markets. I'm Barry Ritholtz. You're listening to MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is MASTERS IN BUSINESS on Bloomberg Radio. I'm Barry Ritholtz. I'm thrilled to be speaking with Jim Chanos -- am I pronouncing Kynikos -- is that -- correctly?</p><p>CHANOS: Oh, you're ready to go to Greece --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Kynikos associates, Kynikos, which translates as \"cynic.\" And you have spent a couple of cynical but lucrative decades on Wall Street, calling out the nonsense that passes for ordinary Wall Street noise.</p><p>Let's talk a little bit about the role of the short seller in markets. And here it is. It's five years past the financial crisis. People forget it wasn't the banks overleveraged and writing all this junk CDS and AIG writing the $3 trillion worth of derivatives with exactly $0 reserved for it. It was you short sellers that caused the crisis.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, sure was.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: How do you defend yourself for bringing the world to the edge of the abyss?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, you never --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And by the way, that was at the highest levels of -- we heard that from the ECB, we heard that crap from Treasury. We heard that from everywhere. And it was just despite Enron and WorldCom and a whole slew of fraud uncovered by short sellers, including Lehman Brothers.</p><p>How does anybody actually say that?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, you remember, Barry, right after Bear Stearns collapsed, a group of bankers who shall go nameless from New York, went down to Washington and sat with senators from New York and elsewhere and with Treasury Secretary Paulson, whatever. And they asked for two things. They didn't ask for forgiveness for their crazy lending and leveraging, they didn't ask for forbearance on capital levels, which they were going to need.</p><p>Instead they asked for a relaxation of the accounting rules, a mark- to-market. And they asked for a ban or curbs on short selling of their shares. And that, to us, was very telling, because it told you where their mindset was. It wasn't about what actually they had done on their balance sheets and they way they had accounted for them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Repo 103?</p><p>CHANOS: Oh, and all kinds of --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- fine, moving stuff off balance sheet each quarter, what harm --</p><p>CHANOS: -- 105 was the least of it. But I mean, just saying they were more worried about it being uncovered and/or having to mark things profitably or -- excuse me, properly. In fact, I mean, a year earlier than that, at a G7 meeting, I was asked, along with Paul Singer -- and this is public information --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This is the spring of '07?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes and --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before anything --</p><p>CHANOS: -- in April of '07, we actually briefed the G7 at their Washington meetings on -- we were asked to give a talk about hedge funds and the risks of hedge funds. And Paul and I gave a presentation on the looming credit crisis. He did it on the structure of structured finance and how unstable it was. And I did it on bank balance sheets and how loaded to the gills international banks were with the stuff Paul had just talked about.</p><p>And it was met with, you know, some would say, at best polite applause or, at most, a stifled yawn.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Now did these guys actually get it? Or were you talking way over their -- ?</p><p>CHANOS: No, no, they got it. I mean, there were -- there were people from the Fed there. There were people, you know, Gordon Brown, the future U.K. prime minister was in the room. You know, a future Treasury Secretary was in the room, future ECB central banker was in the room. I mean, these were serious people and I think that --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, which future Treasury Secretary or serious people, I think, an argument can be made that that Venn diagram has very little lovelife.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we'll leave it -- let you make that statement. But I'm just saying that that again -- I mean, for people to say that nobody warned or could see this coming, and Gillian Tett, in her book, \"Fool's Gold,\" has a chapter on that meeting, which I think is worth the read. But --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And she was one of the people in the \"FT,\" pounding away about this long before Lehman and AIG collapsed. And it was -- you had to willfully look away if you didn't want to see --</p><p>CHANOS: Willful blindness, which is a concept I teach in my financial fraud history class, willful blindness is a very, very strong argument.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- up in New Haven, if memory --</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I teach at Yale SOM.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's great. That sounds like it must be a fascinating -- how do you find the kids these days?</p><p>CHANOS: I think they're -- well, mine aren't kids, because they're mostly students in their late 20s, but --</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Those are kids.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: I -- it's a great class and I get as much out of it as I hope they do. It's a good group and we basically look at some models, historically, of fraud, academic models and then do case-by-case, going back to the 1690s. And it's remarkable as to how these cycles actually keep repeating with many of the same methods, just right up to date.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So who's uncovered more fraud? Various regulatory agencies? Or hedge funds and others who short? How do you -- what's that scorecard look like?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I'd like to say that virtually all major frauds over the past 20-30 years have really been uncovered by either internal whistleblowers, journalists and/or short sellers. Very, very few have been uncovered by regulatory agencies or law enforcement, very few.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And yet the first thing that happens in the crisis is -- first things we do, blame all the short sellers.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Well, that's -- a friend of mine named Bob Sloan wrote a great book about that, a history, called \"Blame the Shorts.\" And it has a long, long storied history also going back to the 1600s where people really will point fingers to those who have profited when -- when they've lost money. And -- and that's human nature, I think.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So now let's sidestep a little bit or -- or just change a little bit. We've been talking about accounting fraud. We haven't even gotten to the role of the accountants, but clearly, the -- the big four, big five -- I don't even know how many are left -- are major enablers of what takes place with -- with many of these, uh, shorts, but now let's -- let's focus on the C-suite and corporate management.</p><p>You recently put out a commentary about buy-backs as little more than financial engineering and speculation in the market by the CEOs of America, whose track record in dabbling in market timing is especially awful.</p><p>What -- what don't you like about buy-backs?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, first of all, in -- in aggregate, every CEO, of course, always thinks their stock is undervalued. We -- we -- we know that.</p><p>But what...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Except when they're selling.</p><p>CHANOS: -- what worries -- well, well, we'll get to that in a second.</p><p>But what worries me is that corporate America, in aggregate, has pre- tax returns on capital in the mid to high teens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: The long-term expected rate of the equity markets is roughly half that. And when corporations are embarked on massive buy-backs across all industries and all companies, in effect, these CEOs are buying the stock market.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Right?</p><p>So what they're telling you then is -- is unequivocally that they think that either they're happy to earn the stock market rate of return or maybe something hopefully better...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Which -- which is half what you would expect...</p><p>CHANOS: -- or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- their rate of return...</p><p>CHANOS: -- or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>CHANOS: -- their rate of return on the margin of any new capital product is much, much lower -- in fact, half or less, of what -- of what is stated. And that does not bode well for the -- the future of profits or for the quality of earnings reported as current profits.</p><p>There's one additional problem with this whole thing, and that is, number one, the CEOs making this decision typically have a very short tenure at companies.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: They're not thinking long-term.</p><p>And number two, we're seeing an increase in insider selling concurrent with the increase in buy-backs.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So out of one side of the mouth...</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They're saying the...</p><p>CHANOS: They...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- the companies should be buying stock...</p><p>CHANOS: But maybe I should be lightening up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- but I'm going to -- right. That's -- that's it. You know, my...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- my favorite data point on stock buy-backs is that Dell, now a private company, spent more money on buy-backs than they earned over their entire...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- lifetime. That -- that's just an astonishing figure.</p><p>CHANOS: And I think that -- well, I think you see that in companies like sears, as well. But -- but the -- for a lot of companies, the other problem with this, of course, is is that CEOs are terrible market timers.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: They're always buying back stu -- the previous peak in corporate buy-back activity was the second quarter of 2007.</p><p>And -- and where was the low?</p><p>The second quarter 2009.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You see the same thing with acquisitions and mergers.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They love to do...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: With inflated stock -- to buy inflated stock...</p><p>CHANOS: Corporate activity...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) stuff is cheap...</p><p>CHANOS: -- follows the market -- basically follows or is coincident with the market.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: It's not a leading indicator.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So we have buy-backs as financial engineering.</p><p>What about dividends?</p><p>A little more credible than?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, a little bit more credible and -- and I think certainly where -- any time you see the actual cash go out the door, um, the other interesting observation we've -- we've made in looking at corporate financial transactions is that increasingly, we're seeing acquisitions which are not taken out of most analysts' free cash flow numbers, acquisitions are replacing CAPEX, corporal -- capital spending or R&amp;D. So companies are buying their -- their R&amp;D or their -- their -- their capital. And that should probably be properly deducted from the free cash flow, because, in aggregate, corporate America is not growing.</p><p>So they're -- by buying each other, you know, and buying divisions of each other, in effect, they're -- they're capitalizing their R&amp;D. Um, and, I think that that's an interesting obser -- and that particularly applies for big tech...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- which are perceived as very cheap companies. If you actually look at them, the only reason their revenues aren't declining at a -- at a reasonable rate is because they're -- they're buying other companies.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We sort of stated these in the pharmaceutical area...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They quote a bunch of genomics, molecular, go down the list, as opposed to plowing money into their own R&amp;D...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- OK, let's go out and buy these new...</p><p>CHANOS: And, again...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: -- and rather than expensing the R&amp;D, they're capitalizing by purchasing. They can set it up as goodwill. And so it's overstating their earnings. And that -- that's a key point that we were trying to hone in on, that -- that companies that grow this way by acquisition are most likely overstating their earnings meaningfully.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And we've seen a ton of acquisitions, maybe not as much as at other peaks, but the M&amp;A activity, along with the IPO activity has certainly picked up fairly appreciably in the past couple of quarters.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, and the M&amp;A activity gives rise, we worry -- we're -- we think and worry, on a really drop in the quality of earnings. And -- and that, I think, drives a lot of M&amp;A activity, the ability to write down inventories, write down receivables, write up liabilities and basically give yourself, in effect, what -- what Herb Greenberg has called a cookie jar going forward to help manage your earnings.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I've been speaking with James Chanos, chairman of Kynikos Associates. You can listen to more of our conversation with Jim in our podcast extra, which is available on Bloomberg View, on SoundCloud and at Apple iTunes, as well as the Bloomberg Radio Plus App.</p><p>Coming up next week, we sit down with former FDIC Chairperson Sheila Bair, which is a really fascinating conversation.</p><p>Be sure and check out my daily column on bloombergview.com or follow me on Twitter @ritholtz. At my blog, I posted a whole bunch of unrelated but interesting items. That's ritholtz.com.</p><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p>You're listening to Masters In Business on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This concludes the broadcast portion of our interview.</p><p>Coming up with our guest, the radio podcast extra.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Today, I've been speaking with James Chanos of Kynikos Associates.</p><p>And we've been talking generally about short-selling and what it's like to run short funds.</p><p>What I love to do in these segments, when we finish broadcasting on the air and go to the podcast, is talk a little bit about you.</p><p>You started in this business as an analyst. We talked about Baldwin and eventually Enron. But when you were an up-and-comer, when you were the age of the kids you're teaching at Yale, who were your influences?</p><p>Who -- who are formative to the Jim Chanos approach to investment?</p><p>CHANOS: Um, you know, it's -- it's hard to find lots of people that you can point to who -- who did what I did. I mean I -- I was blessed when I was a young analyst at -- at Gilford Securities doing Baldwin that, um, we had a number of -- of well-known hedge fund managers who actually were our clients, people like Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, um, and I got to meet shortly after that when I moved to New York in '83, Julian Robertson. One of the people that probably had the most influence on me just passed away, uh, and that was -- it was sort of the legendary Bob Wilson...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: -- who was a -- was a -- not only a great investor, but a -- but an amazing philanthropist. And, uh, I used to have -- I used to have dinner with him or lunch with him from time to time. And he was a -- he had -- he was written up by John Train in \"The Money Masters.\" But he was of the legendary Resorts International short squeeze.</p><p>But he was a tremendous investor on the long side. And, um, he introduced me to people like Dick Gilder here in New York and -- all of whom early, 30 years ago, you know, I learned from another fellow, Stephen Peck, who was an amazing investor, a client of mine, a good friend, of Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh, sure.</p><p>CHANOS: And all these people were just sort of, you know, as I was getting going in New York, not only were they helpful in terms of their wisdom and their experience and what not to do and -- but also introduced me to lots of other people.</p><p>And -- and I think that that, you know, I'm indebted to all of them and -- and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few people.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you mentioned George Soros, clients early on.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And Julian Robertson, another legendary hedge fund manager.</p><p>CHANOS: And Mike -- Mike Steinhardt.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Steinhardt. Again, another guy, called by some the greatest trader on Wall Street ever. I don't know if that's an exaggeration, but people have said that about him.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean they -- it -- I had the -- the pleasure of running money for all three of those men. And -- and they all were different and a different temperament and -- and -- and I would categorize them completely different people, but all -- all amazing investors.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Hmmm. Interesting.</p><p>So you began as an analyst. You worked with some of the most storied names. Obviously, the industry has changed a lot since '83.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: A little bit.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: To think that a relatively unknown analyst at the time and a relatively small firm could get an audience with a Robertson or a Soros, that's not the sort of universe that we exist these days.</p><p>CHANOS: I think it would be a lot harder, I mean but -- but, first of all, people -- there weren't people putting out short-side research in -- in '80, even in '82 and '83 and -- and, uh, so, you know, I think the -- the Baldwin piece, a number of them were -- were short. A few of the people I just mentioned were short that. So it got me an audience with them early on, which I think was helpful.</p><p>But, um, I think it would be a lot tougher today. I mean I started my -- my own fund when I was 27.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p>CHANOS: And -- yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's 30 -- 30 plus years...</p><p>CHANOS: 1985, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And so that's almost exactly 30 years ago.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that -- that was just you and a partner and -- and how big is Kynikos today?</p><p>How many employees...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean we have, I think, 33 employees in -- in New York and London. And, uh, and obviously a little bit more sophisticated.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: It was just three of us, uh, at first and the two partners and a secretary. And my partner, a wonderful partner at the time who I brought with me from Deutsche Bank a year into it came to me and said, you know, I just don't think I -- I can do shorting stocks. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And -- and -- and sold his half back to me, um, for a - - for a nominal amount of money. Uh, and, you know, just walked out the door and prospered, by the way, mightily since doing his own thing.</p><p>So it -- it -- even when you think you can do it, sometimes you can't. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so you mentioned Deutsche Bank in -- in passing. If memory serves, they kind of showed you the door, didn't they?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Yes. In the summer of -- of '85, um, there was a full page -- a front page...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: \"Journal.\"..</p><p>CHANOS: -- monster article talking about these evil short sellers and -- and how they were disrupting these great businesses. Um, and in the middle of the article was -- was sort of -- was me. And a...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: -- and a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And this is even after Baldwin...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- had collapsed and...</p><p>CHANOS: And after a number of other calls we had made as well. And it, um, and so my -- my bosses in Frankfurt woke up that morning to see that, you know, Satan was working in their New York office. And I...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: -- I was told a -- I was told, by the end of the day, my contract, which was coming up, would not be renewed. I mean they didn't fire me, but they just simply said, you know, time for you to do something else.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Thanks. Thanks. Thanks, uh, here's your hat. Watch (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And then the postscript was I think nine of the 10 companies that were mentioned in that piece ultimately either went bankrupt or were prosecuted for fraud.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And any mea culpa from the right...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you know, obviously, you know someone is pulling the strings behind the scenes with that journalist and sends them down the wrong path.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean we were -- we were -- we were famously short a -- a lot of companies being run by a very aggressive investment bank out of Beverly Hills at the time. And I suspect that -- that that may or may not have had something to do with it.</p><p>Having said all that, (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Are we -- are we talking about Drexel or are we talking about somebody else?</p><p>CHANOS: No, we're talking about Drexel.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p>CHANOS: And a -- but -- but a -- one of the -- the, you know, serendipitous aspects was I had a client who had wanted me to run money for them as -- as a money manager, but because I was at a bank and it was...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You couldn't do it.</p><p>CHANOS: -- (INAUDIBLE) -- I couldn't do it. And so when I told them, yes, I was going to be looking for work, they said, well, why don't we set you up in business?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh.</p><p>CHANOS: So that's -- that's how -- that's how Kynikos Associates got started.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's unbelievable. I love stories like that.</p><p>You know, Ray Dalio has a similar story. You talk to a number of people, Jeff Gundlach, there are a lot of people who start in this business in one direction and, for whatever reason, end up making a turn and it's enormously successful.</p><p>CHANOS: I've often taught not only the -- the people who work for me, but my students that -- that's one of the things about business that you have to appreciate is that when good fortune, or bad fortune, comes your way, you have to know how to deal with it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And the bad fortune, you have to -- you have to rebound, you have to pick yourself up. But when good fortune comes, you have to grab it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and take advantage of it, because it will happen a number of times in your career just out of chance. And if you don't take advantage of it, you miss that chance to move your career ahead on -- in a quantum leap...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- and I think that I was fortunate, at the time, in that I was young, I was not quite married yet. I was about to get married, but I didn't have kids. And often I tell people the time to take risks, actually, is not after you're established in your career, when you have a wife and kids and a mortgage...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Too much to lose.</p><p>CHANOS: -- and -- and it's when you're younger and you're given an opportunity.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p>CHANOS: Because if it...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: What...</p><p>CHANOS: -- works, it's great. If it doesn't, no one is going to hold it against you.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And you have the ability...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You -- you lose a year or two. You can (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: You have an ability to get back up. And in -- particularly in America, which is an aspirational society, I think people, in many cases, even if it doesn't work, will admire that you tried.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: When -- when we speak to people from overseas, when we speak to people in Europe especially, one of the things we hear time and again, that they admire the most about America is failure isn't a fatal...</p><p>CHANOS: No.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- scarlet letter here. You know, henry Ford had five failed companies...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before Ford Motor Company. And the stories at Edison are legendary. He had hundreds of failed inventions before that light bulb finally...</p><p>CHANOS: As long as your work ethic...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: -- is good and -- and you're honest, people will value your ideas. And -- and -- and that is one of the great things about our society, that -- that I think sets us apart from almost any other developed economy. You fail in most other developed economies, you're done.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: That's it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: No second -- no second chapters elsewhere.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's not the case here at all.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So we talked about when you first launched. It was two guys and a secretary. Today, obviously, a much more sophisticated multinational entity. Take us through a -- a day in the life of Jim Chanos.</p><p>What time do you start work?</p><p>What -- what is your work flow like?</p><p>What do you do throughout the day?</p><p>I get the sense that you're not chained to Bloomberg all day watching every tick.</p><p>CHANOS: No, I'm not. I mean I have a trading desk that does that. But our -- our portfolio only turns over about once a year, so -- which is glacial by hedge funds.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Sure.</p><p>CHANOS: We're really investors. So I mean time spent looking at every tick is not time well spent for me. Looking at companies is more important for me.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: By -- by the way, that's a theme that's been pretty consistent. I can't begin to tell you how many investors we've spoken to who all pretty much say, if you -- if you have a good idea and a high degree of confidence, the day to day noise, that cacophony you mentioned...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- those fluctuations, it's meaningless noise and you have to have the con -- courage of your conviction.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, I mean you need -- you need to have an intelligence post, as we do -- and I have a good one -- to -- to -- to point it all out to you. But you also need filters and you need to understand.</p><p>And one of the big differences, Barry, in the business now from when we started was back then, getting the information gave you a leg up.</p><p>So if you read the 10-Q because you got it a day or two before the rest of the Street and you saw something buried in -- in management's discussion, you had a piece of information that was, A, public, and, B, material. And it might move the stock and -- and there were lots of instances of that.</p><p>Um, nowadays, the information comes at you with a fire hose.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: I mean it truly does. And -- and the key is having, A, the right filters and the right staff and the right ability to -- to pull out what is the real information from just the absolute, you know, torrent of water coming at you. And -- and so that has changed a lot.</p><p>So I mean I -- I'll get up, you know, obviously, the older I get -- and you might appreciate this, you know, I might get a few -- up a few times at night anyway, but I'll get up, you know, early in the morning and check the markets and if nothing earth-shaking is happening in Asia or Europe and we have a desk that's 24-7, you know, I'll go back to sleep.</p><p>And then typically, you know, up -- up again early in the morning and then it's going through morning news, filings, research that comes in internally overnight, research that's come in externally overnight, um, you know, and -- and then the day may, depending on -- on my schedule, whatever.</p><p>But unfortunately, it's -- it's 24-7, you know, in a way that you know in that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I get the sense you read a lot throughout your day.</p><p>CHANOS: I read an awful lot whether I'm on the move or whatever, so, unfortunately, you know, you -- you have to stay connected. I'm trying to get to the point now where I am able to do it for Saturdays, but I'm trying to make Sundays a non-e-mail, non-electric -- non-electronic day, um, to just disconnect one day out of the week. I think that is becoming a little bit more important and a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's just a recharge day, just a...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, it's just a recharge day...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) it up a little bit.</p><p>CHANOS: And in the spring for eight weeks on -- in the afternoons on Monday, I teach. And that's been, actually, a -- a wonderful, wonderful adjunct to what I'm doing for all kinds of good reasons. And -- and -- and I think that's been a -- been -- been a wonderful plus. And my clients and partners have been very supportive of that -- of that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It -- it's just a change in the routine and it allows you to mix it up a little bit.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And it -- and it's great to interreact and go back to history, whether it's my history or history from 300 years ago, though sometimes it feels like I've lived 300 years.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Um, and -- and, impart, some of the stuff back to a -- back to students.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so you're teaching at Yale School of Management.</p><p>Am I recalling correctly, did you go undergrad to Yale?</p><p>CHANOS: I did. I did.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You did. OK.</p><p>CHANOS: I did, years ago.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you're back -- back in the dorms, effectively?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, well...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- not quite, but I -- I have two -- two sons who went, as well, and when I told them I was going back to teach and that maybe we could...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They were horrified.</p><p>CHANOS: -- live together in -- in like in a con...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: -- in a condo like back to school...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: They wouldn't even...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- they looked to me horrified until I told them I was kidding.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's hilarious.</p><p>Um, they're at a -- I'm assuming they're out of school or?</p><p>CHANOS: One is. One is still there.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And, um, that's pretty funny.</p><p>So every -- you've been doing this how many years now over the...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in the springs?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I got on the -- I'm on my fourth year of teaching.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Oh, that's great.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And a -- and a -- it's a lot, as I say, a lot of fun and it's one afternoon for two months in -- in the spring. And Yale has got a brand new business school, so I'll give a plug for that. And an amazing new dean and a -- Yale SOM is on the way up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We have Bob Shiller coming in in a few weeks...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, he's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- he's one of my favorite...</p><p>CHANOS: -- he's one of my -- he's certainly a tenured -- a tenured and Nobel Prize winner.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: He's at a different level.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: He -- he's really fascinating...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: I'm the low man on the totem pole in the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You -- you talk about -- but you talk about the psychology of investing in behavioral economics...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and how (INAUDIBLE). Here's a guy teaching in the same place you're teaching who's been one of the key drivers of that philosophy for a good couple of decades.</p><p>You -- you mentioned the far -- the fund launched in '85.</p><p>CHANOS: Um-hmm.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's 30 years ago.</p><p>CHANOS: Almost.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: How has the hedge fund industry changed in that ensuing period?</p><p>What -- what do you see as big differences?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean the growth, first of all. I mean it -- we had a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Enormous.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: We had a...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Over $2 trillion now.</p><p>CHANOS: We started with $16 million in '85 and by -- by 19 -- the end of 19 -- early '91, we were over $600 million in assets. And that put us in the top 10 globally of hedge funds...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: -- of (INAUDIBLE). And -- and so that -- that tells you just how small the industry was back then. Um, the dramatic growth was -- was in the late '90s and early millennium.</p><p>But it was truly a small handful of people. Everybody kind of knew each other in the '80s. There were...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: A hundred hedge funds, 200 hedge funds?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, maybe no more than 100...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Now it's 10,000...</p><p>CHANOS: -- maybe...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- something like that?</p><p>CHANOS: Maybe more than 100 and probably practically, 20 or 30.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and -- and everybody knew everybody. I mean truly. And there weren't a lot of -- a lot of real different strategies. I mean everybody was pretty much in the equity markets, give or take.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Long, short?</p><p>CHANOS: Long, short, maybe...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- and that was kind of it. And then -- and, you know, you had guys like -- like -- like Mike Steinhardt spec -- and Soros speculating in bonds and currencies, um, but -- but it was, by and large, an equity driven model. And a -- and everybody was, at that point, was fairly adept, both on the long and short side.</p><p>Um, getting institutional investors was a big deal back then. That he didn't really started until the '90s.</p><p>So...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So in the '80s, your clients were essentially just high net worth individuals...</p><p>CHANOS: High net worth or foreign families because the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So family offices but no sovereign wealth funds yet?</p><p>CHANOS: Typically not. You would -- typically not U.S. fun -- families and no sovereign wealth funds. No endowments. By and large, no pension funds.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's amazing.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And everything has completely changed. Now it's...</p><p>CHANOS: Completely changed. All of it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- dominated by big institutions.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Ten thousand hedge funds, although, if you look at the -- the Bell Curve, that is -- that is not a normal Gaussian distribution. It's effectively those 100 hedge funds capturing 80 percent of the alpha and then a long tail of underperformance.</p><p>CHANOS: That's probably -- that's probably right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The -- the numbers are pretty -- when you look at the Tremont data and you look at some of the other hedge fund data that's out there, the funds that are earning their keep are few and far between.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean true alpha is -- is hard to come by, as we all know.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: For -- for sure. Well, the -- you know, it's like expansion in -- in professional sports teams, you go from 22 to 26 teams and suddenly there's that much talent -- less talent on any one team. It's spread around. And there's sort of a uniform mediocrity.</p><p>But a handful of all stars, you know, there's 100 funds out there that are just...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- stealing it.</p><p>CHANOS: -- the only difference is you can't start your own NBA team. You can start your own hedge fund.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Very easily.</p><p>CHANOS: That makes it worse.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: All -- all you have to do is talk someone into giving you X dollars...</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And it's not even -- there's not even a $100 million minimum. You could -- you know, the SEC regulates RIAs and others. If you have 100 plus, you don't have to do state by state. It's one regulatory scheme. So that's a bogey for a lot of -- you don't even have that on the hedge fund side. Anyone with a couple of million dollars can launch a hedge fund.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Although it is harder. I mean to -- in -- in -- the cost of doing business, of getting a real prime broker, I mean...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- (INAUDIBLE) now that I think have -- have, I think, taken that true start-up out of the -- the industry.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE), in fact, you sort of do need a -- a critical mass to be considered a -- a, you know, a -- at least viable.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So, obviously the industry has changed dramatically over the past couple of years. Let me -- let me throw some of my favorite quotes, um, of yours -- of yours back at you and see what your...</p><p>CHANOS: OK.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- reaction is. Let -- let's talk about timing. \"In investing, you could be really right but temporarily quite wrong.\" I love that line, because I started in the business as a trader and I -- it was always drilled into my head, hey, either you're right or wrong.</p><p>If -- if you think you're right and the market is going against you, you're wrong. But when you're doing fundamental shorting, you're basically -- our friend Doug Kass calls it variant perception. You're identifying what people aren't seeing, or seeing incorrectly...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you're going to be wrong for a long time, almost by identifying that variant perception. You're wrong for a while by definition...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, and there's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- before people catch on.</p><p>CHANOS: -- there's -- there's a big difference. If you're trading a position, you know, sort of because of a fundamental view and your time frame has shortened enough, price tells you everything, almost.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right.</p><p>CHANOS: And in a fundamental short position, not only are you analyzing the company or -- or the -- whatever it is you're analyzing, but in many cases, you have a management team interposed that's actively working to -- to -- to prove you're wrong through activities that aren't necessarily kosher.</p><p>And so there's an added level here of -- of sort of three-dimensional chess when you're on the fundamental short side because the market won't necessarily immediately see what you see. And, in fact, often doesn't. And -- and that's why most fundamental short sellers will tell you, they're -- they're often early.</p><p>One additional problem, you have to borrow the shares.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so the ability to effect a short position in reasonable size for a firm like ours, once everything is clear, may not be given to you. And so there -- there are additional hurdles that don't exist in traditional investing that exist on the short side.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, we mentioned -- I mentioned Doug Kass earlier. One of the things he taught me early on, which I would have wish I had known when I was shorting Lehman, was that you could be short the stock and you're going to get squeezed. But if you really want to make a run for it, you marry a put to that and if you close the short position, you could let the put run. It's never going to get called for you. You're never going to get squeezed. You could -- you're paying up for the option, but it's a way to get, um, that juiced return, because the -- on the short side, the most you can make is 100 percent. With options...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, that's actually not true. But go ahead with it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, what -- well, let's discuss that, because that's a standard line against short-selling.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, that's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Look, you're shorting at 50, you can only go to zero, that's 100 percent.</p><p>Why is that wrong?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, because...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Because of leverage and?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, because the ability of -- of -- if you start with a short position at 100 and -- and with no other cash in your account and you short the stock and it goes down to 50, OK, you can, without adding any more cash -- capital to the account, short additional shares. And if it keeps going your way, you -- you can compound your return.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But then you're running the risk of -- of...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- a margin call, a squeeze...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, that's fine.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: But I just want to...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: I want to get the statement (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you can...</p><p>CHANOS: That you can't make more than 100 percent on initial capital. That's not true.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So you can -- with -- if you're actually using the gain in, um, value, falling stock creates, if you're short, you're then pyramiding that on top and -- and shorting that with that additional effort.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, you're shorting on -- on -- you're compounding your profit, in effect.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. So number two, I've also (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: By the way, I've heard that 100,000 times. You're the first person who's corrected that.</p><p>CHANOS: So -- so the -- the -- the other problem, of course, is is that, you know, I've seen a lot more stocks go to zero than -- than infamy -- invidimy (ph).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: That -- and that's the -- that's the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: But the -- the key point for your listener, of course, is is that for what we do, and -- and theoretically, don't try this at home, kids, we have a portfolio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And a portfolio changes the volatility nature, like any portfolio will. There's going to be things that are always working and things that aren't working. And so, you know, I -- I think that a -- that really tells you that -- that a -- that doing this as a professional with a portfolio approach and watching your country risk, your industry risk and all those things makes much more sense.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So this leads -- you mentioned something earlier and I want to address that. You mentioned you have management actively working against you in a number of ways.</p><p>One of the things that you were very much in the forefront of was working with investigative journalists, working with the media to help uncover fraud.</p><p>How did that first come about?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I'm a -- you know, clear up a misconception here. I mean we don't call up or e-mail reporters and say, hey, you ought to be looking at Enron. And in the case of Enron, Bethany McLean was talking to my partner at the time and he said -- and she said, you know, what do you - - what's interesting?</p><p>And -- and -- and Douglas Millett, do you ever really talk to Jim about Enron?</p><p>And he -- we -- we're real excited about it. And we -- we really think there's something there.</p><p>So I mean that -- that often reporters find a way to fundamental short sellers to -- to ask them, hey, what do you -- what do you think of this or are you working on something?</p><p>And -- and I think that I'll -- I think there are ways to do that and -- and not compromise anybody.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: On the other hand, I think there are ways not to do that. And I think you have to be mindful of -- of that. And I think there's approaches.</p><p>Having said all that, I -- I'm a firm believer in the \"U.S. Constitution\" and -- and anybody has the right to their opinions of interest. But you're -- you do not have the right to your own facts.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And I think that that's an important point. But if you're a publicly traded company, you have to understand that the marketplace is going to be a marketplace of ideas and a marketplace of opinions, of...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: We've -- we've seen some litigation against short sellers. We've seen some litigation against analysts.</p><p>What do you think of that sort of stuff?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean, as I say, no one has the right to -- to trade on or -- or induce others to trade on information they know to be false. And that's kind of the -- the bright line that -- that -- that certainly most -- that all investors need to understand about securities fraud.</p><p>But -- but an awful lot of companies seem to, you know, be upset when people don't have the approved opinion about that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And, you know, that -- that is not actionable in our court system.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: One...</p><p>CHANOS: A...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- one would hope.</p><p>CHANOS: One would hope. One would hope. But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so one of the...</p><p>CHANOS: The federal courts, by the way, have a pretty strong view on that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And they've been on the right side of this, for the most part...</p><p>CHANOS: Usually it's people that bring these cases are in state courts of -- of, you know, varying venues or questionable venues to try to get state, you know, put this before a jury in a state.</p><p>Federal judges, by and large, look at these things and, for the most part, toss them out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's the right way to do it.</p><p>So you mentioned earlier about long versus short. There's a -- a longer quote I really like, which is, \"I used to think that good short sellers could be trained like long focused...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- value investors. It's the same skill set. You're tearing into the numbers. You're valuing businesses. You're assigning a consolidated value and hopefully you see something the market doesn't.\"</p><p>But you've since learned, quote, \"There's a big difference between a long-focused value investor and a good short seller. And you mentioned the differences -- psychology and behavioral finance.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And it...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's a great -- that's a fabulous quote.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and I think that -- and I think that -- that -- as I said, I've run money for a lot of great investors who have farmed out the short side to me. And I've seen that, actually, some of the best value investors who I've had the pleasure of doing business with are not particularly good short sellers. And -- and shouldn't be selling short for that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The wrong constitution.</p><p>CHANOS: They're just -- just the -- they'll obsess over very tiny positions that have gone against them, you know, that...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- you know, that -- that fear of the stock going to infinity that we discussed. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: By the way, that's the other false statement. You -- we've talked about a stock can only lose 100 percent. I've heard that well when you're short, your losses are theoretically infinite.</p><p>Well, not if you have a stop loss. Not if you have a line in the sand...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, there's in you...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that you cover...</p><p>CHANOS: -- there's an even better little argument...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: There -- there's no lock limit up when it comes to equities.</p><p>CHANOS: There's an even better little limit that no one talks about. If you're in a partnership and you're a limited partner, you can only lose what you put up.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right. That -- that's your limitation.</p><p>CHANOS: Which is an argument for investing with short sellers that way.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Typically a hedge fund as opposed to...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. You know, or...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hiding...</p><p>CHANOS: -- or buying shares in an offshore corporation. And -- and - - and that's something, you know, we point out to people, too, that -- that, actually, you can, in effect, get the same limited -- limited down side by doing it in that structure. And the general partner takes the risk, but the prime broker will sell you out long before that ever happens.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. That's right.</p><p>CHANOS: So, again, these are -- these are -- these are...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Myths.</p><p>CHANOS: -- examples of thinking -- well, they're not myths. They're -- they're accurate on the face, but in practicality, they're inaccurate...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- because -- because, again, you structure things to -- to not let that happen, A, and -- and, B, you can actually get protection through the structure of -- of the investment vehicle or whatever, to obviate the -- obviate the -- those risks.</p><p>But having said all that, they do play into behavioral finance. And - - and I remember very famously, a well-known investor who's an incredibly - - he's got an incredible track record. I was running some money for him. And it was in the midst of our disastrous short on America Online in the -- in the late '90s. And I had...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: A little early.</p><p>CHANOS: -- I had -- I had a small short portfolio I was running for him. And -- and AOL was never more than half of 1 percent or 1 percent of our portfolio, because it was so volatile. But it just kept doubling and doubling and doubling.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And we thought it was an accounting fraud, which it turned out to be.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: And this investor called me repeatedly losing sleep at night and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Over a half a percent (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: -- and this one -- and this -- this position was not moving the needle on his performance at all.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: But he was -- he was -- I think, to the detriment of him working on other ideas. And a -- and it -- and -- and that was a real concrete example, to me, of just why it is that -- that certain people shouldn't do this, um, because it was bothering him.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They just lack the constitution. They can't...</p><p>CHANOS: Right. It...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they can't compartmentalize.</p><p>CHANOS: They didn't -- they didn't need to because he -- he was such a good investor doing what he did well. And so for that person, you know, they shouldn't be doing it. And -- and I think that it gets back to exactly what you -- you've -- you've emphasized here, the psychological is completely different.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's -- let's talk about noise, since we -- we've touched on psychological, this is related to it. \"I listen to the noise to make sure there's no new information. I need to know. But I don't worry about most of it.\"</p><p>And I -- I thought that was an interesting con -- concept, when -- when you discussed, relevant to this, analysts' reports, news, rumor mills, that's where the phrase, \"For a short seller, this is a cacophony of negative reinforcement.\"</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I -- I love that quote.</p><p>So how do you deal with that noise?</p><p>Do you filter all of it or do you have a staff that says, hey, out of these 1,000 things, these four or five you should...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hear?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I mean first of all, if we're getting a piece of new material or information from a research report, my staff is not doing their job. Um, and -- because certainly, I want them reading the company filings and company press releases going to conferences, you know, and -- and I -- I hope they -- you know, our team is very good -- that -- that I'm reading it in an internal memo before I'm reading it in a -- in a Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch research piece a week later.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's usually the case 99 percent of the time.</p><p>Having said all that, you have to be mindful of what the Street is saying. You have to be mindful of what you're going up against. And I -- and I think that that's important. And one of the things we do is we do talk to the Street. We have them into our offices. If we have an unusual thesis or hypothesis on a company, we'll have the sell side in and to lay it out...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They're pitching you the other side of the equation?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, well, we know what they're pitching. I mean you know, it's not -- and one of the good asymmetries of the short side -- and there aren't that many of them, one of the good ones is is that if you're fundamentally a short seller, you have no problem finding out what the bull case is.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: It's easy to find out.</p><p>But if you long that stock, you might have to really kind of dig to find out what the real bear case is on it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and a -- and so it's another one of these influential asymmetries that I think works for the fundamental short seller. There are a few others. We don't have to disclose our positions. I think that's a very important one, actually.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You know, there was a -- a movement afoot not too long ago to force short sellers to disclose their positions.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and the Europeans have it in terms of -- of certain thresholds, for example.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: Now the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But you're never short 10 percent of the outstanding stock?</p><p>CHANOS: No, although we've -- we've...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: (INAUDIBLE) company...</p><p>CHANOS: -- we've crossed the European thresholds a few times, because the thresholds are very...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But that's a fairly low.</p><p>CHANOS: -- they're very -- they're very low.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Two percent, 3 percent, something like that?</p><p>CHANOS: Oh, I think it's a -- no, it's .5 percent or (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it that low?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. It's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I had no idea.</p><p>CHANOS: -- it's really low.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's a...</p><p>CHANOS: -- on some of them yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: It's quite low on some of them. Well, the reason is is that, first of all, the IRS doesn't look at short positions as positions. It looks at -- it looks at it as in a commercial transaction, where you're borrowing money, interestingly enough.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It -- it's a margin trade, it's a loan (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, because you don't own anything. You don't -- you -- you have a promise to -- to -- to pay something back.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: To repay...</p><p>CHANOS: Shares.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so it's considered...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: -- instituted indebtedness. Yes. And so -- and which is why the short sellers have no -- no standing at the bar, the securities bar. We don't own anything. And -- and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: -- now I would argue even further, I'm a little surprised that my brethren in the hedge fund world have not actually challenged the 13 F, G and H regime. I...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Sections of the SEC code?</p><p>CHANOS: Code -- mandating disclosure over $100 million of your long positions.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: Because, I mean I understand why the 13D need for change in corporate control. I think any reasonable person...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- would understand that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's right.</p><p>CHANOS: But why is it that -- that all these great investors, every 90 days, should give the public a free look at what they're doing?</p><p>They're pay -- their clients pay for that. And if you don't trade a lot, say you're a value investor, um, well, if you don't trade a lot, that portfolio doesn't trade a lot. And there are people out there basically with services now to replicate your portfolio for nothing, or very little, that you have people paying good money for.</p><p>And I've always said, you know, Coca-Cola doesn't have to put its, you know, formula on -- on -- on the Web and Microsoft doesn't have to issue its source code, why should managers, either hedge fund or otherwise, have to tell the public what -- what -- what's the public's interests?</p><p>I understand the SEC and law enforcement should have every right to see it at any time.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: In other words, 13D filings go to the SEC and it stops there, they don't get put on the Web?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, 13D filings, I think, change in corporate control, that's fine. I mean people publicly should know that.</p><p>But why is it that a passive money manager should tell the public...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Six percent of -- more than 5 percent position, why...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- why disclose that?</p><p>CHANOS: You know, their -- all their positions, all of their positions.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK, so let's clarify that. I'm under the impression they do a filing at 5 percent?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, a 13D.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK. So let's say they have a 2 percent position.</p><p>They have to disclose that?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: What happens if they're offshore?</p><p>CHANOS: Of -- if you're a U.S. money manager, you've got to disclose your positions of $100 million.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Huh, that's interesting.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, so -- so -- so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it a fund above $100 million or a fund...</p><p>CHANOS: A position...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- a position above $100 million?</p><p>CHANOS: A fund $100 -- of $100 million.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Again, I don't understand why the money management industry hasn't gone and said this is, in effect, a, you know, possibly a takings clause in \"The Constitution.\"</p><p>Why is it that the public gets to see what I'm doing?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You're -- you're...</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- forcing me to turn over my intellectual property with no compensation.</p><p>CHANOS: And if you don't short a lot of stocks, then if you're just a long lonely manager, you're giving away your entire business plan every 90 days.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's really interesting. And I hadn't thought of that in a...</p><p>CHANOS: Absolutely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in that context.</p><p>CHANOS: Absolutely.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So the accusation is that Wall Street owns Congress and they can get DC to do whatever they want. And it's not all that far from the truth.</p><p>Why is this so difficult to change?</p><p>You would think, hey, any major change in ownership, anything over -- pick a percent. It doesn't even have to be 5 percent. If you owe more than 3 percent, you need to at least disclose it when you cross that line.</p><p>Um, but after that, why does it have to be completely...</p><p>CHANOS: I'm a little...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- disclosed?</p><p>CHANOS: -- you know, well, first of all, hedge funds don't have the clout that -- that -- when -- when you say Wall Street does...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- we're talking about major -- major banks and -- and investment banks. They're the ones with the clout. Hedge funds don't -- still don't have that much clout in Washington.</p><p>So I think that's number one.</p><p>But, again -- and -- and mutual funds, of course, like it because it actually helps their marketing.</p><p>You know, here's our portfolio.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Sure.</p><p>CHANOS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Absolutely.</p><p>CHANOS: I just -- but I -- I've always wondered at why a -- why hedge funds have just sort of rolled over on this and said well, you know, well, I guess, you know, we've got to do it. And you do have to do it. But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, I'll tell you what the answer is. The answer is merely knowing what Jim Chanos' long or short isn't the same as having Jim Chanos manage that position for you. And the same is true for any hedge fund that's out there. If it was the case, everybody would be generating alpha by imitating the Dalio's, Tepper's, obviously Renaissance Technology doesn't hold onto anything long enough for a filing to go through.</p><p>But still, if it was that easy just to say let me see what Chanos owns, great, I'll own that...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, one would argue that that's actually why the alphas may have dropped and a -- and so, I'm not so sure. It will...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Because everybody was...</p><p>CHANOS: -- clearly for trading...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- (INAUDIBLE) to it.</p><p>CHANOS: -- clearly for trading shops, it -- it's superfluous. And for shops that do a lot of fundamental shorting, it's -- it's meaningless, because, for example, you use...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You want that out there anyway?</p><p>CHANOS: When you see my longs, I file them in my Opportunity Fund, which is our long short. And if you look at my longs, you'll scratch your head and go why is Chanos long in that thing, that looks crazy?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And not understanding there's two shorts against it that are even crazier.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Right, and that happens to be the best system -- systematic hedge for that position.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Um, so it can be -- it can be very misleading to people. And that's the other reason then, why do it?</p><p>If it's misleading because you're both long and short, you're not doing anybody a service.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: If it's not misleading because the guy is just simply a long only person, why does the public have the right to that information for free?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Those are the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CHANOS: There's a lot of arguments against this that -- and -- and the argument for it typically is well, it's for more -- don't we want more transparency?</p><p>And I would argue, no, not necessarily. Um, but I particularly if -- if you're basing a business on -- on intellectual capital and you're charging people for that, I don't see what the public interest is in putting out possibly misleading information.</p><p>One of the problems, when you have the limits where people have to disclose where they go through limits and up and down, you actually -- people can game that...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- knowing themselves they've gone through the limits.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so I've explained that to the European regulators, that - - that these short threshold limits themselves can be disruptive just because they exist.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So let's veer into a dangerous territory. Let's talk a little bit about politics, Washington, DC, the regulatory environment.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You're known as a guy who's a pretty active, uh, participant in politics. You've made the comment that you've been -- I'm paraphrasing -- you've been fortunate enough in your career to have accumulated a sum of money and you feel obligated to respond, to give back, to participate in democracy.</p><p>What -- what attracted you to that given how dysfunctional DC has been?</p><p>Is it something you're still interested in?</p><p>Talk a little bit about that.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I mean I'm certainly not interested in politics personally. I -- I'm interested in the process. I always have been. I -- and first of all, let me say, I think the system is broken. I think the whole system of campaign finance is broken. And I would love a law that says I can't write any checks.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. Well, the...</p><p>CHANOS: But...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- Supreme Court has basically...</p><p>CHANOS: Has gone towy.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you could write, Jim Chanos...</p><p>CHANOS: It's free speech.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- who wants more than a couple of bucks, write...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- write all the money you want (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. I think -- and I think that that -- that while that may be a constitutional freedom, it's one we ought to reexamine, because it raises agency risks and lots of issues of inequality. But -- but we're not here to discuss that.</p><p>The problem is is that if that's -- if that's the legality of the game and -- and you feel strongly about -- about things politically, um, and you want to support them, fine. Uh, you know, I -- we pick our spots.</p><p>On the other hand, um, I think that -- that a -- that the country, you know, actually needs people to be involved in politics.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And I think that -- that it's not about access or influence, it's about, in our case, because we never asked for anything...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, stop a second. When you say you never ask for something, you want to influence the process a little bit, then you -- you derailed the question I was about to ask you, because you said you never ask for something, which was what would you like to see changed?</p><p>What area...</p><p>CHANOS: Well (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- of policy...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, for example...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- could you move on the needle on?</p><p>CHANOS: -- well, for example, I -- I've publicly said I -- I think that carried interest should be raised. The tax on carried interest should be raised.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So this -- this is the advantage that private equity and hedge fund managers have...</p><p>CHANOS: On long-term cap -- gain allocations and performance fees being treated as long-term capital gains.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So they're -- they're taxed at -- it used to be 15 percent, now it's 23...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, whatever.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- or so.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But it sure as hell ain't for -- the joke that Warren Buffett says as he pays a lower tax rate...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- than his secretary.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. And I -- and I think a lot of these -- so -- so I would, you know, you would argue...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So why hasn't that been changed?</p><p>You would think that's the -- the most egregious stroke of the pen thing to change?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, you'll have to ask the people that don't want to change it. I don't know. The -- the -- there are a lot of issues that are out there like that that I think you would be kind of surprised as a Wall Streeter that I support, but I -- that are counterintuitive.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Give me -- give me another one. Let's -- let's...</p><p>CHANOS: Well...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You're -- you're one of these -- I can just hear Bill O'Reilly saying...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you're one of these limbers -- limer -- limousine liberals who really feels guilty about having money.</p><p>CHANOS: You know, I don't feel guilty at all about having money. I - - trust me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: I -- I feel blessed and -- and I know I'm fortunate. And -- and not at all. And the -- but I do think the level of discourse in this country needs to be reopened. And I think we -- we've -- we've put both parties in this -- this sort of truly bipolar area there where no one wants to meet in the middle anymore.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: A lot due to campaign finance reasons and -- and the primaries.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's the underlying problem that, you know, the old joke is that Reagan and Tip O'Neill would argue all day, they'd go out at night, have a beer and the next morning there would be legislation signed. That sort of cross-pollination...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, look, apparently that story was a bit apocryphal. Apparent, there wasn't -- it wasn't that simple with those two.</p><p>But -- but I know what you mean...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But they did get -- they did get...</p><p>CHANOS: I know what you mean.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- they did get -- meet in the middle.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. Well, what...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: They did get things accomplished.</p><p>CHANOS: -- well, what's changed is the Senate, really, if you know Washington, in that -- that the House has always been pretty -- a pretty bipartisan place and -- and it's always been pretty raucous in terms of hardened attitudes and -- and -- and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, that's -- do you mean a partisan there's that...</p><p>CHANOS: It's much more partisan.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- the Senasin -- the Senate is bipartisan and the House was partisan.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the Senate -- the Senate, until about 20 or 30 years ago, was a place in which people crossed party lines all the time and voted their conscience and voted the way they really felt on the issues and weren't penalized for it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and -- and so senators really were that -- that upper house that said, OK, we -- we're a little bit older, a little bit more experienced, we're -- we -- we -- more confident of our reelection or our tenure and if -- if I want to vote on civil rights even though I'm -- I'm a hard -- I'm in the Republican Party, I -- I do. And that happened.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Um-hmm.</p><p>CHANOS: But now the Senate is just as fractious as the House. And -- and senators worry about reelection or getting very liberal or very conservative challengers. Again, part of it's the campaign finance issue, part of it's the -- the redistricting of -- for the representatives.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Gerrymandering, as well.</p><p>CHANOS: And so -- so the -- the whole idea that there was an upper house that was sort of, you know...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The adult supervision.</p><p>CHANOS: The adults, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: The adults that were getting policy done is -- is changed, as well. And so it's added to the acrimony. It's added to the gridlock. And -- and I think it's just added -- it's -- it's not put us in a good place. And I think that that's -- and I've supported Republican candidates that I think are moderates, as well, so...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. How -- how do we fix this?</p><p>How do we repair...</p><p>CHANOS: I think you...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- campaign finance?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I think you have to start, you know, with some sort of reform. And I think, you know, unfortunately, a family member who is -- who has been in politics also pointed this out correctly, you also have to do something about term limits, because other -- if you do have campaign finance limits, term limit -- anybody with an incumbency becomes more important.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so you have a do I -- you have an advantage being an incumbent...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Ninety-nine percent or 98 percent reelection rate...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. So...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- in the House.</p><p>CHANOS: -- so I mean we -- that -- that -- it's -- it's a tricky issue. But just throwing more and more unlimited amounts of money, I think, doesn't help the issue. It makes -- I think it makes it worse.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And what do you do -- so, in other words, you have a system that's broken, nobody from either party is going to -- willing to work with the other party...</p><p>CHANOS: But nobody can turn the money down (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And at the same time the Supreme Court...</p><p>CHANOS: It's an arms race.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- is -- has -- has basically lit that fuse and said go for it then...</p><p>CHANOS: And it's an arms race. So therefore, I mean you can't -- if you don't spend, you're not going to have an equal chance -- seat at the table.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And so it's just...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You have no choice, you have to.</p><p>CHANOS: -- it's just this vicious cycle. And...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So how do you break that?</p><p>How do you...</p><p>CHANOS: Well, as I say, I'd leave it up to the politicians and the legal scholars, but at some point, you're going to need a piece of legislation or a constitutional amendment or something that -- that's going to have to change this system. And I -- I don't know -- I don't know any other way around it. If you have a Supreme Court that keeps saying this is an a -- the legislation is unconstitutional, then you're going to have to change the \"Constitution.\"</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. And -- and that's a challenge. That's quite a challenge...</p><p>CHANOS: It's a big challenge.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- to get that done. It probably has to get a lot worse before it gets better.</p><p>CHANOS: You know, that's a scary thought.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Let -- let me tack policy to one other place, because we spent this whole afternoon chatting and China has never come up.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly. Where's that?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And you, very famously, um, identified, I want to say four years ago, is that -- is that right?</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, it was the end of '09, early 2010.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Basically said China is a -- a big house of cards, building these ghost cities, they're spending all this policy money, they're not that good at it. Their economy has been so robust that it's covered up a lot of these credit errors.</p><p>What do you think is going on with China today?</p><p>By the way, China's stock market today at a four or a six week high, but it's shellacked over that period.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It's down 40 percent. China, while the rest of the world has rallied substantially, has gone the exact opposite way.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Almost cut in half.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, people have always ask -- still ask us, well, what do you think, you know, when are you going to be right?</p><p>You've been early. And I keep saying if you look at the Chinese market...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It's got -- China has gotten crushed over the past few years.</p><p>CHANOS: It's the -- it was the best place to be short in the last four years.</p><p>Um, look, everything that we saw in China, at -- at the end of '09 and 2010 is basically now twice as bad. That's kind of the way I put it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It hasn't gotten better.</p><p>CHANOS: It -- it's gotten worse. The -- the debt to GDP has gone from over 100 percent of GDP to over 200 percent. Back in -- in '09, there was 5.6 billion square meters of high rises under development and (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: 5.6 billion?</p><p>CHANOS: -- 6 billion square meters. That's 60...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh-huh.</p><p>CHANOS: -- billion square feet.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: Now, the number is twice that. It's 10.6 billion square -- square meters under development at the end of 2013.</p><p>So everything that we saw then that was bad, and I think it -- it was bad, is, in effect, twice as bad now.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Don't they have...</p><p>CHANOS: When we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- hundreds of millions of people to move off the farm?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, the problem is, is the hundreds of millions of people can't afford the stuff that they're -- that's being built. They're building high end condos, uh, shopping malls, high speed rail. It's only the -- the top 5 percent of people in China that can afford that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's the -- that's the -- the sort of paradox here. I'll give you just an idea of -- of what's changed in four years. When we started looking at China, the Chinese GDP in dollar terms was about $7 trillion US. And the total...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Not too shabby.</p><p>CHANOS: Not -- and the to -- total amount of bank -- assets in the banking system in China was $9 trillion.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: OK.</p><p>CHANOS: So it was a little bit over 100 percent.</p><p>Now, the GDP is about $9 trillion and the total assets in the Chinese banking system are about $24 trillion.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Wow!</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, a meaningful difference.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And that's a...</p><p>CHANOS: So they've had to employ...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that's a lot of...</p><p>CHANOS: -- they've had to employ more and more debt to get the growth.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: I was going to say, this isn't capital, this is...</p><p>CHANOS: This is the...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- credit.</p><p>CHANOS: -- total assets, total assets. It's just basically a proxy for -- for credit outstanding. And so increasingly, they've had to employ more and more debt to -- to drive their growth. And -- and -- and that's because the model is based on 50 percent investment to GDP.</p><p>So if you think about that, that means that -- that if they -- if it takes them two years to finish a project, that means that one quarter of your GDP every year rolls off and has to be replaced with a -- digging a new hole in the ground somewhere.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well -- well, that's while they were at 12 percent GDP growth four years ago and -- and the most recent data is closer to 6.5, 7 percent.</p><p>CHANOS: Seven, yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: It is, because it -- and -- and so the soft...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And by the way, we would kill for 7 percent GDP.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, well, the 7 percent is a little misleading, too, though, because, again, 7 percent, the consumer is still declining per GDP. So the 7 percent is only really coming from -- from the fact that they're still building stuff. And -- and now, it's beyond a shadow of a doubt, even -- even Chinese officials or died in the wool bulls will tell you, they've got to change that, they've got to reform this. And they've got to get away from this investment-driven model.</p><p>The question is, how?</p><p>RITHOLTZ: How and what do they replace it with?</p><p>CHANOS: Exactly.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You know, the -- the key -- the fascinating thing about China, or let me flip that around, the interesting thing about U.S. manufacturing, we started seeing signs of this about five years ago, be fracking blew up, before natural gas was everywhere. But natural gas prices had dropped and we were hearing about companies relocating in the U.S., setting up a natural gas electrical generator. One of the big complaints you hear about China is a lack of consistent electrical availability.</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Not only 24-7, but a consistent amperage and wattage...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, peak -- peak usage.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and it fluctuates and...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you have to set up a series of electronics just to get a steady whatever it is, 120 and 60. So in the U.S., you run a natural gas pipeline near a factory, you set up an electrical code generation plant, you're effectively getting unlimited, very low cost energy and you don't have to take three weeks to ship your product to the States.</p><p>And that's...</p><p>CHANOS: Well...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- started as a -- as labor prices started to go up...</p><p>CHANOS: And Chinese wages have gone up, too.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- what happens when wages go from $1 a day to -- to $25 a day?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, that's -- that's what's happened. In fact, net -- net exports in China, when I first started looking at China, net exports were 12 percent of GDP, exports minus imports. Now, it's almost down to 0. Now, it's a couple percent.</p><p>And so -- so the impact that China, as an exporting engine, is already diminished on their GDP.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's amazing.</p><p>CHANOS: And they've offset it now -- they've offset it with more and more investment. So the story in China is not export anymore, the story in China is this giant building project, the property building.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Can -- can you grow a middle class in a -- a country that size and use that the way the U.S. post-World War II -- you know, we had a 50 year run after World War II, where the middle class boomed like never before. And it was a period of tremendous economic growth.</p><p>CHANOS: Right. But we...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Can China do that?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, we were already past the middle income trap at that point, though. We -- we passed that in the -- the late 19th, early 20th century.</p><p>I mean China is still facing that. And -- and how do you get people from the sort of $5,000 to $7,000 per capita...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- income level to -- to $30,000 or plus?</p><p>And -- and that's always the tricky point in -- in economic development is -- is the, you know, basically, there's four phases of economic development, Barry. You've got, basically, you educate the population from illiteracy to secondary school education.</p><p>Second, you move people from rural areas to urban.</p><p>Third, you employ capital where it never -- capital has never been employed. That's where we are in China right now.</p><p>And the fourth and the way that South Korea and Japan and post-war Germany, post-war is you finally begin to innovate and make products that the rest of the world wants and be more productive.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And that's the tricky part. And that's where most countries can't surmount. They get to the third point, but they can't get to the fourth point, where they become truly innovative and -- and -- and it -- the Asian tigers all fell by the wayside, for example, in the mid-'90s...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- with the exception of South Korea and -- and Singapore. The rest all -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, basically...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Vietnam...</p><p>CHANOS: -- stalled out.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Um, that's where we are with China right now.</p><p>The three countries post-World War II were Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union. They all were pretty much destroyed by the war.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh-huh.</p><p>CHANOS: They had to rebuild. They had to start from scratch. You know, they already had educated workforces. They already had urban centers.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: But they had to basically put capital to work again, which they did. And Germany, in the '60s and Japan in the '70s began to innovate and produce world-class products that everybody wanted.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: For sure.</p><p>CHANOS: The Soviet Union didn't.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: And China, the question is, will China ever be able to do - - be more than just a -- a high end...</p><p>CHANOS: A manufacturing base.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- that's it.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and the -- and/or employ capital in a non-impressive way to build empty buildings and condos and things like that. And that's what they're doing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So the quote you had about China, I'll -- I'm curious if you still think this is true. \"The Chinese banking system is built on quicksand.\"</p><p>CHANOS: Yes. It's...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Is it still true?</p><p>CHANOS: -- I just think it's -- it's more true than ever, um, in -- in that there's just -- the bad loans are there. There's legacy bad loans they didn't address from even 10 years ago. Um, they are telling you with a straight face that non-performing loans are, you know, less than 1 percent. Um, and -- and yet, you just see the madness of some of these projects and the fact that defaults are starting now left, right and center and they'll look at you with a straight face and say, oh, no, no, our non- performing loans are not a problem.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So I can sit here and continue speaking to you for a couple more hours.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: But I know your assistant will kill me if I keep you here past 4:00. So I -- I just wanted to end on one last question. And before I forget, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. I know people are going to find this a fascinating conversation.</p><p>The -- the last question I want to ask you is really general and open- ended. Um, the industry of Wall Street, finance, investment banking, investing has changed dramatically over the past 30 years and especially over the past five years.</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: What do you see happening in this industry going forward?</p><p>CHANOS: Well, I -- I kind of would like to think we're seeing our limits on it, because -- and it's always -- it's always a little bit hypocritical to talk -- talk, you know, negatively about what you do for a living, but I think that -- that the nature of finance, in and of itself, as a profit center or a big part of the economy is sort of self-defeating.</p><p>And -- and I think that we've gotten kind of to the limits, I suspect, of where finance can go to push the U.S. economy. I mean I think it hit its peak in '06-'07, uh, in terms of finance as a percent of corporate profits and...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The argument is -- that I've made is the bailouts prevented that process of...</p><p>CHANOS: You know, clearing...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- converting back to...</p><p>CHANOS: -- of clearing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: -- the market clearing.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes, and I would agree with you on that. And I read, you know, I remember at the time you were writing that and you were right. And I agree with it. And I think that -- that unfortunately, finance becoming a big part of the economy in terms of taking deposits, making loans, all of that stuff, puts it in this too big to fail category broadly speaking, where -- where ironically enough, it cannot be subject to the -- the -- the whims of capitalism itself, creative destruction, because it would just be systemic.</p><p>And so we -- we build this monstrous Rube Goldberg like contraption that is completely ludicrous and then say we can't let it fall apart...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So...</p><p>CHANOS: -- because it will impact everything else.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- so too big to fail, too much leverage, too little capital...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and yet not subject to the laws of capital.</p><p>CHANOS: Well, let's leave it at this. If we look at those -- those dark days of '08 and '09, the one industry that actually went through bankruptcy was the auto industry. And I always chide my friends in White - - at the White House and -- who say, oh, well, the auto bailout was smart.</p><p>And I keep saying, you know, no, it wasn't an auto bailout. I was short the -- the auto stocks. Shareholders were wiped out...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- the boards were -- were dismissed. The executives were fired. They brought in new teams, they recapitalized the companies, the government put in debtor in possession financing...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- which was post-bankruptcy. Now, we can argue about the unions' role in that, that employees were given seniority. But in many bankruptcies, in...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's typical.</p><p>CHANOS: -- employees are...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: That's not atypical.</p><p>CHANOS: -- given preference.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: And -- and, in fact, we did exactly what capitalism should have said we did, we recapped the industry and we made it more viable going forward.</p><p>The people who took risks in the past, you know, paid the price.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right. That's exactly right.</p><p>CHANOS: But it worked. It actually worked better, I think, than what we've had in finance coming out of this, which was...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Well, we had -- we had a Treasury secretary that was from finance. And so industry gets bankruptcy, finance gets bailouts. If it was reversed, if you had the head of a railroad or a head of a manufacturing plant, I can't guarantee you that GM and Chrysler would have been put through bankruptcy, but I can guarantee you that Citi and Bank of America and Merrill and Morgan would have been treated the way financiers treated manufacturers.</p><p>CHANOS: But then we might not have had this beautiful new Bloomberg headquarters.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Uh, I think this predates it. This was up long before that.</p><p>CHANOS: I know it was. I'm just kidding.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: So -- so listen, you know, the counter-argument, and this - - this is me talking literally in my book, the counter-argument is if you take -- my example is Bank America...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- Merrill Lynch, Countrywide, that giant...</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- horrific blasphemy of a company...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- if you would have put them into bankruptcy, you spin out Merrill as a free-standing, clean balance sheet investment firm.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- you spin out Bank America as a clean balance...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- money center bank. You spin out Countrywide as a mortgage underwriter.</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You take all the bad paper -- I -- I'm fond of saying no such thing as toxic assets, only toxic prices.</p><p>CHANOS: Right.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: You sell all that crap that's dragging down their balance sheet all these years...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- at 15, 20 cents on the dollar...</p><p>CHANOS: Yes.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- someone's a buyer of that...</p><p>CHANOS: Of course.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- and you also end up clearing all those home prices instead of having private equity come in and try and flip them, these home prices plummet and first time home buyers are buying houses at a reasonable price.</p><p>CHANOS: If you had wiped out the equity of these institutions, what, you know, to the -- 80 percent...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANOS: -- subordinated that.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: Sixty percent on the mezzanine debt, 50 percent on other debt and the depositors were whole...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- I think not only would that have helped the whole process, it would have -- it would have meant that people learned the lessons going forward.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: The -- the moral hazard gets avoided and we, in our economic recovery in 2014 would be...</p><p>CHANOS: Correct.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: -- years ahead of where we are (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>CHANOS: And the depositors understood that they -- the ones taking no risk were protected by the government...</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p>CHANOS: -- as they should be. But the more risk you took, the more at risk you were at, I undoubtedly think the system would be far healthier today than it is.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: It's -- it's called risk for a reason.</p><p>CHANOS: And I've got it.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: Jim, thank you so much for your time.</p><p>CHANOS: Barry, thank you.</p><p>RITHOLTZ: This has been absolutely fascinating.</p><p>You've been listening to Master of Finance series.</p><p>I'm Barry Ritholtz.</p><p>This is Bloomberg Radio and we've been speaking to Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates.</p><p>Thanks so much for coming in, Jim.</p><p>CHANOS: My pleasure.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: You're listening to Masters In Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio.</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

The K-ICS, which the financial regulator plans to implement in line with the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS17), also needs to be well prepared.\"    \"With the increase in non-face-to-face transactions since the COVID-19 incident, Big Tech's power with a strong platform is further strengthening,\" he said, referring to big-tech companies that quickly penetrate the financial market and threaten traditional financial companies.    Chairman Shin stressed the need to carry out \"two-handed management\" through digital transformation as a solution to overcome the crisis. The company should not only innovate its financial and insurance businesses through digital transformation at the company level, but also enter new business areas.    Chairman Shin said, \"To survive rapid market changes and become a continuously growing company, we need to do 'two-handed management' by generating profits through existing life insurance businesses and finding future growth engines together.\"    Kyobo Life Insurance's pursuit of \"digital transformation\" is to fundamentally change and innovate the way it works, focusing on innovation in products and services based on digital, streamlining insurance business and asset management processes, and establishing a new business model based on digital.    Shin also called for the establishment of a \"two-sided market platform\" to discover new business models. A \"two-sided market platform\" refers to a platform that enables both consumers and suppliers to be active within the platform and obtain the desired value.    \"As it is difficult to build a two-sided market platform centered on the insurance business, the idea for the two-sided market platform should be found in new areas outside the insurance business,\" he added. \"The more powerful the two-sided market platforms are developed, the higher the market position will be.\"    <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kslee@koreaittimes.com\">kslee@koreaittimes.com</email>    \uc800\uc791\uad8c\uc790 \u00a9 Korea IT Times \ubb34\ub2e8\uc804\uc7ac \ubc0f \uc7ac\ubc30\ud3ec \uae08\uc9c0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42801526558</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JK-T1D1-F07F-82VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Korea IT Times</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002RKU</classCode><className>KYOBO LIFE INSURANCE CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC6321 ACCIDENT &amp;

Le secteur est engag\u00e9 dans un cycle d\u2019investissement lourd, qui se poursuivra avec le lancement de la 5G, la grande affaire sur le plan strat\u00e9gique pour les op\u00e9rateurs. Les attributions de fr\u00e9quence seront un rendez-vous tr\u00e8s important. Cela fait neuf ans que l\u2019Arcep n\u2019a pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9 une attribution aussi structurante pour le march\u00e9. L\u2019autre grand chantier, c\u2019est la fibre. Nous esp\u00e9rons annoncer plus de 4 millions de prises construites en 2020. Nous allons en parall\u00e8le nous pencher sur l\u2019extinction du r\u00e9seau cuivre. Concernant la 5G, nous prenons conscience que la technologie pose de nombreux enjeux et nous entendons jouer un r\u00f4le.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Les discussions avec le gouvernement \u00e0 propos de l\u2019attribution des fr\u00e9quences 5G ont \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement longues. Ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement difficiles ?</emphasis></p><p>            Il est normal et sain que ces \u00adattributions fassent l\u2019objet de d\u00e9bats. Le spectre est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des Fran\u00e7ais. Il y a eu des allers-retours, mais il faut relativiser. Les attributions de fr\u00e9quences 3G et 4G avaient aussi donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des d\u00e9bats intenses. L\u2019essentiel est que nous sommes parvenus \u00e0 un compromis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Le prix plancher fix\u00e9 \u00e0 2,17 milliards d\u2019euros ne risque-t-il pas de p\u00e9naliser les plus petits \u00adop\u00e9rateurs, Bouygues Telecom et Free, aux capacit\u00e9s financi\u00e8res moins importantes qu\u2019Orange ou SFR ?</emphasis></p><p>            C\u2019est difficile \u00e0 dire, car cela d\u00e9pendra du r\u00e9sultat final de la proc\u00e9dure. Si les op\u00e9rateurs, y compris les deux plus petits, ont de l\u2019ambition pour la 5G, ils peuvent acc\u00e9der aux fr\u00e9quences. Evidemment, cela aura un prix. Mais il n\u2019y a pas de handicap discriminant. L\u2019am\u00e9nagement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 donne sa chance \u00e0 chacun.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On parle de mutualisation des r\u00e9seaux entre les op\u00e9rateurs.

Pour autant, dans un march\u00e9 \u00e0 quatre op\u00e9rateurs, elle peut \u00eatre une mani\u00e8re de \u00adcombiner le meilleur des mondes, \u00e0 savoir une concurrence \u00adintense et des synergies dans les d\u00e9ploiements afin d\u2019\u00e9viter des co\u00fbts trop \u00e9lev\u00e9s. </p><p>            Les bonnes mutualisations sont typiquement celles en zones rurales, les mauvaises, celles qui vont restreindre la concurrence. Il n\u2019y a pas de dogme absolu. S\u2019il y a des propositions de mutualisations intelligentes qui se font dans le respect de l\u2019autonomie de chacun, nous les accueillerons.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A propos de la 5G, le recours aux \u00e9quipements de Huawei fait beaucoup d\u00e9bat\u2026</emphasis></p><p>            La 5G nous fait entrer dans une \u00e8re techno-politique, o\u00f9 il y a des choix de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 faire. La question de Huawei en est sans doute l\u2019un des aspects, mais je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 me prononcer dessus.

Nous ouvrons ce d\u00e9bat sans a priori. </p><p>            Aujourd\u2019hui, il existe un clivage entre les techno-enthousiastes et les techno-sceptiques. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019\u00eatre pour ou contre la technologie, mais de choisir ce que nous voulons en faire et comment nous nous assurons qu\u2019elle se d\u00e9veloppe comme un bien commun.

Dans un monde o\u00f9 les technologies sont massivement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es par les entreprises priv\u00e9es, nous devons nous assurer qu\u2019elles ne le sont pas contre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des gens. Cela appelle plus de r\u00e9gulation. L\u2019Arcep fait une proposition depuis presque deux ans, et qui n\u2019a toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue, pour \u00e9tendre la neutralit\u00e9 du Net aux terminaux. </p><p>            Actuellement, la r\u00e9gulation des t\u00e9l\u00e9coms est fond\u00e9e uniquement sur celle des r\u00e9seaux.

Or, nous constatons que les utilisateurs sont contraints par les syst\u00e8mes d\u2019exploitation install\u00e9s dans les terminaux, en l\u2019occurrence iOS (Apple) et Android (Google), qui d\u00e9cident \u00e0 leur place. Si l\u2019on veut peser sur le \u00addestin de la technologie, il faudra passer par de la r\u00e9gulation.

Efectivamente, las autoridades europeas, y espec\u00edficamente la Comisi\u00f3n, han sido siempre reticentes a la idea de la creaci\u00f3n de campeones nacionales que pudieran convertirse en campeones europeos para terminar siendo campeones globales, capaces de competir con los gigantes norteamericanos y asi\u00e1ticos, y a menudo han vetado propuestas de integraci\u00f3n entre grandes compa\u00f1\u00edas europeas cuando han considerado que pod\u00edan perjudicar la competencia en Europa. En materia de ayudas de Estado, las autoridades europeas han mantenido tambi\u00e9n una posici\u00f3n muy beligerante respecto de las diversas formas de apoyo que algunos Estados han pretendido dar a sus industrias nacionales en determinados \u00e1mbitos (la construcci\u00f3n naval o lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo con las t\u00e9rmicas son dos casos que nos han afectado de forma relevante), a pesar de saber que esas ayudas no eran ni remotamente comparables con la situaci\u00f3n de que disfrutaban algunos de sus competidores globales. Tambi\u00e9n en el \u00e1mbito de la protecci\u00f3n de datos de car\u00e1cter personal (GDPR) las autoridades europeas han adoptado una posici\u00f3n muy protectora de los derechos de los europeos que contrasta con los niveles vigentes de protecci\u00f3n en otras geograf\u00edas (fundamentalmente, en Estados Unidos y los grandes pa\u00edses asi\u00e1ticos). Por \u00faltimo, en materia de regulaci\u00f3n financiera, las autoridades europeas tambi\u00e9n han realizado un gran esfuerzo por incrementar la competencia en el \u00e1rea, por ejemplo, de los servicios de pago, con el \u00e1nimo de que los consumidores pudieran beneficiarse de esa mayor competencia. </p><p>Personalmente, estoy de acuerdo, e incluso orgulloso, de esta actitud europea por lo que no  formulo ante ella una enmienda a la totalidad. Sin embargo, el demonio se oculta en los detalles y echo de menos en todas estas pol\u00edticas una reflexi\u00f3n suficiente sobre la posici\u00f3n competitiva en la que todas estas pol\u00edticas y regulaciones sit\u00faan a las empresas europeas frente a sus competidores globales. En este sentido, PSD2 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Payment Services Directive 2</emphasis>) es quiz\u00e1 un ejemplo particularmente claro. De manera un tanto ingenua, si se me permite esta expresi\u00f3n que da t\u00edtulo a este art\u00edculo, la directiva obliga a los bancos a abrir las cuentas de sus clientes y la informaci\u00f3n en ellas contenida a favor de nuevos prestadores de servicios de pago.  Si estuvi\u00e9ramos hablando, como el pre\u00e1mbulo de la directiva pretende destacar, de<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> fintech </emphasis>que pueden prestar algunos servicios concretos a los clientes bancarios en condiciones favorables en t\u00e9rminos de coste y experiencia de cliente no habr\u00eda mucho que debatir.  El problema es que esa nueva regulaci\u00f3n puede ser aprovechada, con un coste y esfuerzo muy limitado, por otros actores de mayor tama\u00f1o y muchos mayores recursos, que ya empiezan a asomarse al mundo de la prestaci\u00f3n de servicios financieros en Europa, especialmente en el \u00e1rea de pagos. Esos nuevos actores (como las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech</emphasis>) no se encuentran sin embargo sometidas a una exigencia regulatoria similar, con lo que surge un escenario claramente desigual que beneficia a unos posibles prestadores de servicios financieros frente a otros, sin tener en cuenta (aparentemente) los efectos que ello podr\u00eda producir en su posici\u00f3n competitiva global. Por otra parte, las autoridades europeas no parecen igualmente preocupadas por eliminar los severos obst\u00e1culos que (sobre todo a nivel de legislaci\u00f3n nacional y pr\u00e1cticas supervisoras locales) siguen dificultando tanto la prestaci\u00f3n de servicios financieros con un alcance transfronterizo como el libre movimiento del capital y la liquidez, incluso dentro de un mismo grupo bancario. La paralizaci\u00f3n de la iniciativa para la creaci\u00f3n de un esquema europeo de garant\u00eda de dep\u00f3sitos (EDIS), tercer pilar de la uni\u00f3n bancaria, es otro claro signo de esa asimetr\u00eda. La competitividad global de los bancos (y otras compa\u00f1\u00edas) europeos deber\u00eda ser un punto clave de nuestra agenda, entendiendo que ello terminar\u00e1 redundando  en beneficio de los consumidores europeos. A no ser que creamos (ingenuamente) que situar a grandes competidores globales en una posici\u00f3n ventajosa frente a sus equivalentes europeos no terminar\u00e1 por resultar perjudicial para aquellos. Enti\u00e9ndaseme bien. No se trata, en ninguna medida, de rebajar el est\u00e1ndar de protecci\u00f3n de los consumidores europeos ni de reducir la competencia entre proveedores de servicios, sino de que pueden competir en posici\u00f3n de igualdad y bajo un marco regulatorio com\u00fan. Esperemos que las nuevas autoridades europeas surgidas del proceso de renovaci\u00f3n que est\u00e1 cercano a comenzar sepan encontrar un mejor balance entre la protecci\u00f3n de los consumidores europeos y la competitividad de nuestra industria y, en particular, del sector financiero europeo. Ser\u00eda un acierto.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CINCOD-745032</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CINCOD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMR-M9B1-JDKT-24YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222705</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Estructura, Grupo De Estudios Economicos, S.A.

El producto, como suele suceder en Apple, gener\u00f3 una gran expectaci\u00f3n. Ahora la polmica rodea a dicha tarjeta: David Heinemeier Hansson (@DHH[3]), un influyente desarrollador -cre\u00f3 Ruby on Rails y es CEO de Basecamp- ha criticado duramente a Apple por concederle la Apple Card a l y a su mujer, pero haciendo que ella tenga 20 veces menos crdito que l aun estando ambos en la misma situaci\u00f3n. Acusa a Apple de no tomar cartas en el asunto y sobre todo ha reimpulsado el debate sobre esos oscuros algoritmos propietarios que creemos que son perfectos y omnipotentes, que controlan nuestras vidas y que pueden ser subjetivos y tener prejuicios. En este caso, afirma DHH, el algoritmo es \"jodidamente sexista\". Algoritmos sexistas Los mensajes de Heinemeier Hansson en Twitter la semana pasada mostraban una situaci\u00f3n parad\u00f3jica: estn casados desde hace a\u00f1os en rgimen de gananciales, declaran a la Hacienda estadounidense de forma conjunta y de hecho su mujer es la que es estadounidense: l es dans y consigui\u00f3 el visado de residencia hace a\u00f1os. The @AppleCard[4] is such a fucking sexist program. </p><p>My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple's black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does. No appeals work. \u2014 DHH (@dhh) 7 de noviembre de 2019[5] A pesar de todo eso, confesaba, \"el algoritmo de caja negra de Apple cree que yo merezco 20 veces el lmite de crdito que ella\". La crtica era dura y contundente, y destacaba que incluso cuando ella paga ese lmite por completo antes de tiempo y cubre esos gastos, la tarjeta no le deja hacer ms gastos hasta el siguiente periodo de facturaci\u00f3n. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.xataka.com/servicios/apple-card-no-convierte-a-apple-banco-sino-financiera-carrefour-que-ing-enemigo-para-banca\">https://www.xataka.com/servicios/apple-card-no-convierte-a-apple-banco-sino-financiera-carrefour-que-ing-enemigo-para-banca</url> En Xataka[6] Apple Card no convierte a Apple en un banco, sino en una financiera: ms Carrefour que ING y un enemigo para la banca[7] ;El problema no solo es Apple, sino la confianza ciega de los empleados -e incluso de muchos de los que respondan en Twitter- en un algoritmo creado para determinar a quin se le concede la tarjeta, a quin no, y con cunto crdito contarn esas personas a las que se les concede. Los propios empleados del servicio de atenci\u00f3n al cliente de Apple no lograron resolver el problema, a pesar de responder rpidamente al problema y ser amables con la queja: no daban respuesta, y cuando lo hicieron -debido a la presi\u00f3n meditica- acabaron dejando el crdito de su mujer como el de l sin ms. Cuando se pusieron en contacto de nuevo con el servicio tcnico para tratar de averiguar qu haba pasado, los empleados respondieron que no saban que haba pasado \"pero le juro que no estamos discriminando, es el algoritmo, simplemente\".  EL ALGORITMO Esa explicaci\u00f3n fue lo que ms enfureci\u00f3 a Heinemeier, que se mostraba frustrado porque \"nadie entiende EL ALGORITMO. Nadie tiene la capacidad de examinar o chequear EL ALGORITMO. Y a pesar de ello, toda la gente con la que he hablado tanto en Apple como en Goldman Sachs estn TAN SEGUROS que EL ALGORITMO no est sesgado ni discrimina en forma alguna. Eso es lo que yo llamara un buen manejo de la disonancia cognitiva\". So nobody understands THE ALGORITHM. Nobody has the power to examine or check THE ALGORITHM. Yet everyone we've talked to from both Apple and GS are SO SURE that THE ALGORITHM isn't biased and discriminating in any way. That's some grade-A management of cognitive dissonance. \u2014 DHH (@dhh) 8 de noviembre de 2019[8] Esa fe ciega en el algoritmo por parte de los representantes de Apple y de los usuarios es lo realmente preligroso para el CEO de Basecamp, que a\u00f1ada que \"tambin es una mierda que eligieran incrementar el lmite de mi esposa sin tratar de ir nunca a la raz del problema. Vamos, esencialmente, a sobornar a un bocazas en Twitter, y as no tendremos que examinar nuestra fe defectuosa en EL ALGORITMO\".        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.elblogsalmon.com/empresas/tarjeta-credito-apple-aciertos-errores\">https://www.elblogsalmon.com/empresas/tarjeta-credito-apple-aciertos-errores</url> En El Blog Salm\u00f3n[9] Tarjeta de crdito de Apple: aciertos y errores[10] ;Heinemeier incluso se gast\u00f3 50 d\u00f3lares para que l y su mujer supieran exactamente cul era su puntuaci\u00f3n de crdito, una medida de la confianza que las entidades bancarias y de crdito tienen en esa persona en general. Con ella, por ejemplo, se establece la probabilidad esperada de que esa persona pagar sus facturas. Just read this thread. My wife has a way better score than me, almost 850, has a higher salary and was given a credit limit 1/3 of mine. We had joked that maybe Apple is just sexist. Seems like it's not a joke. Beyond f'ed up. \u2014 Carmine Granucci (@whoiscarmine) 9 de noviembre de 2019[11] Este tipo de puntuaciones se usan en diversos pases europeos y son especialmente comunes en Estados Unidos, donde por ejemplo entidades como la tristemente clebre Equifax -afectado por el que se considera como el mayor robo de datos personales de la historia[12]- gestiona esa informaci\u00f3n crtica.Pues bien: la esposa de Heinemeier tena a\u00fan ms puntuaci\u00f3n que l, algo que se repeta en otros casos de gente que le responda en Twitter con situaciones similares. The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019. \u2014 Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) 10 de noviembre de 2019[13] Hasta el propio Steve Wozniak, cofundador de Apple, afirmaba que le haba pasado lo mismo con su mujer. l obtuvo 10 veces el crdito que haba recibido su mujer aun cuando no tenan cuentas o activos separados. \"A pesar de ello es difcil contactar con alguien humano para corregirlo. Gran tecnologa en 2019\".  Goldman Sachs tiran balones fuera, Apple no se pronuncia La crtica de Heinemeier es en realidad un ejemplo de c\u00f3mo nuestro mundo probablemente ha depositado demasiada confianza en unos algoritmos que pueden estar muy lejos de ser perfectos o justos. We wanted to address some recent questions regarding the #AppleCard[14] credit decision process. pic.twitter.com/TNZJTUZv36[15] \u2014 GS Bank Support (@gsbanksupport) 11 de noviembre de 2019[16]; De hecho, apuntaba este desarrollador y emprendedor de xito, todo esto nos lleva a una reflexi\u00f3n clara que parece demostrar seg\u00fan l que equipos en los que la diversidad (por ejemplo de raza, sexo o credo) es amplia permiten \"crear mejores productos\". Afirmaba que \"me sorprendera enterarme de que el equipo de Apple que trabaja en esto no est sobrerrepresentado por hombres, o al menos por mujeres que no han tenido que preocuparse por la aprobaci\u00f3n de ese crdito. Es fcil mantener el status quo cuando todo fluye para ti\".       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.xataka.com/robotica-e-ia/pueden-ser-racistas-los-algoritmos\">https://www.xataka.com/robotica-e-ia/pueden-ser-racistas-los-algoritmos</url> En Xataka[17] Pueden ser racistas los algoritmos?[18] La polmica generada por los tuits de DHH ha provocado una fra respuesta por parte de Goldman Sachs, cuyo departamento de soporte ha publicado un mensaje en Twitter en el que afirman que \"no tomamos ni tomaremos decisiones basadas en factores como el sexo\". Seg\u00fan este banco, cada solicitud toma en cuenta factores como la puntuaci\u00f3n de crdito, cunta deuda tiene la persona y c\u00f3mo se ha gestionado esa deuda. Seg\u00fan Bloomberg[19] la tarjeta de crdito de Apple est totalmente gestionada por Goldman Sachs, \"que es responsable de todas las decisiones de crdito de la tarjeta\". Las entidades de crdito cada vez ceden ms el control de esas decisiones a mquinas y algoritmos \"como parte de una estrategia para reducir costes e impulsar las solicitudes de prstamos\".   El comentario de Goldman Sachs no ha detenido a los reguladores de Wall Street, que estn iniciando una investigaci\u00f3n sobre las prcticas de esta entidad de crdito. Como indican en Bloomberg, esta decisi\u00f3n se produce poco despus de que esa misma entidad reguladora iniciase una investigaci\u00f3n de UnitedHealth Group Inc. tras descubrirse que su algoritmo favoreca[20] a pacientes de raza blanca frente a los de raza negra a la hora de conceder seguros sanitarios. No es, ni de lejos[21], la primera vez que pasa algo as[22].Apple no se ha pronunciado a\u00fan sobre la cuesti\u00f3n, algo que el propio Heineman ha criticado[23]. En Xataka nos hemos puesto en contacto con sus responsables pero a\u00fan no hemos recibido respuesta. Si lo hacemos actualizaremos esta informaci\u00f3n con esos datos.

Y cada vez ms, la automatizaci\u00f3n de procesos[1] y la aplicaci\u00f3n del machine learning[2] se acercan a un escenario de disrupci\u00f3n a manos de los llamados neobancos[3], compa\u00f1as fintech[4], apps[5], plataformas digitales[6] o gigantes tecnol\u00f3gicos[7] como Amazon[8], Google[9], Apple[10] y otros, hasta operadoras de telecomunicaciones[11], que amenazan con deconstruir la cadena de valor de la banca tradicional pieza por pieza[12]. Tecnologa, desintermediaci\u00f3n y automatizaci\u00f3n avanzada de la transaccionalidad gracias al machine learning son las piezas que estn dando lugar a una tormenta perfecta de la que no se est hablando lo suficiente, pero que muchos ven venir con autntico pnico mientras esperan in\u00fatilmente que algo o alguien salga a protegerlos de la lluvia. No, el problema de la banca no es que surjan startups ms ligeras y con propuestas ms atractivas[13] para algunos segmentos de clientes como los que viajan mucho[14], que esas startups se hagan con licencias bancarias[15] en pases como Lituania, que la mismsima Google se plantee ofrecer cuentas corrientes[16], o que surjan f\u00f3rmulas nuevas[17], con marcas imaginativos[18] o con capitalizaciones crecientes[19]. El problema no es ese, como tampoco lo son los vanos intentos de los reguladores por evitar el proceso aludiendo a los posibles riesgos para los usuarios[20] o a la asimetra de algunos competidores[21]. El problema es que cada da ms, cualquiera puede plantearse ser un banco. </p><p>Como tal, el negocio bancario no es intrnsecamente muy rentable - o ser difcil que lo sea - en un escenario de creciente automatizaci\u00f3n y transparencia, pero s ofrece muchas posibilidades interesantes como complemento a otros negocios, que adems, en muchos casos, pueden extrapolar la confianza que generan en sus clientes y situarse por encima de la banca tradicional y su muy maltrecha imagen de cara a los usuarios. Tiene sentido que muchos bancos tradicionales ofrezcan brillantes resultados, cuando hablamos de un negocio transaccional cada vez menos especfico y con menos valor a\u00f1adido? Veremos bancos que desaparecen como tales, para que sus funciones vayan siendo progresivamente absorbidas por compa\u00f1as de consumo que ofrecen crdito a sus clientes, por universidades que invierten en sus estudiantes y gestionan sus ahorros y transacciones, por especialistas en inversiones con estructuras ligersimas y comisiones min\u00fasculas[22], o por empresas online con reputaci\u00f3n impecable de servicio al cliente. La automatizaci\u00f3n, que lleg\u00f3 sustituyendo puestos de nivel bajo en banca e inversiones, ya desplaza a algunos de los puestos con sueldos ms jugosos en las lites financieras[23]. Una tarta, la de los servicios bancarios, cada vez ms deseada por un mayor n\u00famero de actores, que ven la posibilidad de hacer las cosas mucho mejor que como lo hace la banca tradicional, en muchos casos con estructuras sobrecargadas de sucursales fsicas y plantillas a\u00fan enormemente sobredimensionadas, a pesar de las oleadas de despidos y prejubilaciones de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. La reputaci\u00f3n de especialistas de los bancos, en entredicho: ofrecer servicios bancarios sin ser un banco tradicional nunca ha sido ms sencillo. Basta constituir una startup, montar una propuesta de valor que suene atractiva a determinados segmentos de clientes, y dejar que la prensa y el boca-oreja haga el resto. Problemas de confianza? Para muchos servicios bancarios, se puede poner a prueba durante mucho tiempo a una compa\u00f1a sin necesidad de arriesgar demasiado, como ocurre con todos esos padres que envan a sus hijos de Erasmus con tarjetas de neobancos cuya publicidad no han visto en ning\u00fan sitio, pero que les funcionan de maravilla para lo que ellos quieren. En ocasiones, la elecci\u00f3n se hace simplemente por un criterio de rebelda: estamos tan tremendamente hartos de la banca tradicional, que simplemente, queremos probar otras opciones. Algo que, obviamente, no ocurre en todos los segmentos de clientes, pero que sin duda, constituye un fen\u00f3meno en evoluci\u00f3n y crecimiento. Qu es mejor? Ver como neobancos, compa\u00f1as fintech y similares van comindote el terreno en determinados segmentos de clientes, o simplemente, pensar que el futuro es que los servicios que ofreces los ofrezcan compa\u00f1as de otros tipos, ajenas al negocio bancario, que simplemente ven en ellos una oportunidad de ofrecer ms posibilidades flexibilidad o condiciones a sus clientes, incluso con la posibilidad de estabilizar gracias a ello su tesorera? Si trabajas en banca, no es mala idea ir pensando en tu reinvenci\u00f3n profesional. Cada vez hay menos vacas sagradas, y este tipo de dinmicas de disrupci\u00f3n no esperan por nadie.

Or should labor groups seek cooperation with employers, even if the resulting deals do little to advance labor's broader goals?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The debate has flared up around labor's efforts to make inroads with the likes of Uber and Airbnb, businesses that allow drivers and homeowners to earn income as contractors.

Or should labor groups seek cooperation with employers, even if the resulting deals do little to advance labor's broader goals? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The debate has flared up around labor's efforts to make inroads with the likes of Uber and Airbnb, businesses that allow drivers and homeowners to earn income as contractors. And it was on vivid display in the political battle over Amazon's plan to create a new headquarters in New York with 25,000 jobs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The plan fell apart in the face of a backlash over public subsidies, resentment of the covert process in which the city and the state negotiated the deal, and concern about its neighborhood impact. But labor issues were also a factor, giving rise to tensions even among unions.</p><p>  In the more confrontational camp were labor groups led by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which called on the city and the state to withhold nearly $3 billion in subsidies unless Amazon established a ''fair process'' for its warehouse workers in the city to unionize. The retail workers said they were open to negotiating what that meant.</p><p>  ''I think we stood on principle,'' said Stuart Appelbaum, the retail workers' president. ''If you're aggressively anti-union, we shouldn't be giving you subsidies.''</p><p>  A company executive told the City Council last month that Amazon would not remain neutral in an organizing campaign at its local facilities, though an Amazon spokesman said this week, ''We respect the rights of our employees to choose to join or not join a union.''</p><p>  In the engagement camp was the local council of building trade unions, whose members were likely to get work from the construction of Amazon's headquarters in Queens. They were joined by a Service Employees International Union local, which had gained the right to represent janitors and other service workers at the Queens complex.</p><p>  ''Their presence in New York -- a progressive community, a union town -- was eventually going to lead to some potential change down the road,'' said H\u00e9ctor J. Figueroa, the president of the service employees local, known as 32BJ.</p><p>  In some respects, these arguments go back decades. Thomas Kochan, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted that the United Automobile Workers and General Motors negotiated a new arrangement when the company set up its Saturn division in the mid-1980s. In exchange for a role in managerial duties, the union agreed to forgo many of the work rules typical in other plants, such as those governing which worker could do what job. The arrangement stoked tensions within the union and the company for years.</p><p>  But in recent years the growing reach of tech conglomerates has created urgency within labor to court their workers, Mr. Kochan said.</p><p>  Despite their minimal presence in these companies, unions have a variety of levers to pull. They can exert influence through politicians when public subsidies are involved, as in the Amazon case. And they can pressure regulators to scrutinize businesses that upend traditional industries, like transportation and hospitality.</p><p>  Whether to use these levers to force concessions, or to take a less adversarial approach that would give labor a foothold in big tech, has divided the labor movement.</p><p>  In 2016, Uber reached a five-year agreement with a regional branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to create a drivers' guild, which would advocate on behalf of drivers but not challenge their status as independent contractors. The Machinists would also have to refrain from turning the guild into a formal union during that time. In exchange, Uber agreed to provide the organization with funding and a way to communicate directly with drivers. The guild says a majority of its revenue comes from other sources.</p><p>  A rival group representing professional drivers criticized the Machinists for creating a so-called company union -- federal law prohibits unions that companies fund or control, though the law applies only to workers who are employees. Some union officials complained that the guild was anti-democratic, since drivers hadn't elected Machinists officials to represent them.</p><p>  But Sharon Block, a senior Labor Department official under President Barack Obama, argued that the deal was defensible. Ms. Block pointed out that the guild had taken something of a hybrid approach between cooperation and antagonism, lobbying for policies such as a minimum earnings standard for drivers and allowing passengers to tip, both of which have been enacted in New York.</p><p>  ''There are situations in which taking the half loaf can be worthwhile,'' Ms. Block said.</p><p>  Around the same time, the Service Employees International Union was completing a deal with Airbnb in which the company would connect hosts who needed their homes cleaned with unionized workers, an approach that the two sides were already testing in New York and Los Angeles.</p><p>  The agreement collapsed after a prominent hospitality workers union, Unite Here, protested that the deal would merely provide political cover to Airbnb, which the union accuses of destroying good-paying hotel jobs and creating housing shortages.</p><p>  The union's president, D. Taylor, said that Unite Here was always open to working with employers, but that unions typically lacked the clout to cut good deals when they wandered into an industry where their presence was weak.</p><p>  ''You're settling a contract that has lower standards than the dominant union in that industry could get because you don't have leverage,'' Mr. Taylor said.</p><p>  The service workers' union declined to comment.</p><p>  Given the number of people Amazon employs -- more than 250,000 in the United States, not including seasonal workers -- and its influence over numerous industries, the proposed New York headquarters arguably represented the highest stakes yet for a test of these competing approaches.</p><p>  Some experts said a deal allowing a union to represent building-service workers at the proposed Amazon complex could have been valuable.</p><p>  ''They have the opportunity to show the people who work there at all levels that unionization is good,'' said Catherine Fisk, an expert on labor law at the University of California, Berkeley. ''That it's a way to equitably allocate wages, that there is an orderly process for dealing with sexual harassment allegations, with issues about absenteeism -- whatever the company is concerned about.''</p><p>  But others were skeptical that allowing janitorial workers to unionize would have any benefit for the company's broader work force in New York, much less anywhere else in the country.</p><p>  The problem, said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is that servicing buildings is just too far removed from what most Amazon workers do. Many companies have unionized building-service workers but are otherwise union-free, she said.</p><p>  Like those companies, Amazon seemed intent on drawing the line at service workers: It walked away from discussions with labor about a framework that could have made it easier to organize employees who perform core functions, like packing goods at the company's fulfillment centers.</p><p>  The question is whether Amazon can sustain this hard line indefinitely. If it can, progressives and labor activists may have contributed to the loss of 25,000 jobs and billions in future tax revenue without winning any tangible benefits for workers.</p><p>  But there is reason to believe that Amazon may have to bargain with labor in New York at some point, and that unions and other progressive groups will have established an important principle when that happens.</p><p>  After all, many of Amazon's facilities are not like automobile plants or call centers, in that the company can easily plunk them down anywhere. Amazon tends to locate warehouses reasonably close to customers, of whom there are potentially millions in the New York area. It has sought to put its white-collar hubs in areas with many high-skilled workers, a practice that also favors cities like New York.</p><p>  In its statement about the demise of the Queens plan, the company noted that there ''are currently over 5,000 Amazon employees in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island, and we plan to continue growing these teams.''</p><p>  And that logic is likely to apply to a variety of tech companies that seek customers and workers in liberal hubs.</p><p>  ''You don't have huge numbers of highly educated people who they need who want to move to small cities in Arkansas,'' Professor Fisk said. ''I think California and New York and a lot of other places may have more leverage to insist on the high-road approach.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Stuart Appelbaum, left, a union leader, at a demonstration last month.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Social media giants' ``failure'' to tackle hate speech on their sites highlights why new laws are required to protect people online, the Labour Party has argued.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jo Stevens, shadow secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, said the UK ``desperately'' needed legislation forcing platforms to act because ``self-regulation isn't working''.</p><p>Labour has accused the Government of delaying the introduction of an online harms bill to protect internet users.</p><p>Ms Stevens' comments came after Twitter was accused of being too slow to remove anti-Semitic posts made by grime artist Wiley on Friday.</p><p>The rapper's comments, as well his posts made on Facebook-owned Instagram, were condemned by politicians and campaigners and are now being investigated by the police.</p><p>Labour also highlighted the experiences of footballers Wilfried Zaha and David McGoldrick, who were victim to racist abuse online earlier this month.</p><p>The party also claimed that the ``anti-vaxx movement'' - people opposed to vaccinations - had been allowed to grow to ``dangerous levels'', and spread ``misinformation that is putting lives at risk''.</p><p>Ms Stevens said: ``The failure to tackle these high-profile examples of hate speech shows why we so desperately need proper legislation to force the social media companies to keep people safe online.</p><p>``Social media companies have had repeated opportunities to show they can police their sites effectively.</p><p>``But when high-profile individuals are allowed to keep their platforms after spreading vile anti-Semitic abuse - and then doubling down when challenged - it's clear that self-regulation isn't working.''</p><p>An online harms White Paper was published in April 2019, with an initial Government response to a related consultation release in February.</p><p>The Government said in its response it was ``minded'' to make Ofcom the new online regulator.</p><p>Last month, Lord Puttnam, chairman of the Lords Committee on Democracy and Digital Technologies, said it was ``unacceptable'' that it had been told new legislation may not be in place until 2024.</p><p>Ms Stevens added: ``The Government promised this bill more than a year ago - it's high time they showed they take the safety of those who use the internet as seriously as the needs and influence of the big tech firms.''</p><p>Last week, a report from MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee said an online harms regulator must be appointed now to hold social media platforms to account.</p><p>They said misinformation about coronavirus was allowed to spread ``virulently'' across social media because legislation is still not in place to regulate it.</p><p>On Sunday, Home Secretary Priti Patel called on social media giants to move faster in tackling hate speech on their platforms.</p><p>Labelling Wiley's posts as ``abhorrent'', she tweeted: ``They should not have been able to remain on Twitter and Instagram for so long and I have asked them for a full explanation.</p><p>``Social media companies must act much faster to remove such appalling hatred from their platforms.''</p><p>Twitter has previously said ``abuse and harassment'' have ``no place'' on its service and that it takes enforcement action over accounts that violate its rules addressing hateful conduct.</p><p>Facebook said there was ``no place for hate speech on Instagram''.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

nitf:lede=\"true\">More legislation is needed to protect people online after social media giants' \"failure\" to tackle hate speech on their websites, says the Labour Party.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jo Stevens, shadow secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, said the UK \"desperately\" needed legislation forcing platforms to act because \"self-regulation isn't working\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Labour party is accusing the Government of delaying the introduction of an online harms bill to protect Internet users.</p><p>It comes after politicians and campaigners condemned Twitter for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/grime-wiley-antisemitic-twitter-a4507701.html\">being too slow to remove</url>anti-Semitic tweets by rapper Wiley on Friday.</p><p>The musician's manager John Woolf, who is Jewish, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/grime-wiley-antisemitic-twitter-a4507701.html\">\"cut all ties\" with the Grime artist</url> following the barrage of offensive posts which are also now being <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/grime-wiley-antisemitic-twitter-a4507701.html\">investigated by the police</url>.</p><p>Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he has written to Instagram and Twitter to \"make it clear that they need to act immediately to remove and prevent the hate which divides our communities\".</p><p>Labour also highlighted other examples of hate shared online by noting the experiences of footballers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/grime-wiley-antisemitic-twitter-a4507701.html\">Wilfried Zaha</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/grime-wiley-antisemitic-twitter-a4507701.html\">David McGoldrick</url>, who were victim to racist abuse online earlier this month.</p><p>The party claimed that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/grime-wiley-antisemitic-twitter-a4507701.html\">\"anti-vaxx movement\"</url>, people opposed to vaccinations, had been allowed to grow to \"dangerous levels\", and spread \"misinformation that is putting lives at risk\".</p><p>Ms Stevens said: \"The failure to tackle these high-profile examples of hate speech shows why we so desperately need proper legislation to force the social media companies to keep people safe online.</p><p>\"Social media companies have had repeated opportunities to show they can police their sites effectively.</p><p>\"But when high-profile individuals are allowed to keep their platforms after spreading vile anti-Semitic abuse - and then doubling down when challenged - it's clear that self-regulation isn't working.\"</p><p>An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/grime-wiley-antisemitic-twitter-a4507701.html\">online harms White Paper was published in April 2019</url>, with an initial Government response to a related consultation release in February.</p><p>The Government said in its response it was \"minded\" to make Ofcom the new online regulator.</p><p>Last month, Lord Puttnam, chairman of the Lords Committee on Democracy and Digital Technologies, said it was \"unacceptable\" that it had been told new legislation may not be in place until 2024.</p><p>Ms Stevens added: \"The Government promised this bill more than a year ago - it's high time they showed they take the safety of those who use the Internet as seriously as the needs and influence of the big tech firms.\"</p><p>Wiley performing at Wireless Festival in 2018 (Getty Images)</p><p>Last week, a report from MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee said an online harms regulator must be appointed now to hold social media platforms to account.</p><p>They said misinformation about coronavirus was allowed to spread \"virulently\" across social media because legislation is still not in place to regulate it.</p><p>On Sunday, Home Secretary Priti Patel<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/grime-wiley-antisemitic-twitter-a4507701.html\">called on social media giants to move faster</url> in tackling hate speech on their platforms.</p><p>Labelling Wiley's posts as \"abhorrent\", she tweeted: \"They should not have been able to remain on Twitter and Instagram for so long and I have asked them for a full explanation.</p><p>\"Social media companies must act much faster to remove such appalling hatred from their platforms.\"</p><p>Twitter has previously said \"abuse and harassment\" have \"no place\" on its service and that it takes enforcement action over accounts that violate its rules addressing hateful conduct.</p><p>Facebook said there was \"no place for hate speech on Instagram\".</p><p>

Lives will be put at risk as a result of this,\" he said. \"We have now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda and today it has been exposed.</p><p>\"These uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson's denials in absolute tatters.\"</p><p>READ MORE: Boris Johnson makes threat over SNP's control of Scottish NHS</p><p>But the Tories hit back, saying that British officials were actually flagging a potential issue which needed to be avoided in future trade talks.</p><p>The papers echoed fears expressed in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme last month, which said the price the NHS pays for US medicines could \"soar\" under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. It said despite Johnson's claim that the NHS \"is not on the table\", sources with knowledge of the trade talks questioned whether that was the whole story.</p><p>Dr Philippa Whitford, SNP candidate for Central Ayrshire and a consultant breast surgeon, said: \"We cannot take the risk of letting the Tories in, and watching them trade away our precious health service that is publicly owned, operated and free at the point of need for a deal with Donald Trump.

This news only broke within the last few minutes, and the practical impact will probably turn out to be minimal or non-existent, but in symbolic or headline terms, this is probably a gift to Boris Johnson. For Tory leaders (and some Labour ones too) it has for years been taken as axiomatic that voters like to see their PM in a wrangle with Brussels (a flawed mindset that ultimately contributed to the Brexit vote) and now at last Johnson will be able to perform this role. Being in breach of EU treaties will go down better with his Brexiter base than sending the letter requesting an article 50 extension, something he did last month after promising he never would. In a statement the commission said:</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>As the guardian of the treaties, the European commission has today sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching its EU treaty obligations by not suggesting a candidate for the post of EU commissioner.</p><p>The UK authorities have until Friday 22 November at the latest to provide their views.

CCHQ issued a press notice claiming that Labour is committed to an open border policy, or \"free movement\" for the whole world, and that as a result 840,000 people could come to the UK every year. CCHQ also said that, if Labour just maintained EU free movement, average net migration might be 260,000 every year for the next 10 years, or 2.6m in total over the next decade. Interestingly the press notice includes an implicit admission of the Tories' failure to meet their own immigration target (getting annual net migration below 100,000), because it says 260,000 per year would be a \"slight increase\" on current immigration levels. The claim that Labour would operate an open border policy is untrue and ludicrous, but Labour has not yet finalised its immigration policy and there is a tension between those in the party who backed a conference \"free movement\" motion (the Momentum wing, crudely) and those who back immigration controls (the Unite wing, crudely).

And what of a Labour majority? The answer will not be welcomed by Jeremy Corbyn: </p><p>The chances of a Labour majority are as close to zero as it is possible to be.</p><p>He said the issues for Labour included Corbyn's personal unpopularity with voters (although he also noted that Johnson was \"the most unpopular new prime minister in polling history\"), and the fact that they had lost both remain and leave votes through a middle-ground approach to Brexit. Curtice said:</p><p>Where they have demonstrated Blairite moderation is the one issue on which you shouldn't demonstrate Blairite moderation, as it won't get you anywhere.</p><p>The current Tory lead of about 10 percentage points would most likely be enough for Boris Johnson, Curtice said.</p><p>With a 10-point lead, however you look at it, if that was to transpire in the ballot box it would be highly likely the Conservatives would win a majority of a size that would be sufficient to get the withdrawal treaty through.</p><p>But given the likelihood the Tories will lose a \"fair chunk\" of seats in Scotland and to the Lib Dems, Johnson needed to keep the lead above about six or seven percentage points: </p><p>If it get below that, the odds are beginning to swing in favour of a hung parliament. So be aware: just because the Tories are ahead in the polls, it doesn't mean to say that Boris is going to get a majority.</p><p>The key battle in northern Tory target seats, he said, would be for the Conservatives to hang on to gains made by Theresa May in 2017, and for the Lib Dems to take seats from Labour. Curtice said: \"Boris Johnson would love the Liberal Democrats to go up.\"</p><p>The one exception to the binary end point, he noted, would be the very particular result where the Tories won 320 or so seats, just below a working majority, and the DUP held the balance. With the Northern Irish party wanting neither to support Corbyn or back Johnson's Brexit deal, this could bring a new deadlock.</p><p>    Prof Sir John Curtice.

Patel, the home secretary, is very popular with with rightwing Tories and Brexit party supporters, but she is not one of the cabinet minister most skilled at dealing with forensic questioning.</p><p>Here is the extract from the Conservative news release explaining how the party justifies its claim. (Bold type in the original document.)</p><p>New analysis released today, using official figures and based on HM government's own methodology reveals:</p><p> Maintaining free movement with existing EEA members would result in average net immigration to the UK of 260,000 per year over the next 10 years. This is equivalent to a city the size of Brighton moving to the UK every year. Labour's policy of maintaining EU free movement would lead to 2.6 million more people moving to the UK over the next 10 years. This scenario is a minimal interpretation of Labour's policy and represents a slight increase based on current immigration levels.</p><p> Extending free movement to the rest of the world would result in average net immigration to the UK of 840,000 per year over the next 10  years. This is equivalent to the combined populations of Manchester and Newcastle moving to the UK every single year. This means that levels of net migration would more than treble if Labour introduced their proposals for completely open borders.</p><p>This analysis is deliberately cautious and is likely to provide a significant underestimate of net inflows from non-EEA countries under Labour's plans.</p><p>This claim is that it is based on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/labour-pledges-free-broadband-for-all-homes-and-businesses-in-uk\">a motion passed at Labour party's conference.</url> But there are two problems with citing it as evidence that Labour would allow annual net immigration to rise to 840,000 a year. First, the wording of the motion was very generalised (the full text is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/labour-pledges-free-broadband-for-all-homes-and-businesses-in-uk\">here)</url>, and it was not clear what it would mean in practice. And, second, Labour is only committed to implementing policies in its manifesto, not motions passed at conference.</p><p>Today Labour is arguing that, when the conference motion demanded a manifesto pledge to \"maintain and extend free movement rights\", this was not a reference to allowing non-EU nationals to come and live in the UK freely. \"There was no mention [in the motion] of geographically extending freedom of movement to other countries,\" a party source said. Instead this was a reference to extending the rights that already apply to British citizens and others with the right to live in the UK, for example by making it easier for spouses to join them, the source argued.</p><p>This may be a fair way to interpret the motion passed by Labour conference, but this is not a point that the party made particularly forcefully at the time.</p><p>Today Labour has dismissed the Tory claims as \"fake news\". In a statement Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said:</p><p>This is more fake news from the Conservative party's make-believe research department. Unlike the Tories we won't scapegoat migrants or deport our own Windrush generation citizens. The damage done to our society has been through damaging Conservative cuts to our public services, not by EU nationals coming to work in them.</p><p>What is true, though, is that Labour has yet to say what its immigration policy would be. Jeremy Corbyn and others have said things that imply that they would like to keep free movement for EU nationals after Brexit, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/14/labour-pledges-free-broadband-for-all-homes-and-businesses-in-uk\">during the campaign Corbyn has tended to sidestep questions about what Labour's exact policy will be</url>, saying details will be given in the manifesto. But Labour does want to negotiate a soft version of Brexit with the EU, keeping the UK aligned to the single market, and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has admitted that negotiating this would involve a negotiation about whether or not the UK would maintain EU free movement rules.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.45am GMT</p><p>block-time published-time 8.41am GMT </p><p>I'm Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver.</p><p> Brandon Lewis, the Home Office minister, is now being interviewed on Today.

Actually those employers that seek to undermine those national agreements are to blame for the exploitation.</p><p>And he [McCluskey] talked about stricter regulations and that is what we are proposing.</p><p>Pidcock added: \"I think it's a false flag, this issue of immigration.\" </p><p>She then accused the media of \"mischaracterising\" McCluskey. Pidcock said: </p><p>What you are actually doing is mischaracterising Len McCluskey as some kind of false division in the Labour party.</p><p>He is the leader of the trade union that I am a member of, he talked very clearly about there not being an environment where national terms and conditions can be undermined by exploitative bosses.</p><p>Pushed again on whether she is in favour of extended free movement rights, as was voted for at the Labour party's conference, Pidcock added: </p><p>I am in favour of making sure there are conditions where no worker, whether they be British or a foreign worker are exploited in this country, because that is the real issue.</p><p>The issue is not about migrant labour, the issue is about what kind of legislative environment we have for workers, and we will create one where all workers are protected.</p><p>Pidcock also hit back at the CBI's claims that Labour's pledge to sanction businesses who cannot prove that they are working to remove their gender pay gap is \"adding bureaucracy\". She said: </p><p>We don't want employers, and some do, to see this as a tick box-exercise where they look and say: 'OK we do have a gender pay gap, and we've written down that we do, but we're not going to do anything about that.'</p><p>There has to be proof of how they're working to close that gap, and if there's absolutely no proof as to how they're working towards the elimination of that gap then there will be some form of sanction.</p><p>     Laura Pidcock.

The party said the policy, estimated to cost around \u00a320bn, would be partly paid for by high taxes on internet companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. The Conservatives criticised the policy, saying it was a \"fantasy plan to effectively nationalise broadband [that] would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions\". A string of public figures have declared they will not vote for Labour due to its association with antisemitism. Authors John Le Carr\u00e9 and William Boyd were among two dozen signatories of a letter published in the Guardian which cites fears of effectively surrendering the fight against antisemitism. The Brexit party claimed that senior figures within their ranks including former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe and its candidate in Peterborough Mike Greene were offered post-election roles by the Tories in exchange for stepping aside. The allegations were vociferously denied by the Tories. A spokesman said: \"Neither the Conservative party, nor its officials have offered Brexit party candidates jobs or peerages. We don't do electoral pacts - our pact is with the British people.\" Jeremy Corbyn said people should be allowed to reunite with their families and stressed the necessity of inward immigration to the UK due to skills shortages. The Labour leader ruled out imposing what he described as \"arbitrary\" net migration targets after successive failures to achieve them. His comments came after the Home Secretary Priti Patel appeared to retreat from a Tory pledge issued overnight to \"reduce immigration overall\". By this afternoon she seemed to water down that commitment (see 3.52pm). Meanwhile prime minister Boris Johnson said he welcomed \"people of talent\" migrating to the UK but that he was \"also in favour of control\". Fake nurse! The Labour party in Wales withdrew a party election broadcast after it emerged that a nurse featured in the video who criticised the Conservative party was an actor. The Liberal Democrats dismissed suggestions (see 8.53pm) that the party has put itself before the national interest in fielding a replacement candidate in Canterbury (see 7.21pm) and in contesting the South West Hertfordshire seat where pro-Remain former minister David Gauke is running as an independent. Earlier, my colleague Andrew Sparrow summed up the day's events up until the late afternoon (see 6.06pm). Thanks for joining us, and for all your comments. The announcement, one of the most significant of the campaign so far, is now leading the major news channels. However, Jim Pickard from the Financial Times has rightly highlighted the apparent inconsistency between John McDonnell's claim in July that the nationalisation of the water companies was \"the limit of [Labour's] ambition when it comes to nationalisation\" and the pledge this evening. He had promised in an interview with the Sunday Times that \"There are no tricks up my sleeve\", that Labour had no plans to nationalise companies such as BT and would limit takeovers to power networks, Royal Mail, rail and water companies. Nicky Morgan, the outgoing culture secretary, has dismissed Labour's pledge to provide free Wi-Fi as \"reckless\" and claimed it was part of an effort to distract from the party's divisions over Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn's fantasy plan to effectively nationalise broadband would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions. Corbyn is so clearly trying to distract from his party's divisions on Brexit and immigration that he will promise anything, regardless of the cost to taxpayers and whether it can actually be delivered. What reckless idea will be next? Of course, the policy would indeed technically cost taxpayers billions, but according to Labour it would be delivered without raising taxes for individuals. And here's some more reaction to the eye-catching policy pledge. A new tax on Big Tech companies including Facebook, Google and Amazon would help fund Labour's plans to provide homes and businesses with free internet connections, while the part of BT responsible for broadband would also be taken under public ownership. A new British Broadband public service would boost 5G connectivity and deliver fast full-fibre internet across the country, where parts have poor internet connections, the party said. If in government, it would aim to deliver the service at no cost to members of the public by 2030 after integrating the broadband-relevant parts of BT into the new public entity. Jeremy Corbyn will make the announcement in Lancaster on Friday where is expected to describe the new free public service as central to his plans to transform the country and economy. The rollout would begin with communities which have the worst broadband access, including rural and remote communities and some inner city-areas, followed by towns and smaller centres, and then lastly by areas currently well served by super-fast or ultrafast broadband. Labour said it will be paid for through the party's \"Green Transformation fund\" and the greater taxation of corporations, adding that it will save the average person \u00a330.30 a month. There would be a one-off capital cost to rollout the full-fibre network of \u00a315.3 billion, in addition to the government's existing and not yet spent \u00a35 billion commitment. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is expected to say that the plans represented \"public ownership for the future\" and would challenge \"rip-off 'out-of-contract pricing\". He told the Mirror: We're dramatically falling behind. The future of our economy has got to be based on the fourth industrial revolution and new technology and artificial intelligence. In some areas it's quite clear it's holding back the local economy. We're falling behind our international competitors when it comes to the roll out of broadband. It's the basic form of communication and where the jobs will come from in future. In the smaller towns and coastal communities, the same message comes up: we're being held up by our transport connections and our broadband connections. This will also transform rural economies. Cat Hobbs, director of campaign group We Own It, also told the paper: It's absolutely clear that privatisation is bad deal for the public purse, and for our public services. We're wasting billions on shareholder dividends and the higher cost of investment in the private sector. By bringing our services into public ownership, we could use that money to deliver better services for all of us. David Lammy has accused the prime minister of not knowing the words to \"The wheels on the bus\" after he appeared to initially falter when singing part of the popular nursery rhyme. Boris Johnson mentioned his visit to a school in Taunton during his round up of his day's exploits only to say that he discussed education funding. Here's a bit more from the Labour rally in Edinburgh. Holding off from committing to specific new policies, Jeremy Corbyn did not address demands for Scottish independence either. Fundamentally our message is one of social justice, social justice that brings a sense of decency to people's lives. That is foremost what we would do. Somebody asked me the other day you would like to do when you go into office on December 13. Lots of things, hundreds of things, I could ask all of you what your priority would be and we would probably come up with lots of things different things. I just thought for a second or two, and I thought the thing I would really like to do is use the power of government, the power of office to end rough sleeping homelessness once and for all. He also repeated his pledge that a Labour government would establish a department of employment rights to \"guarantee from day one of your employment you have got full rights at work, including the right to join a trade union\". Meanwhile, the SNP's logo and a slogan saying \"Escape Brexit\" was projected onto the facade of McEwan Hall in Edinburgh. Brexit party officials are now claiming that senior figures within their ranks including former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe and its candidate in Peterborough Mike Greene were offered post-election roles. In a video directly uploaded to YouTube, party leader Nigel Farage said: They then tried something that borders on corruption. Repeatedly, it's been suggested to me that I might like a seat in the House of Lords so I can go quietly. Every time this gets said my answer is the same: I'm not for sale. I'm not interested. Knowing they couldn't buy me off, there was a concerted attempt from people who work deep inside No 10 Downing Street - and I'm not blaming Boris for this, I don't believe he would be part of this but it shows you the calibre of people he's got around him, the culture that exists in Westminster. He bypassed me and went to other senior figures in the Brexit party suggesting that eight of them could go in the House of Lords and all they had to do was come to Nigel and convince him to stand down in a whole load more marginal seats. As you can imagine, I said I do not want, and will never have anything to do with, this kind of behaviour. At a rally tonight, Farage has also demanded the House of Lords is abolished to prevent people being \"brought off\". And some light relief from the Guardian's sketch writer John Crace. My colleague Severin Carrell is reporting from a Labour rally in Edinburgh where Jeremy Corbyn has announced the party's manifesto will be \"bigger, better and - I'm not sure I'm pleased to say it - longer than the last one\" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard earlier criticised the Scottish National party for what he claimed was a contradictory position in supporting unity in Europe but division in the UK. However, Nicola Sturgeon predicted earlier today that Corbyn would soon back her call for a Scottish independence vote in 2020 after he appeared to soften a commitment made to journalists on Wednesday that such a referendum would not take place during Labour's first hypothetical five years in power. Brexit party chairman Richard Tice has hit out at the Conservative party and re-stoked the row (see 4.34pm) over whether the Tories offered \"jobs and titles\" to his party's candidates standing in Labour-held seats. Since our decision to stand down more than half our candidates for the good of this country, we have been dismayed by the behaviour of senior Conservative Party figures. Our people have been offered jobs and titles to stand down as candidates on the last day of nominations, as part of a concerted campaign to undermine our party. We made a unilateral gesture which should prevent a second referendum and keep Boris Johnson in office. We are proud and grateful that our candidates have resisted these distasteful overtures and stood firm. A Tory spokesman said Brexit party candidates had not been offered peerages. Neither the Conservative Party, nor its officials have offered Brexit Party candidates jobs or peerages. We don't do electoral pacts - our pact is with the British people. The only way to get Brexit done and unleash Britain's potential is to vote for your local Conservative candidate, otherwise the country runs the risk of another deadlocked Parliament, or even worse a Labour/SNP coalition led by Jeremy Corbyn who would subject Britain to two referendums in 2020. Earlier, Brexit party candidate Rupert Lowe - the former Southampton FC chairman - announced that he was not going to contest the election in Dudley North for fear of enabling a Labour victory (see 4.46pm). Chuka Umunna, the Liberal Democrat economics spokesperson, has been fielding accusations that his party has put itself before the national interest in fielding a replacement candidate in Canterbury (see 7.21pm) and in contesting the South West Hertfordshire seat where pro-Remain former minister David Gauke is running as an independent. He criticised the party's former candidate in the constituency, journalist Tim Walker, for acting unreasonably and said there must be \"reciprocity\" among parties if candidates are to step aside. Let's take a look at the facts. We want to stop Brexit, we are the UK's biggest and strongest remain party. We have agreed unprecedented arrangements ... I can't think of any other instance where one of the main parties in the UK has stood aside in an election for other parties in a number of seats. These arrangements can only work where you have a party that is committed to remaining in the European Union. The Labour party has been steadfast in saying it is not a Remain party. But also, if you do these arrangements, there needs to be reciprocity. The problem with what [Tim Walker] did there was that he took a unilateral decision and you operate as part of a team. You are a candidate for a political party. He didn't consult anybody about that decision. That would be like you [the interviewer] announcing that you're going to defect to CNN live on air before actually talking to your employers. That's obviously not a reasonable way to conduct yourself. A string of public figures have declared they will not vote for Labour due to its association with antisemitism. Authors John Le Carr\u00e9 and William Boyd are among two dozen signatories of a letter published in the Guardian which cites fears of effectively surrendering the fight against antisemitism. The Labour party in Wales has withdrawn a party election broadcast after it emerged that a nurse featured in the video who criticised the Conservative party was an actor. My colleagues Lisa O'Carroll and Pamela Duncan have the story In the film, which was broadcast on Tuesday on the BBC, ITV and S4C, the nurse tells viewers how a trade deal with US president Donald Trump is a threat to the NHS. The actor, dressed in a blue NHS style uniform, told viewers: \"We will increase the funding available to our health service. Labour is the party that created the NHS, and we will defend it against Tory attempts to sell it off for parts to Donald Trump.\" Labour said it was not aware that the nurse was fake until someone pointed out she was an actor, in contravention of the guidelines for such broadcasts. Plaid Cymru branded the advert \"fake\" and attacked the Labour party's record on the NHS in Wales. The Green party in Canterbury has announced it will not stand a candidate in the marginal seat where pro-Remain Labour MP Rosie Duffield is defending a wafer-thin majority against the Tories. It comes after the Liberal Democrat candidate unilaterally stood down yesterday, citing fears of dividing the remain vote despite not trusting Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit. Green Party spokesperson Henry Stanton said: The Green Party - unlike other political parties - places local democracy and local parties at the heart of its operations. In this instance, members voted not to stand a general election candidate... The local party will instead be focussing efforts on campaigning to save the Wincheap wet woodland and water meadows, improve public transport and clean up Canterbury and Whitstable's dirty air. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was forced to deny losing control over her party on Wednesday after Tim Walker suddenly announced he was standing aside in an article for the Guardian. The party - which came a distant but respectable third in 2017 - swiftly installed an outside candidate, Claire Malcolmson, a councillor in Surrey, to replace him. Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has confirmed her party will run 17 candidates across the 18 constituencies in Northern Ireland, with none of the major parties contesting all seats due to a unionist electoral pact and pro-Remain agreements. Foster also criticised Sinn Fein over the party's historic decision to not to take up seats in Westminster, which is due to their principled refusal to \"validate British sovereignty over the island of Ireland\". This will be a close election. It's about who has a plan to deliver for Northern Ireland. The DUP has a strong team of candidates who have a plan to get Northern Ireland moving again. We will stand on our record as the only party to have delivered 1.5 billion more to support hospitals, schools, broadband and roads. Real investment in real lives. Sinn Fein want a mandate to do nothing. They won't take their seats in Westminster and won't let the other parties form an executive in Stormont. It's time to get Northern Ireland moving again. This is from PA Media: The Democratic Unionist Party is running in 17 constituencies, standing aside in Fermanagh South Tyrone in support of Ulster Unionist candidate Tom Elliott. Sinn Fein is running in 15 constituencies, and will not field candidates in South Belfast, East Belfast or North Down and will instead support pro-Remain candidates in those seats. Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party will run candidates in 16 constituencies. Alliance is the only political party that is running candidates in all 18 constituencies. At the last election, the DUP won 10 seats and Sinn Fein won seven, along with independent Sylvia Eileen. A total of 102 candidates will contest 18 constituencies across Northern Ireland at this year's General Election. Nominations closed on Thursday ahead of next month's polling day. Steve Aiken from the UUP had previously suggested the party would run in all of the region's 18 constituencies. He later rowed back from that position following pressure in North Belfast and from unionist rivals over standing a candidate against Democratic Unionist deputy leader Nigel Dodds, who is expected to face a tight race against Sinn Fein's John Finucane. The other constituency which the UUP will not run in is West Belfast, a seat which has traditionally been dominated by Sinn Fein with only a small unionist vote. Aiken also came under pressure for his party to stand aside in South Belfast where the DUP's Emma Little Pengelly is expected to come under pressure from SDLP candidate Claire Hanna. The Green Party has stepped aside in South Belfast for Hanna due to her Remain credentials. Meanwhile, the SDLP announced it has completed the nomination of the 15 candidates it will run. The party had previously said it was stepping aside in three constituencies in support of other remain candidates. Those are North Belfast, East Belfast and North Down. The Green Party is stepping aside in East, West and North Belfast in support of pro-remain candidates. Of the smaller parties, People Before Profit is running two candidates, the NI Conservative Party is contesting four seats and Aontu will stand candidates in seven constituencies. My colleague Jamie Grierson has debunked the Tories' claim that net migration would reach 840,000 under a Labour government. The Tories had said its analysis of Labour's conference proposals suggested net migration could increase to 840,000 a year under Corbyn, but the opposition party dismissed the \"fake news from the Conservative party's make-believe research department\". The Guardian has been fact-checking claims made during the run-up to the general election. Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women's Equality party, has responded to the news that O'Mara will not contest the Sheffield Hallam seat. She said his decision was \"a victory for women across the country\" and endorsed the Liberal Democrats in the constituency. The Women's Equality Party is the only political party that has won in four fifths of its target seats before a single vote has been cast. WE announced we would be standing against Jared O'Mara to hold him to account at the ballot box, after he publicly admitted sexually harassing a 20-year-old staff member and has yet to face any consequences. He was one of five MPs we targeted and is now the fourth of those men to step down. This speaks to the enormous courage of survivors and campaigners who have spoken out against MPs facing allegations of abuse in this election. Our campaign has made it impossible for parties to continue to ignore abuse and for individual politicians facing unresolved allegations to continue as MPs. O'Mara's decision is a victory not just for the constituents of Sheffield Hallam but for women across the country. However, this situation should never have been allowed to continue for so long. That's why the Women's Equality Party is pleased to be endorsing the Liberal Democrats in Sheffield Hallam in exchange for them taking on our key policies in their manifesto. The changes we are calling for in the Recall Act will give the public more power to sack their MPs, ensuring that constituents never end up in this situation again. Former Labour MP Jared O'Mara will not stand in the general election, as expected, Sheffield Council has confirmed. He famously won the seat from former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg in 2017, and shall not defend the more than 2,000 majority he achieved in Labour's first ever victory in the constituency since it was established in 1885. Former aid worker Laura Gordon will look to prevent local councillor Olivia Blake from upholding Labour's majority, while the Conservatives' Ian Walker will fight the Sheffield Hallam seat for the third time after coming a respectable third at the last election. O'Mara was accused by a junior staffer of sexual harassment after his suspension from the Labour party when a series of sexist and homophobic tweets emerged, written before he was elected. He had said he would be taking time out to deal with his mental health - he has autism and cerebral palsy - after a former aide accused him of being \"the most disgustingly morally bankrupt person I have ever had the displeasure of working with\". Please let everyone be assured that I will be tendering my resignation via the official parliamentary process as soon as term restarts. I am not in any fit state to continue and nor would that be appropriate if I was. I reiterate my apology to my constituents, the people of Sheffield and the people of the UK as whole. The European commission has said it is launching \"infringement proceedings\" against the UK after the government refused to nominate a new British EU commissioner. This news only broke within the last few minutes, and the practical impact will probably turn out to be minimal or non-existent, but in symbolic or headline terms, this is probably a gift to Boris Johnson. For Tory leaders (and some Labour ones too) it has for years been taken as axiomatic that voters like to see their PM in a wrangle with Brussels (a flawed mindset that ultimately contributed to the Brexit vote) and now at last Johnson will be able to perform this role. Being in breach of EU treaties will go down better with his Brexiter base than sending the letter requesting an article 50 extension, something he did last month after promising he never would. In a statement the commission said: As the guardian of the treaties, the European commission has today sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching its EU treaty obligations by not suggesting a candidate for the post of EU commissioner. The UK authorities have until Friday 22 November at the latest to provide their views. This short time period is justified by the fact that the next commission must enter into office as soon as possible. Following the UK's reply on 13 November to the two letters sent by president-elect Ursula von der Leyen recalling the UK's obligations under the EU treaty - and the European council decision of 29 October 2019 extending the article 50 period (1) -, the commission has now analysed this reply and considers that the UK is in breach of its EU treaty obligations. The Conservatives have sought to brush aside new figures showing that A&amp;E waiting times are at their worst level for 15 years. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, claimed this was a byproduct of increased demand, and that the NHS is in some ways \"performing better than it ever has\", but for Labour this was essentially a free hit. Labour was placed on the defensive as the Tories launched an attack on its immigration policy. CCHQ issued a press notice claiming that Labour is committed to an open border policy, or \"free movement\" for the whole world, and that as a result 840,000 people could come to the UK every year. CCHQ also said that, if Labour just maintained EU free movement, average net migration might be 260,000 every year for the next 10 years, or 2.6m in total over the next decade. Interestingly the press notice includes an implicit admission of the Tories' failure to meet their own immigration target (getting annual net migration below 100,000), because it says 260,000 per year would be a \"slight increase\" on current immigration levels. The claim that Labour would operate an open border policy is untrue and ludicrous, but Labour has not yet finalised its immigration policy and there is a tension between those in the party who backed a conference \"free movement\" motion (the Momentum wing, crudely) and those who back immigration controls (the Unite wing, crudely). Jeremy Corbyn has said that he wants an immigration system that is \"fair\". Boris Johnson said that he favoured \"controlled immigration\" and that in some circumstances this would mean net migration levels falling. He said: We want to have a controlled system... And yes, that may mean in some sectors immigration comes down. Johnson has been accused of refusing to meet members of the public and running scared of protests during a visit to Somerset. The Tories have denied a claim from Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, that one of Johnson's most senior aides has been offering jobs to his candidates to get them to stand down in Tory target seats. Farage made his allegation as nominations closed, meaning it is now too late for parties to replace candidates who are standing down. After the 4pm deadline one Brexit party candidate in a ultra-marginal seat announced he would not contest the election because he wanted to help the Tories take it off Labour. Jeremy Corbyn has ruled out agreeing to a second Scottish independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government. That's all from me for tonight. My colleague Mattha Busby is writing the blog now. People should be allowed to reunite with their families, Jeremy Corbyn has said in an interview where he also stressed the necessity of inward immigration to the UK due to skills shortages. The Labour leader told the BBC that policymakers had to be realistic about the issues the country faces, and ruled out imposing what he described as \"arbitrary\" net migration targets after successive failures to achieve the stated goal. We have to be realistic that in this country we have 40,000 nurse vacancies, we have a great shortage of doctors, we have shortages of many skills, and they cannot be met very quickly because we're not training enough people, so there's going to be immigration in the future. Pressed on whether he would rather see the number of migrants in the UK go up or go down, he said: As a point of principle I want people to be able to be reunited and I want British people to be able work across Europe as they are at the present time. Putting arbitrary figures on it as successive governments have done simply doesn't work. Our immigration strategy is based on fairness, justice and the economic needs of our society, and they are considerable. I have made my case very clear about the value of migration to our society, about the stability of people living in our society, about the horrors of the hostile environment created deliberately by Theresa May, and others, and the uncertainty that so many EU nationals have been put through. I think that uncertainty should finish, they should have guaranteed rights to remain in Britain. The BBC reports that Corbyn said Labour's eventual migration policy would depend on the outcome of Brexit. The party has, of course, promised a second referendum which could see the UK remain within the EU. I recognise why people voted Remain and why people voted Leave in different parts of the country and for different reasons - in my own communities where I represent and also all across the country. [But] I think that is actually a sensible approach that a very large number of people [have] come to think, well, at least somebody has been grown-up about this. Corbyn's comments come after the Home Secretary Priti Patel appeared to retreat from a Tory pledge issued overnight to \"reduce immigration overall\". By this afternoon she seemed to water down that commitment (see 3.52pm). The prime minister Boris Johnson also spoke to the BBC earlier where he welcomed \"people of talent\" migrating to the UK but said he was \"also in favour of control\". The Labour party in Wales have withdrawn a party election broadcast after it emerged that a nurse featured in the video who criticised the Conservative party was an actress. In the film, which was broadcast on Tuesday on the BBC, ITV and S4C, the nurse tells viewers how a trade deal with US president Donald Trump is a threat to the NHS. Labour said the production company had used an actress without telling them and as soon as it was brought to its attention it withdrew the advert. It will not be working with the company in future, a spokesman said. The deadline for election candidates to be nominated was 4pm today. That means that, if a candidate now withdraws, it is too late for their party to replace them. And, right on cue, Rupert Lowe has announced that, despite being selected as the Brexit party candidate for Dudley North, he is not going to contest the election. Dudley North is a Labour/Tory marginal where Labour won by just 22 votes in 2017. The MP was Ian Austin, who left Labour to sit as an independent and who is now urging voters to back Boris Johnson. In a statement, Lowe says he cannot afford to take the risk of his candidature helping Labour win. In an interview with Sky News Jeremy Corbyn confirmed that the \"extend free movement\" motion passed at conference would not necessarily be included in full in the party's manifesto. The party's manifesto policy on immigration (and everything else) would be decided at a Clause V meeting of the party this weekend, he said. He went on: The conferences passes motions, and that is absolutely fine. The meeting that's held this weekend will decide what actually goes in the manifesto, which is not necessarily every last dot and comma of every resolution passed at conference. Tory sources are dismissing the Nigel Farage claim (see 4.20pm) as rubbish and \"typical Farage attention-seeking\". They may say something more specific later. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claims Sir Edward Lister, Boris Johnson's chief strategic adviser in No 10, has been calling Brexit party candidates offering them jobs if they stand down in target seats. I've asked the Tories for a comment, and will post their reply when I get it. UPDATE: Tory sources are dismissing the Nigel Farage claim as rubbish and \"typical Farage attention-seeking\". They may say something more specific later. On the BBC's World at One Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that increasing demand was to a large extent responsible for A&amp;E waiting times in England being at their worst level for 15 years. Over the last five years the number of people going to A&amp;E had risen by a quarter, he said. \"Parts of the system are responding extremely well,\" he insisted. He went on: In terms of getting operations done, there's been a 7% rise, so when people talk about the performance of the NHS, in many ways the NHS is performing better than it ever has. Jonathan Ashworth, his Labour shadow, said Hancock's response was \"staggering\". According to the BBC's Norman Smith, Priti Patel, the home secretary, did eventually confirm that the Tories went to reduce immigration in her broadcast interview. (See 3.52pm.) Boris Johnson labelled climate change protesters \"crusties\" after security concerns forced him to change his election campaign visit to a bakery, the Press Association reports. Extinction Rebellion activists were positioned outside Burns The Bread in Glastonbury, Somerset, prompting a decision to divert the prime minister to one of the company's shops in Wells. At the shop in Wells Johnson commented on the change in plan, saying: \"There were lots of crusties there - more crusty than your loaves.\" In a press notice overnight Priti Patel, the home secretary, said the Conservatives would \"reduce immigration overall\". But in an interview this afternoon she has appeared to back away from that pledge, according to the BBC's Callum May and Norman Smith. Scottish Labour strategists have armed Jeremy Corbyn with data on the numbers of people giving disability payments for mental illness and child poverty for each of the Westminster constituencies he has visited in Scotland. In an effort to switch the agenda from the harder territory of Brexit or Scottish independence on to core topics such as poverty, party officials have mined official data to produce fact sheets for Corbyn and Labour candidates to use in campaigning. Corbyn's two-day trip to Scotland, taking in key seats in Glasgow, Hamilton, Uddingston, Dundee and West Lothian, has been short on new policies but heavy in incident. He has been heckled by opponents, and tripped himself up on party policy on a Scottish independence referendum. But addressing the small crowds and audiences which gather at campaign stops, Corbyn reels off data on local poverty levels. Speaking at Newtongrange Scottish mining museum in Midlothian on Thursday, where Labour's Danielle Rowley won a shock victory in 2017, he lambasted the Conservatives and Lib Dems for their \"political choice of imposing austerity on the whole of the UK ... Nine years later we see the result of it.\" He said: In a constituency like this, which has almost 5,000 people in receipt of personal independence payments, almost 40% of those get it for what's called 'psychiatric disorders' - in reality it's mental health stress. When you have so many people suffering from mental health stress: then you ask yourself, why is that? Is it just one of those things, or is it because of insecurity in their lives? Insecurity in housing, insecurity in the private rented sector, poverty at home. Why are so many children living in poverty in this area? Why are 25% of the population in this constituency in fuel poverty? Are any of these things necessary? Why are 8,000 children living in poverty? Is any of this necessary? No. These are from Sky's Lewis Goodall, who has been out on the campaign trail. The Lib Dems published a plan for equalities and human rights at a new event this morning attended by Sal Brinton, the party president and two Lib Dem candidates who have joined from Labour, Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna. This is from the Jewish Chronicle's Lee Harpin who was there. Boris Johnson has an update on the flooding. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has been tweeting about Labour's stance on free movement. She confirms - as the party was saying earlier, see 9.45am - that Labour is not treating the \"extend free movement\" motion passed at conference in September as referring to maintaining free movement for everyone from EU countries after Brexit. It referred to \"free movement rights\", she says. But the Conservatives continue to clam that Labour actually go much further. Following up on the press release issued overnight (see 9.45am), Priti Patel, the home secretary, has released an open letter to Abbott saying party figures have consistently called for looser immigration rules. Patel quotes John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, saying in 2013: \"If we're a civilised society, we should have open borders... It should be a basic human right.\" But, of course, McDonnell wasn't shadow chancellor in 2013. At that point he was just a backbencher. My colleague Paul Johnson has detected something of a pattern in Boris Johnson's walkabouts around the country. The Brexit party leader Nigel Farage says he does not expect to vote in the general election. According to the Press Association, there will be no Brexit party candidate in the Tory-held Kent seat where he votes (presumably Sevenoaks, where he had his family home), and he does not want to vote Conservative. He told reporters: \"I doubt I'll vote. I very much doubt I'll vote.\" Asked whether he had ever not voted before, he replied: I did spoil a paper in 1992. I couldn't vote for John Major, I couldn't do it. My last Conservative vote was 1987. The BBC's Alex Forsyth has more on Boris Johnson's Glastonbury no-show. (See 1.56pm.) There were lively scenes in Glastonbury as Boris Johnson dodged a crowd of protesters at a bakery in a business park on the outskirts of the Somerset town. Word got out that Johnson was on his way and a crowd of about 100 - including Extinction Rebellion protesters, musicians and even a bard - turned up to greet him at the Burns the Bakery unit. It got tense when the police moved the crowd away from the front of the bakery on to a grass verge close to a busy road. Tory supporters including James Heappey, the party's candidate in Wells, waited at the bakery for Johnson for more than an hour, but he did not show. There was no explanation, leading to frustration and anger from those who had hoped to express their concerns about issues ranging from the climate emergency to the state of the NHS and pensions to the PM. Retired NHS manager Martin Campbell said: \"He's running scared. He doesn't want to talk to ordinary people about the issues that affect us all.\" At one point a rumour went round that Johnson was in Glastonbury high street, leading to a dash from Burns the Bakery into the town but there was no sign there. A video clip later appeared on Johnson's Facebook page of him serving a customer at a Burns the Bread shop, though not at either of the company's two branches in Glastonbury. In an interview this morning in Scotland Jeremy Corbyn said he rejected the claim from Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president, that Britain will become a \"second-rate player\" if it leaves the EU. Asked if he agreed, he replied: No I don't think we are ever going to be a second-rate player. This is a big country, an important country and trading partner and I look forward to leading a government that will be working with others around the world. [Tusk] makes many statements at many times and he is the president of the EU and, yes, he can make those statements and I look forward to discussing them with him. HuffPost's Paul Waugh has got hold of a briefing note from Momentum, the pro-Corbyn Labour group, advising activists how to respond to awkward questions on the doorstep. We have received a briefing from the monarch of UK psephologists, Prof Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University, about what might happen in the election, and the short version is this: while there are many imponderables in play, it seems a toss-up between a Boris Johnson majority and a hung parliament. Curtice said it was \"pretty much a binary contest\" between the two. And what of a Labour majority? The answer will not be welcomed by Jeremy Corbyn: The chances of a Labour majority are as close to zero as it is possible to be. He said the issues for Labour included Corbyn's personal unpopularity with voters (although he also noted that Johnson was \"the most unpopular new prime minister in polling history\"), and the fact that they had lost both remain and leave votes through a middle-ground approach to Brexit. Curtice said: Where they have demonstrated Blairite moderation is the one issue on which you shouldn't demonstrate Blairite moderation, as it won't get you anywhere. The current Tory lead of about 10 percentage points would most likely be enough for Boris Johnson, Curtice said. With a 10-point lead, however you look at it, if that was to transpire in the ballot box it would be highly likely the Conservatives would win a majority of a size that would be sufficient to get the withdrawal treaty through. But given the likelihood the Tories will lose a \"fair chunk\" of seats in Scotland and to the Lib Dems, Johnson needed to keep the lead above about six or seven percentage points: If it get below that, the odds are beginning to swing in favour of a hung parliament. So be aware: just because the Tories are ahead in the polls, it doesn't mean to say that Boris is going to get a majority. The key battle in northern Tory target seats, he said, would be for the Conservatives to hang on to gains made by Theresa May in 2017, and for the Lib Dems to take seats from Labour. Curtice said: \"Boris Johnson would love the Liberal Democrats to go up.\" The one exception to the binary end point, he noted, would be the very particular result where the Tories won 320 or so seats, just below a working majority, and the DUP held the balance. With the Northern Irish party wanting neither to support Corbyn or back Johnson's Brexit deal, this could bring a new deadlock. According to the Press Association, which had a pool reporter accompanying Boris Johnson when he visited West Monkton primary school, near Taunton, Johnson held Rosie the rabbit and sang songs with pupils. The PM then suggested singing The Wheels on the Bus, remarking: \"The wheels are staying very much on the bus.\" According to PA, Johnson asked a separate group of pupils for their favourite book before asking: \"Have you got the Incredible Hulk? That's the one I like.\" In a newspaper article in the autumn Johnson famously compared himself, or the UK as a whole, to the Incredible Hulk. Then he ended up talking about breasts. As PA reports, while looking at a Hulk book, one pupil shouted \"boobies\" to which the PM replied: \"Those aren't boobies, they are muscles.\" While Johnson was inside the school, chants of \"Boris out\" could be heard outside, where Labour, Liberal Democrat and climate change activists were gathered. Jeremy Corbyn is now saying that he would not agree to a Scottish independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government - which would rule out one being held in 2020 or 2021. This is a change from what Corbyn was saying at one point yesterday, when he was ruling it out for the entire five years of a Labour government, although the party subsequently said it would be open to one after the Holyrood elections in spring 2021 (which, given the amount of time preparing for a referendum might take, would be close to saying 2023 at the earliest). In response, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, has posted this on Twitter. My colleague Steven Morris says it is starting to look as if Boris Johnson might be giving Glastonbury a miss after all. Boris Johnson is due in Glastonbury shortly. According to my colleague Steven Morris, who is there, not everyone wants to give him a warm welcome. Here is some footage of Jeremy Corbyn being confronted by a heckler at a meeting in Dundee. (See 10.53am.) According to the Press Association, the heckler later identified himself as Bob Costello, a former SNP activist. It is often assumed that being heckled reflects badly on a politician, but it is hard to watch this and think that Costello emerges with much credit. \"Is this democracy?\" he shouted at one point, during his prolonged interruption of proceeding. Corbyn replied: The democracy is that we have a public meeting where we conduct it in a reasonable manner, and those who wish to say something at the end are of course free to do so. Democracy is not when you interrupt somebody when they are speaking. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, had to delete a tweet this morning saying he would be \"live from South Yorkshire\" when he was in Hull. Hull is in East Yorkshire, as he subsequently acknowledged. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has pledged to revoke article 50 on day one of her premiership if she is elected to Number 10. Speaking to the PA news agency on a visit to the Guru Nanak Sikh temple in Glasgow, she said: The Liberal Democrats have been very clear - we want to remain in the European Union. We are an internationalist party and so a Liberal Democrat majority government would revoke article 50 on day one. She also stressed her opposition to a second referendum on Scottish independence. I want Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom for very much the same reasons I want the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union. We work better when we are closely together with our nearest neighbours, where we share values and we share economic interests. So I want Scotland to stay in the UK, I do not want another independence referendum, Liberal Democrats will not support indyref2. Here is the full quote from Nigel Farage alleging that Tories have been using underhand methods to try to persuade Brexit party candidates to stand down. He did not give any specific examples, and he did not say where this was happening, or who was responsible, but it was clear that he was claiming that this pressure was coming from Conservatives. Farage said: What is going on right now is nothing short of disgraceful. There is a full-scale attempt, going on out there as I speak, to stop men and women, freely, putting themselves up before the UK electorate. You would have thought this was Venezuela. And that is what is happening. Our people, men and women - much like these on the platform here - who put themselves forward are now coming under relentless phone calls, email and abuse, and being told they must stand down. That is happening in 21st Britain. I think that is a complete and utter disgrace. The battle for Scotland's anti-Tory vote between Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon became bitter and personal on Wednesday evening after the Labour leader accused Sturgeon of \"being willing to usher in another heartless Conservative government\". The two clashed on Twitter after Corbyn's two-day campaigning visit to Scotland got off to a rocky start, when he had tied himself in knots over Labour's referendum policy. He first ruled out backing one for a full five-year term, before retracting that after being corrected by his aides to say Labour would not support one for the first few years. He simultaneously rejected Sturgeon's calls for a \"progressive alliance\" to defeat the Tories, insisting it was \"their choice\" whether to back Labour or allow the Tories to regain power. Sturgeon retorted that Scottish National party MPs would only support a minority Labour government if it allowed Holyrood to stage a fresh independence referendum at a time of its choosing. Sturgeon wants one next year. Corbyn retaliated by tweeting back footage from 1979, when SNP support for a vote of no confidence helped topple James Callaghan's Labour government, allowing Margaret Thatcher to win her first general election and heralding 18 years of Tory government. The SNP leader hit back by accusing Corbyn of \"desperate stuff\", pointing out she was in primary school in 1979. The SNP had tabled a no-confidence motion after Callaghan's government decided not to introduce devolution to Scotland as the 1979 devolution referendum required 40% of all Scotland's voters to say yes. After a low turnout, that threshold was not met. With backing too from the Liberal party, Thatcher tabled an early day motion stating the house had no confidence in Callaghan's government which went to a vote. Along with unionist MPs from Northern Ireland, the SNP's 11 MPs voted against Labour, which lost the motion by one vote. Those events are engrained in Labour folklore as proof of the SNP's dishonesty about opposing the Tories. With the polls showing Labour support as low as 12% in Scotland, they face another wipeout on 12 December and are desperately trying to mobilise disillusioned and apathetic Labour voters. Scottish Labour's Facebook page features film of Ian Lavery, the party chairman and a former National Union of Mineworkers president, insisting a minority Labour government would challenge the SNP to vote down its budget, including \u00a370bn extra spending for Scotland, rather than agree a deal. He concluded: \"Let the SNP decide whether they want to accept that or not. Let them decide whether they want to stick their fingers up at the Scottish people.\" Farage says in September he offered to work with the Tories on a \"leave alliance\". That could win an 80 or 100-seat majority. But the Tories were not interested, he says. He claims this shows the Tories are putting party before country. Here is one of the Farage quotes. Farage says if his candidates get to Westminster they will not be \"good little boys and girls\". They will fight for Brexit. He cannot understand why people think it makes sense for the UK to be shackled to 15% of the world's economy, he says. Farage says the Tories have not been grateful for his decision not to stand candidates in Tory-held seats. Instead, all that the party has had from the Tories has been \"wall to wall abuse\", he says. And he claims something \"disgraceful\" is happening that the audience do not know about. Brexit party candidates are coming under relentless pressure to stand down. They are getting phone calls, emails and abuse, he says. Farage claims, again, that Boris Johnson signalled a \"marked change of direction\" in a video he posted on Twitter on Sunday about Brexit. (Actually, he didn't.) Farage says he would be happy with a Canada-style trade deal, or a no-deal Brexit. Under either option, the UK would not be bound by EU laws. Farage says the Tories are today talking about reducing immigration. \"Are you having a laugh?\" In the last three elections they have promised this, but failed, he says. Farage says democracy only works if you have losers' consent. The losers must accept the result of the election, he says. He says the Brexit party will fight Labour in every seat in this country. Farage says the audience probably used to think they lived in a 21st century democracy. But all the promises made by politicians have not been delivered, he says. He claims Labour think people did not know what they voted for. Labour wants people to do it all again. Labour is treating voters with contempt, he says. In May the highest Brexit party vote came in areas with the most Labour MPs, he says. He says Labour is now more about Hoxton than Hull. In Labour areas there is no enthusiasm for Jeremy Corbyn, he says. He claims many Labour voters will stay at home. That gives the Brexit party a phenomenal opportunity, he claims. Nigel Farage is speaking at the Brexit party event. He is in Hull, and he says this is Brexit country. He says the Brexit party reset the political agenda when it was set up earlier this year. Its success in the European elections led to the removal of Theresa May as prime minister, he claims. He welcomes Michelle Dewberry to the party. At the Brexit party event Michelle Dewberry is speaking now. A former winner of the TV reality show The Apprentice, Dewberry is the Brexit party's candidate in Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle. Maybe this is the \"big announcement\" the party promised earlier. (See 10.15am.) Dewberry stood as an independent, pro-Brexit candidate in the same constituency in 2017. She says in this campaign it seems as though wanting to speak up for the north has become trendy. But for years the north has been neglected by Westminster, she says. She says Brexit will allow the UK to decide how the country should be run. There should be deeper devolution, she says. She says she is tired of having the north treated \"as an afterthought\". This has to stop, she says. She says politics is broken. There has been a lot of talk of tactical voting. That shows the system does not work. Parliament should truly reflect the desires of the people. First-past-the-post does not achieve that. She says the Brexit party wants constitutional reform. She also rejects the claim that by standing in Hull West and Hessle (a seat Labour held in 2017 with a majority of 8,025) she is splitting the pro-Brexit vote. Every person can use their vote way they wish, she says. The Brexit party event flagged up earlier (see 10.15am) has just started. Nigel Farage, the party leader, is due to speak soon, but at the moment David Bull, a doctor and Brexit party MEP, is speaking. One in six patients waited longer than four hours in A&amp;E in England during October - the worst-ever performance since a target was introduced in 2004, according to official data released this morning. In response Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said these figures showed why the NHS needed Labour's \u00a340bn rescue plan. He said: The Conservatives have ushered in the worst NHS crisis on record. Under Boris Johnson the NHS is in crisis and we're heading for a winter of abject misery for patients. Our A&amp;Es are overwhelmed, more so than ever. In every community there's an ever growing queue of people waiting for treatment. In his response Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said almost nothing about why the figures were so bad, but instead just attacked Labour. He said: With rising demand, and with dedicated staff already working exceptionally hard, the last thing our NHS can afford is Labour's plans for a four-day week and uncontrolled and unlimited immigration, which would cripple our health service - leaving it understaffed and underfunded. It is not true to say that Labour is planning uncontrolled and unlimited immigration. (See 9.45am.) Labour is finding it harder to explain how the NHS would absorb the possible costs of its plans for a 32-hour working week (the Times has splashed on the issue today), but, as John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, explained at a news conference yesterday, this is a 10-year aspiration, not something to be introduced immediately, and the idea is that productivity increases will make it affordable. Here is an explanation of the Labour 32-hour working week plan. It may feel to some of us as if the election campaign has been going on for ages, but on the Today programme this morning Deborah Mattinson, the pollster and public opinion specialist, issued a healthy corrective. Most members of the public are not yet taking any notice, she said. She told the programme: One of the things to bear in mind is that nothing much is landing from this campaign at the moment anyway. There was a poll this week saying 42% of people had picked up nothing. I asked people in a focus group yesterday: 'What have you heard since the campaign began?' And literally they all looked at me blankly. Mattinson said it was only in the last fortnight of the campaign that non-committed voters would start to take an interest in what was going on. Jeremy Corbyn was heckled by a supporter of another Scottish independence referendum as gave a speech this morning at the Queen's Hotel in Dundee, PA Media reports. The report goes on: On the second day of his Scottish tour, Corbyn was interrupted by a shouting member of the audience who asked him what he planned to do about the \"will of the Scottish people\". The man shouted: \"Is this democracy?\" Corbyn tried to quieten him, saying: \"It's perfectly democratic when we listen to each other, so I'll listen to you in a moment.\" \"Take your hands off me,\" the heckler shouted as people grabbed him. He was then ejected to the cheers and claps of the audience. Boris Johnson began campaigning in a rainy south-west by visiting a school, the Press Association reports. Pupils at West Monkton primary school, near Taunton, welcomed the prime minister who was accompanied by Rebecca Pow, the Conservative candidate seeking re-election for Taunton Deane. In the overnight Conservative party press notice about immigration Priti Patel, the home secretary, restates her commitment to introducing an \"Australian-style points system so what we can control our borders\". What do you think David Cameron, the former Tory prime minister, thinks of that? Apart from a low-key day of canvassing in Reading West, he does not seem to have played a role in the election so far, and it would be surprising if he were to start giving interviews criticising his successor. But on this issue we know what he thinks, because he covers it in his revealing and extremely readable memoir, For the Record. Writing about the Brexit campaign, he says: By the time we got to June, referendum month, Boris [Johnson] and [Michael] Gove were pledging to introduce an 'Australian-style points-based immigration system' before the next general election if Britain voted leave. Quite apart from the fact that we already had the equivalent of a points system (clear categories for immigrants, with some channels such as unskilled labour from outside the EU set at zero), our system was tougher than Australia's, and our level of immigration much lower. From the Brexit party I don't know what that will be about, but we'll tune in... In his Today interview Brandon Lewis, the security minister, said wealthy Russian businessmen had an \"absolute right\" to donate to the Conservative party if they were British citizens. Admitting that he had received donations from prominent Russians himself, he said: I have had donations from Lubov [Chernukhin] and also Alexander Temerko, as has the Conservative party. They are British citizens, they are prominent British businesspeople as well - Alexander himself has invested in the renewable energy industry in the East of England. So British citizens have the absolute right, as any other British citizen does, to invest in and be part of the British political scene, and I think it's wrong to accuse them of anything else. It is interesting that CCHQ put up Brandon Lewis, a Home Office minister, to give interviews this morning defending what is the Conservative party's overnight attack line against Labour - the claim that average net immigration would rise to 840,000 a year under Jeremy Corbyn - and not his boss, Priti Patel. Patel, the home secretary, is very popular with with rightwing Tories and Brexit party supporters, but she is not one of the cabinet minister most skilled at dealing with forensic questioning. Here is the extract from the Conservative news release explaining how the party justifies its claim. (Bold type in the original document.) New analysis released today, using official figures and based on HM government's own methodology reveals: Maintaining free movement with existing EEA members would result in average net immigration to the UK of 260,000 per year over the next 10 years. This is equivalent to a city the size of Brighton moving to the UK every year. Labour's policy of maintaining EU free movement would lead to 2.6 million more people moving to the UK over the next 10 years. This scenario is a minimal interpretation of Labour's policy and represents a slight increase based on current immigration levels. Extending free movement to the rest of the world would result in average net immigration to the UK of 840,000 per year over the next 10 years. This is equivalent to the combined populations of Manchester and Newcastle moving to the UK every single year. This means that levels of net migration would more than treble if Labour introduced their proposals for completely open borders. This analysis is deliberately cautious and is likely to provide a significant underestimate of net inflows from non-EEA countries under Labour's plans. This claim is that it is based on a motion passed at Labour party's conference. But there are two problems with citing it as evidence that Labour would allow annual net immigration to rise to 840,000 a year. First, the wording of the motion was very generalised (the full text is here), and it was not clear what it would mean in practice. And, second, Labour is only committed to implementing policies in its manifesto, not motions passed at conference. Today Labour is arguing that, when the conference motion demanded a manifesto pledge to \"maintain and extend free movement rights\", this was not a reference to allowing non-EU nationals to come and live in the UK freely. \"There was no mention [in the motion] of geographically extending freedom of movement to other countries,\" a party source said. Instead this was a reference to extending the rights that already apply to British citizens and others with the right to live in the UK, for example by making it easier for spouses to join them, the source argued. This may be a fair way to interpret the motion passed by Labour conference, but this is not a point that the party made particularly forcefully at the time. Today Labour has dismissed the Tory claims as \"fake news\". In a statement Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: This is more fake news from the Conservative party's make-believe research department. Unlike the Tories we won't scapegoat migrants or deport our own Windrush generation citizens. The damage done to our society has been through damaging Conservative cuts to our public services, not by EU nationals coming to work in them. What is true, though, is that Labour has yet to say what its immigration policy would be. Jeremy Corbyn and others have said things that imply that they would like to keep free movement for EU nationals after Brexit, but during the campaign Corbyn has tended to sidestep questions about what Labour's exact policy will be, saying details will be given in the manifesto. But Labour does want to negotiate a soft version of Brexit with the EU, keeping the UK aligned to the single market, and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has admitted that negotiating this would involve a negotiation about whether or not the UK would maintain EU free movement rules. I'm Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Brandon Lewis, the Home Office minister, is now being interviewed on Today. He was talking about flooding on ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier. (See 8.23am.) He accepts that the Tories have let people down in the past by failing to hit their target of getting net migration below 100,000. But he claims that was partly due to the Tories being in coalition with the Lib Dems from 2010 to 2015. Q: Which immigrants would you allow? And don't just say the brightest and the best. Lewis says the migration advisory committee would advise the government on this issue. The government has to look at this methodically, he says. It would take the MAC's advice. Q: You claim there would be surge of migration under Labour. But this claim is based on a motion passed by the Labour conference that won't be in the manifesto. Lewis says the Tory claim is also based on what Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell has said. He says the Tory claim that Labour could end up allowing more than 800,000 migrants into the UK per year is an understatement. The shadow employment secretary, Laura Pidcock, has dismissed immigration targets as \"arbitrary\". Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Pidcock said: We know actually that migrant labour does not undercut wages, it is exploitative bosses that seek to undermine national agreements - that's our emphasis. Questioned on whether she would be happy for immigration to rise under a Labour government, Pidcock added: \"I think these targets are arbitrary.\" When pushed on comments in the Guardian by the leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, more free movement, Pidcock said: It isn't right that we place the blame on numbers of immigrants for wages. Actually those employers that seek to undermine those national agreements are to blame for the exploitation. And he [McCluskey] talked about stricter regulations and that is what we are proposing. Pidcock added: \"I think it's a false flag, this issue of immigration.\" She then accused the media of \"mischaracterising\" McCluskey. Pidcock said: What you are actually doing is mischaracterising Len McCluskey as some kind of false division in the Labour party. He is the leader of the trade union that I am a member of, he talked very clearly about there not being an environment where national terms and conditions can be undermined by exploitative bosses. Pushed again on whether she is in favour of extended free movement rights, as was voted for at the Labour party's conference, Pidcock added: I am in favour of making sure there are conditions where no worker, whether they be British or a foreign worker are exploited in this country, because that is the real issue. The issue is not about migrant labour, the issue is about what kind of legislative environment we have for workers, and we will create one where all workers are protected. Pidcock also hit back at the CBI's claims that Labour's pledge to sanction businesses who cannot prove that they are working to remove their gender pay gap is \"adding bureaucracy\". She said: We don't want employers, and some do, to see this as a tick box-exercise where they look and say: 'OK we do have a gender pay gap, and we've written down that we do, but we're not going to do anything about that.' There has to be proof of how they're working to close that gap, and if there's absolutely no proof as to how they're working towards the elimination of that gap then there will be some form of sanction. The security minister, Brandon Lewis, has defended the prime minister's refusal to apologise over the government response to the floods in Yorkshire and the east Midlands. Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Lewis, a former floods minister, was played clips of Boris Johnson being heckled about his response to the flood and why he had refused to say sorry. Lewis said: \"Obviously, it's not the PM's fault that there's been a flood.\" He also suggested Johnson had held back from visiting flood-hit areas because he didn't want to hamper the clean-up operation. He said: Sometimes when a big group of politicians and the media turn up, they get in the way and they distract people from doing the job. The prime minister was able to visit when it's right, not distracting from the core work of getting people's lives back together as quickly as possible. Lewis was challenged on why Doncaster, one of the areas worst hit by the floods, has had its funding cut by 50% since 2010. He defended the government austerity policy. He said: We had such a dreadful economic situation back in 2010 that we inherited that we had to reduce spending so the country could get back gradually to living within its means. Local authorities are a huge part of the public sector expense. And if it was right that they played their part and there was a lot of efficiencies we could find. Asked if he was claiming that 50% of Doncaster budget was being wasted, he said: The 50% [cut] refers to just one part of their budget. It doesn't include the council tax and other income they get. So it not a 50% cut overall. When we have a situation like flooding, that's why we have what's called the Bellwin scheme and that's something that kicks in to take on in this kind of natural disaster. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has rejected pressure to withdraw more of his candidates in Labour or Liberal Democrat seats. Speaking to Today, on the day when nominations for candidates close, he said: We're going to fight 300 seats and that's exactly what we're going to do. The job of the Brexit party is to hold him [Boris Johnson] to account, because too many times over the last three years the Conservatives have made promises and not delivered. He also criticised the Conservatives for refusing to do a deal with the Brexit party in Labour seats. \"I've realised that the Conservatives want a Conservative majority in parliament, not a Brexit majority in parliament.\" He added: There are very clearly seats in which we are the lead challenger and their are other seats in which they are the lead challenger to Labour, and we could have done a deal on that basis, but the priority for the Conservative party, they do not want the Brexit party to get seats in parliament. They'd rather risk not winning the election than having a leave majority, a leave alliance. He also criticised his old ally Arron Banks, who urged him to withdraw more candidates. Farage said Banks was suffering from \"Brexhaustion\". And he claimed the election would be decided by tactical voting. Farage said: I'm going to go out around the country saying to Labour voters: 'You are being let down badly, betrayed by the Labour party who now want you to vote again.' And the same for Conservative voters: in seats that the Conservatives have never won in 100 years, your best chance of getting Brexit is to get us in there and hold Boris Johnson to account. And ultimately this election will be decided by tactical voting decisions all across the country. Luciana Berger, the Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for health and social care, has defended the party's insistence on putting up a candidate in Canterbury despite the previous candidate decision to stand aside in favour of Labour. Berger, who defected from Labour earlier this year, conceded that the Labour candidate's, Rosie Duffield, is \"a very lovely person\". But speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme she added: I know her very well personally, but she's campaigning to put Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10. This comes down to the choice who's going to be our next prime minister at this general election. Berger pointed out that Labour had refused to take part in cross-party talks on a remain pact. She said: I wish the Labour party would have been involved in the unite to remain discussions. They had ample opportunity to do so but they refused to engage. One of the most senior members has said that the Labour party is not a party of remain. And if people want to party remain at this election, they have to vote for the Liberal Democrats. The papers Matthew Weaver brings us one of the more disturbing stories of the day. Boris Johnson dropped a reference to \"onanism\" from an election campaign speech after previews of the text drew criticism from the opposition. On Tuesday night Johnson's advisers released extracts from the speech the prime minister was due to give at an electric taxi factory in the West Midlands on Wednesday. In the texts given to journalists, Johnson likened Labour's approach to spending, Brexit and Scottish independence to \"self-obsession and onanism\". But when Johnson delivered the speech the word onanism was left out. Asked about the omission by the Sun's political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, Johnson tried to laugh it off. He said: \"All I can say is that a stray early draft seems to have somehow found its way into your otherwise peerless copy, by a process that I don't pretend to understand, but I will make inquiries.\" Reports of the pre-briefed version of the speech led to a spike in Google searches for the arcane term for masturbation. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has promised that a Conservative government would reduce immigration overall, in an attack on Labour's immigration policy. Patel criticised Labour's immigration policy, which has not been announced yet, saying: Under Corbyn's Labour, immigration would surge and put huge strain on schools and our NHS. Jeremy Corbyn has no credible plan for how to deal with the consequences of his open borders policy. The biggest risk to our NHS is Corbyn's plans for uncontrolled and unlimited immigration, for ever. By contrast, the Conservatives will get Brexit done, end free movement and introduce an Australian-style points system so that we can control our borders and protect our public services. We will reduce immigration overall while being more open and flexible to the highly skilled people we need, such as scientists and doctors. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: This is more fake news from the Conservative party's make-believe research department. Unlike the Tories, we won't scapegoat migrants or deport our own Windrush-generation citizens. The damage done to our society has been through damaging Conservative cuts to our public services, not by EU nationals coming to work in them. Boris Johnson has hit back at claims he is \"in cahoots\" with Nigel Farage. In a speech he said that in fact \"the Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance would consign this country to months, if not years, of dither, delay, discord, division\". Corbyn said Labour was \"not doing pacts, not doing deals\" if it failed to win a majority in the election, rejecting suggestions fuelled by Sturgeon that he had privately agreed to support a second independence referendum in exchange for Scottish National party support. Instead, he challenged Sturgeon to support a minority Labour government. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian's live coverage of the day's politics news. It is Equal Pay Day - when the average woman effectively stops earning for the year, taking into account a mean gender pay gap of 13.1%. The Lib Dems and Labour will use it to announce measures to tackle the gender pay gap. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to oblige bigger companies to publish data on employment levels by gender, as well as for BAME and LGBT staff, and would push for a law to end the so-called pink tax, whereby companies charge higher prices for fundamentally identical products such as razors or deodorants simply because they are marketed at women. Labour has pledged to eradicate the gender pay gap by 2030 through measures such as fines for organisations that fail to report on the subject, and by extending the reporting requirement from firms with 250 or more employees to those with more than 50. Boris Johnson has come under fire for his government's slow response to the flooding across parts of England's north and has declined to apologise, saying a huge amount of work was going on to help and compensate victims. The PM spent time in deluged regions of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and Lincolnshire on Wednesday. Corbyn has criticised the government, saying its spending on flood defences until 2021 \"heavily favours London and the south-east of England\". Richard Partington has fact-checked this claim, and while it is technically true, those figures are seriously influenced by long-term funding for Thames estuary projects running up to 2100. Over the spending period to 2021, Labour is wrong, with more spent per head on flood defences in Yorkshire and the Humber.

Of the latest top changes, the dismissal of Mark Barnett of Invesco Perpetual as manager of the \u00a31.2bn Edinburgh Investment Trust catches the eye.</p><p>The Woodford scandal has acted like an electric shock for a complacent savings industry and the unfortunate Barnett, a former associate of Neil Woodford, has been caught in the aftermath.</p><p>His heavy exposure to big tobacco in the age of environmental, social and governance (ESG) does not fit with the zeitgeist.</p><p>He is replaced by Majedie Asset Management, run by exiles from former Mercury Asset Management. The switch at Edinburgh may capture headlines but insurer LV= (Liverpool Victoria), with more than 5m customers, yesterday parted company with its chief executive, Richard Rowney, after 13 years at the helm.</p><p>As a mutual which delights in giving out ESG advice, members might have expected a fuller explanation for a power shift with minimal succession planning.</p><p>If big institutional trusts and investors find it tricky to manage themselves we should perhaps not be surprised by the boardroom chaos of the last 48 hours.</p><p>Accounting and governance issues are at the heart of the wholesale boardroom exodus at M&amp;C Saatchi, which includes founder and inspiration Maurice Saatchi.</p><p>An audit and reporting mess at fashion group Ted Baker saw its veteran chairman and the chief executive head for the door. And at transport firm Stagecoach, the founders, Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, are marching towards the exit in 2020. The decision to leave the train came amid dipping profits and a failure to renew existing rail franchises.</p><p>The sliding doors show a decisiveness often missing from corporate life, with managers declining to take responsibility for failure and hanging on for dear life. A common thread at Saatchi, Ted Baker and casualties such as Carillion, Patisserie Valerie and Thomas Cook is weakness of audit.</p><p>Too often, accountants find themselves under pressure to recognise profits before they arrive, thereby disguising the underlying weakness of reported earnings. With disclosure comes punishment in the shape of share price subsidence and a fight for survival and credibility.</p><p>In his desire to radically reshape capitalism Labour's John McDonnell has identified a command and control deficit. But his solutions - public ownership and share stakes for the workers - simply transfer the problem from business to Government. The core problem has been feeble regulators. Shaking up audit is as good a place as any for the next government to start.</p><p>Former mandarin John Kingman offered the Tories an oven-ready plan with the creation of a new statutory audit, reporting and governance authority. The failure to act has been a political own goal and, in Kingman's words, exposed Britain's companies to risks that can only be tackled with legislation.</p><p>If adopted, his proposals might have better inoculated corporate Britain from the crackpot McDonnell threat. One chief executive told me yesterday that if Labour gets power he would resign and go abroad'.</p><p>Imagine the calamitous impact on output if even a small number of the nation's wealth creators felt they had to do the same.</p><p>Fast food</p><p>THE value of robust regulation is demonstrated by the Competition &amp; Markets Authority's decision to lodge objections to Amazon's plan to take a \u00a3436m stake London online food delivery firm Deliveroo.</p><p>Amazon already has best-in-class logistics and one should never underestimate its oligopolistic tendencies.</p><p>It would be a big tech loss to the UK if Deliveroo's algorithms were to fall into the hands of the Seattle behemoth.</p><p>Speed bump</p><p>THE German car industry is not quite dead yet. Porsche has taken 30,000 deposits on its fully electric Taycan 4S, due to hit showrooms near you this month.</p><p>The cost? A cool \u00a383,365 for the basic model. Best to order today in case Labour's wealth tax kicks in.</p><p>\u00a9 Daily Mail</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAIL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAIL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPY-TFV1-DYTG-4009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138794</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Your answer (and your vote) will depend on how business-friendly you are.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">National's attitude to tech is so entwined in its trade policy, that it's hard to know what else it stands for in tech.</p><p>Whereas Labour takes a broader view, founded on values like digital equality and privacy protection. Labour wants technology to be accessible to all New Zealanders, not just corporations.</p><p>Technology is already a fast- growing business in New Zealand. It's the third biggest export sector in this country, having racked up $6.9 billion of export revenue last year, according to the Technology Investment Network (TIN). As a comparison, figures from the Department of Statistics put dairy exports at $11.16b and travel and tourism earnings at $10.2b.</p><p>National clearly wants to continue that export growth, since technology is a key part of its trade policy. There it talks about continuing to invest in infrastructure (such as ultra-fast broadband), investing in \"innovation programmes\" across various sectors, and pushing for a Trans-Pacific Partnership without the United States.</p><p>Labour's technology policy is wrapped up in a document entitled Jobs and Innovation, which is a good indication of where its priorities are. The Labour Party wants tech to create more jobs and add to our Gross Domestic Product.</p><p>Indeed, Labour's stated goal in that document is for the ICT (information and communication technology) sector to be our second-largest contributor to GDP by 2025. The problem is, ICT isn't actually tracked in official GDP figures.</p><p>Instead Labour has used figures from a 2016 report by the New Zealand Technology Industry Association (NZTech), which declared that the ICT sector contributed $12.5b to our GDP in 2015. That's 6.2 per cent of total GDP, according to NZTech. If you add in hi-tech manufacturing, then the \"combined tech sector\" accounted for 8 per cent of GDP.</p><p>However, it's difficult to compare these statistics with other sectors. NZTech's report doesn't say how ICT currently ranks, compared to dairy or tourism.</p><p>So how will we know if or when ICT becomes the second-largest contributor to GDP? I asked Labour MP Clare Curran for comment. She acknowledged that \"there are many ways to measure ICT, as there is not a discrete Stats NZ industry sector\". She resolved that Labour \"will fix this in conjunction with industry groups\".</p><p>Labour has also written a seven-page ICT manifesto. There it promises to reduce barriers \"in education, in the way we treat contractors and in our investment in research and technology\". But it doesn't specify how it will reduce these barriers, other than by general measures like developing an action plan and engaging industry groups.</p><p>One area where National and Labour diverge in terms of tech policy, is how to fund research and development (R&amp;D). National believes that grants are the way to go, whereas both Labour and the Greens favour tax credits.</p><p>At the recent Digital Future Panel debate in Wellington, National Party ICT spokesman Brett Hudson claimed that the former tax credit system was \"rorted\". He said that the current system of allocating grants to worthy technology companies, via the government agency Callaghan Innovation, is a much better solution. That's because Callaghan grants, he said, include an inherent test of whether an idea is worth backing. Callaghan will only give out money if private investors (such as angel investors) also back it with their money.</p><p>National is planning to boost Callaghan grants even further. In May, it announced an additional $74.6 million in funding.</p><p>Curran said that its investment in R&amp;D will primarily be funded through 12.5 per cent tax credits. It will also introduce grants for young entrepreneurs. The Greens' Gareth Hughes also prefers tax credits to grants, saying they're \"easier and less bureaucratic\".</p><p>Another Labour pledge is to get multinationals to pay their fair share of tax. It's well known that the big tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Facebook, pay minimal tax in New Zealand. Labour plans to give the IRD \"an additional $30m per year to crack down on multinational tax avoidance\". This crackdown will be the equivalent of a very small flea in the ear of Mark Zuckerberg and co, but it will strike a chord with Kiwi taxpayers.</p><p>Both Labour and the Greens want to overhaul IP and copyright regulations, so that they're not so restrictive for individuals. The Green Party is particularly keen to reform NZ software patent laws and introduce a more modern copyright legislation - for example, better \"fair use\" provisions for internet sites.</p><p>National is more cautious on this front. Since the current patent and copyright laws are more supportive of corporations than consumers, Hudson favours a balanced approach to \"protect our innovators.\"</p><p>So who would you vote for, if this election was just about technology policy? I suspect it won't come down to which method of giving out R&amp;D money you prefer. It's more likely to be a question of whether you view technology as primarily an enabler of trade, or whether you also want technology policy to address digital equality and local jobs.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>CAPTION:</p><p>One area where National and Labour diverge in terms of tech policy, is how to fund research and development KIRK HARGREAVES/STUFF</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WAIKTO-WKP17092100091133326001-BE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WAIKTO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ1-SRG1-DYTR-J2VF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155926</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax New Zealand All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Waikato Times (Hamilton, New Zealand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 21, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001741</classCode><className>TRADE DEVELOPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00095A0</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000679</classCode><className>EXPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000816</classCode><className>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000D4DM</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS &amp;

He said that the current system of allocating grants to worthy technology companies, via the government agency Callaghan Innovation, is a much better solution. That's because Callaghan grants, he said, include an inherent test of whether an idea is worth backing.

Labour wants technology to be accessible to all New Zealanders, not just corporations.</p><p>Technology is already a fast- growing business in New Zealand. It's the third biggest export sector in this country, having racked up $6.9 billion of export revenue last year, according to the Technology Investment Network (TIN). As a comparison, figures from the Department of Statistics put dairy exports at $11.16b and travel and tourism earnings at $10.2b.</p><p>National clearly wants to continue that export growth, since technology is a key part of its trade policy. There it talks about continuing to invest in infrastructure (such as ultra-fast broadband), investing in \"innovation programmes\" across various sectors, and pushing for a Trans-Pacific Partnership without the United States.</p><p>Labour's technology policy is wrapped up in a document entitled Jobs and Innovation, which is a good indication of where its priorities are. The Labour Party wants tech to create more jobs and add to our Gross Domestic Product.</p><p>Indeed, Labour's stated goal in that document is for the ICT (information and communication technology) sector to be our second-largest contributor to GDP by 2025. The problem is, ICT isn't actually tracked in official GDP figures.</p><p>Instead Labour has used figures from a 2016 report by the New Zealand Technology Industry Association (NZTech), which declared that the ICT sector contributed $12.5b to our GDP in 2015. That's 6.2 per cent of total GDP, according to NZTech. If you add in hi-tech manufacturing, then the \"combined tech sector\" accounted for 8 per cent of GDP.</p><p>However, it's difficult to compare these statistics with other sectors. NZTech's report doesn't say how ICT currently ranks, compared to dairy or tourism.</p><p>So how will we know if or when ICT becomes the second-largest contributor to GDP? I asked Labour MP Clare Curran for comment. She acknowledged that \"there are many ways to measure ICT, as there is not a discrete Stats NZ industry sector\". She resolved that Labour \"will fix this in conjunction with industry groups\".</p><p>Labour has also written a seven-page ICT manifesto. There it promises to reduce barriers \"in education, in the way we treat contractors and in our investment in research and technology\". But it doesn't specify how it will reduce these barriers, other than by general measures like developing an action plan and engaging industry groups.</p><p>One area where National and Labour diverge in terms of tech policy, is how to fund research and development (R&amp;D). National believes that grants are the way to go, whereas both Labour and the Greens favour tax credits.</p><p>At the recent Digital Future Panel debate in Wellington, National Party ICT spokesman Brett Hudson claimed that the former tax credit system was \"rorted\". He said that the current system of allocating grants to worthy technology companies, via the government agency Callaghan Innovation, is a much better solution. That's because Callaghan grants, he said, include an inherent test of whether an idea is worth backing. Callaghan will only give out money if private investors (such as angel investors) also back it with their money.</p><p>National is planning to boost Callaghan grants even further. In May, it announced an additional $74.6 million in funding.</p><p>Curran said that its investment in R&amp;D will primarily be funded through 12.5 per cent tax credits. It will also introduce grants for young entrepreneurs. The Greens' Gareth Hughes also prefers tax credits to grants, saying they're \"easier and less bureaucratic\".</p><p>Another Labour pledge is to get multinationals to pay their fair share of tax. It's well known that the big tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Facebook, pay minimal tax in New Zealand. Labour plans to give the IRD \"an additional $30m per year to crack down on multinational tax avoidance\". This crackdown will be the equivalent of a very small flea in the ear of Mark Zuckerberg and co, but it will strike a chord with Kiwi taxpayers.</p><p>Both Labour and the Greens want to overhaul IP and copyright regulations, so that they're not so restrictive for individuals. The Green Party is particularly keen to reform NZ software patent laws and introduce a more modern copyright legislation - for example, better \"fair use\" provisions for internet sites.</p><p>National is more cautious on this front. Since the current patent and copyright laws are more supportive of corporations than consumers, Hudson favours a balanced approach to \"protect our innovators.\"</p><p>So who would you vote for, if this election was just about technology policy? I suspect it won't come down to which method of giving out R&amp;D money you prefer. It's more likely to be a question of whether you view technology as primarily an enabler of trade, or whether you also want technology policy to address digital equality and local jobs.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>CAPTION:</p><p>One area where National and Labour diverge in terms of tech policy, is how to fund research and development KIRK HARGREAVES/STUFF</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMARU-THL17092100091133326143-BD</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMARU2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ1-SRG1-DYTR-J2DT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155920</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax New Zealand All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Timaru Herald (New Zealand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 21, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001741</classCode><className>TRADE DEVELOPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000679</classCode><className>EXPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000816</classCode><className>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000D4DM</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS &amp;

Tom Watson, the shadow secretary of state for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, also took aim at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who he called a \"coward\" and an \"arrogant corporate elite\" for not attending a Parliamentary hearing in November. Speaking at an event organised by think tank Progressive Centre UK, the deputy Labour leader set out the party's view on the need for regulation of big tech firms. </p><p>\"The scale of the largest companies is rightly the subject of scrutiny,\" he said in an edited version of the speech in the New Statesmen[1]. \"We should take seriously the calls to break them up if it is in the public interest. I don't subscribe to the argument that they're global companies that can't be touched.\"It's certainly true that we have to work within existing international structures to regulate monopolies. But these companies also exist within UK markets, and are subject to UK law including competition regulation.\" Facebook, which owns incredibly popular platforms WhatsApp and Instagram and is considered to have an effective monopoly on social media, has faced recentcalls for it to be broken up[2]in order to curb its influence. The Company is already under investigation from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and multiple advocacy groups have expressed a desire to see Facebook split up from it's acquired businesses. However, within 24 hours of these calls, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to integrate the messaging platforms across the three brands. This caught the attention of the Irish Data Regulator[3], which is already investigating Facebook for repeated breaches of users data. Despite previously appearing before the US Congress and before MEPs, Zuckerberg has continually refused to be interviewed by politicians in the UK.\"He's an arrogant corporate elite and he's a coward and he should be sitting in front of that Digital, [Clutrure, Media and Sport select] committee, which has cross-party unity and answering the questions that our democratic institutions need to know,\" he said. \"For me, personally, the symbolism of that empty chair, having been through the phone hacking enquiry 10 years ago, it is really resonant.\" However, the MP for West Bromwich East did suggest that Zuckerberg had managed to unite the government at a time when it appears to be divided on most other issues.\"Even in this age of a divided country and a divided Parliment over Brexit, the one man on planet Earth that has united Parliament is Mark Zuckerberg,\" he added. \"I am hoping that we can have a cross-party consensus on dealing with some of these online harms that are afflicting families and communities up and down the country\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://tech.newstatesman.com/guest-opinion/tom-watson-data-monopolists\">https://tech.newstatesman.com/guest-opinion/tom-watson-data-monopolists</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/32839/calls-for-facebook-to-be-split-up-sent-to-us-ftc\">https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/32839/calls-for-facebook-to-be-split-up-sent-to-us-ftc</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/32857/irish-data-protection-commission-facebook-whatsapp-instagram-merge\">https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/32857/irish-data-protection-commission-facebook-whatsapp-instagram-merge</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DENS1336351549546235541251765300165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DENS-133635</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCD-7YC1-JCMN-Y3SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><timeReceived>1:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Pro</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

La promesa de dividir a las mayores tecnol\u00f3gicas de EEUU es la esencia de un manifiesto de la senadora democrtica por Massachussets que, seg\u00fan los analistas, formar parte del debate poltico en la campa\u00f1a hacia la Casa Blanca. </p><p>Aunquela amenaza regulatoria a las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicasha aumentado desde el escndalo de Cambridge Analytica en el que se vio inmersoFacebookhace un a\u00f1o, la carrera presidencial parece devolver la atenci\u00f3n a tecnol\u00f3gicas comoAmazon y Alphabet, que han contribuido a sostener el repunte del mercado de valores de EEUU durante una dcada. En opini\u00f3n de Lee Spelman, responsable de renta variable de JPMorgan AM, el plan de dividir a las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas afectara a la rentabilidad de las empresas, aunque no se sabe hasta qu punto. La intervenci\u00f3n de Warren, una de las primeras en incorporarse a la carrera presidencial en las filas dem\u00f3cratas, llega en un momento en el que el sector tecnol\u00f3gico muestra pocos indicios de querer renunciar al papel que ha tenido en la racha alcista de Wall Street. El sector de la tecnologa de la informaci\u00f3n ha registrado este a\u00f1o un alza en el Standard ...or's 500 del 18,5%, el mayor del mercado, superando con creces el 13,2% de las acciones de empresas de mayor capitalizaci\u00f3n. Las acciones de las grandes tecnol\u00f3gicas que no son parte del sector de la tecnologa de la informaci\u00f3n, como Facebook y Netflix, tambin han superado al Standard ...or's 500 .DUDAS Pero, a pesar de los buenos datos tecnol\u00f3gicos, empiezan a surgir las dudas. No solo dependen de las decisiones polticas, como qued\u00f3 patente cuando el presidente del subcomit antimonopolio de la Cmara de Representantes inst\u00f3 a la Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Comercio a emprender una investigaci\u00f3n para saber si Facebook haba violado las leyes de competencia. La lista de preocupaciones incluye una ralentizaci\u00f3n de la economa global que representa una amenaza para empresas que dependen tanto de la publicidad, como es el caso de Google. Al mismo tiempo, una ruptura comercial entre Washington y Pekn podra empeorar la situaci\u00f3n de Apple en China. El plan de una senadora dem\u00f3crata de dividir a estos gigantes lastrara su rentabilidad De momento parece quelos inversores ya no estn tan c\u00f3modos con el sector. Los fondos de inversi\u00f3n de EEUU han reducido su exposici\u00f3n a a las acciones tecnol\u00f3gicas al nivel ms bajo en tres a\u00f1os, seg\u00fan Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. La gestora de activosRichard Bernstein Advisors tambin ha rebajado su exposici\u00f3n al sector. El fondo, que opera en Nueva York, tiene en su cartera un 11% de acciones tecnol\u00f3gicas frente al 26% de principios del ejercicio. Bernstein, su fundador y consejero delegado, asegura que las firmas del sector son ms vulnerables a periodos de escaso crecimiento. Adems, recuerda las malas previsiones para justificar su cautela: las ganancias del Standard ...or's 500 caern un 3,6% en el primer trimestre frente al mismo periodo del a\u00f1o anterior. 'Este es un sector tremendamente cclico, algo que la gente suele confundir con crecimiento', advierte Bernstein. 'Si sus beneficios caen en 2019 y 2020 ser inmune el sector? La respuesta es no', a\u00f1ade. CHINA Las tensiones comerciales entre las dos principales economas han afectado a Apple, a la que Microsoft adelant\u00f3 el a\u00f1o pasado como la empresa de mayor capitalizaci\u00f3n de mercado del mundo. Las acciones del fabricante del iPhone estn un 20% por debajo de los mximos registrados en octubre, tras la cada de ventas de smartphones en China que desencaden\u00f3 las cadas. La esperanza de una tregua comercial entre EEUU y China ha contribuido a unrepunte de las acciones de Appleeste a\u00f1o, tras un descenso del 30% en el \u00faltimo trimestre de 2018, pero el deterioro de la economa china sigue siendo una de las preocupaciones del fabricante del iPhone. 'Aunque la batalla comercial no ha cesado, todo apunta a que habr una soluci\u00f3n', explica Spelman. Con independencia del desenlace de la guerra comercial, el sector tecnol\u00f3gico siempre tendr atractivo entre los inversores. La adopci\u00f3n de herramientas de automatizaci\u00f3n, una caracterstica de la conocida como'cuarta revoluci\u00f3n industrial', ser un factor que aumente ese atractivo, ya que a las empresas no les quedar ms remedio que adoptar las nuevas tecnologas. 'Hay compa\u00f1as que se beneficiarn de la revoluci\u00f3n industrial 4.0, pero algunas se beneficiarn ms que otras', explica Ankur Crawford, gestor de cartera del fondo Alger, que opera desde Nueva York. Por ahora, para las gestoras de fondos que han confiado en el sector tecnol\u00f3gico como motor de las acciones en EEUU, el reto est en descifrar c\u00f3mo afrontarn los desafos polticos y econ\u00f3micos del pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o. 'A principios de a\u00f1o se podra haber lanzado un dardo y acertar; ahora hay que ser ms selectivos', concluye Crawford.
