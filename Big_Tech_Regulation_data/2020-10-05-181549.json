It recently launched a campaign targeting Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, where it portrays the billionaire as \"wanted\" by legal authorities for having stolen news content.</p><p>\"Mr. Trudeau can't have it both ways,\" the organization said in a recent statement. \"Facebook behaves like an outlaw because our government lets Zuckerberg write his own rules. They pay no taxes in Canada, suffer no consequences for publishing illegal content and make billions here selling ads against content produced by others without compensation.\"</p><p>Geist says he is unconvinced that Canadian media firms could negotiate a workable agreement with Facebook and Google given the relatively small size of the country's market. Digital firms have claimed that news sharing makes up only a small portion of their business model, and thus does not justify sizeable contracts for the news it shares.</p><p>\"The response from those platforms has been that the value of your content isn't worth what you're asking for in the licence,\" he said.</p><p>.

Other observers argue people might actually prefer such a restriction.</p><p>\"They want the government of Canada to pay attention,\" he said. \"They want the British government, they want the European government, the U.S. government to\" contemplate the threats made against Australia.</p><p>Guilbeault said on Twitter on Wednesday that the Liberals \"remain committed\" to ensuring a more equitable digital regulatory framework in Canada - \"that includes making sure that Canadian news organizations continue to inform and empower our communities,\" he said.</p><p>\"As for Facebook's action, the Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats.\"</p><p>In June, Guilbeault told an audience at the Banff World Media Festival that \"those who benefit from the media content\" of Canadian news companies \"should be paying their fair share.\" He said he was looking at the models in France and Australia to find a \"longer-term\" solution for the declining revenues at Canadian news outlets.</p><p>Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, a lobby group that represents the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, has been critical of Ottawa's posture toward Facebook's on the issue. It recently launched a campaign targeting Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, where it portrays the billionaire as \"wanted\" by legal authorities for having stolen news content.</p><p>\"Mr. Trudeau can't have it both ways,\" the organization said in a recent statement. \"Facebook behaves like an outlaw because our government lets Zuckerberg write his own rules. They pay no taxes in Canada, suffer no consequences for publishing illegal content and make billions here selling ads against content produced by others without compensation.\"</p><p>Geist says he is unconvinced that Canadian media firms could negotiate a workable agreement with Facebook and Google given the relatively small size of the country's market. Digital firms have claimed that news sharing makes up only a small portion of their business model, and thus does not justify sizeable contracts for the news it shares.</p><p>\"The response from those platforms has been that the value of your content isn't worth what you're asking for in the licence,\" he said.</p><p>.

That includes applying sales taxes to digital subscriptions with foreign-based companies like Netflix and Apple TV, in the same way they're charged for Canadian companies. This is a total no-brainer, and should be implemented without delay. In fact, Quebec and Saskatchewan already do it.</p><p>Beyond that, the panel recommends a series of actions guided by a simple and incontestable principle set out by its chair, Janet Yale: \"If you benefit from operating in the Canadian system, you should contribute.\"</p><p>For example, it says, foreign-based streaming services, with Netflix again most prominent, should contribute to Canadian content, just as domestic content producers must do. The Trudeau government has promised legislation along these lines; this recommendation gives it more ammunition to go ahead.</p><p>It also calls for companies like Facebook and Google with \"significant Canadian revenues\" to register in this country and be subject to regulation by the CRTC or a new organization it suggests be called the \"Canadian Communications Commission.\"</p><p>That would bring an end to the current situation in which foreign-based tech giants make huge amounts of money in Canada, but because they have little or no physical presence in this country escape meaningful government scrutiny. It's high time to stop giving them a free pass.</p><p>The panel takes aim at another unacceptable situation: the foreign tech giants have made billions by parasitizing off companies that produce original news content (the Star and similar organizations among them).</p><p>Tech platforms, principally Facebook and Google, \"facilitate the sharing of content produced by other news media typically without any form of compensation to the journalists and media outlets that created the content,\" it says. \"The problem is exacerbated by the imbalance in negotiating power between the dominant platforms and the great number of creators who actually produce the news.\"</p><p>It suggests ways to foster a \"strong, financially stable, and independent news sector\" by, among other things, ensuring that news creators \"are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\" It would also extend a tax credit on labour by news organizations beyond its planned expiration date, and broaden to include broadcast and digital platforms as well as print.</p><p>That's a good idea, but it should be noted that the government's first task is to deliver on the aid package to media that it set out last year. Much of that is still stuck in the federal bureaucracy.</p><p>Another excellent idea is to tear away the secrecy surrounding the algorithms the digital giants use to determine how information is conveyed and displayed. The panel suggests empowering the CRTC to have the companies reveal more about their internal workings, which would help to redress the power imbalance between them and those who actually produce the content they profit from.</p><p>There's much more in the report. It proposes a fundamental rethink of the CBC, including doing away with advertising on all the corporation's platforms within five years.</p><p>That, it says, would allow the corporation to focus exclusively on its public purpose instead of being torn between its public mandate and the commercial imperatives that come from relying on advertising revenue.</p><p>That would come with a hefty price-tag if the government was expected to replace all the ad dollars. It could usefully start, therefore, by focusing on weaning the CBC off digital advertising on its website. That competes directly with private-sector news organizations (such as the Star) and makes it that much harder for existing local news operations to pay their way.</p><p>This ambitious report will be extensively debated and is already being hotly contested. At a minimum, though, it should act as a spur for Ottawa to stop ragging the puck on confronting the challenge of Big Tech.</p><p>-Toronto Star</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MHNEWE-406242129MHNW</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MHNEWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y49-WVS1-DYKX-04HX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460050</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Medicine Hat News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Medicine Hat News</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Yet our government has mostly been content to sit on the sidelines, ducking the tough issues raised by the likes of Google and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As of this week, it has no excuse for further inaction. A blue-ribbon panel appointed by the government itself has produced a set of bold recommendations designed to make sure the digital giants contribute a lot more to the system they profit from so generously.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aside from scores of specific suggestions for change (97 in all), the panel offers something sadly lacking in government policy so far in this vital area: a sense of urgency.</p><p>It calls for immediate action in a few areas. That includes applying sales taxes to digital subscriptions with foreign-based companies like Netflix and Apple TV, in the same way they're charged for Canadian companies. This is a total no-brainer, and should be implemented without delay. In fact, Quebec and Saskatchewan already do it.</p><p>Beyond that, the panel recommends a series of actions guided by a simple and incontestable principle set out by its chair, Janet Yale: \"If you benefit from operating in the Canadian system, you should contribute.\"</p><p>For example, it says, foreign-based streaming services, with Netflix again most prominent, should contribute to Canadian content, just as domestic content producers must do. The Trudeau government has promised legislation along these lines; this recommendation gives it more ammunition to go ahead.</p><p>It also calls for companies like Facebook and Google with \"significant Canadian revenues\" to register in this country and be subject to regulation by the CRTC or a new organization it suggests be called the \"Canadian Communications Commission.\"</p><p>That would bring an end to the current situation in which foreign-based tech giants make huge amounts of money in Canada, but because they have little or no physical presence in this country escape meaningful government scrutiny. It's high time to stop giving them a free pass.</p><p>The panel takes aim at another unacceptable situation: the foreign tech giants have made billions by parasitizing off companies that produce original news content (the Star and similar organizations among them).</p><p>Tech platforms, principally Facebook and Google, \"facilitate the sharing of content produced by other news media typically without any form of compensation to the journalists and media outlets that created the content,\" it says. \"The problem is exacerbated by the imbalance in negotiating power between the dominant platforms and the great number of creators who actually produce the news.\"</p><p>It suggests ways to foster a \"strong, financially stable, and independent news sector\" by, among other things, ensuring that news creators \"are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\" It would also extend a tax credit on labour by news organizations beyond its planned expiration date, and broaden to include broadcast and digital platforms as well as print.</p><p>That's a good idea, but it should be noted that the government's first task is to deliver on the aid package to media that it set out last year. Much of that is still stuck in the federal bureaucracy.</p><p>Another excellent idea is to tear away the secrecy surrounding the algorithms the digital giants use to determine how information is conveyed and displayed. The panel suggests empowering the CRTC to have the companies reveal more about their internal workings, which would help to redress the power imbalance between them and those who actually produce the content they profit from.</p><p>There's much more in the report. It proposes a fundamental rethink of the CBC, including doing away with advertising on all the corporation's platforms within five years.</p><p>That, it says, would allow the corporation to focus exclusively on its public purpose instead of being torn between its public mandate and the commercial imperatives that come from relying on advertising revenue.</p><p>That would come with a hefty price-tag if the government was expected to replace all the ad dollars. It could usefully start, therefore, by focusing on weaning the CBC off digital advertising on its website. That competes directly with private-sector news organizations (such as the Star) and makes it that much harder for existing local news operations to pay their way.</p><p>This ambitious report will be extensively debated and is already being hotly contested. At a minimum, though, it should act as a spur for Ottawa to stop ragging the puck on confronting the challenge of Big Tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020013057059579</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3M-PNT1-F103-34TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

And they're updating copyright laws designed to protect the rights and livelihood of those who produce content that ends up online - everything from music to news.Ottawa, by contrast, has been hesitant to act, and that's putting it kindly. </p><p>In case after case, our federal government has chosen to tread lightly when it comes to dealing with the impact of the big tech companies on Canadians' privacy, on the spread of false and toxic information, and on the economic health of the companies that pay for original content only to see the tech giants scoop up much of the profit.That's the overall conclusion to be drawn from a comprehensive &lt;a href=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/02/23/as-tech-giants-grow-ever-more-powerful-canada-and-others-are-under-pressure-to-act.html\">https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/02/23/as-tech-giants-grow-ever-more-powerful-canada-and-others-are-under-pressure-to-act.html</url>\"&gt;survey of the issues involved in trying to rein in Big Tech &lt;/a&gt;by Star reporters Michael Lewis, May Warren and Jennifer Yang.In one area after another, politicians in the United States, the European Union, even Australia, California and Quebec, are debating how to respond to the tech challenge. After years of being celebrated as champions of innovation and prosperity, they're now coming under well-deserved fire for playing fast and loose with customers' personal data, crushing competitors, contributing to inequality and poisoning democracy.It's a perfect storm for tech, yet Ottawa seems to be content to sit on the sidelines and watch as others tackle the tough issues. Take privacy, one of the biggest concerns for consumers in the wake of epic fails involving Facebook last year, including one affecting the personal information of 50 million users. The European Union has pioneered privacy laws for the tech age with its General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect last May. It requires tech companies to be much more transparent about how they obtain consent from consumers, and what they do with the data they collect, and allows for fines of up to 4 per cent of a company's revenue.French authorities fined Google a record $75 million in January for violating the law, and other investigations are under way elsewhere in Europe. This law promises to hit the tech companies where they hurt most - on their bottom line.Is there any sign that our federal government is prepared to be similarly tough? In short, no. Canada's privacy law was developed in 2000, when smartphones were barely a gleam in Steve Jobs' eye, and doesn't provide for the kind of stiff fines that the EU law contains. A parliamentary committee last year recommended a tougher approach, but from the government so far, nothing.What about the health of democracy? Germany has taken the toughest line, forcing tech firms to remove hate speech within 24 hours and employing moderators to police their content. In Britain, &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/\">https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/</url>\"&gt;a parliamentary committee last week&lt;/a&gt; labelled Facebook and the like \"digital gangsters\" for allowing a torrent of \"disinformation\" to subvert democracy. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, government action seems inevitable. \"Self-regulation is no longer enough,\" &lt;a href=\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/18/the-guardian-view-on-facebook-the-arrogance-of-power\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/18/the-guardian-view-on-facebook-the-arrogance-of-power</url>\"&gt;editorializes The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.But in Ottawa, the Trudeau government has been much more cautious. Bill C-76 bans the use of foreign money by third-party advocacy groups and empowers a committee of senior bureaucrats to blow the whistle if any outside entity tries to interfere with next fall's federal election.But the government did not follow the advice of an all-party Commons committee, which urged it to go a lot further and force Google, Facebook, etc., to up their game in removing \"manifestly illegal content.\" Instead, the government chose to go easy on the social media companies.Finally, Europe is moving toward adopting a new copyright law that would force Google and Facebook to compensate content creators, or filter out copyright-protected content. The basic idea is that those who produce content (including news) should not have to stand by while Big Tech creams off the revenue. The new law isn't a done deal, but most EU countries signed on to the idea this month.Canada, in contrast, has done nothing on this front. Ottawa is in the midst of a consultation on copyright law that is due to extend into 2020, well beyond the next election. Content producers, meanwhile, watch while social media companies profit by \"sharing\" their content.The techlash was a long time coming, but it's turned into a howling storm. Governments must find a way to rein in Big Tech without stifling the free flow of information, and Ottawa should be part of that solution. So far, though, it has failed the challenge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019022553596593</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHB-KDM1-JDH1-C4KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

There have certainly been awkward moments for some of the technically challenged among us, but long after the mud dries on the knees of this year's World Cup Winners, the TVs connected during the event will remain in the living room, blaring out on-demand content.  </p><p>This change will give more New Zealanders access to a wider spread of content options than they've ever had before. But it also puts this country at the centre of what marketing academic Mark Ritson recently tipped to become \"the bloodiest battle in marketing history\".  </p><p>What Ritson is referring to is the fight for supremacy among the tech and media juggernauts all vying for control of the biggest screen in our everyday lives. Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google, Disney and HBO are just some of the players spending a fortune to get viewers locked into their platforms.  </p><p>Pitted against the billions of dollars Netflix or Apple have, local broadcasters face a challenge for relevance unlike anything they've seen since television emerged.  </p><p>All this choice might seem great on the surface, but as more of our daily media minutes are shifted to international providers we'll start to see a number of unintended consequences that could have a direct impact on Kiwi culture.  </p><p>Cookies, diapers and candyAs far back as 2016, a study by Colmar Brunton found that 40 per cent of parents were concerned about the influence of American and international content on their kids.  </p><p>\"We have heard from lots of parents that they want their children to hear our stories. They also want to hear them in our accent and in our languages. It's hugely important to parents,\" TVNZ general manager of product and data Carmen Aitken tells the Herald.  </p><p>Aitken says she still consistently hears from parents who are concerned about kids slipping Americanisms into their daily vernacular, from watching overseas content.  </p><p>A unscientific poll among parents in the Herald newsroom found that words such as \"cookies\", \"candy\", \"diapers\" and \"gas\" have become common replacements for their predecessors : \"biscuits\", \"lollies\", \"nappies\" and \"petrol\". And this is only set to increase, with YouTube steadily dominating screentime among younger viewers.  </p><p>One way to look at this is that mimicry is a normal part of growing up and that children tend to parrot what they see in those around them.  </p><p>Another way to look at it, however, is in terms of the power media have to influence how we behave. This is often referred to as \"cultural currency\", and it plays a big role in terms of defining what we admire and who we look up to.  </p><p>If Kiwi kids are predominantly fed narratives from abroad from a young age, what space does that leave for the local stories and colloquialisms that have been shaped over decades?  </p><p>This is part of the reason why NZ On Air has invested heavily in programming on TVNZ's ad-free children's platform Heihei. The hope being that parents will choose the local option before venturing abroad.  </p><p>The content watched by our tamariki is only part of the complexity we're walking into. Another concern is the way in which data is captured from a young age.  </p><p>Just recently, YouTube was fined more than US$170 million ($271m) for collecting children's personal data while they were watching videos. The problem is that locally we are largely powerless against this until something happens abroad. The giants of the tech world aren't going to change their habits on the basis of what we scream from our corner of the world.  </p><p>At least local broadcasters can be held accountable by regulators and lawmakers here in New Zealand. TVNZ's Aitken says they only capture the name, gender and age of their users and that this information is not shared with any third party advertisers. If in the future TVNZ is caught breaking this rule and misusing data or distributing content that's unsafe for children, we have local measures that can hold them to account. The same cannot be said of any of the big tech companies that run their businesses from abroad.  </p><p>So as we head into a streaming-first world, the question for parents is who they trust to look after their kids' eyeballs. Our local broadcasters or the \"don't be evil\" crew in Silicon Valley?      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-NZHBdvkids04</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X64-6YB1-JDK8-V0WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 4, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

The majority of Covid-19 fatalities globally have been among people in the age group of Trump and his Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden. Around 80 percent of American deaths and 94 percent of European deaths have been among those aged 60 or over. Given that America's most powerful and prominent national political leaders are all in their 70s, it would have been reasonable to expect more caution from some of those leaders \u2014 and more attention from all of them to the needs of their peers.   There is plenty of evidence the elderly are not being given their due in terms of attention and resources. As the world races towards delivering vaccines, an analysis published this week found older people have been excluded from half the human trials for Covid-19 vaccines , bringing into question their eventual efficacy on the people whose health is most affected.   Elder care global crisis: The challenges facing older people this year run deep and dangerous. The pandemic is highlighting chronic deficiencies in elder care, in particular, across the West: in countries from Belgium to the U.S., upwards of a third of Covid-19 deaths have occurred in nursing homes. The Boston Globe\u2019s famous Spotlight section time this week examined how, \u201cLong-term care facilities account for nearly 66 percent of COVID-19 deaths here.\u201d The story also points out that, \u201c About one in seven Massachusetts long-term care residents died from COVID-19 .\u201d While shocking, the numbers are not surprising. The OECD has issued damning reports as recently as June on the poor investment its members make in long-term care.   \u201cThe pandemic emphasized how miserably we treat older people in care homes, said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, at a Foreign Policy event. \u201cI hope it will fuel a new movement around how we treat older people in care homes.\u201d That movement will also need to address the relatively low pay offered to most caregivers, says UNI, a global union representing them. \u201cUnfortunately, on the heels of one of the largest bailout packages in the EU and the U.S., we saw no direct funding for care\u201d, said UNI\u2019s Eugenio Villasante . \u201cWe know that we can do better at keeping them (old people) safe if caregivers have the right tools and support,\u201d said Christy Hoffman, the union\u2019s general secretary.   Vaccine access problems: The next direct problem is likely to be vaccine access: The American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living this week urged U.S. states to prioritize Covid-19 vaccine distribution to all long-term care facilities, because the average age of residents is 85 and nearly all have at least one underlying health condition. According to CDC data, that makes them 630 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those under 30.   Missed connections: More broadly, the social connections that are life lines for many older people have been cut off or cut-back this year, as caregivers and family members work to socially isolate and protect themselves. That\u2019s made worse by the fact that older people in many countries do not have the access or skills needed to replace those physical connections with the digital ones that now underpin work and social life. The problem works both ways: Many older people are primary caregivers themselves, stepping in for dead, absent, imprisoned and working parents. Yet 30 percent of the families that rely on them for that free care don\u2019t have a back-up plan if their older caregiver dies or becomes disabled \u2014 an increased risk during the pandemic, reports Generations United, an advocacy group.   Discrimination: Age discrimination is thriving, often under the banner of protecting public health -- from age-specific restrictions on movement to informal age cut-offs on access to ventilators in hospitals. \u201dGovernment policy around the world has restricted the movement of older people based on their age,\u201d including stay-at-home orders and public transport bans, said Justin Derbyshire, CEO of Help Age International. While there are some public health reasons for such age-based restrictions, many 2020 policies are failing to meet basic tests of fairness and evidence, Derbyshire said. \u201cOne of the last \u2018-isms\u2019 that\u2019s allowed is ageism, and we\u2019ve got to stop that,\u201d Roth added.   Stuck with this mess: Some of these problems will stick around long after a Covid-19 vaccine arrives. The world\u2019s over-65 population is on track to double between now and 2050 to around 1.5 billion. Right when we should be getting better at supporting aging, we\u2019re messing up. An International Labor Organization survey of countries covering 80 percent of the world\u2019s population found that only 1 in 20 people live in countries that provide universal long-term care in nursing homes.   Bye bye, secure retirement: Ageing economies have long been plagued by inadequate pension systems for their aging citizens. Most government pension systems aren\u2019t designed to support millions of people in their 80s and beyond. While retirement ages have been slowly increasing across the West, the likelihood of another decade of zero or low interest rates will discourage low-risk forms of retirement saving, according to the 2020 Natixis Global Retirement Index . The upshot: We have to chase returns to make up for lack of government support, increasing risks across the economy.  According to Natixis, Iceland provides the most secure retirement. European countries occupy seven of the top 10 positions, alongside Canada, Australia and New Zealand.   Glimmers of hope: 2020  is not all bad news. Previously underserved aging populations \u2014 like out LGBT communities, which are starting to include many people in their 70s \u2014 are getting more support. Your author visited America\u2019s largest LGBT-focused retirement facility Thursday, the 17-story Stonewall House in New York City , developed by SAGE , an advocacy and services group, and Marvel Architects. Next up is a 83-apartment development in the city\u2019s Bronx borough.

Listen now.      QUOTABLE    \u201cIf it was women in charge of developing the next generation of technology, there would be less World of Warcraft. I would be completely conclusive on that\u201d \u2014 European Union digital czar Margrethe Vestager at POLITICO\u2019s AI summit.   REALITY CHECK  CORNER   WORST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN HISTORY: It wasn\u2019t just Americans with their jaws on the floor. Foreigners recoiled at the footage of Tuesday\u2019s debate in Cleveland, Ohio. More than just an embarrassing shouting match: they see it as more evidence of American democracy in decline. \u201cIt was very depressing,\u201d Marietje Schaake , a Dutch former member of the European Parliament who now serves as international policy director at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center, told Global Translations. After years of monitoring democratic backsliding in Hungary and Poland, and leading the EU\u2019s election observation mission in Kenya, Schaake had a warning: \u201cThe U.S. can go down a lot further, even if people think it\u2019s already intense.\u201d Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen wrote on Facebook that, \u201dInterruptions and arguments were allowed to fill way too much time,\u201d adding, \u201cfortunately, it's not like that in Denmark.\u201d POLITICO\u2019s resident China Watcher David Wertime declared China the winner of the debate , not that we\u2019ll ever know what a debate with Xi Jinping looks like.    TOO MANY CLIMATE PLEDGES: Over two weeks of the U.N. General Assembly, which just wrapped Wednesday, it was hard to avoid the 500 climate-themed events and the many pledges associated with them. And that\u2019s the problem. Private climate action may be better than no climate action, but it\u2019s also unnecessarily fragmented. Can anyone really tell the difference between The Climate Pledge , Race to Zero, Net Zero Carbon Coalition, Climate Neutral Now Pledge , America\u2019s Pledge on Climate Change , Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action (NAZCA), U.S. Climate Alliance and Caring for Climate ?     Sustainability    BIG ON BIODIVERSITY, SORT OF: 64 countries this week called for reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 as part of a U.N. Biodiversity Summit and U.N. negotiators are pushing to establish protections for 30 percent of the planet in a new international agreement that would be finalized in May 2021. That goal has the support of U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and countries including Canada, but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau lamented that, \u201cwe are the only country in the top 10 largest countries in the world who have committed to these pledges.\u201d China was gung-ho on climate last week, but less so on biodiversity. Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro sees a plot against his Amazon assets: \u201cI strongly reject international greed towards our coveted Amazon,\u201d he said. He blasted \u201cfalse and irresponsible information\u201d that he said was being used to \u201cimpose unfair international rules\u201d on Brazil.   Green NGOs are already complaining about the language in the draft agreement \u2014 they find it vague, and believe the action points are diffused across a confusing array of targets. Florian Titze , who is following the talks for environmental group WWF, said the \u201cambition is too low\u201d and that it \u201clacks clarity,\u201d especially on how to implement, monitor and mobilize financial resources. Basile van Havr e, a Canadian co-chair leading the negotiation, said the draft is improving and expanding to include science-based targets and not simply political ones. Jonathan Wilkinson , Canada\u2019s environment minister, said his country has a particular responsibility to defend biodiversity because it includes \u201cthe second largest land mass, a fifth of the world\u2019s freshwater, and the longest coastline in the world.\u201d   Speaking of Canada \u2014 it\u2019s happening up North! Join POLITICO\u2019s newest newsletter, \u201cCorridors ,\u201d for all the latest from Ottawa. On tap this week: the Green Party leadership election, a look inside the country\u2019s pandemic recovery negotiations and the fallout from the U.S. presidential \u201cdebate.\u201d   U.N. CLIMATE GAMBLE PAYS OFF, ISOLATING WASHINGTON: After years of stalling, there\u2019s been significant movement on climate issues in recent days, writes Karl Mathiesen . China shifted the geopolitical center of the climate debate closer towards the EU, and away from the U.S., when it committed to carbon neutrality by 2060. California\u2019s announcement it will ban combustion engine cars by 2035 is another groundbreaking move. Meanwhile, Poland \u2014 the EU\u2019s most coal-dependent country and it\u2019s sole climate action refusenik \u2014 changed tune by setting a 2049 deadline to abandon coal mining. Together the EU, China and California account for around 40 percent of carbon emissions and global purchasing power.   The sudden movement wasn\u2019t the result of years of U.N. diplomacy -- far from it. There was \u201cno strategic conversation\u201d involving agency chiefs, said Erik Solheim , who led the U.N. Environment Program from 2016 until 2018, when President Trump stalled global climate efforts. \u201cI never heard or saw a real Plan B emanate out of the 38th floor\u201d of the U.N. headquarters in New York, another high-ranking former official said. But U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has ramped up his engagement with the issue in 2020. In a speech in China, where a massive new wave of coal power plants had been approved, he said, \u201cCoal should have no place in any rational recovery plan.\u201d In India, he said the coal business was \u201cgoing up in smoke.\u201d Guterres increasingly focused on a set of precise, universal policy demands he believes should shape post-Covid stimulus packages. Coincidence or not, that theme was a feature of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019 s speech to the U.N.     A message from Bank of America:                    Read our final Global Public Health Spotlight : Carmen Paun obtained four different proposals for World Health Organization reform from the governments of Germany, France, South Korea and Chile.

POWER PLAYS AND ELECTIONS    WAR ALERT \u2014 ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN ARE ON THE EDGE: The two former Soviet states have clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-controlled enclave internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, for three decades.  But the conflict reignited this week, with more than 150 dead in skirmishes. The U.S, Russia and France said in a joint statement that they \u201ccondemn in the strongest terms\u201d the fighting, and called for an immediate ceasefire. The Nagorno-Karabakh clashes have the potential to draw in larger power \u2014 in particular Russia and NATO member Turkey, two countries that already support opposing sides in Syria and Libya \u2014 leading to a broader war.   Explainers:  POLITICO | Chicago Council on Global Affairs   BELGIUM \u2014 HOME OF SURREALISM GETS A GOVERNMENT AFTER 652 DAYS: Belgian politicians do a good job imitating the country\u2019s surrealist art. The latest exhibition: 44-year-old liberal Alexander de Croo will lead a new seven-party coalition government, ending the country\u2019s world record run of 21 months in caretaker government mode. For a change that happened so slowly, it also happened very quickly in the end. Marie-Christine Marghem started a summit of EU environment ministers as Belgian\u2019s minister and was booted before the meeting ended. Even the entrance of the government was bizarre: the Belgian Parliament met in the European Parliament on Thursday because it was the only space in Brussels big enough to satisfy social distancing requirements. The socially distant swearing-in photo at the Royal Palace is also something to behold . De Croo is an experienced hand at the sort of complicated arrangement he\u2019s now leading. He grew up around Belgium's government \u2014 his father was a Cabinet minister. And back in 2011, he set in train Belgium\u2019s first world record-setting period without a permanent government when he withdrew his party from the governing coalition, prompting its collapse.   Other notable appointments: Former prime minister Sophie Wilmes becomes foreign minister in the new government, while a Green member of the European Parliament, Petra de Sutter, will become deputy prime minister, making her the world\u2019s most senior transgender politician. On the dynasty theme: Mathieu Michel , the brother of European Council President and former Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel , will become Belgium\u2019s digital affairs minister.   US 2020 \u2014 A DIFFERENT TYPE OF POLL WATCHER \u2014 FOREIGN ELECTION OBSERVERS START WORK IN U.S.: Trump is calling for partisan poll watchers to form a surveillance army at polling places \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s not going to end well,\u201d Trump said when the subject of mail-in ballots came up during Tuesday night\u2019s debate. But it\u2019s the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the largest international body charged with monitoring elections, which has the most professional poll-watching operation, and it\u2019s starting work in Washington, D.C. Oct. 6. A core team of 30 will then fan out around the country in the run-up to election day. That's well short of the 500 observers OSCE has hoped to bring to America before the coronavirus disrupted those plans. Another 100 observers from the Parliaments of OSCE\u2019s 47 member countries (which include the U.S.) will arrive stateside during election week.   Laura Thornton , director of global programs at The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) told Global Translations: \u201cAmerica prefers to teach, not learn, and bristles at the idea of being observed. But we have a lot to gain from observation, particularly when trust in the electoral process is alarmingly low.\u201d Ambassador Urszula Gacek , the British-born Polish diplomat who is heading the observation mission, promised a \u201cvigorous\u201d assessment of the election, providing a \u201ctrue reflection\u201d of the election campaign and the post-election aftermath. The OSCE has monitored elections every two years in the U.S. since 2002. Gacek said her team has a \u201cvery positive relationship\u201d with the State Department and the 50 state secretaries of state across America, but expected this to be \u201cthe most politically and technically challenging election\u201d of her career.   Sidebar: The New York Times conducted a five-month-long investigation into increasingly organized claims of voter fraud to understand how a virtually non-existent problem became central to the president\u2019s re-election narrative.   US 2020 \u2014 DEEP DIVE ON RACE AND THE ELECTION IN THE LATEST CAMPAIGN CONFIDENTIAL: In this week's episode we talk to Derrick Johnson , president of the NAACP, as well as Brooke Minters and Eugene Daniels , two POLITICO senior reporters, about why race will be top of mind for tens of millions of Americans when they vote, even if it falls out of the headlines. Listen here .   CHINA VERUS THE COMMONWEALTH: In a bid to obtain infrastructure finance, governments of small Caribbean nations \u2014 member of the Commonwealth and former British colonies \u2014 are signing up to loans from Beijing, to London\u2019s annoyance, the Times of London reported .    REMEMBER BREXIT? Formal negotiations for Britain\u2019s complete exit from the EU (earlier this year was more of a partial exit) are due to end next week. And they are still off-track. The EU has started legal action against the U.K., which is a bit like have two divorce cases going at once. Ireland\u2019s foreign minister was in Washington this week to shore-up Republican support for the Good Friday Agreement, which ensures peace in Northern Ireland. Simon Coveney told Global Translations that it\u2019s bipartisan messages like the ones he obtained this week that \u201cwill land in London,\u201d and that he thinks a limited deal that includes level playing field arrangements between the EU and UK;  a ban on trade tariffs and quotas; and fishing rights could be agreed by the end of 2020.   BIG TECH \u2014 EU AND CONGRESS READY TO TAKE SHOTS: The EU is preparing for its biggest-ever effort to regulate the tech industry \u2014 a collection of rules known as the Digital Services Act (DSA), to be presented December. The legislative package will include content moderation requirements for online platforms, and shift the focus of enforcement from punishing bad behavior to restricting company activities. In Washington, the House of Representatives is expected to release a long-awaited antitrust report Monday on competition in the tech sector, after skeptical U.S. lawmakers grilled the CEO's of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook over the summer.     INSTITUTIONALIZED    CHINA \u2014 ACCUMULATING GLOBAL POWER SEATS ONE VOTE AT A TIME: Wall Street Journal dives into how China\u2019s decade-long campaign to win top jobs in international organizations (and create other organizations where it can\u2019t) is bearing fruit . \u201cIf you control important levers of these institutions, you influence norms, you influence ways of thinking, you influence international policy, you inject your way of thinking,\u201d said Ashok Malik, senior policy adviser at India\u2019s foreign ministry.   U.N. AND EU INK PEACEKEEPING AGREEMENT: The United Nations\u2019 Atul Khare and the European Union Ambassador Olof Skoog signed an agreement Tuesday to step up their peace operations and crisis management cooperation.   NEW SCHOOL \u2014 MICROSOFT BRINGS CORPORATE DIPLOMACY TO THE U.N.: If any company was going to set up a U.N. outpost in 2020, it was going to be Microsoft. Founded by Bill Gates \u2014 now the biggest donor to the U.N.'s World Health Organization \u2014 the company this year pledged to go \"carbon negative\" and has bunch of lucrative I.T. contracts with the U.N. bureaucracy. The new outreach is spearheaded by John Frank , recently returned from Brussels where he turned around Microsoft's image after a decade of bruising antitrust battles which left the company billions of dollars out of pocket. Frank told Global Translations that there's a underlying reason for prioritizing global connections: The world is far behind its sustainable development and climate targets and unilateral efforts by even the biggest companies won't fix that. \"We want organizations around the world learning from each other and adopting best practices,\" he said, and that means supplementing the U.N.'s convening power. Frank says tech companies like Microsoft can help bring more data-driven decisions to the sustainable development movement. \"There is a sense in the private sector that we can't wait for national governments to get their act together before we do something.\"   OLD SCHOOL \u2014 JAMES BAKER\u2019S RULES FOR RUNNING WASHINGTON: You\u2019ll need to click the link to get the juicy anecdotes , but the top tips, write Peter Baker and Susan Glasser were:  1. Titles don\u2019t matter. (But good office real estate does.)  2. Don\u2019t lie to journalists. (And always call them back, the closer to deadline, the better.)  3. If Dick Cheney (or anyone else) gets in your lane, run over him.  4. Never leave your enemies alone with the president.  5. And finally, never forget who the real enemy is: the Pentagon.   OLD SCHOOL \u2014 LETTERS AND DAGGERS, A FRENZIED FIVE-PART EXCHANGE ON RETHINKING U.S RUSSIA POLICY: When POLITICO published a letter from Tom Graham, Rose Gottemuller, Fiona Hill, George Schulz, Sam Nunn and 106 other signatories, we had no idea it would quickly become a franchise, with rebuttals pouring in, including from Ukrainian dignitaries. Read the five letters, including a final reply from the original authors, here: 1 \u2014  2 \u2014  3 \u2014  4 \u2014  5 .   QUICK ENTRY \u2014 NEW U.S. PRE-CLEARANCE CHECK IN BRUSSELS: Passengers flying to the U.S. from Brussels Airport will be screened in advance rather than having to go through lengthy immigration checks on arrival, following a deal between the two governments reached Monday. There are currently 16 preclearance sites for travel to the U.S in six different countries.   QUICK WITHDRAWAL \u2014 HOW QUICKLY CAN ONE MOVE A NUCLEAR WARHEAD?

Disinformation continues to pose a serious threat to U.S. security</p><p>Stanislav Levchenko, a KGB agent turned defector, told a Paris weekly in 1987 that the Kremlin had been successfully tricking the West for 70 years because Americans and Europeans tended to be naive.</p><p>Soviet leaders capitalized on this \"factor of elementary naivete\" among westerners and \"have used it for many years\" to spread disinformation, Levchenko said, in an eerie preview of the tactics used by Russian agents who created fake social media accounts and spread disinformation during the 2016 election.</p><p>Levchenko described the Kremlin's Cold War-era effort as a \"large machine,\" with as many as 15,000 people working full time in Moscow alone in the \"sphere of disinformation.\" But he said in that 1987 interview that the number of gullible westerners was likely declining because many of Moscow's tactics had been exposed.</p><p>That's because back then, Russian disinformation efforts were meticulously tracked and exposed by the little-known U.S. Active Measures Group, a multi-agency effort led by the State Department.</p><p>With today's powerful social media, It's time to revive such tactics for exposing modern disinformation campaigns not only by the Kremlin but copycat attempts by China, Iran and others, says John Lenczowski, who served as President Ronald Reagan's principal adviser on Soviet affairs and was one of the key players in the Active Measures Group.</p><p>Given the role of social media in disseminating information, the group should involve government agencies and technology companies, says Lenczowski, the founder and president of the Institute for World Politics.</p><p>\"How else do you fight against propaganda, disinformation and active measures?\" Lenczowski asks. \"You have to collect intelligence and expose it because a lot of this happens in the darkness and that's how criminals like to operate.\"</p><p>Although Russia, China, Iran and others have strengthened their information warfare playbooks in recent decades, the United States instead has dismantled its machinery for combating disinformation.</p><p>Read the full report here by CQ Roll Call's Gopal Ratnam of how the U.S. was caught flatfooted by modern online disinformation campaigns. </p><p>2. Gigantism of Big Tech invites a fresh look at antitrust</p><p>Increased public concern over the reach of large technology companies, bipartisan support for thinking anew about how to regulate big business, and ambitious policy proposals ahead of the 2020 presidential election are driving a new conversation over antitrust enforcement in the United States.</p><p>In less than two decades, three of America's most ubiquitous technology platforms -- Facebook, Google and Amazon -- have grown rapidly in size and clout from small, single-market companies into industry conglomerates thanks, in part, to a mostly hands-off approach to antitrust by the U.S. government.</p><p>Big Tech's critics say the companies have thrived under the government's passive enforcement of antitrust laws, which were written at the turn of the 20th century to break up monopolies in the oil, steel and railroad industries.</p><p>But a shift in the way the government viewed antitrust, led in the 1970s by conservative judge Robert Bork, resulted in the belief that a company establishing market dominance by acquiring smaller companies was good for consumers as long as prices stayed low.</p><p>Such was the thinking that allowed Google, in 2007, to purchase the online advertising agency DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, Facebook to buy Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, and Amazon to acquire Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion in 2017.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power -- too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a White House hopeful who in March proposed breaking up the companies in a post on Medium. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\"</p><p>Read Dean DeChiaro's full report here.   </p><p>3. Cyber warfare is everywhere and forever; the U.S. is unprepared for it</p><p>Last fall, when the Navy was examining gaping holes in its cybersecurity, its outside consultant leading the project ordered his team to learn the ancient Chinese strategy game Go.</p><p>In that board game, two players place black and white discs one by one onto a grid. The players then slowly try to encircle each other until the victor completely envelops the loser's pieces.</p><p>The point, says Michael Bayer, the veteran Pentagon adviser who ran the Navy's review, was to show that China and other foes are encircling and exploiting America's weak flanks rather than directly challenging its conventional military strengths.</p><p>Meanwhile, he says, American policymakers tend to think in checkers or chess terms, directly attacking an opponent. The Chinese play both games, but westerners generally do not know Go. \"If you play checkers or chess you want to grab the data on weapons systems,\" Bayer says. \"If you play Go, you want to grab the Office of Personnel Management background files on everybody,\" referring to a 2014 hack orchestrated by Beijing.</p><p>In the long game of information warfare, old strategies lose meaning. The battle is not in one region or another or over a particular time frame; it is everywhere and forever. The traditional distinctions between civilian and military lose meaning because defeat in one jeopardizes the other. The United States is, quite simply, playing the wrong game.</p><p>\"I believe we are in a declared cyberwar,\" Bayer says. \"It is aimed at the whole of society and the state. I believe we are losing that war.\"</p><p>China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and even terrorist groups have for years been waging -- and, experts say, winning -- conflicts in the so-called \"gray zone\" just below the threshold that would trigger a U.S. military response.  A 2016 Pentagon report defined it as \"not yet war but not quite peace.\"</p><p>In the gray zone, two modes of fighting dominate. The first, information operations, constitutes everything from broadcasting propaganda to using social media for spreading information or misinformation. The second tool is cyber.</p><p>In these two realms, the U.S. military and civil society are virtually unprotected and will be for years, Pentagon experts have reported in the last two years.</p><p>But by most accounts, while America's cyber warriors have stepped up their attacks in the last year, including in Russia, the ability to defend U.S. networks has not kept pace. Without a strong defense, offensive attacks can be invitations for disaster instead of deterrents.</p><p>And numerous experts say America's ability to fight offensively or defensively in cyberspace is inadequate, with the required focus, leadership and strategic thinking all woefully wanting.</p><p>\"While we have made progress, it would be fair to say we have a long way to go,\" says Mike Rounds, the South Dakota Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Cybersecurity.</p><p>Read the full report by Gopal Ratnam and John M. Donnelly here. </p><p>4. Big Apple debates use of algorithms, facial recognition in policing</p><p>The extent to which artificial intelligence and automated decision-making should play a role in policing is at the center of a debate over civil liberties in the nation's largest city.</p><p>Technologies powered by artificial intelligence, such as facial recognition and predictive policing tools, have been shown to have racial and ethnic biases, raising questions about whether their use by police could exacerbate inequalities already baked into the criminal justice system.</p><p>The debate in New York City reflects similar conversations across the country as cities and other municipalities seek to make use of new technologies to safeguard residents without infringing on their rights or harming members of marginalized communities.</p><p>Advocates who favor greater oversight of the NYPD's use of algorithms to aid in investigations are expressing concern after Mayor Bill de Blasio included an exemption for law enforcement in an executive order establishing a new position to monitor use of algorithms and artificial intelligence by city agencies.</p><p>The issuance of the executive order in November coincided with the release of a report by the city's Automated Decision Systems Task Force, which was established to look at machine-learning tools in city government. Some members of the task force criticized the report because they said it did not include dissenting recommendations. They also said the task force was not given sufficient access to information on how individual city agencies use automated decision-making systems.</p><p>Disapproval of the report and the executive order's law enforcement exemption indicate an ongoing rift between a metropolis that uses a range of automated decision-making tools -- for things like assessing the risk of building fires and evaluating public school teachers -- and activists and academics who argue that reliance on algorithms, especially those used in policing, can increase bias against minorities.</p><p>Jumaane Williams, the city's public advocate, and Brad Lander, a city councilman from Brooklyn who sits on the council's committees on technology and civil rights, praised de Blasio's creation of a new Algorithms Management and Policy Officer. But they said police investigations should not be exempt from the officer's reach, arguing it would \"risk recreating ingrained patterns of discrimination and inequality.\"</p><p>Read Dean DeChiaro's full report here.</p><p>And don't miss his story on New York City eyeing regulation of facial recognition technology.</p><p>5. After stumbles, U.S. tries to recover a leadership role in telecommunications</p><p>In the early 2000s, then-U.S. telecom giant Lucent, a successor to Bell Labs, was a darling of Wall Street because its patents and technologies were key to the world's transition to 3G, or third-generation mobile technology, which soon enabled voice, data and video to be streamed to cellphones.</p><p>But in less than a decade, a combination of bad bets by Lucent and the dot-com bust of 2001 felled the company. Sales and employee strength each declined about 80 percent in just two years from the peak in 2001 of $41.5 billion and 153,000 workers to its nadir of 2003.</p><p>Then, in 2006, Lucent was bought by the French company Alcatel. But Alcatel turned around and sold parts of Lucent to Finland's Nokia in 2014 and the rest to China Huaxin, a Chinese investment company that specializes in the telecom sector. </p><p>Lucent's decline and a similar story that befell another U.S. telecom giant, Motorola, marked a downward spiral that derailed America's significant hold on mobile technology, ceding momentum to China as well as to European companies Nokia and Ericsson.</p><p>Now, another decade and a generation of technologies later, the world is poised for 5G -- the fifth generation of mobile technology -- with mobile carriers promising it will deliver not only blazing speeds for smartphones, but will help self-driving cars navigate, enable factories to be operated remotely and transform the practice of health care.</p><p>But the United States, without a major telecom horse in the race, is counting on the European suppliers to build out most of its 5G network, while trying to keep China from becoming the global leader.</p><p>Read Gopal Ratnam's full report here. </p><p>6. Falsehoods on Facebook could prompt changes to Big Tech's prized liability shield</p><p>The 30-second advertisement, complete with ominous music and paid for by President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, claims without evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's potential Democratic opponent, threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine unless its government fired a prosecutor investigating an energy company with ties to Biden's son, Hunter.</p><p>The ad won't be seen on CNN, which says it will not air it because it \"makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets.\"</p><p>But it will be seen widely on Facebook, the social media site that, more than any other, was critical to the Russian online disinformation campaign designed to influence the 2016 election. Facebook has sought to downplay any responsibility for the outcome of the contest and has taken steps to crack down on \"fake news\" ahead of 2020.</p><p>\"We rely on third-party fact-checkers to help reduce the spread of false news and other types of viral misinformation, like memes or manipulated photos and videos,\" wrote Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, in a Sept. 24 blog post. He continued: \"We don't believe, however, that it's an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician's speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.\"</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, was more succinct in an Oct. 17 speech at Georgetown University.</p><p>\"I don't think people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true,\" he said.</p><p>The decision by Facebook to allow the ad, and its policies for content moderation in general, raise questions about technology platforms' responsibility to crack down on domestic and foreign disinformation, and the consequences if they don't. </p><p>At the center of the debate is a 1996 law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, that gives technology companies, including social media platforms, broad immunity from liability for third-party content posted on their sites. That includes paid advertisements, such as the Trump campaign's Biden video, courts have found.</p><p>In the two decades since its creation, the statute has been credited with allowing Silicon Valley to thrive and enabling freedom of expression online. But it also allows platforms significant cover for their hosting of \"fake news,\" which has renewed interest in possible changes to the law.</p><p>\"One of the main goals of Section 230 in 1996 was to give platforms the flexibility to implement effective content moderation systems,\" says Jeff Kosseff, a law professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of a book about the law, \"The 26 Words That Created The Internet.\"</p><p>\"What happened in 2016,\" Kosseff says, \"had a big effect on the political debate because it highlighted the less-than-perfect content moderation systems that platforms have.\"</p><p>Read Dean DeChiaro's full report here. </p><p>7. Airwaves now reserved for educational purposes may go to commercial 5G</p><p>For students at Burton Middle School in Porterville, Calif., a small city at the southeast corner of the massive and rural San Joaquin Valley where the poverty level is 30 percent, a Wi-Fi signal outside of the school is hard to come by.</p><p>In a nation where an estimated 70 percent of teachers assign homework requiring a broadband connection, internet access is often inaccessible for poor people and minorities, and a quarter of the students in Porterville lacked home internet access as recently as five years ago.</p><p>Initially, the school gave students laptops with data connections, but funding for that didn't last long. When Burton sought a new way to connect its kids, it found Mobile Beacon, a Rhode Island-based nonprofit that offers low-cost broadband and Wi-Fi hotspots to schools and libraries in struggling communities.</p><p>Mobile Beacon, which has worked with 830 schools and more than 1,000 libraries since it was founded in 2010, provided Burton with 150 mobile hotspots and broadband connectivity to families for $10 per month, far cheaper than a commercial provider would charge.</p><p>The organization provides internet service using a slice of the U.S. airwaves called the Educational Broadband Service, which has occupied a swath of the 2.5 gigahertz band of spectrum since the John F. Kennedy administration and is reserved for licensees who commit to using their access for educational purposes.</p><p>In rural and impoverished communities around the country, students use the EBS spectrum for Wi-Fi access during long school bus rides and to hear lectures from far-flung metropolitan campuses. It can help connect children who are chronically absent because of illness, addiction recovery, or farming season.</p><p>But this summer, the Federal Communications Commission approved a plan to scrap the band's educational requirement and auction its unlicensed parts to the highest bidder. The goal, according to Ajit Pai, the commission's Republican chairman, is to clear the airwaves and make space for the fifth-generation wireless network, known as 5G.</p><p>Critics of the decision, including the Trump administration, say the FCC is erasing an opportunity to close \"the homework gap,\" which divides American children who have internet at home from the 12 million who don't.</p><p>Read Dean DeChiaro's full report here. </p><p>8. Government struggles to rein in Artificial Intelligence programs</p><p>It can help trace missing children, but misidentifies people of color. It can help detect cancer, but may recommend the wrong cure. It can help track criminals, but could aid foreign enemies in targeting voters. It can improve efficiency, but perpetuate long-standing biases.</p><p>The \"it\" is artificial intelligence, a technology that teaches machines to recognize complex patterns and make decisions based on them, much like humans do. While the promised benefits of the technology are profound, the downsides could be damaging, even dangerous.</p><p>Last year police in New Delhi, for example, traced 2,930 missing children in four days by using an experimental facial recognition technology that identified them by examining a database of 45,000 kids living in shelters and homes; yet a facial recognition tool developed by Amazon and tested by the American Civil Liberties Union in 2018 incorrectly identified 28 members of Congress as having been arrested for a crime, disproportionately picking out African-American lawmakers including civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis.</p><p>In another case, Boston's attempts to use an automated system to help students attend higher quality schools closer to their homes and increase racial and geographic integration resulted in shortened commutes but greater segregation because of pre-existing racial disparities in school distribution, according to researchers at Northeastern and Harvard universities. </p><p>Significant advances in computers' ability to recognize visual patterns and human languages, including voice and text recognition, and to learn without supervision have brought machines closer to achieving cognitive tasks once reserved for humans. Vast quantities of data held privately and by governments are the necessary \"food\" that computers must digest to learn the new skills. </p><p>Lawmakers and regulators still grappling with the downsides of the internet and social media era such as the loss of privacy, criminal hacking and data breaches are now trying to balance the promises and perils of artificial intelligence.</p><p>Industry groups, lobbyists and unions are angling to shape the debate over regulations affecting technologies that could one day bring more job losses because of increased automation. Civil rights groups and some technologists are calling for greater oversight to prevent bias and discriminatory practices.</p><p>Determining the way forward is also complicated because artificial intelligence has emerged almost organically from existing technology and data, unhampered by restrictions on privacy and use, says Jason Schulz, a law professor at New York University who also oversees law and policy for NYU's AI Now Institute. \"We are now trying to figure out whether the scaffolding we have for the internet era is sufficient for AI or do we need a whole new foundation,\" he says.  </p><p>Read the full report by Gopal Ratnam and Kate Ackley here. </p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ Roll Call's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

As policymakers consider laws that affect platforms or other online content, it is critical that they consider Balkin's framework and the implications of this \"new-school speech regulation\" that the framework identifies. Failure to apply it could lead\u2014indeed, has led in the recent past\u2014to laws or regulations that indirectly undermine basic free expression interests. A critical perspective on how to think about free speech in the twenty-first century requires that we recognize the extent to which free speech is facilitated by the internet and its infrastructure. </p><p>We also must recognize that free speech is in some new ways made vulnerable by the internet and its infrastructure. In particular, free speech is particularly enhanced by the lowering barriers to entry for speakers that the internet creates. At the same time, free speech is made vulnerable insofar as the internet and the infrastructure it provides for freedom of speech is subject to legal and regulatory action that may not be transparent to users. For example, a government may seek to block the administration of a dissident website's domain name, or may seek to block the use by dissident speakers of certain payment systems[3]. There are of course non-governmental forces that may undermine or inhibit free speech\u2014for example, the lowered barriers to entry make it easier for harassers or stalkers to discourage individuals from participation. This problem is in some sense an old problem in free-speech doctrine\u2014the so-called \"heckler's veto\"[4]\u2014is a subset of this problem. The problem of harassment may give rise to users' complaints directly to the platform provider, or to demands that government regulate the platforms (and other speakers) more. Balkin explores the methods in which government can exercise both hard and soft power to censor or regulate speech at the infrastructure level. This can include direct changes of the law aimed at compelling internet platforms to censor or otherwise limit speech. This can include pressure that doesn't rise to the level of law or regulation, as when a lawmaker warns a platform that it must figure out how to regulate certain kinds of troubling expression because \"[i]f you don't control your platform, we're going to have to do something about it.\"[5] It can include changes in law or regulation aimed at increasing incentives for platforms to self-police with a heavier hand[6]. Balkin characterizes the ways in which government can regulate speech of citizens and press indirectly, through pressure on or regulation of platforms and other intermediaries like payment systems, as \"New School Speech Regulation.\"[7] The important thing to remember is that government itself, although often asked to arbitrate issues that arise between internet platforms and users, is not always a disinterested party. For example, a government may have its own reasons for incentivizing platforms to collect more data (and to disclose the data it has collected), such as with National Security Letters. Because the government may regulate speech indirectly and non-transparently, there is a sense in which government cannot position itself on all issues as a neutral referee of competing interests between platforms and users. In a strong sense, the government itself may have its own interests that themselves may be in opposition to either user interests or platform interests or both. Toward a new Framework It is important to recognize that entities at each corner of Balkin's \"triangular\" model may each have valid interests. For example, governmental entities may have valid interests in capturing data about users, or in suppressing or censoring certain (narrow) classes of speech, although only within a larger human-rights context in which speech is presumptively protected. End-users and traditional media companies share a presumptive right to free speech, but also other rights consistent with Article 19 of the ICCPR:\"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\"The companies, including but not limited to internet infrastructure companies in the top right corner of the triangle, may not have the same kind of legal status that end users or traditional media have. By the same token they may not have the same kind of presumptively necessary role in democratic as governments have. But we may pragmatically recognize that they have a presumptive right to exist, pursue profit, and innovate, on the theory that their doing so ultimately redounds to the benefit of end users and even traditional media, largely by expanding the scope of voice and access. Properly, we should recognize all these players in the \"triangular\" paradigm as \"stakeholders.\" With the exception of the manifestly illegal or malicious entities in the paradigm (e.g., \"hackers\" and \"trolls\"), entities at all three corners each have their respective interests that may be in some tension with actors at other corners of the triangle. Further, the bilateral processes between any two sets of entities may obscure or ignore the involvement of the third set in shaping goals and outcomes. What this strongly suggests is the need for all (lawful, non-malicious) entities to work non-antagonistically towards shared goals in a way that heightens transparency and that improves holistic understanding of the complexity of internet free speech as an ecosystem. Balkin suggests that his free-speech-triangle model is a model that highlights three problems: (1) \"new school\" speech regulation that uses the companies as indirect controllers and even censors of content, (2) \"private governance\" by companies that lacks transparency and accountability, and (3) the incentivized collection of big data that makes surveillance and manipulation of end users (and implicitly the traditional media) easier. He offers three suggested reforms: (a) \"structural\" regulation that promotes competition and prevents discrimination among \"payment systems and basic internet services,\" (b) guarantees of \"curatorial due process,\" and (c) recognition of \"a new class of information fiduciaries.\" Of the reforms, the first may be taken as a straightforward call for \"network neutrality\" regulation, a particular type of regulation of internet services that Balkin has expressly and publicly favored (e.g., his co-authored brief in the net neutrality litigation[8]). But it actually articulates a broader pro-competition principle that has implications for our current internet free-speech ecosystem. Specifically, the imposition of content-moderation obligations by law and regulation actually inhibits competition and discriminates in favor of incumbent platform companies[9]. Which is to say, because content moderation requires a high degree both of capital investment (developing software and hardware infrastructure to respond to and anticipate problems) and of human intervention (because AI filters make stupid decisions, including false positives, that have free-speech impacts), highly capitalized internet incumbent \"success stories\" are ready to be responsive to law and regulation in ways that startups and market entrants generally are not. The second and third suggestions\u2014that the platforms provide guarantees of \"due process\" in their systems of private governance, and that the companies that collect and hold Big Data meet fiduciary obligations\u2014need less explanation. But I would add to the \"information fiduciary\" proposal that we would properly want such a fiduciary to be able to invoke some kind of privilege against routine disclosure of user information, just as traditional fiduciaries like doctors and lawyers are able to do. Balkin's \"triangle\" paradigm, which gives us three sets of discrete stakeholders, three problems relating to the stakeholders' relationships with one another, and three reforms is a good first step to framing internet free-speech issues non-dyadically. But while the taxonomy is useful it shouldn't be limiting or necessarily reducible to three. There are arguably some additional reforms that ought to be considered, at a \"meta\" level (or, if you will, above and outside the corners of the free-speech triangle). With this in mind let us add the following \"meta\" recommendations to Balkin's three specific programmatic ones. Multistakeholderism. The multipolar model that Balkin suggests, or any non-dyadic model, actually has been addressed in different ways by institutionalized precursors in the world of internet law and policy. That model is multistakeholderism. Those precursors, ranging from hands-on regulators and norm setters like ICANN to broader and more inclusive policy discussion forums like the Internet Governance Forum, are by no means perfect and so must be subjected to ongoing critical review and refinement. But they're better at providing a comprehensive, holistic perspective[10] than lawmaking and court cases. Governments should be able to participate, but should be recognizes as stakeholders and not just referees. Commitment to democratic values, including free speech, on the internet. Everyone agrees that some kinds of freedom of expression are disturbing and disruptive on the internet\u2014yet, naturally enough, not everybody agrees about what should be banned or controlled. We need to work actively to uncouple the commitment to free speech on the internet\u2014which we should embrace as a function of both the First Amendment and international human-rights instruments\u2014from debates about particular free-speech problems. The road to doing this lies in bipartisan (or multipartisan, or transpartisan) commitment to free-speech values. The road away from the commitment lies expressly in the presumption that \"free speech\" is a value that is more \"right\" than \"left\" (or vice versa). To save free speech for any of us, we must commit in the establishment of our internet policies to what Brandeis called \"freedom for the thought that we hate.\" Commitment to \"open society\" models of internet norms and internet governance institutions. Recognition, following Karl Popper's The Open Society and Its Enemies[11] (Chapter 7) that our framework for internet law and regulation can't be \"who has the right to govern\" because all stakeholders have some claims of right regarding this. And it can't be \"who is the best to govern\" because that model leads to disputed notions of who's best. Instead, as Popper frames it,\"For even those who share this assumption of Plato's admit that political rulers are not always sufficiently 'good' or 'wise' (we need not worry about the precise meaning of these terms), and that it is not at all easy to get a government on whose goodness and wisdom one can implicitly rely. If that is granted, then we must ask whether political thought should not face from the beginning the possibility of bad government; whether we should not prepare for the worst leaders, and hope for the best. But this leads to a new approach to the problem of politics, for it forces us to replace the question: Who should rule? by the new question: How can we so organize political institutions that bad or incompetent rulers can be prevented from doing too much damage?\"Popper's focus on institutions that prevent \"too much damage\" when \"the worst leaders\" in charge is the right one. Protecting freedom of speech in today's internet ecosystem requires protecting against the excesses or imbalances that necessarily result from merely dyadic conceptions of where the problems are or where the responsibilities for correcting the problems lie. If, for example, government or the public want more content moderation by platforms, there need to be institutions that facilitate education and improved awareness about the tradeoffs. If, as a technical and human matter it's difficult (maybe impossible) to come up with a solution that (a) scales and (b) doesn't lead to a parade of objectionable instances of censorship/non-censorship/inequity/bias, then we need create institutions in which that insight is fully shared among stakeholders. (Facebook has promised more than once to throw money at AI-based solutions, or partial solutions, to content problems, but the company is in the unhappy position of having a full wallet with nothing that's worth buying, at least for that purpose. (See \"Can Mark Zuckerberg Fix Facebook Before It Breaks Democracy?\"[12]). The alternative will be increasing insistence that platforms engage in \"private governance\" that's both inconsistent and less accountable. In the absence of an \"ecosystem\" perspective, different stakeholders will insist on short-term solutions that ignore the potential for \"vicious cycle\" effects. Older models for mass-medium free-speech regulation were entitles like newspapers and publishers, with high degrees of editorial control, and common carriers like the telephone and telegraph, which mostly did not make content-filtering determinations. There is likely no version of these older models that would work for Twitter or Facebook (or similar platforms) while maintaining the great increase in freedom of expression that those platforms have enabled. Dyadic conceptions of responsibility may lead to \"vicious cycles,\" as when Facebook is pressured to censor some content in response to demands for content moderation, and the company's response creates further unhappiness with the platform (because human beings who are the ultimate arbiters of individual content-moderation decisions are fallible, inconsistent, etc.). At that point, the criticism of the platform may frame itself as a demand for less \"censorship\" or for more \"moderation\" or for the end of all unfair censorship/moderation. There may also be the inference that platforms have deliberately been socially irresponsible[13]. Although that inference may be correct in some specific cases, the general truth is that the platforms have more typically been wrestling with a range of different, competing responsibilities. It is safe to assume that today's mass-media platforms, including but not limited to social media, as well as tomorrow's platforms will generate new models aimed at ensuring that the freedom of speech is protected. But the only way to increase the chances that the new models will be the best possible models is to create a framework of shared free-speech and open-society values, and to ensure that each set of stakeholders has its seats at the table when the model-building starts.

I am Mark Levin. This is \"Life, Liberty &amp; Levin\" and I have two great guests tonight, Charlie Kirk and Daniel Horowitz.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First of all, let me say hello to each of you. It's a pleasure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER OF TURNING POINT USA: Great to be here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LEVIN: Charlie Kirk, founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, a national student movement dedicated to identifying, organizing and empowering young people, more about the principles of free markets and living in government, thank goodness.</p><p>You started Turning Point USA one day after you graduated from high school.</p><p>KIRK: That's correct.</p><p>LEVIN: So, you're how old?</p><p>KIRK: Twenty four.</p><p>LEVIN: Wow, you don't look a day over 23, you know.</p><p>KIRK: That's what they -- they say I am getting too old for this stuff.</p><p>LEVIN: And you have a presence in over 1,000 college campuses and high schools across the country.</p><p>KIRK: That's correct.</p><p>LEVIN: And Daniel Horowitz, you work with \"Conservative Review\" that I am associated with. You are, I think our most popular writer there, certainly one of them. You are the senior editor there. You host a nationally syndicated podcast, \"The Conservative Conscience.\"</p><p>A lot of people know you, you appear on radio and TV a lot, as does Charlie talking about immigration, budgets and so forth and so on.</p><p>You are considered one of our really sharp thinkers out there and I wanted to have you both and go on and talk about what's going on in this country because I am very concerned about so much of what's going on.</p><p>First, Charlie, let me start with you. Our college campuses, they seem to be the last holdout of this columnist philosophy in terms of free speech, freedom of association, speakers, the violence, the safe spaces, the triggering -- all of these phrases I never heard of before. What's going on?</p><p>KIRK: Wow, a lot. Also, I think the greatest threat to Western civilization is what is going on in our college campuses today and I can tell you I have been doing this for six years now. I started this right out of high school.</p><p>The suppression of free speech, the absolute attack on the idea of America, the outward neo-Marxist believes from the professors, the faculty and the student activists, it makes you feel as if you are entering a different country.</p><p>Now, what's most stunning about this is, I have been doing this like I said for six years. I have visited hundreds of campuses across the country, not once have I seen a conservative student or a faculty member try and shout down a liberal when they come on campus.</p><p>Yet, almost daily, and myself included, I experience this all the time. When I come on campus, there are leftist activists petitioning for me not to be allowed to speak, they are trying to defund conservative student groups on campus.</p><p>So, it is really happening here. It's not just that the liberal is the predominant political viewpoint on campus. It's that they want to be the only viewpoint on campus, and put simply, the college left hates the idea that there are other ideas.</p><p>They want a total monopoly on the conversation because they are threatened by the mere existence of a pro-free market, pro-conservative world view because they know when that does actually happen, students hear both sides and they come somewhere in the middle and they are threatened by that.</p><p>And you have seen what I like to call the islands of totalitarianism which our college campuses be rather effective in indoctrinating next generation, and if we do not properly reeducate and enlighten that next generation, we are going to have a country that is completely and totally unrecognizable.</p><p>LEVIN: Is part of the problem the tenure and these professors who are radical leftists, they get tenure, they cannot be removed. They cannot really be challenged and so you don't have this competition of thought among even professors?</p><p>KIRK: That is correct. And you actually look at the two different kind of personality archetypes.</p><p>A conservative, we are going to try to go through college as quickly as possible, go into business or finance and make a life for ourselves.</p><p>A liberal, they actually love college. They love the fact that it's kind of a luxury vacation. There's very little responsibility and unlimited freedom. They don't leave, they become professors because they enjoy that kind of culture.</p><p>So, it makes sense that they go into academia and the answer is yes, these tenure laws are outdated. There is no checks and balances to be able to remove these radical professors. And even more so, there is no ideological or intellectual diversity.</p><p>You know, what's most interesting to me is have you for example at University of California Berkeley, they have fulltime staff members that are dedicated to the idea of racial and ethnic diversity.</p><p>But as soon as you raise your hand and talk about intellectual or ideological or political or religious diversity, they say, \"Oh, no, no, no, we don't really stand much for that. We only need to have racial and ethnic diversity,\" and so, we need to be able to have the free flow of ideas reenter our college campuses, and I find on college campuses, the most intolerant people are those people that preach tolerance.</p><p>LEVIN: Daniel Horowitz, country is going broke among other reasons, funding colleges and universities, funding public education across the board. We seem to be subsidizing the left, the left's ideology to our own detriment, isn't that correct?</p><p>DANIEL HOROWITZ, SENIOR EDITOR, CONSERVATIVE REVIEW: You know, as a long time critic of the Republican Party from the right, what I have noticed is that, we often die on their hills, not on our hills, on our ideology and I'll speak to what Charlie was saying, I think it was very important, younger people in colleges, they are faced with a dynamic now, when they go out into the world, they have endless student debt, and endless costs from health care.</p><p>Health care is very expensive and naturally, if they're not offered a competing set of ideas, the free stuff is going to be very enticing. But no one ever explains to them how the government has created an insurance health care conglomerate cartel, an education cartel, that has basically inflated the cost of those services commensurate with those very subsidies we don't offer and instead the Republican Party tends to shy away from that, tends to agree with what the Democrats are offering.</p><p>As you always say, they operate within their contours, within their paradigm, and as such, the American people and certainly, the younger generation, they are going to be attracted to those that offer it with a happy face rather than those who offer the same ideas with a sour face.</p><p>LEVIN: What is the answer with these various oligopolies, educational oligopolies. How do conservatives or even non-leftists, how do they get involved in administration, in education because it seems like a close shot pretty much?</p><p>HOROWITZ: It is, but if you look everywhere at a closed shop, there's a reason for it. The market didn't dictate it. There is always a government intervention. If we got the government out of education, then we'd have the free flow of ideas and health care is very evident.</p><p>A lot of young people look at the system and say, \"This is too expensive.\" We are being gouged, therefore, we need socialized medicine. But someone needs to get up there and say government through Medicare and Medicaid? By the way, Medicaid is 75 percent run by insurance companies.</p><p>They get all their market's share through government subsidies and use that to gouge the consumer. So, I think the way to promote free markets is to show how we don't own the existing policies. They are not the result of free markets, they're the result of big government policies and only the free market policies could deconstruct that, but we've got to make the case, and unfortunately we're not seeing that too much from either party.</p><p>LEVIN: How do we make the case in colleges and universities if we're not given the platform to make the case?</p><p>KIRK: You know, despite all the horror that's happening on our college campuses, I've never been more optimistic about the future of this country. And I will tell you why, and I visit these campuses. We have a record amount of college chapter inquiries and request through our organization, Turning Point USA. I'll show up to give a campus lecture, standing room only, selling out tickets like you wouldn't imagine, but I also look at some of the other speakers out there.</p><p>Someone who used to be an obscure social psychologist from Canada, Jordan Peterson now has the number one best-selling book on Amazon for weeks straight and getting millions of views on YouTube everyday and he talks about things that shouldn't be controversial. He'll say, there are only two genders. Oh my goodness, that's considered hate speech now on college campuses.</p><p>He'll say, men are better at some things and women are better at some things. Shocking statement. But how are we going to win? We are going to win because the left, who I consider to be an enemy of democracy, an enemy of freedom, an enemy of the Constitution or Republic, the enemies of freedom always overshoot their target. Always. If history tells us anything.</p><p>And because of that, decent minded people in the middle will gravitate towards better ideas, better principles and freedoms and that's why you see people between the ages of 16 and 20, right now, are much more for conservative side, that kind of Generation Z, every study shows that they are going way more conservative than the generation before them.</p><p>So, how do we fix it? We fix it with better ideas, better arguments and we are going to be the decent, fair-minded champions of liberty and freedom for a generation that feels completely lost in this sea of post modernism and neo-Marxism.</p><p>LEVIN: Do we find those better ideas in the party structure? In the Republican Party? What does the Republican Party stand for today?</p><p>HOROWITZ: You know, I think if we're going to continue doing the same thing over and over again, we're going to define the definition of insanity. It's been three decades since Reagan and we've lost our way. We've really not found any home in the Republican Party.</p><p>The reality is, Republicans take a look at what Charlie sees on the college campuses and they say, \"Oh, my gosh, this is so scary, the young generation doesn't believe in conservatism. We need to go and move further to the left.\"</p><p>But again, they're always going to vote for the authentic thing that it's not so much that the young generation is irrevocably liberal, it's that they're attracted to the strongest players on the block. So, you need to offer new ideas. How are you going to find them?</p><p>Well, one thing is, I agree with you, we need a convention of the states. If you expect Washington to fix itself, I think we have enough examples, it's never going to happen ever. They control -- Republicans control all three branches of government. They control roughly 30 state governments and we're not seeing any new ideas.</p><p>We need to fix it from without. We need citizens task forces to come up with new ideas, new grassroots organizations but ultimately, it has got to come from without because sadly, I don't think this duopoly of the Republicans and Democrats is serving anyone correctly and to the extent, younger voters are more attracted to new ideas, I think it will be through a new movement, not a tainted Republican Party that comes with a lot of baggage.</p><p>LEVIN: How do we do what Daniel is talking about? Which is a lot of work. Convention of states, that is, the state legislatures, send delegates, they get together, they have a meeting, which they used to do all the time and then they can propose amendments to the Constitution to hone in the Federal government. That's a big task. I am all for it. I've written all about it, but in the meantime, the meantime can be years.</p><p>Do you want to give the playing field up to the Democratic Party where they control the House, the Senate and the Presidency? Even now if they control the House and the Senate, the current President will be stopped immediately in his tracks. What are your thoughts?</p><p>KIRK: So, look, what I am focusing my life on is both a short and long- term objective. The short-term objective is to try to change the cancerous culture on college campuses, which if we don't get that right, our culture will be completely unrecognizable.</p><p>And in the great words of Andrew Breitbart, politics flows downstream from culture and culture, the first component of culture is education, and we have 1,800 major college campuses across the country, where post modernism and neo-Marxism is run amok.</p><p>And so, I am focused on changing that culture, but beyond that, how do we change it politically? The activists that we, at Turning Point USA are training every single day, the thousands of young people that we're empowering, they need to run for office because they're principled, because they understand the ideas, and more than anything else, more than a lot of the current Republican officials, they have fought the left head-on.</p><p>They have seen who they really are because on the college campuses, if you want to see at its most primal form what drives a leftist towards action? It's really, they don't care for the poor, they hate the rich. It's not that they have a benevolent view of the world, they want to destroy everything. They want to watch the world burn.</p><p>So, because of that, we have a group of young people, more than a group, a movement of young people that we need to empower, equip and train to run for local, state and Federal office and they will be the next principled -- they will be the next Mike Lee's, the next Thomas Massie's.</p><p>I mean, why don't we have a goal to say, \"Let's we have 15 Mike Lee, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz's by the next elections.\" That's ambitious because there's people on both parties that don't want that by the way, so that's how we begin to fix it but that undercurrent is so important.</p><p>LEVIN: Is that enough?</p><p>HOROWITZ: The problem is, it's kind of like sending diamonds into a landfill. We've tried a lot of that. I was just dealing with several primaries throughout the country where the other side will use their superior forces, their endless special interest funding to run on our issues, paint the conservative guys as the rhinos, as the liberals and confuse the voters and we're really not having a lot of success in primaries.</p><p>I mean, you know, we were together in 2014, you were early on endorsing a lot of challengers. I helped recruit a lot of them, and it's very, very difficult. I think it needs to start with some of the sitting members. You have a Freedom Caucus, you have a couple of conservatives in the Senate. We need a new contract with America.</p><p>We need a new taxpayer and consumer Bill of Rights where like Charlie said, we're not just against the other side and hate the other side where we affirmatively stand for certain ideas. We stand for Federalism, for localism. We stand for free markets, and I think if we would do that, we would offer voters another, a new idea, a set of ideas even within the Republican ballot line so you don't have the ballot access issue where you're going to give control to the Democrats, they are still going to run as Republicans, but it has got to start with the sitting Republicans.</p><p>LEVIN: Ladies and gentlemen, you can join me every single night on LevinTV as part of CRTV, Conservative Review TV during the week. That's LevinTV, give us a call 844-LEVIN-TV. That's 844-LEVIN-TV.</p><p>Welcome back. All right, let's talk about free markets. You push free markets in our colleges and universities. Amazon is under attack. Facebook is under attack. Twitter is under attack. They're all left-wing. Let's admit it. Conservatives having difficulty dealing with all of them. Should the government get involved and regulate these entities?</p><p>KIRK: Well, first I think -- first and foremost, Amazon in particular, very few people know that they're on the verge of signing one of the largest Department of Defense contracts in our history, $100 billion Cloud contract for Amazon web services over ten years which would be -- I mean, that would be subsidizing the entire Amazon empire.</p><p>So, Amazon in particular, the President's instincts are actually spot-on here. Amazon loses money basically in every vertical of the company except Amazon web services. They use government subsidies. They use preferential treatment to the US Postal Service. They are masters at using tax loopholes not to mention Jeff Bezos himself owns the \"Washington Post\" and uses that as battering ram over politicians here in DC every day because no one wants an unflattering article in the \"Washington Post.\"</p><p>So, should there be an FTC complaint against them for monopolization? As a free market guy, I hesitate to say that, but first and foremost, let's stop subsidizing this.</p><p>LEVIN: Let me ask you a question, what are they monopolizing exactly?</p><p>KIRK: Well, I mean some people would make the argument, some people that they are monopolizing online retail transactions. So, the argument would be, if ExxonMobil for example controlled 42 percent of all domestic oil kind of transactions...</p><p>LEVIN: How about if the domestic steel industry controlled 70 percent of steel production?</p><p>KIRK: Right, that's correct. I mean, we can arbitrarily put forth monopolization of things towards all of these different categories. My argument would be, as a free market guy, let's focus on the government contracts first and foremost. They should not get preferential subsidies or corporate handouts, especially the one from the Department of Defense, $100 billion over ten years, and the President should absolutely veto and nix that completely and immediately.</p><p>LEVIN: What about Facebook?</p><p>KIRK: Facebook is quite interesting. Here's what I can't figure out about Facebook. Barack Obama did even more than what Cambridge Analytica did in 2012. The Barack Obama campaign. They compromised the privacy of over 25 million Americans. In fact, they bragged about it.</p><p>\"The New York Times\" wrote a very flattering piece saying that the Obama campaign was technologically sophisticated and cutting edge to be able to use Facebook as a way to run a modern-day campaign.</p><p>Zuckerberg didn't apologize after that. Zuckerberg didn't testify in front of Congress. Make no mistake, the only reason why Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress and why Facebook is under attack is because some of the data might have been used to help a Republican get elected President of the United States.</p><p>It nothing to do with privacy. It has nothing to do with internet rights or freedoms and has everything to do with Democrats that are upset that their big tech monolith might have been used to aid a conservative candidate.</p><p>LEVIN: Should they be regulated?</p><p>KIRK: No, I don't necessarily think so. I think they should be treated as a public forum though. That is an important distinction constitutionally and for the courts because they're not a content provider. They need to be treated as a public forum which Google pretends they are, that they censor YouTube videos like (inaudible)...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEVIN: It's a private company, so how do you treat that as a public forum?</p><p>KIRK: Well, so that's the distinction. Is that if they want -- so Google, for example, pretends they're a public forum because they allow different voices and different opinions to be heard. The distinction is, Facebook is not actually not in the content creation space, they aggregate other people's content.</p><p>And so are they a public forum or are they a public company? They could still be a private company and operate as a, \"public forum\" and they get into the space of censoring different voices. A conservative far more likely to get censored on Facebook than anyone else which represents a huge threat to the First Amendment.</p><p>LEVIN: So then, don't use Facebook.</p><p>KIRK: Well, that's the issue though. They have 2.1 billion active users.</p><p>LEVIN: They have 2.1 and one less.</p><p>KIRK: That's correct. It would take a lot of cultural realignment for us stop using Instagram which is owned by Facebook. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook and Facebook in general. I get a lot of my followers and a lot of my engagement and a lot of my kind of you know, force multiplication through Facebook, so it's kind of the devil you have to use in some sense, which I don't necessarily think government regulation is the best way to go about it though.</p><p>LEVIN: Amazon, Facebook, what's your take?</p><p>HOROWITZ: Well, in fact, when it comes to government regulations, sometimes they are a more potent weapon for the incumbent powers within a market than subsidies are. Because they use them to box out competition.</p><p>So, I don't think they would work. But I am kind of black and white when it comes to this. There's something called private property that I think a lot of us have forgotten about. When it comes to a person's private property, I have the right to use my company, my livelihood for what I want, and you have the right to either patronize it or start your own thing.</p><p>What we have done is, we have done the exact opposite. Basically, Federal courts are giving random plaintiffs standing to sue President Trump for blocking them on Twitter. Now Trump's own Twitter account he could use any way he wants.</p><p>Twitter, likewise, could offer a Twitter account to anyone they want or deny it to anyone including the President. They could deny it to me. It's incumbent upon conservatives, I think to start their own platform.</p><p>I know it's very difficult, but unlike health care where 60 percent of the incumbent insurance cartel organizations, 60 percent of their revenue comes from government funding, government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, in this case, it is a free market, it's just difficult to break into.</p><p>We've got to take that initiative and I think, this is an example where we could be very consistent that on the one hand, you have the right to take your organization and make it as political as you want, on the other hand, I have the right with my private property to service what I want.</p><p>LEVIN: Do we trust the Federal government to referee?</p><p>HOROWITZ: Oh, no.</p><p>LEVIN: Speech?</p><p>HOROWITZ: It can only be worse. They can only make it worse. Like I said without...</p><p>LEVIN: Has is the Federal government ever properly refereed speech?</p><p>HOROWITZ: Never, never, I mean, because again those that already have market share and economies of scale will use the regulations to their advantage. So, I think you know, for conservatives, social media is a tough path to plow.</p><p>LEVIN: And isn't the truth -- let me just say this, the two of you may have to take it to the next segment. We don't know what the next technology is. We don't know what the next platforms are going to be. If you talked about Facebook 20 years ago, nobody would know what Facebook is or these other technologies and so forth, so there may be something out there, somebody out there, somebody sitting in their dorm room at Harvard at this time who is not Zuckerberg, but somebody else that comes up with something that makes it even kind of old-fashioned to be on Fcebook and so forth.</p><p>KIRK: So here's the -- you brought up the key point here. Be very careful. If there's a regulation that tries to regulate Facebook, I guarantee you Zuckerberg will have the best team of lobbyists that protects the company more than anything else so it prevents that next competitor from rising up. That is the story of regulation of America over the last 100 years.</p><p>HOROWITZ: Like the auto companies right now...</p><p>KIRK: Or Dodd-Frank.</p><p>HOROWITZ: Yes.</p><p>KIRK: It protects the incumbent.</p><p>HOROWITZ: It protects the incumbent, Sarbanes-Oxley, and the auto companies, notice Trump is now easing the cafe standards. I expect the auto companies to jump on board and say, this is great, let's abolish them, they are for it because they've already gained it out.</p><p>KIRK: And they have the trial lawyers, the regulators, the institutional knowledge and the capital to be able to comply with the cost of regulation.</p><p>LEVIN: Regulation is typically anti-competition, an anti-individual?</p><p>KIRK: That's right. Regulation is a tool for the incumbent company or business owner to use against the small little guy that does not have the same sort of resources to compete in the marketplace. And you saw that of the financial crisis as well Dodd-Frank, the big banks got bigger. They had no penalty to pay and the small local community banks got completely run over.</p><p>LEVIN: We'll be right back.</p><p>KELLY WRIGHT, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News Headquarters, I am Kelly Wright in New York.</p><p>Former First Lady Barbara Bush is in failing health. The 92-year-old wife of President George H.W. Bush and mother of President George W. Bush will no longer seek medical treatment and will instead focus on comfort care according to a family spokesperson.</p><p>The spokesman said she is surrounded by her family and appreciates the kind messages and prayers she's receiving.</p><p>Actor and former Marine Corps drill instructor R. Lee Ermey has passed away, his longtime manager and friend says Ermey died of pneumonia-related complications. Best known for role in the drill instructor in Stanley Kubrick's \"Full Metal Jacket\" Ermey was one of Hollywood's go-to actors for military roles with more than 60 movie credits to his name. He was 74 years old.</p><p>I am Kelly Wright, now back to \"Life, Liberty &amp; Levin.\"</p><p>LEVIN: Welcome back. Charlie Kirk, Daniel Horowitz. Daniel, let me start with you, a question. There seems to be some conflicting ideas within the Republican Party, even within the conservative movement, when it comes to national security and foreign policy of the Rand Paul position who's more libertarian, somewhat protectionist in that regard or isolationist in that regard, I would argue, and then you have the Marco Rubio position which is almost hyper-interventionist and actually, those aren't the two positions, there are other positions more likely traditional Reagan position. Can you explain this?</p><p>HOROWITZ: You know, when we started Conservative Review, as you all know, we started out with a scorecard where we wouldn't just rate the members based on votes, but we would give a description of what they did on their committee assignments, what sort of legislation they proposed? And we had this discussion, well, how do you rate foreign policy and national security? It's not as definitive, you don't have doctrines that are just as clear cut like raising taxes, increase in spending, and we noted this false dichotomy that have in the Republican Party, and I think again, it's borne out of the lack of vision among some conservatives.</p><p>That while you have got the Bloods and Crips fighting each other, Daniel, which one are you for? What we need to do is identify our interests. What are our American interests? We need to do an audit of where we are involved in, why we're there.</p><p>If military a intervention, what do we hope to be in its place? Learn some of the lessons from Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan and understand what is doable, what is not doable, cost/benefit analysis. Let's do all of this, I do firmly believe that at some point, as much as we hate Congress, you need the people's representatives involved.</p><p>I don't believe that any airstrike, imminent strike needs an authorization, but if we're going to have troops for 15 years, the American people are rightfully wary.</p><p>LEVIN: What are you talking about in particular?</p><p>HOROWITZ: Afghanistan. Afghanistan.</p><p>LEVIN: Afghanistan.</p><p>HOROWITZ: There was an authorization but, I mean, there was an authorization of use of force in Japan too and it's 60 years later.</p><p>LEVIN: There have been very few declarations of war. I understand your point. There have been five. America is at \"war\" or in some battle more times than it's not, and so there's that argument whether we should or shouldn't, and I agree with it, it shouldn't be an ideological point, it should be a rational point, but that said, obviously, to get Congress involved, Congress needs to do something and Congress is a very slow body.</p><p>They don't even hold hearings on budgets. So, the balance, is it not, is if they're going to deliberate for three or four weeks or three or four days and the President thinks, \"You know what, I've got to hit that spot right over there.\" Those guys are doing whatever they're doing, this creates the conflict.</p><p>HOROWITZ: Sure, but I mean, I think the question is we have about 4,000 ground troops in Syria, and they're kind of there indefinitely and you have the Sunni insurgency and then you have the Iranian hegemony backed by Hezbollah, by Assad and the Russians.</p><p>LEVIN: I agree, but and we troops in Germany. They have been there for decades.</p><p>HOROWITZ: Not engaged in combat.</p><p>LEVIN: But they're there potentially to be engaged in combat, right?</p><p>HOROWITZ: Sure.</p><p>LEVIN: What do we do?</p><p>HOROWITZ: Well, I mean, I think we're not going to reinvent the wheel in one generation where we go back to what was viewed as an offensive expeditionary back in George Washington's time, but I think there has to be some understanding of Yemen, Syria, Somalia. What are the players? What do we hope to get from it? Is it solvent?</p><p>I don't mind if we create a red line and say, \"Hey, you used chemical warfare, we're going to strike those chemical weapons.\" But there is a broader question of is Syria as a whole a tenable situation with the Sunni insurgency and Assad.</p><p>LEVIN: Charlie.</p><p>KIRK: Quickly, in the Middle East, really, the two big players consolidating power are the Iranians and the Saudi Arabians and the Saudi Arabians have lots of different proxies throughout the Middle East.</p><p>And I think, we as a foreign policy in particular should be very careful to just think immediately Saudi Arabia always has our best interests at heart. I think that is a fallacy. Some people call them a frenemy. I would call them very close to an enemy. In fact, they do not have our best interests at heart despite the new guise that they have put on.</p><p>The Iranians are not our friends either, but we should not fight a Saudi Arabian proxy war just -- and have American blood...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KIRK: That is exactly right, so that is more of a religious conflict.</p><p>LEVIN: Are they building ICBMS for Saudi Arabia? Iran?</p><p>KIRK: Well...</p><p>LEVIN: Do they want nuclear warheads on ICBMS for Saudi Arabia?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KIRK: ... Israel, but no...</p><p>LEVIN: No, intercontinental ballistic missiles?</p><p>KIRK: No, of course not, they want them for America.</p><p>HOROWITZ: But the way to go after Iran is go after Iran, not go down the rat holes in Yemen for example where you have...</p><p>KIRK: I would agree.</p><p>HOROWITZ: ... the Al Qaeda and the Houthis. And we lost a Navy SEAL...</p><p>LEVIN: So, we should declare war on Iran?</p><p>HOROWITZ: Not, necessarily, no. I don't think that's...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOROWITZ: : Well, I agree with you...</p><p>LEVIN: No, I am asking.</p><p>HOROWITZ: We went into the wrong country when we went after Iraq. I mean, I think you said that before, I think it would have been more prudent...</p><p>KIRK: Iraq was actually fighting Iran. I mean, Saddam was very anti-Iran and he was...</p><p>LEVIN: Yes, I came to the conclusion that we picked the wrong country because Iran is a threat us to. I believe that and I believe it today. I also don't believe we have to attack Iran directly, although one day we might. It just depends, and I think Barack Obama has put us in a position which backed us up against a wall because now we're arming essentially their nuclear plans.</p><p>That said, it doesn't mean I don't think we ought should be strategic and use proper tactics, and back other countries that may help us in the long run, you know? You look at all the wars we've been involved in, that's exactly what we've done.</p><p>I mean, Russia is not our friend, is it? And yet, we allied with them in World War II to defeat another enemy. These things happen, but we are not going to resolve it here. I am just curious, there is this battle going on within the Republican Party, even the conservative movement on what to do in terms of foreign policy.</p><p>And when we come back, I want to ask you both this question: What is the foreign policy of the Democratic Party? Because other than appeasement, I can't quite figure it out. But I would be curious to know what you guys think.</p><p>Don't forget, you can join us every week night on LevinTV. Give us a call so you can join us, 844-LEVIN-TV, 844-LEVIN-TV on our network Conservative Review, CRTV. We'll be right back.</p><p>Welcome back. All right, Charlie Kirk, what is the Democratic foreign policy?</p><p>KIRK: If I had to put it simply, it's arm our enemies and put America in a jeopardizing position. If you look at the Iran deal, no one rationally can defend that unless you want to give money, power and an advantage to an entire country and region that wants us dead.</p><p>I mean, John Kerry and Barack Obama, and you've been vocal on the Iran deal and you went through the specifics, I mean, they have put us in a totally compromising position militarily, culturally and also geopolitically.</p><p>But you look even broader than that, the Democrats seem so determined and hell-bent to try to withdraw our presence from certain sectors across the world where we actually had success in keeping radical powers in check whether it be trying to advance the filibuster, put a lot of our military funding in jeopardy or conversations, so look, I think the Democratic Party is very simple. They want a globalist-type government. They don't believe America is the greatest country in the history of the world.</p><p>They don't believe America is exceptional, and you can see that through the now foreign policy discussions that used to be that politics ended on the water's edge, that doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>The Democrats now have a much more globalist world view where they think that these solutions can be solved in the UN or that America should not be better than any other country and they want to almost rid the world of the inequities through the lessening and weakening of our own stature and position, which is a horrible idea because we actually live in the most peaceful time in human history which is a direct corollary to America being the most dominant in human history.</p><p>The more ubiquitous American military presence is, we are actually more peaceful.</p><p>LEVIN: Does this also explain the position on immigration? No borders, lack of sovereignty and so forth, you are like one of the nation's great experts on this and you write about it all the time?</p><p>HOROWITZ: I was headed right there because immigration, we also focus on cultural, domestic policy but it's really foreign policy and national security at its core. In the early days, we didn't have a DHS, it was the State Department that actually ran our immigration policy because it was rooted in foreign policy.</p><p>I think, this is where you see the rise of the alt-left taking over the Democratic Party. I am not too old, but I am old enough to remember a time when I grew up in Maryland, the Governor was William Donald Schafer. He was a pretty liberal Democrat, but he always believed in a strong national security, traditional values and he got ran out of the party pretty late in his career because he was strong on immigration, and that just shows how far they've moved over.</p><p>What -- I think you referred to this often is the de-civilization agenda where, there are certain basic things that whether they stopped at water's edge or whether they're just natural law, family structure, a man-to-man, woman-to-woman, a marriage is a marriage and borders are borders, they are now questioning just the raw basics and what is so sad about immigration is that the open border doesn't just flood the country with a lot of low- skilled immigrants, a lot of crime, but the drug crisis that we have now.</p><p>If you look at any graph of what they call the opioid crisis, which they want to make a health care issue, it started in 2013. That's where the compassion and sympathy for these unaccompanied alien children comes full circle. A lot of them were drug mules, even those who weren't had to pay the drug smugglers to come in, and yet, you cannot implicate that agenda in any discussion over the drug crisis. Everything must yield because the ends justify the means.</p><p>LEVIN: Do you agree with this?</p><p>KIRK: Well, 100 percent. I visited the border last week and for three days, I spent extensive time. I like to say there is no border. It's a joke. In fact, I mean, there is literally a copper bar that you could just step over and walk into Mexico. This is in the Tucson sector, mind you, which is the number one sector of drug traffic in the country, and I talked to Border Patrol agents, I talked to some senior level Border Patrol agents and said, \"How many of you actually support building a wall?\" I said. Well, we polled our Border Patrol agents in all the different sectors, 95 percent supported building the wall. The other 5 percent didn't understand the question.</p><p>What we really have here is an attack on sovereignty, an attack on our country, and an attack on our very culture at its very core. A nation is defined by its border. You have a weak border, you have a weak country, but it's intentional.</p><p>I don't give the Democrats any sort of advantage on the argument. I don't give them the benefit of the doubt quite honestly. They want open borders. They want political and societal chaos. They want a globalist type agenda where America is not better than any other country where the Constitution is completely run amok because when have you 15 million illegal immigrants in this country, I like to call them foreign nationals, not illegal immigrants, then all of a sudden, the rule of law completely disappears.</p><p>They are moving the goal posts intentionally. When you get rid of the rule of law, then you can have anarchy. And I believe that within the base of the Democratic Party in the left is a desire to want to completely de- civilize and destroy western civilization as we know it.</p><p>LEVIN: When we come back, this rule of law, where are we on the rule of law? What about our judges? Are they upholding the rule of law? We'll be right back.</p><p>All right, Daniel Horowitz, judges, we were just talking about immigration. Where do we stand with the judiciary in this country?</p><p>HOROWITZ: Your grandfather was the judicial supremacist. I mean, it has gotten 10 times worse since even when you wrote \"Men in Black.\" We are at the point where judges do not recognize any clause of the Constitution. What's a state power they give to the Feds, what's the Fed power they give to the states? What's a real right, they read out of the Constitution. What is antithetical to an unalienable right? They read into the Constitution.</p><p>And moreover, they are now abusing the rules of standing to make anything a justiciable case, so everything Trump has done that often is not new territory, he merely gets rid of things that didn't exist in the country from 1789 until Barack Obama's last two years such as trans-genderism in the military, the contraception mandate.</p><p>A number of his EPA regulations, a lot of conservatives are very proud of his deregulation agenda. I've got news for you.</p><p>LEVIN: So, what's happened to all that?</p><p>HOROWITZ: The courts are enjoining them. Basically, the legal profession has created this rule where any left-wing, third-party group could get standing in a court to sue an abstract policy with no valid injuction fact and put a nationwide -- have a district judge put a nationwide...</p><p>LEVIN: There's thousands of thousands of district judges.</p><p>HOROWITZ: Almost a thousand and then put a nationwide injunction on...</p><p>LEVIN: And block the President's agenda. What's your take on this?</p><p>KIRK: When I was raised, I was told there are three branches of government. That is not true.</p><p>LEVIN: There's at least four, I think.</p><p>KIRK: There's a fourth branch of government and in fact, it's the most powerful. It's unaccountable, it's unelected and it's unknown, and that's the bureaucracies and included in that are these district court judges, and as you articulate very well, in the original draft of the Constitution, circuit court or district judge is found nowhere. There was a Supreme Court and that was it.</p><p>People need to understand that a majority of our laws and the power that is vested within our government is not between the Supreme Court, it is not between the legislative or the executive, it's between the bureaucracies and they are putting an unprecedented amount of pressure on our freedoms and liberties on a state, local and Federal level all across the country and again, they're unaudited, they are unaccountable and they are unknown.</p><p>We don't know their names. We can't get rid of them. We can't vote them out. This is something the Founding Fathers did not, I think even foresee in some ways because the bureaucracy has a life of its own. It's a multimillion person standing army against our freedom and liberty and one of the greatest threats to America we have today.</p><p>LEVIN: So with these unelected branches, the courts and much of the courts have been created by Congress and the administrative state also created by Congress, that legislate, that adjudicate and that execute, and they're outside the Constitutional system and outside our ability to reach them. All right, we'll be right back.</p><p>Welcome back. I am going to ask you what I've asked all my guest so far. The next 20 years in America, do you feel positive about it or not so positive? Charlie.</p><p>KIRK: Positive despite unprecedented odds, opposition from people that want to destroy this country. Never bet against America and don't bet against the American people. We have the enemies of freedom in our colleges, in our culture, in our media but with people like you and we have people like our organization and our student activists that are rising up and fighting every single day that are signaling the alarm and organizing for ideas that are timeless. I am optimistic because that's exactly it -- it's the idea. It's more than anything else, freedom will always win.</p><p>LEVIN: Daniel?</p><p>HOROWITZ: It's all in our hands. If you ask me about the next three or five years, I do unfortunately see a resurgent of the left, but over the next 20 years, the good news as Charlie has said, the left is overplaying their hand.</p><p>The country does not want what they want and I think that is the opportunity for younger conservatives to come in and offer something affirmative that speaks to people's hearts and their intellect and where they are and when they balance that against what they see in the left, I am confident in the long run, we will win out. But we've got to seize the opportunity.</p><p>LEVIN: You both are a little more confident than I am and that's okay. It doesn't really matter, I suppose. What matters is we keep fighting and keep advancing the cause and our ideas. I want to thank you. You've been terrific guests. And I want to thank you too, America and I will see you here next time. Thank you and God bless.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018041501cb262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S41-K031-JB20-G48G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7149\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 15, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Turning Point USA, Education, Conservatives, Free Markets, Facebook, Amazon, Barbara Bush, R.

The new line is that it's inherently problematic when even as many as three or four companies dominate an industry, and that the government needs to take action, pronto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is an overreaction, as Robert D. Atkinson and Michael Lind have explained in this space (\"The Neo-Brandeisian Attack on Big Business,\" October 2, 2017). In many cases it's actually better, for workers and consumers alike, to have a few big, highly efficient companies duking it out with one another than to have hundreds of tiny ones fumbling around in the marketplace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there are real monopolies in this country, and three of them -- Alphabet (i.e., Google), Amazon, and Facebook -- control much of our online life. They are already showing anti-competitive tendencies, as well as censoring speech, and yet there is no perfect response to such practices. These firms could do great damage if left unchecked -- but then again, their market dominance might not be as secure as it seems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not time to smash these companies to pieces. But it just might be time to rein in some of their most egregious practices.</p><p>Traditionally, the case against monopolies has gone something like this. In a competitive market, companies must charge the lowest price they profitably can or else lose out to their rivals. If a company were to, say, arbitrarily hike its prices by half, the vast majority of its customers would simply head elsewhere. By contrast, if there isn't much competition to speak of, a company can charge whatever the market will bear. It might hike its prices by half and lose only a quarter of its sales -- pulling in more revenue for less effort -- because customers won't have an alternative. Their only options are to pay the new price or go without the product entirely.</p><p>This problem might then compound as the monopolist leverages its power. A company might take the extra money it makes from a monopoly on one product and use it to secure monopolies on other products -- losing money at first as it sells items below cost to drive out the competition, then hiking prices. Or it might pursue \"vertical integration\"; the company that owns all the oil refineries might buy up the pipelines and railroad tankers as well, monopolizing the entire chain of businesses through which consumers gain access to a product. And if a monopolist doesn't outright take over those related industries, it can use its monopoly clout to extract concessions from the other businesses it deals with, as well as from workers.</p><p>It's not illegal simply to have a monopoly so long as it was established through legal means, but it is illegal to abuse monopoly power in various ways. And concerns about abuse cut across ideological lines. Liberals, naturally, will jump at any chance to hammer big companies. And conservatives are keenly aware that capitalism works so well thanks to the magic of competition -- and cannot work without it.</p><p>Judge Learned Hand once wrote that a 90 percent market share \"is enough to constitute a monopoly; it is doubtful whether sixty or sixty-four percent would be enough; and certainly thirty-three percent is not.\" In practice, courts put the cutoff somewhere between 70 and 80 percent, a range in which the company is about two to four times the size of all its competitors put together.</p><p>The applicability of traditional thinking about monopolies is limited, however, when it comes to the Godzillas of tech. Google and Facebook, which monopolize online search (91 percent market share) and mobile social media (77 percent) respectively, don't charge the end users of those products a cent. And while Amazon has a monopoly, or at least a near-monopoly, over e-book sales (70 percent), it doesn't control the broader market of online retail, which itself is less than one-tenth of total retail in the U.S. Moreover, far from hiking prices, Amazon has gone out of its way to keep them low, earning little to no profit each year and focusing its efforts on growth. And to cap it all off, while these companies' competitors may be tiny, all a customer has to do is type in a different Web address to access them. So what's the problem?</p><p>Let's take a brief look at some of these companies' most controversial actions -- and the actions they have the power to take even if they haven't yet.</p><p>Here's one that got Google clobbered with a $2.7 billion fine from the European Union, and it has to do with what happens when someone, well, \"googles\" the name of a product. Years ago, such a search would turn up some links to \"comparison shopping\" websites -- places users could go to compare prices at different retailers. Recently, though, comparison-shopping sites have shown up on page four of the results, at best.</p><p>Why might that be? Because Google decided that what its users really wanted to do was comparison-shop among retailers who pay Google. Today, anyone searching the name of a product is first shown a selection of \"sponsored\" offerings, complete with pictures and prices of specific products. Below that, where the normal search results begin, there are direct links to retailers (I recently got a Home Depot link in a search for \"lawnmower\") but no links to other price-comparison options. Portions of a report inadvertently leaked by the Federal Trade Commission here in the U.S. showed that Google had deliberately rigged its algorithm to penalize competing sites -- leveraging its monopoly over Web search to take other companies' business. There is also some evidence that this practice pushed up prices: The ad spots are allocated via auction, the costs of which participating retailers have to cover, and as a result the products the search engine highlights are often more expensive than what a consumer could find if he compared prices a different way.</p><p>There's more where that came from. The EU is also investigating Google with regard to Android, an operating system for smartphones. Much the way Google search is free to the end user, Android is free for companies that make smartphones. And as much as one hears about each new version of the iPhone (which runs Apple's own iOS), Android is installed on more than 80 percent of the smartphones sold today. The flipside of free is that there are strings attached: Smartphone companies must sell their phones with Google's own apps pre-installed, \"nudging\" the user to use Google products across the board. (On my own Android phone, Google Play Movies &amp; TV is mysteriously considered a \"system app\" and cannot be uninstalled.) This is remarkably similar to the practice that got Microsoft in hot water two decades ago, when it sold Windows, its monopoly operating system, with its own Internet browser set up as the default, doing great damage to its rival Netscape.</p><p>Back in 2013, U.S. regulators put an end to two other anti-competitive practices at Google. In addition to selling ads on its own products, Google runs AdSense, which places ads on any website that wants to participate and passes along some of the revenue; the company agreed to lift restrictions it had placed on companies that used other ad services in addition to AdSense. It also apparently needed to be told it couldn't \"scrape\" user reviews from websites such as Yelp (through which people can weigh in on local restaurants and other businesses) and include those reviews on its own sites.</p><p>Google isn't always hyper-competent when it executes these kinds of anti-competitive moves, however. In 2011 it had a meeting at Forbes in which it told the media company it would receive better search rankings if its articles included a button that readers could click to share a link on Google Plus, a social-media site. Apparently a journalist invited to the meeting wasn't told it was confidential and wrote a piece about the practice -- and despite the effort to manhandle press outlets that heavily rely on Google's search engine for traffic, hardly anyone uses Google Plus today.</p><p>Of the three tech giants against which allegations of \"monopolization\" are often made, Amazon is the most interesting, as it controls less than half of the online-retail market. In a celebrated Yale Law Journal article that serves as an excellent catalogue of everything Amazon has done wrong, Lina M. Khan argued at length that the company essentially breaks the mold; regulators' current criteria for anti-competitive behavior just don't capture what the company has been up to. And indeed, she documents many troubling practices.</p><p>The foundation of Amazon's business strategy, oddly enough, is an unwillingness to make a profit. The company has wound up in the black more often in recent years, but it consistently ran losses for much of its history, and generally speaking it keeps prices low and spends any extra revenue on efforts to grow. Its shareholders have been content to watch their stock gain value as the company gets bigger rather than receiving a share of any profits. And grow the company has. It doesn't just sell stuff online; it also serves as a marketplace for other sellers, provides cloud-computing services, produces movies and TV shows, and manages a distribution chain. It now owns Whole Foods, whose stores could soon serve as distribution hubs.</p><p>In other words, Amazon has tons of money rolling in, and shareholders aren't clamoring to see any of it, so losses are acceptable so long as they serve the purpose of growth. One thing this means is that when Amazon wants to obliterate the competition in a specific market niche, it can sell below cost like an old-fashioned monopolist. That is how it established a monopoly in e-books: It lost money on bestselling titles, and probably on the Kindle e-reader device as well. Regulators declined to step in, noting that Amazon's e-book sales were profitable overall, even if the company was losing money on bestsellers in particular. (Incredibly, they did step in when Apple and five of the six major publishers established \"agency pricing\" for the iBookstore, by which books' publishers would set whatever price they wanted on each title and Apple would take 30 percent. At the time this happened, Amazon controlled 90 percent of the e-book market.)</p><p>Once Amazon had gained such enormous market share, it had the ability to boss book publishers around. The maker of a product cannot afford to be kept away from a majority of its potential customers, and this is especially true when the monopolist ties its customers to itself through a device such as the Kindle, which gives the user direct access to the Amazon store and automatically downloads any Amazon e-books he purchases from other devices as well. (Many Kindle users don't even know it's possible to put non-Amazon files on the device, which is not too difficult for the tech-savvy but entails a somewhat obscure process.) Amazon is famous for yanking publishers' catalogues from its store during negotiations.</p><p>Quidsi, which operated several retail websites, including Diapers.com, also got a taste of what it means to go up against Amazon. When the smaller company rebuffed the bigger one's attempt to purchase it, Amazon slashed prices on baby products by up to 30 percent. It set up digital \"bots\" that monitored prices on Diapers.com and automatically undercut them every time they changed, and it started services that gave regular baby-products customers even deeper discounts. Quidsi alleged that the strategy would cause Amazon to lose $100 million over three months, losses a smaller company could not sustain. Quidsi finally sold to Amazon, which responded to its new freedom from competition by raising prices and scaling back discounts.</p><p>This isn't \"creative destruction\"; Amazon didn't come up with a better way to sell people diapers. It just kept sustaining losses until its smaller competitor gave up.</p><p>Then there's the fact that, in addition to selling products itself, Amazon serves as a platform for other sellers -- many product pages show multiple offers, and some products are available only through non-Amazon sellers. In a sense this is admirably pro-competitive, as Amazon is giving smaller sellers a way to reach its huge user base (for a fee). But there's a downside for other companies that succeed through Amazon's infrastructure: Amazon sees all their sales data, meaning the entire third-party Amazon marketplace is basically a big test lab for Amazon proper. If another company's product succeeds, Amazon can in short order start offering a similar product itself at the same price (or less). Some Amazon sellers have accused the company of doing just that, even with rather distinctive products such as pillows modeled after football mascots.</p><p>There are two other threats the tech monopolies pose that are worth briefly discussing: They are in a good position to maintain their dominance, and their dominance brings with it an extraordinary power to shape public discourse.</p><p>It's well known that older companies gradually lose their mojo, making them vulnerable to ambitious start-ups. Recently I was surprised to learn, for example, that a higher percentage of adolescents use Instagram (a photo-centric social-media site) than use Facebook. Then I learned that Facebook has owned Instagram since 2012. Facebook has also persistently tried to buy Snapchat, another photo app popular with teens.</p><p>Acquisition is a common way for tech monopolies to entrench their position, and it normally doesn't require the sort of strong-arm tactics that Amazon employed against Quidsi. Alphabet, Google's parent corporation, has purchased more than 200 companies over its lifespan, integrating its purchases into its various offerings. It's hardly any surprise that by one analysis, from Google critic Scott Cleland, the company leads in 13 of the Internet's 14 key \"commercial web functions of the Internet data economy,\" the exception being social media: \"data collection, search, tracking-analytics, digital advertising, mobile, video, location, browser, Internet Infrastructure, consumer-Internet of Things, Apps store, translation, &amp; email.\"</p><p>Some major tech products, including Google Docs, were acquired at the start rather than developed in-house. \"Initial public offerings\" of start-up companies have declined in recent years, perhaps in part because so many companies work toward the goal of being bought up by a giant rather than succeeding on their own.</p><p>And today, an incredible proportion of the information driving public discourse runs through Google and Facebook. To be clear, this does not pose any sort of First Amendment issue -- these are private companies, and the Constitution does not dictate how they program their search algorithms or decide which stories appear on users' news feeds. But the potential for political meddling is substantial and troubling when a single company controls a key way that Americans across the political spectrum find their information.</p><p>Russian bots famously were designed to spread breathless \"fake news\" on Facebook in the runup to the 2016 election, a problem the company is now looking to fix. Last year, some former Facebook employees told the tech site Gizmodo that they had, at their superiors' request, deliberately kept conservative topics such as the annual CPAC gathering out of Facebook's \"Trending Topics\" section. Google's YouTube has banned or \"demonetized\" (refused to run ads on, depriving the creators of revenue) videos created by various right-wing figures, including Michelle Malkin. One study suggested that if Google deliberately tweaked search results to favor a candidate, it could influence about 2 percent of votes, enough to sway close elections.</p><p>Google has also made itself a powerful player in the D.C. think-tank world, funding a variety of institutions on the right and left alike. The company has never hidden these efforts, and they fall well within its rights, but they burst into the public consciousness earlier this year when the left-leaning New America Foundation parted ways with its Open Markets Institute. The latter's head, Barry Lynn, had praised the aforementioned EU ruling against Google -- which generously funded other projects at New America.</p><p>So what's the solution? The most draconian option would be to just start busting up these companies. Last year in Washington Monthly, Lynn and his New America colleague Phillip Longman called for the government to \"break up Amazon, Facebook, Google, Comcast, and any other essential network monopoly by banning them from owning companies that depend on their services.\" In the blog post that presaged his departure from New America, Lynn called on U.S. regulators to \"cleanly separate ownership of the network from ownership of the products and services sold on that network, as they did in the original Microsoft case of the late 1990s.\" (Before the ultimate settlement, a court ruling would have broken up the maker of Windows.)</p><p>The Microsoft example is instructive: No one is very afraid of the company these days even though the government failed to break it up, opting instead to gently restrict its business practices. The company is doing well financially, largely owing to its cloud-computing services, but the monopoly worries have faded: PC sales have dropped off thanks to the rise of smartphones and tablets, an attempt to put Windows on mobile phones flopped, Microsoft's Internet browsers are just a fifth of the market, and its search engine is an afterthought. It's perfectly conceivable that today's seemingly secure tech monopolies will lose their grip over time too.</p><p>But gentler approaches are available to address more immediate problems, starting with the EU's strategy for comparison-shopping sites, which in that same post Lynn described as \"requiring that Google give equal treatment to rival services instead of privileging its own.\" One could also imagine requiring companies such as Amazon to keep other companies' sales data private, though that would be difficult to enforce, or banning companies that reach a certain market share from selling below cost, especially in a concentrated effort to destroy a competitor. (Indeed, this is already illegal in some circumstances, though the law is rarely enforced.) In a similar vein, Jonathan Taplin, author of Move Fast and Break Things, has suggested stopping the tech monopolies from acquiring still more small ventures, requiring them to operate as public utilities (such as by licensing their patents for a set fee), and mandating that they take greater steps to prevent intellectual-property infringement on their networks.</p><p>Regarding this last item, companies such as Google and Facebook are currently given \"safe harbor\" under a law passed 20 years ago, when the Internet was a fledgling technology in need of special legal protections -- essentially meaning they can't be held liable for their users' piracy, or for pointing users to pirated material in search results, unless a creator has specifically requested the removal of an infringing post or link. There are limits to how much we can expect search engines and social networks to fight piracy, of course, even if they're huge monopolies. But the first Google result for \"nirvana smells like teen spirit mp3\" should not be a bare-bones website that helps users download songs for free from mysterious, unnamed sources rather than hosting the files itself, as it was when I searched those words recently. If these companies are going to control a huge part of our lives without facing competition, they can do a better job of respecting others' rights.</p><p>Speaking of which, Jeremy Carl of Stanford's Hoover Institution has suggested basically applying the First Amendment to these companies. Google (and its YouTube), Facebook (and its Instagram), and any future monopolies could be prohibited from banning, censoring, or demonetizing any speech that is legal. They would act as common carriers available to all.</p><p>Some mix of the above measures might preserve a competitive marketplace without a heavy-handed government assault on private businesses. But as yet, it's unclear how the Trump administration will approach the issue of tech monopolies and antitrust law more generally, and to what extent Congress is open to these ideas.</p><p>The administration has recently sued to block the merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, an aggressive move but one that (ostensibly) relies on age-old antitrust concerns. It's an example of \"vertical integration\" between two companies that are large but not monopolies: Time Warner owns television networks such as HBO and TNT, while AT&amp;T distributes those networks through products such as DirecTV. In theory, the two combined could benefit from charging AT&amp;T's competitors artificially high rates for Time Warner's content, harming consumers in the process. The other possible rationale is that Trump is merely trying to punish Time Warner, which owns his media archenemy, CNN.</p><p>Either way, the suit doesn't provide much of a signal as to how the administration sees Google. But there's certainly a populist angle to keeping a check on enormous companies when no competitors are around to do so -- and a conservative angle to ensuring that competition flourishes online.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATREV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATREV2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R79-DX31-DYTG-T181-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211515</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 National Review All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>National Review</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 18, 2017 </dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp; Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Discretion</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjdERjFENTBEOTdDNENFRjk5ODNBRUJDM0MwRjc4MzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUU1OTEyOTNEQ0U4NEQ1RkEwMkU0MzZCQkE0QjBBOTA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>State Regulation</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzkzREJEOTdEQkUxNEE2QTlGNkVBMzQ0QkE0OTg0QzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI5NTI1QUNEQ0JDNEM4Q0I2OEZDRjc3QkVFMDU4QTg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Social Networking Sites</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJEOEE3NERCMEE5NDAyRTgzQ0QzNTc3MkM3NzI0MUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U2OEYyMDlBMThBNDQxRjg4NkFGM0I4REVDODE1QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QGO</classCode><className>MONOPOLIZATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDNGMkQ1NzQwRjIzNDZCNUI1RERGQzA4RjUwQzdGNzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDA2NTZCMDc0RDA0NDBCOEFFMjA0NTg1QTBGMjM3NTQ</classCode><className>Monopolies &amp; Monopolization</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp; TRADE LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><className>Antitrust &amp; Trade Law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001373</classCode><className>PRICE CHANGES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DL4P</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS FACILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001373</classCode><className>PRICE CHANGES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The new line is that it's inherently problematic when even as many as three or four companies dominate an industry, and that the government needs to take action, pronto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is an overreaction, as Robert D. Atkinson and Michael Lind have explained in this space (\"The Neo-Brandeisian Attack on Big Business,\" October 2, 2017). In many cases it's actually better, for workers and consumers alike, to have a few big, highly efficient companies duking it out with one another than to have hundreds of tiny ones fumbling around in the marketplace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there are real monopolies in this country, and three of them -- Alphabet (i.e., Google), Amazon, and Facebook -- control much of our online life. They are already showing anti-competitive tendencies, as well as censoring speech, and yet there is no perfect response to such practices. These firms could do great damage if left unchecked -- but then again, their market dominance might not be as secure as it seems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not time to smash these companies to pieces. But it just might be time to rein in some of their most egregious practices.</p><p>Traditionally, the case against monopolies has gone something like this. In a competitive market, companies must charge the lowest price they profitably can or else lose out to their rivals. If a company were to, say, arbitrarily hike its prices by half, the vast majority of its customers would simply head elsewhere. By contrast, if there isn't much competition to speak of, a company can charge whatever the market will bear. It might hike its prices by half and lose only a quarter of its sales -- pulling in more revenue for less effort -- because customers won't have an alternative. Their only options are to pay the new price or go without the product entirely.</p><p>This problem might then compound as the monopolist leverages its power. A company might take the extra money it makes from a monopoly on one product and use it to secure monopolies on other products -- losing money at first as it sells items below cost to drive out the competition, then hiking prices. Or it might pursue \"vertical integration\"; the company that owns all the oil refineries might buy up the pipelines and railroad tankers as well, monopolizing the entire chain of businesses through which consumers gain access to a product. And if a monopolist doesn't outright take over those related industries, it can use its monopoly clout to extract concessions from the other businesses it deals with, as well as from workers.</p><p>It's not illegal simply to have a monopoly so long as it was established through legal means, but it is illegal to abuse monopoly power in various ways. And concerns about abuse cut across ideological lines. Liberals, naturally, will jump at any chance to hammer big companies. And conservatives are keenly aware that capitalism works so well thanks to the magic of competition -- and cannot work without it.</p><p>Judge Learned Hand once wrote that a 90 percent market share \"is enough to constitute a monopoly; it is doubtful whether sixty or sixty-four percent would be enough; and certainly thirty-three percent is not.\" In practice, courts put the cutoff somewhere between 70 and 80 percent, a range in which the company is about two to four times the size of all its competitors put together.</p><p>The applicability of traditional thinking about monopolies is limited, however, when it comes to the Godzillas of tech. Google and Facebook, which monopolize online search (91 percent market share) and mobile social media (77 percent) respectively, don't charge the end users of those products a cent. And while Amazon has a monopoly, or at least a near-monopoly, over e-book sales (70 percent), it doesn't control the broader market of online retail, which itself is less than one-tenth of total retail in the U.S. Moreover, far from hiking prices, Amazon has gone out of its way to keep them low, earning little to no profit each year and focusing its efforts on growth. And to cap it all off, while these companies' competitors may be tiny, all a customer has to do is type in a different Web address to access them. So what's the problem?</p><p>Let's take a brief look at some of these companies' most controversial actions -- and the actions they have the power to take even if they haven't yet.</p><p>Here's one that got Google clobbered with a $2.7 billion fine from the European Union, and it has to do with what happens when someone, well, \"googles\" the name of a product. Years ago, such a search would turn up some links to \"comparison shopping\" websites -- places users could go to compare prices at different retailers. Recently, though, comparison-shopping sites have shown up on page four of the results, at best.</p><p>Why might that be? Because Google decided that what its users really wanted to do was comparison-shop among retailers who pay Google. Today, anyone searching the name of a product is first shown a selection of \"sponsored\" offerings, complete with pictures and prices of specific products. Below that, where the normal search results begin, there are direct links to retailers (I recently got a Home Depot link in a search for \"lawnmower\") but no links to other price-comparison options. Portions of a report inadvertently leaked by the Federal Trade Commission here in the U.S. showed that Google had deliberately rigged its algorithm to penalize competing sites -- leveraging its monopoly over Web search to take other companies' business. There is also some evidence that this practice pushed up prices: The ad spots are allocated via auction, the costs of which participating retailers have to cover, and as a result the products the search engine highlights are often more expensive than what a consumer could find if he compared prices a different way.</p><p>There's more where that came from. The EU is also investigating Google with regard to Android, an operating system for smartphones. Much the way Google search is free to the end user, Android is free for companies that make smartphones. And as much as one hears about each new version of the iPhone (which runs Apple's own iOS), Android is installed on more than 80 percent of the smartphones sold today. The flipside of free is that there are strings attached: Smartphone companies must sell their phones with Google's own apps pre-installed, \"nudging\" the user to use Google products across the board. (On my own Android phone, Google Play Movies &amp; TV is mysteriously considered a \"system app\" and cannot be uninstalled.) This is remarkably similar to the practice that got Microsoft in hot water two decades ago, when it sold Windows, its monopoly operating system, with its own Internet browser set up as the default, doing great damage to its rival Netscape.</p><p>Back in 2013, U.S. regulators put an end to two other anti-competitive practices at Google. In addition to selling ads on its own products, Google runs AdSense, which places ads on any website that wants to participate and passes along some of the revenue; the company agreed to lift restrictions it had placed on companies that used other ad services in addition to AdSense. It also apparently needed to be told it couldn't \"scrape\" user reviews from websites such as Yelp (through which people can weigh in on local restaurants and other businesses) and include those reviews on its own sites.</p><p>Google isn't always hyper-competent when it executes these kinds of anti-competitive moves, however. In 2011 it had a meeting at Forbes in which it told the media company it would receive better search rankings if its articles included a button that readers could click to share a link on Google Plus, a social-media site. Apparently a journalist invited to the meeting wasn't told it was confidential and wrote a piece about the practice -- and despite the effort to manhandle press outlets that heavily rely on Google's search engine for traffic, hardly anyone uses Google Plus today.</p><p>Of the three tech giants against which allegations of \"monopolization\" are often made, Amazon is the most interesting, as it controls less than half of the online-retail market. In a celebrated Yale Law Journal article that serves as an excellent catalogue of everything Amazon has done wrong, Lina M. Khan argued at length that the company essentially breaks the mold; regulators' current criteria for anti-competitive behavior just don't capture what the company has been up to. And indeed, she documents many troubling practices.</p><p>The foundation of Amazon's business strategy, oddly enough, is an unwillingness to make a profit. The company has wound up in the black more often in recent years, but it consistently ran losses for much of its history, and generally speaking it keeps prices low and spends any extra revenue on efforts to grow. Its shareholders have been content to watch their stock gain value as the company gets bigger rather than receiving a share of any profits. And grow the company has. It doesn't just sell stuff online; it also serves as a marketplace for other sellers, provides cloud-computing services, produces movies and TV shows, and manages a distribution chain. It now owns Whole Foods, whose stores could soon serve as distribution hubs.</p><p>In other words, Amazon has tons of money rolling in, and shareholders aren't clamoring to see any of it, so losses are acceptable so long as they serve the purpose of growth. One thing this means is that when Amazon wants to obliterate the competition in a specific market niche, it can sell below cost like an old-fashioned monopolist. That is how it established a monopoly in e-books: It lost money on bestselling titles, and probably on the Kindle e-reader device as well. Regulators declined to step in, noting that Amazon's e-book sales were profitable overall, even if the company was losing money on bestsellers in particular. (Incredibly, they did step in when Apple and five of the six major publishers established \"agency pricing\" for the iBookstore, by which books' publishers would set whatever price they wanted on each title and Apple would take 30 percent. At the time this happened, Amazon controlled 90 percent of the e-book market.)</p><p>Once Amazon had gained such enormous market share, it had the ability to boss book publishers around. The maker of a product cannot afford to be kept away from a majority of its potential customers, and this is especially true when the monopolist ties its customers to itself through a device such as the Kindle, which gives the user direct access to the Amazon store and automatically downloads any Amazon e-books he purchases from other devices as well. (Many Kindle users don't even know it's possible to put non-Amazon files on the device, which is not too difficult for the tech-savvy but entails a somewhat obscure process.) Amazon is famous for yanking publishers' catalogues from its store during negotiations.</p><p>Quidsi, which operated several retail websites, including Diapers.com, also got a taste of what it means to go up against Amazon. When the smaller company rebuffed the bigger one's attempt to purchase it, Amazon slashed prices on baby products by up to 30 percent. It set up digital \"bots\" that monitored prices on Diapers.com and automatically undercut them every time they changed, and it started services that gave regular baby-products customers even deeper discounts. Quidsi alleged that the strategy would cause Amazon to lose $100 million over three months, losses a smaller company could not sustain. Quidsi finally sold to Amazon, which responded to its new freedom from competition by raising prices and scaling back discounts.</p><p>This isn't \"creative destruction\"; Amazon didn't come up with a better way to sell people diapers. It just kept sustaining losses until its smaller competitor gave up.</p><p>Then there's the fact that, in addition to selling products itself, Amazon serves as a platform for other sellers -- many product pages show multiple offers, and some products are available only through non-Amazon sellers. In a sense this is admirably pro-competitive, as Amazon is giving smaller sellers a way to reach its huge user base (for a fee). But there's a downside for other companies that succeed through Amazon's infrastructure: Amazon sees all their sales data, meaning the entire third-party Amazon marketplace is basically a big test lab for Amazon proper. If another company's product succeeds, Amazon can in short order start offering a similar product itself at the same price (or less). Some Amazon sellers have accused the company of doing just that, even with rather distinctive products such as pillows modeled after football mascots.</p><p>There are two other threats the tech monopolies pose that are worth briefly discussing: They are in a good position to maintain their dominance, and their dominance brings with it an extraordinary power to shape public discourse.</p><p>It's well known that older companies gradually lose their mojo, making them vulnerable to ambitious start-ups. Recently I was surprised to learn, for example, that a higher percentage of adolescents use Instagram (a photo-centric social-media site) than use Facebook. Then I learned that Facebook has owned Instagram since 2012. Facebook has also persistently tried to buy Snapchat, another photo app popular with teens.</p><p>Acquisition is a common way for tech monopolies to entrench their position, and it normally doesn't require the sort of strong-arm tactics that Amazon employed against Quidsi. Alphabet, Google's parent corporation, has purchased more than 200 companies over its lifespan, integrating its purchases into its various offerings. It's hardly any surprise that by one analysis, from Google critic Scott Cleland, the company leads in 13 of the Internet's 14 key \"commercial web functions of the Internet data economy,\" the exception being social media: \"data collection, search, tracking-analytics, digital advertising, mobile, video, location, browser, Internet Infrastructure, consumer-Internet of Things, Apps store, translation, &amp; email.\"</p><p>Some major tech products, including Google Docs, were acquired at the start rather than developed in-house. \"Initial public offerings\" of start-up companies have declined in recent years, perhaps in part because so many companies work toward the goal of being bought up by a giant rather than succeeding on their own.</p><p>And today, an incredible proportion of the information driving public discourse runs through Google and Facebook. To be clear, this does not pose any sort of First Amendment issue -- these are private companies, and the Constitution does not dictate how they program their search algorithms or decide which stories appear on users' news feeds. But the potential for political meddling is substantial and troubling when a single company controls a key way that Americans across the political spectrum find their information.</p><p>Russian bots famously were designed to spread breathless \"fake news\" on Facebook in the runup to the 2016 election, a problem the company is now looking to fix. Last year, some former Facebook employees told the tech site Gizmodo that they had, at their superiors' request, deliberately kept conservative topics such as the annual CPAC gathering out of Facebook's \"Trending Topics\" section. Google's YouTube has banned or \"demonetized\" (refused to run ads on, depriving the creators of revenue) videos created by various right-wing figures, including Michelle Malkin. One study suggested that if Google deliberately tweaked search results to favor a candidate, it could influence about 2 percent of votes, enough to sway close elections.</p><p>Google has also made itself a powerful player in the D.C. think-tank world, funding a variety of institutions on the right and left alike. The company has never hidden these efforts, and they fall well within its rights, but they burst into the public consciousness earlier this year when the left-leaning New America Foundation parted ways with its Open Markets Institute. The latter's head, Barry Lynn, had praised the aforementioned EU ruling against Google -- which generously funded other projects at New America.</p><p>So what's the solution? The most draconian option would be to just start busting up these companies. Last year in Washington Monthly, Lynn and his New America colleague Phillip Longman called for the government to \"break up Amazon, Facebook, Google, Comcast, and any other essential network monopoly by banning them from owning companies that depend on their services.\" In the blog post that presaged his departure from New America, Lynn called on U.S. regulators to \"cleanly separate ownership of the network from ownership of the products and services sold on that network, as they did in the original Microsoft case of the late 1990s.\" (Before the ultimate settlement, a court ruling would have broken up the maker of Windows.)</p><p>The Microsoft example is instructive: No one is very afraid of the company these days even though the government failed to break it up, opting instead to gently restrict its business practices. The company is doing well financially, largely owing to its cloud-computing services, but the monopoly worries have faded: PC sales have dropped off thanks to the rise of smartphones and tablets, an attempt to put Windows on mobile phones flopped, Microsoft's Internet browsers are just a fifth of the market, and its search engine is an afterthought. It's perfectly conceivable that today's seemingly secure tech monopolies will lose their grip over time too.</p><p>But gentler approaches are available to address more immediate problems, starting with the EU's strategy for comparison-shopping sites, which in that same post Lynn described as \"requiring that Google give equal treatment to rival services instead of privileging its own.\" One could also imagine requiring companies such as Amazon to keep other companies' sales data private, though that would be difficult to enforce, or banning companies that reach a certain market share from selling below cost, especially in a concentrated effort to destroy a competitor. (Indeed, this is already illegal in some circumstances, though the law is rarely enforced.) In a similar vein, Jonathan Taplin, author of Move Fast and Break Things, has suggested stopping the tech monopolies from acquiring still more small ventures, requiring them to operate as public utilities (such as by licensing their patents for a set fee), and mandating that they take greater steps to prevent intellectual-property infringement on their networks.</p><p>Regarding this last item, companies such as Google and Facebook are currently given \"safe harbor\" under a law passed 20 years ago, when the Internet was a fledgling technology in need of special legal protections -- essentially meaning they can't be held liable for their users' piracy, or for pointing users to pirated material in search results, unless a creator has specifically requested the removal of an infringing post or link. There are limits to how much we can expect search engines and social networks to fight piracy, of course, even if they're huge monopolies. But the first Google result for \"nirvana smells like teen spirit mp3\" should not be a bare-bones website that helps users download songs for free from mysterious, unnamed sources rather than hosting the files itself, as it was when I searched those words recently. If these companies are going to control a huge part of our lives without facing competition, they can do a better job of respecting others' rights.</p><p>Speaking of which, Jeremy Carl of Stanford's Hoover Institution has suggested basically applying the First Amendment to these companies. Google (and its YouTube), Facebook (and its Instagram), and any future monopolies could be prohibited from banning, censoring, or demonetizing any speech that is legal. They would act as common carriers available to all.</p><p>Some mix of the above measures might preserve a competitive marketplace without a heavy-handed government assault on private businesses. But as yet, it's unclear how the Trump administration will approach the issue of tech monopolies and antitrust law more generally, and to what extent Congress is open to these ideas.</p><p>The administration has recently sued to block the merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, an aggressive move but one that (ostensibly) relies on age-old antitrust concerns. It's an example of \"vertical integration\" between two companies that are large but not monopolies: Time Warner owns television networks such as HBO and TNT, while AT&amp;T distributes those networks through products such as DirecTV. In theory, the two combined could benefit from charging AT&amp;T's competitors artificially high rates for Time Warner's content, harming consumers in the process. The other possible rationale is that Trump is merely trying to punish Time Warner, which owns his media archenemy, CNN.</p><p>Either way, the suit doesn't provide much of a signal as to how the administration sees Google. But there's certainly a populist angle to keeping a check on enormous companies when no competitors are around to do so -- and a conservative angle to ensuring that competition flourishes online.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATREV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATREV2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2V-J1D1-JCBF-3181-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">211515</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 National Review All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>National Review</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 18, 2017 </dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp; Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Discretion</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjdERjFENTBEOTdDNENFRjk5ODNBRUJDM0MwRjc4MzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUU1OTEyOTNEQ0U4NEQ1RkEwMkU0MzZCQkE0QjBBOTA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>State Regulation</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzkzREJEOTdEQkUxNEE2QTlGNkVBMzQ0QkE0OTg0QzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI5NTI1QUNEQ0JDNEM4Q0I2OEZDRjc3QkVFMDU4QTg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp; Internet Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Social Networking Sites</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJEOEE3NERCMEE5NDAyRTgzQ0QzNTc3MkM3NzI0MUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0U2OEYyMDlBMThBNDQxRjg4NkFGM0I4REVDODE1QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QGO</classCode><className>MONOPOLIZATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDNGMkQ1NzQwRjIzNDZCNUI1RERGQzA4RjUwQzdGNzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDA2NTZCMDc0RDA0NDBCOEFFMjA0NTg1QTBGMjM3NTQ</classCode><className>Monopolies &amp; Monopolization</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp; TRADE LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><className>Antitrust &amp; Trade Law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001373</classCode><className>PRICE CHANGES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DL4P</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS FACILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001373</classCode><className>PRICE CHANGES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

There was a technology theme to the selections, while several on our panel of small business champions picked companies they claimed were tackling some of the world's biggest problems by treating Alzheimer's disease and broadening access to education.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many of the best ideas are ones that solve a problem and make things easier for people. Loral and Eishel Quinn, the mother and daughter behind Sustainably, have done just that with an app that allows people to donate spare change to charity automatically - by rounding it up to the nearest pound each time they shop.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They realised that charitable giving needed an upgrade; setting up direct debits or rooting around in your bag for spare change were not the easiest ways for people to donate to good causes.</p><p>The company, based in Edinburgh and London, is supporting charities large and small - from the British Heart Foundation to animal shelters and charities helping refugees. It is attracting a new generation of philanthropists who want to do good on their own terms. Sustainably doesn't share your personal details, so you can give with privacy, transparency and control.</p><p>The business is part-funded by Virgin StartUp, our not-for-profit organisation, and I'm proud we have committed to funding an equal number of women and men. Gender shouldn't matter when it comes to starting a business. What is important is the strength of your idea and your determination to make it happen.</p><p>Workfinder was run as a project in my Founders4Schools charity for three years, but was spun out in the summer. It is now a for-profit business that connects university students with scale-up companies looking to put together teams for particular projects.</p><p>It would be obvious to students that they should apply to, say, Unilever or Google, but there are tens of thousands of applicants for every spot. Workfinder, which has an HQ in Shoreditch, east London, is telling students that scale-ups produce 95% of jobs in the country, and helping them identify the best places to apply. It uses information from LinkedIn, DueDil [a financial database] and Companies House to act as a matchmaker between students and those fast-growing companies. It works for both parties.</p><p>My other favourites this year have been Raspberry Pi, which makes affordable mini-computers, and Perkbox, an online platform for boosting employee engagement.</p><p>The insurance industry is broken. Decades of middle-men, jargon, lengthy contracts and confusing quotes have made protecting yourself a chore, and in an era of pay-as-you-go services and subscriptions, there just isn't a place for such outdated practices anymore.</p><p>Founder Freddy Macnamara set up Cuvva in Islington, north London, to take the hassle out of insurance by letting people sign up for only what they need - whether that's an hour's cover, a rolling contract or a longer policy. If you're borrowing a friend's van to move home at the weekend, or need to use a family car for a holiday, for instance, you can get a quote in seconds via the Cuvva app and it doesn't require you to add names to existing policies, nor does it involve complex forms.</p><p>I love the idea that one of the oldest financial markets in the world is being transformed through products, and an approach to customer service, that really reflect the way people live today.</p><p>My favourite companies are those that form critical requirements in the course of business. Taina has developed technology that helps financial institutions automate their regulatory compliance. It was founded by Maria Scott, a Londonbased entrepreneur who worked as a tax lawyer for the bank JP Morgan for 12 years. Maria is incredibly driven and motivated and is a great female role model. XCD, based in Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, is a human resources payroll software suite on the Salesforce platform. It is going to be successful, but has taken five years to get where it is. You don't go from zero to hero in a few weeks.</p><p>The businesses that stand out are those with a great vision and an acute understanding of the market and their differentiators within it.</p><p>One is Fluidic Analytics, a Cambridgebased life sciences business. It was set up by a group of scientists who have developed the technology to analyse proteins faster and more accurately than any other technology available. This year, the team celebrated a breakthrough in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with its Fluidity One-W system. The impact of the company's innovation on diagnostics, cancer therapies and organ transplants is potentially huge.</p><p>Another stand-out business is the men's trousers brand Spoke, which is based in Richmond, southwest London. The growth of direct-to-customer channels has made overseas customers more accessible to UK retailers. While the best brands make this look effortless, behindthe-scenes execution takes a huge amount of digital marketing prowess, which Spoke has achieved.</p><p>Identifying the gap for a direct-tocustomer men's clothing business, the team are using machine learning to offer customers 10 times more sizes than the average trouser brand.</p><p>The typical student needs between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 for educational materials and equipment each year. That leaves disadvantaged students potentially unable to access the materials required to excel in higher education.</p><p>Perlego, a digital learning library in London, was created to combat this problem. For only \u00a312 a month - less than the price of a single textbook - Perlego users gain access to more than 250,000 academic and professional books, while the platform allows publishers to recoup revenues lost to piracy and the secondhand market.</p><p>Another example of a business solving a real problem is Thirdfort. The process of buying or selling a home hasn't changed for decades and carries increasing risks for lawyers around compliance and for consumers around fraud. Thirdfort tackles this with a mobile app, empowering lawyers to carry out checks with no need for physical documents. With a photo of the required documents and a selfie, Thirdfort carries out identity and anti-money-laundering checks.</p><p>London-based Concirrus is tackling marine insurance, a 300-year-old industry, using big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning. The premise is that behaviour is a better indicator of risk than the traditional approach, which looks at size, weight and type.</p><p>The company has ingested billions of records of data to create predictive models that clearly outperform the market. Concirrus has done for marine insurance what Google Maps did for driving directions and has won customers such as Marsh and Willis Re.</p><p>Northern Ireland's Neurovalens is changing the future treatment of global health epidemics with a non-invasive headset. It combines neuroscience with technology to stimulate the brain's hypothalamus [which has a vital role in functions such as releasing hormones and controlling appetite] and tackles obesity, insomnia and type 2 diabetes. There has been enormous traction this year, with three products moving into phase three clinical trials. There have been large sales of the consumer headset, Modius, which targets weight loss.</p><p>Two companies we backed this year stand out. Aparito was founded in Wrexham by Elin Haf Davies, a former senior research nurse at Great Ormond Street Hospital, with the aim of solving a poignant problem: many clinical trials - especially involving children - fail because of poor data.</p><p>Aparito is Europe's first company to combine smartphone and wearable technology to record patient data 24/7 and feed it directly into clinical trials. Larger and better data sets could make the difference between success and failure. Acamar Films is the independent production company behind Bing, the toprated BBC children's show. If you have pre-school children, Bing is probably a constant presence in your home. Acamar's founder, Mikael Shields, acquired the rights to the book character in 2005. He then invested nearly 10 years and considerable sums researching and developing Bing's world. The first episode aired in 2014 and it is broadcast in about 120 territories. Next stop is America.</p><p>As the skills we need at work change, Jolt provides a highly flexible and much more affordable business school in London and Tel Aviv, letting people learn at their own pace and around their work schedule. It runs classes where experts from companies such as Tesla and Apple stream live talks, teaching everything from Instagram marketing techniques to negotiation skills. It provides the quality of a \u00a325,000-a year MBA at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>Founded by a former tech entrepreneur and a leading biologist, Zoe is running the biggest-ever clinical study on twins to truly understand what goes on in our microbiome, the bacteria in our gut and what we can do to change our health.</p><p>While big tech companies such as Facebook and Amazon have shown they still have plenty of flaws, we hope companies such as Jolt and Zoe show how technology really can make us all better off.</p><p>They saw that giving to charity needed an upgrade</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sir Richard Branson founder of Virgin Group SustainablySherry Coutu entrepreneur and non-executive director WorkfinderRobin Klein co-founder of LocalGlobe CuvvaVin Murria entrepreneur and angel investor XCD HR and Taina TechnologyStephen Welton founder and chief executive of BGF Fluidic Analytics and SpokeAlex Chesterman co-founder of Lovefilm and Zoopla Perlego and ThirdfortKerry Baldwin managing partner of IQ Capital Concirrus and NeurovalensAlex Davies founder of Wealth Club Aparito and Acamar FilmsJames Wise partner at Balderton Capital Jolt and ZoeCharity round-up: Loral Quinn, 48, right, and her daughter Eishel, 24, the driving force behind Sustainably</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-156057859</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVN-97F1-JCBW-N2TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 29, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0003PRY</classCode><className>BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Clearly, we are at a point in time in which the corporate/social compact and even <url normalizedValue=\"https://aboutus.ft.com/en-gb/new-agenda/\"> capitalism itself</url> is being rethought (or reset, as the FT announced on the front page this week).</p><p>One of the interesting bits of string in that larger story is the way in which we are seeing public authorities taking on rich and powerful wrongdoers in ways that they\u2019ve been slow to do in the past (one of the big points of public discontent following the financial crisis of 2008 was, of course, that nobody went to jail for tanking the global economy and leaving ordinary people to pay for it).</p><p>In recent weeks, we\u2019ve seen the indictment of 33 rich parents who tried to buy spots for their kids at top US universities. The fact that actress <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/us/felicity-huffman-sentencing.html\"> Felicity Huffman\u2019s picture</url> was splashed on the front page of The New York Times \u2014 gaunt, penitent and holding the hand of a worn-looking William H Macy (pictured below) \u2014 says a lot about the iconic nature of her 14-day sentence. For some, the length of time was a farce, since it was a fraction of what poor people get for doing much, much less. For others, it was a sign that the system is actually working, and no one, not even Hollywood royalty, is above it.</p><p>Meanwhile, federal prosecutors and regulators are expanding their already quite aggressive investigations into how JPMorgan Chase and other financial companies may have manipulated metal markets, something which has led to criminal charges against three individuals. I\u2019m going to be watching that story very carefully to see if there\u2019s a shift from the last similar commodity manipulating scandal, involving Goldman Sachs in the aluminium market. You may remember another front page <url normalizedValue=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/business/a-shuffle-of-aluminum-but-to-banks-pure-gold.html\"> NYT piece</url> back then which laid out the Kafka-esque way in which the bank was getting around rules designed to prevent companies from both owning and trading physical commodities by moving its aluminium horde a few feet or so, from one shed to another, every so often. In the end, regulators couldn\u2019t make charges stick, and the bank left the market before prices began to fall, at which point nobody much cared (if you do, there\u2019s a whole chapter in my last book about this).</p><p>We are even seeing politicians orchestrating public trials of chief executives. Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, recently called for Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg to be sent to the Big House. \u201cMark Zuckerberg has repeatedly lied to the American people about privacy. I think he ought to be held personally accountable, which is everything from financial fines to the possibility of a prison term,\u201d Mr Wyden said.</p><p>This is important, because to Big Tech companies, fines (like those paid by so many banks for malfeasance before and after 2008) are simply a cost of doing business. Criminal charges for top executives are another matter. I\u2019m wondering if we might soon hear calls to Occupy Silicon Valley\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.</p><p>Ed, what do you think of this new, tougher line on the part of some public officials? Is it legitimate? Posturing? And where it might go politically?</p><p>Recommended reading</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>I don\u2019t necessarily agree with all his conclusions (I think Elizabeth Warren is actually much more of a pragmatic doer than people give her credit for being) but as a column, I very much enjoyed David Brook\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/opinion/elizabeth-warren.html\"> fever dream</url> of a Warren presidency.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>If anyone has any doubt that Silicon Valley has too much debt and too little sense, read this Wall Street Journal <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-is-not-the-way-everybody-behaves-how-adam-neumanns-over-the-top-style-built-wework-11568823827\"> deep dive into WeWork</url>.

In general, the Obama administration did let Wall Street off the hook after 2008 and the fines imposed on some banks were borne by shareholders, rather than culpable executives. This was a mistake since it reinforced the view that there is one law for the rich and another for everyone else. Huffman\u2019s light sentence last week is a perfect example of this. It seems the Obama-Biden view has not changed since 2008, which is a mistake. The other day Joe Biden said that no one in America should go to jail for non-violent offences. As the Epstein episode showed, money can hijack the course of justice in America, which is not how the rule of law should work in a democracy.

In August, the 34-year-old tech executive took a more radical step to restrict his use of social media and other addictive technologies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rosenstein purchased a new iPhone and instructed his assistant to set up a parental-control feature to prevent him from downloading any apps. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He was particularly aware of the allure of Facebook \"likes\", which he describes as \"bright dings of pseudo-pleasure\" that can be as hollow as they are seductive. And Rosenstein should know: he was the Facebook engineer who created the \"like\" button in the first place. </p><p>A decade after he stayed up all night coding a prototype of what was then called an \"awesome\" button, Rosenstein belongs to a small but growing band of Silicon Valley heretics who complain about the rise of the so-called \"attention economy\": an internet shaped around the demands of an advertising economy. </p><p>These refuseniks are rarely founders or chief executives, who have little incentive to deviate from the mantra that their companies are making the world a better place. Instead, they tend to have worked a rung or two down the corporate ladder: designers, engineers and product managers who, like Rosenstein, several years ago put in place the building blocks of a digital world from which they are now trying to disentangle themselves. \"It is very common,\" Rosenstein says, \"for humans to develop things with the best of intentions and for them to have unintended, negative consequences.\"</p><p>Rosenstein, who also helped create Gchat during a stint at Google, and now leads a San Francisco-based company that improves office productivity, appears most concerned about the psychological effects on people who, research shows, touch, swipe or tap their phone 2,617 times a day.</p><p>There is growing concern that as well as addicting users, technology is contributing toward so-called \"continuous partial attention\", severely limiting people's ability to focus, and possibly lowering IQ. One recent study showed that the mere presence of smartphones damages cognitive capacity - even when the device is turned off. \"Everyone is distracted,\" Rosenstein says. \"All of the time.\"</p><p>It is very common for humans to develop things with the best of intentions that have unintended, negative consequences</p><p>  Justin Rosenstein, creator of the 'like' button    </p><p>But those concerns are trivial compared to the devastating impact upon the political system that some of Rosenstein's peers believe can be attributed to the rise of social media and the attention-based market that drives it.</p><p>Drawing a straight line between addiction to social media and political earthquakes like Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump, they contend that digital forces have completely upended the political system and, left unchecked, could even render democracy as we know it obsolete.</p><p>In 2007, Rosenstein was one of a small group of Facebook employees who decided to create a path of least resistance - a single click - to \"send little bits of positivity\" across the platform. Facebook's \"like\" feature was, Rosenstein says, \"wildly\" successful: engagement soared as people enjoyed the short-term boost they got from giving or receiving social affirmation, while Facebook harvested valuable data about the preferences of users that could be sold to advertisers. The idea was soon copied by Twitter, with its heart-shaped \"likes\" (previously star-shaped \"favourites\"), Instagram, and countless other apps and websites.</p><p>It was Rosenstein's colleague, Leah Pearlman, then a product manager at Facebook and on the team that created the Facebook \"like\", who announced the feature in a 2009 blogpost. Now 35 and an illustrator, Pearlman confirmed via email that she, too, has grown disaffected with Facebook \"likes\" and other addictive feedback loops. She has installed a web browser plug-in to eradicate her Facebook news feed, and hired a social media manager to monitor her Facebook page so that she doesn't have to.</p><p>\"One reason I think it is particularly important for us to talk about this now is that we may be the last generation that can remember life before,\" Rosenstein says. It may or may not be relevant that Rosenstein, Pearlman and most of the tech insiders questioning today's attention economy are in their 30s, members of the last generation that can remember a world in which telephones were plugged into walls. </p><p>It is revealing that many of these younger technologists are weaning themselves off their own products, sending their children to elite Silicon Valley schools where iPhones, iPads and even laptops are banned. They appear to be abiding by a Biggie Smalls lyric from their own youth about the perils of dealing crack cocaine: never get high on your own supply.</p><p>                                        \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7                                      </p><p>One morning in April this year, designers, programmers and tech entrepreneurs from across the world gathered at a conference centre on the shore of the San Francisco Bay. They had each paid up to $1,700 to learn how to manipulate people into habitual use of their products, on a course curated by conference organiser Nir Eyal.</p><p>Eyal, 39, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, has spent several years consulting for the tech industry, teaching techniques he developed by closely studying how the Silicon Valley giants operate. </p><p> Related:  Are smartphones really making our children sad?</p><p>\"The technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions,\" Eyal writes. \"It's the impulse to check a message notification. It's the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later.\" None of this is an accident, he writes. It is all \"just as their designers intended\". </p><p>He explains the subtle psychological tricks that can be used to make people develop habits, such as varying the rewards people receive to create \"a craving\", or exploiting negative emotions that can act as \"triggers\". \"Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation,\" Eyal writes.</p><p>Attendees of the 2017 Habit Summit might have been surprised when Eyal walked on stage to announce that this year's keynote speech was about \"something a little different\". He wanted to address the growing concern that technological manipulation was somehow harmful or immoral. He told his audience that they should be careful not to abuse persuasive design, and wary of crossing a line into coercion.</p><p>But he was defensive of the techniques he teaches, and dismissive of those who compare tech addiction to drugs. \"We're not freebasing Facebook and injecting Instagram here,\" he said. He flashed up a slide of a shelf filled with sugary baked goods. \"Just as we shouldn't blame the baker for making such delicious treats, we can't blame tech makers for making their products so good we want to use them,\" he said. \"Of course that's what tech companies will do. And frankly: do we want it any other way?\"</p><p>We're not freebasing Facebook and injecting Instagram here</p><p>  Nir Eyal, tech consultant    </p><p>Without irony, Eyal finished his talk with some personal tips for resisting the lure of technology. He told his audience he uses a Chrome extension, called DF YouTube, \"which scrubs out a lot of those external triggers\" he writes about in his book, and recommended an app called Pocket Points that \"rewards you for staying off your phone when you need to focus\". </p><p>Finally, Eyal confided the lengths he goes to protect his own family. He has installed in his house a outlet timer connected to a router that cuts off access to the internet at a set time every day. \"The idea is to remember that we are not powerless,\" he said. \"We are in control.\"</p><p>But are we? If the people who built these technologies are taking such radical steps to wean themselves free, can the rest of us reasonably be expected to exercise our free will?</p><p>Not according to Tristan Harris, a 33-year-old former Google employee turned vocal critic of the tech industry. \"All of us are jacked into this system,\" he says. \"All of our minds can be hijacked. Our choices are not as free as we think they are.\"</p><p>Harris, who has been branded \"the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience\", insists that billions of people have little choice over whether they use these now ubiquitous technologies, and are largely unaware of the invisible ways in which a small number of people in Silicon Valley are shaping their lives.</p><p>A graduate of Stanford University, Harris studied under BJ Fogg, a behavioural psychologist revered in tech circles for mastering the ways technological design can be used to persuade people. Many of his students, including Eyal, have gone on to prosperous careers in Silicon Valley. </p><p>Harris is the student who went rogue; a whistleblower of sorts, he is lifting the curtain on the vast powers accumulated by technology companies and the ways they are using that influence. \"A handful of people, working at a handful of technology companies, through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today,\" he said at a recent TED talk in Vancouver.</p><p>\"I don't know a more urgent problem than this,\" Harris says. \"It's changing our democracy, and it's changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships that we want with each other.\" Harris went public - giving talks, writing papers, meeting lawmakers and campaigning for reform after three years struggling to effect change inside Google's Mountain View headquarters.</p><p> It all began in 2013, when he was working as a product manager at Google, and circulated a thought-provoking memo, A Call To Minimise Distraction &amp; Respect Users' Attention, to 10 close colleagues. It struck a chord, spreading to some 5,000 Google employees, including senior executives who rewarded Harris with an impressive-sounding new job: he was to be Google's in-house design ethicist and product philosopher. </p><p>Looking back, Harris sees that he was promoted into a marginal role. \"I didn't have a social support structure at all,\" he says. Still, he adds: \"I got to sit in a corner and think and read and understand.\"</p><p> He explored how LinkedIn exploits a need for social reciprocity to widen its network; how YouTube and Netflix autoplay videos and next episodes, depriving users of a choice about whether or not they want to keep watching; how Snapchat created its addictive Snapstreaks feature, encouraging near-constant communication between its mostly teenage users.</p><p>I have two kids and I regret every minute that I'm not paying attention to them because my smartphone has sucked me in</p><p>  Loren Brichter, app designer    </p><p>The techniques these companies use are not always generic: they can be algorithmically tailored to each person. An internal Facebook report leaked this year, for example, revealed that the company can identify when teens feel \"insecure\", \"worthless\" and \"need a confidence boost\". Such granular information, Harris adds, is \"a perfect model of what buttons you can push in a particular person\".</p><p>Tech companies can exploit such vulnerabilities to keep people hooked; manipulating, for example, when people receive \"likes\" for their posts, ensuring they arrive when an individual is likely to feel vulnerable, or in need of approval, or maybe just bored. And the very same techniques can be sold to the highest bidder. \"There's no ethics,\" he says. A company paying Facebook to use its levers of persuasion could be a car business targeting tailored advertisements to different types of users who want a new vehicle. Or it could be a Moscow-based troll farm seeking to turn voters in a swing county in Wisconsin.</p><p>Harris believes that tech companies never deliberately set out to make their products addictive. They were responding to the incentives of an advertising economy, experimenting with techniques that might capture people's attention, even stumbling across highly effective design by accident.</p><p>A friend at Facebook told Harris that designers initially decided the notification icon, which alerts people to new activity such as \"friend requests\" or \"likes\", should be blue. It fit Facebook's style and, the thinking went, would appear \"subtle and innocuous\". \"But no one used it,\" Harris says. \"Then they switched it to red and of course everyone used it.\"</p><p> That red icon is now everywhere. When smartphone users glance at their phones, dozens or hundreds of times a day, they are confronted with small red dots beside their apps, pleading to be tapped. \"Red is a trigger colour,\" Harris says. \"That's why it is used as an alarm signal.\"</p><p>The most seductive design, Harris explains, exploits the same psychological susceptibility that makes gambling so compulsive: variable rewards. When we tap those apps with red icons, we don't know whether we'll discover an interesting email, an avalanche of \"likes\", or nothing at all. It is the possibility of disappointment that makes it so compulsive. </p><p>It's this that explains how the pull-to-refresh mechanism, whereby users swipe down, pause and wait to see what content appears, rapidly became one of the most addictive and ubiquitous design feature in modern technology. \"Each time you're swiping down, it's like a slot machine,\" Harris says. \"You don't know what's coming next. Sometimes it's a beautiful photo. Sometimes it's just an ad.\" </p><p>                                        \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7                                      </p><p> The designer who created the pull-to-refresh mechanism, first used to update Twitter feeds, is Loren Brichter, widely-admired in the app-building community for his sleek and intuitive designs. </p><p>Now 32, Brichter says he never intended the design to be addictive - but would not dispute the slot machine comparison. \"I agree 100%,\" he says. \"I have two kids now and I regret every minute that I'm not paying attention to them because my smartphone has sucked me in.\"</p><p>Brichter created the feature in 2009 for Tweetie, his startup, mainly because he could not find anywhere to fit the \"refresh\" button on his app. Holding and dragging down the feed to update seemed at the time nothing more than a \"cute and clever\" fix. Twitter acquired Tweetie the following year, integrating pull-to-refresh into its own app. </p><p>Since then the design has become one of the most widely emulated features in apps; the downward-pull action is, for hundreds of millions of people, as intuitive as scratching an itch.</p><p> Related:  Inside the rehab saving young men from their internet addiction</p><p>Brichter says he is puzzled by the longevity of the feature. In an era of push notification technology, apps can automatically update content without being nudged by the user. \"It could easily retire,\" he says. Instead it appears to serve a psychological function: after all, slot machines would be far less addictive if gamblers didn't get to pull the lever themselves. Brichter prefers another comparison: that it is like the redundant \"close door\" button in some elevators with automatically closing doors. \"People just like to push it.\"</p><p>All of which has left Brichter, who has put his design work on the backburner while he focuses on building a house in New Jersey, questioning his legacy. \"I've spent many hours and weeks and months and years thinking about whether anything I've done has made a net positive impact on society or humanity at all,\" he says. He has blocked certain websites, turned off push notifications, restricted his use of the Telegram app to message only with his wife and two close friends, and tried to wean himself off Twitter. \"I still waste time on it,\" he confesses, \"just reading stupid news I already know about.\" He charges his phone in the kitchen, plugging it in at 7pm and not touching it until the next morning.</p><p>\"Smartphones are useful tools,\" he says. \"But they're addictive. Pull-to-refresh is addictive. Twitter is addictive. These are not good things. When I was working on them, it was not something I was mature enough to think about. I'm not saying I'm mature now, but I'm a little bit more mature, and I regret the downsides.\"</p><p>Not everyone in his field appears racked with guilt. The two inventors listed on Apple's patent for \"managing notification connections and displaying icon badges\" are Justin Santamaria and Chris Marcellino. Both were in their early 20s when they were hired by Apple to work on the iPhone. As engineers, they worked on the behind-the-scenes plumbing for push-notification technology, introduced in 2009 to enable real-time alerts and updates to hundreds of thousands of third-party app developers. It was a revolutionary change, providing the infrastructure for so many experiences that now form a part of people's daily lives, from ordering an Uber to making a Skype call to receiving breaking news updates. </p><p>But notification technology also enabled a hundred unsolicited interruptions into millions of lives, accelerating the arms race for people's attention. Santamaria, now 36, who now runs a startup after a stint as the head of mobile at Airbnb, says the technology he developed at Apple was not \"inherently good or bad\". \"This is a larger discussion for society,\" he says. \"Is it OK to shut off my phone when I leave work? Is it OK if I don't get right back to you? Is it OK that I'm not 'liking' everything that goes through my Instagram screen?\" </p><p>His then colleague, Marcellino, agrees. \"Honestly, at no point was I sitting there thinking: let's hook people,\" he says. \"It was all about the positives: these apps connect people, they have all these uses - ESPN telling you the game has ended, or WhatsApp giving you a message for free from your family member in Iran who doesn't have a message plan.\"</p><p>A few years ago Marcellino, 33, left the Bay Area, and is now the final stages of retraining to be a neurosurgeon. He stresses he is no expert on addiction, but says he has picked up enough in his medical training to know that technologies can affect the same neurological pathways as gambling and drug use. \"These are the same circuits that make people seek out food, comfort, heat, sex,\" he says.</p><p>All of it, he says, is reward-based behaviour that activates the brain's dopamine pathways. He sometimes finds himself clicking on the red icons beside his apps \"to make them go away\", but is conflicted about the ethics of exploiting people's psychological vulnerabilities. \"It is not inherently evil to bring people back to your product,\" he says. \"It's capitalism.\"</p><p>That, perhaps, is the problem. Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist who benefited from hugely profitable investments in Google and Facebook, has grown disenchanted with both companies, arguing that their early missions have been distorted by the fortunes they have been able to earn through advertising. </p><p>It's changing our democracy, and it's changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships we want</p><p>  Tristan Harris, former design ethicist at Google</p><p>He identifies the advent of the smartphone as a turning point, raising the stakes in an arms race for people's attention. \"Facebook and Google assert with merit that they are giving users what they want,\" McNamee says. \"The same can be said about tobacco companies and drug dealers.\"</p><p>That would be a remarkable assertion for any early investor in Silicon Valley's most profitable behemoths. But McNamee, 61, is more than an arms-length money man. Once an adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, 10 years ago McNamee introduced the Facebook CEO to his friend, Sheryl Sandberg, then a Google executive who had overseen the company's advertising efforts. Sandberg, of course, became chief operating officer at Facebook, transforming the social network into another advertising heavyweight. </p><p>McNamee chooses his words carefully. \"The people who run Facebook and Google are good people, whose well-intentioned strategies have led to horrific unintended consequences,\" he says. \"The problem is that there is nothing the companies can do to address the harm unless they abandon their current advertising models.\"</p><p>But how can Google and Facebook be forced to abandon the business models that have transformed them into two of the most profitable companies on the planet?</p><p>McNamee believes the companies he invested in should be subjected to greater regulation, including new anti-monopoly rules. In Washington, there is growing appetite, on both sides of the political divide, to reign in Silicon Valley. But McNamee worries the behemoths he helped build may already be too big to curtail. \"The EU recently penalised Google $2.42bn for anti-monopoly violations, and Google's shareholders just shrugged,\" he says.</p><p>Rosenstein, the Facebook \"like\" co-creator, believes there may be a case for state regulation of \"psychologically-manipulative advertising\", saying the moral impetus is comparable to taking action against fossil fuel or tobacco companies. \"If we only care about profit maximisation,\" he says, \"we will go rapidly into dystopia.\" </p><p> Related:  Does staring at your phone for hours on end serve any practical purpose?</p><p>                                        \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7                                      </p><p>James Williams does not believe talk of dystopia is far-fetched. The ex-Google strategist who built the metrics system for the company's global search advertising business, he has had a front-row view of an industry he describes as the \"largest, most standardised and most centralised form of attentional control in human history\".</p><p>Williams, 35, left Google last year, and is on the cusp of completing a PhD at Oxford University exploring the ethics of persuasive design. It is a journey that has led him to question whether democracy can survive the new technological age.</p><p>He says his epiphany came a few years ago, when he noticed he was surrounded by technology that was inhibiting him from concentrating on the things he wanted to focus on. \"It was that kind of individual, existential realisation: what's going on?\" he says. \"Isn't technology supposed to be doing the complete opposite of this?\" </p><p>That discomfort was compounded during a moment at work, when he glanced at one of Google's dashboards, a multicoloured display showing how much of people's attention the company had commandeered for advertisers. \"I realised: this is literally a million people that we've sort of nudged or persuaded to do this thing that they weren't going to otherwise do,\" he recalls.</p><p>He embarked on several years of independent research, much of it conducted while working part-time at Google. About 18 months in, he saw the Google memo circulated by Harris and the pair became allies, struggling to bring about change from within.</p><p>It is not inherently evil to bring people back to your product. It's capitalism</p><p>  Chris Marcellino, former Apple engineer    </p><p> Williams and Harris left Google around the same time, and co-founded an advocacy group, Time Well Spent, that seeks to build public momentum for a change in the way big tech companies think about design. Williams finds it hard to comprehend why this issue is not \"on the front page of every newspaper every day. </p><p>\"Eighty-seven percent of people wake up and go to sleep with their smartphones,\" he says. The entire world now has a new prism through which to understand politics, and Williams worries the consequences are profound.</p><p>The same forces that led tech firms to hook users with design tricks, he says, also encourage those companies to depict the world in a way that makes for compulsive, irresistible viewing. \"The attention economy incentivises the design of technologies that grab our attention,\" he says. \"In so doing, it privileges our impulses over our intentions.\" </p><p>That means privileging what is sensational over what is nuanced, appealing to emotion, anger and outrage. The news media is increasingly working in service to tech companies, Williams adds, and must play by the rules of the attention economy to \"sensationalise, bait and entertain in order to survive\".</p><p>In the wake of Donald Trump's stunning electoral victory, many were quick to question the role of so-called \"fake news\" on Facebook, Russian-created Twitter bots or the data-centric targeting efforts that companies such as Cambridge Analytica used to sway voters. But Williams sees those factors as symptoms of a deeper problem. </p><p>It is not just shady or bad actors who were exploiting the internet to change public opinion. The attention economy itself is setup to promote a phenomenon like Trump, who is masterful at grabbing and retaining the attention of supporters and critics alike, often by exploiting or creating outrage.</p><p>Williams was making this case before the president was elected. In a blog published a month before the US election, Williams sounded the alarm bell on an issue he argued was a \"far more consequential question\" than whether Trump reached the White House. The reality TV star's campaign, he said, had heralded a watershed in which \"the new, digitally supercharged dynamics of the attention economy have finally crossed a threshold and become manifest in the political realm\".</p><p> Related:  Russia's election ad campaign shows Facebook's biggest problem is Facebook</p><p>Williams saw a similar dynamic unfold months earlier, during the Brexit campaign, when the attention economy appeared to him biased in favour of the emotional, identity-based case for the UK leaving the European Union. He stresses these dynamics are by no means isolated to the political right: they also play a role, he believes, in the unexpected popularity of leftwing politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, and the frequent outbreaks of internet outrage over issues that ignite fury among progressives. </p><p>All of which, Williams says, is not only distorting the way we view politics but, over time, may be changing the way we think, making us less rational and more impulsive. \"We've habituated ourselves into a perpetual cognitive style of outrage, by internalising the dynamics of the medium,\" he says. </p><p>It is against this political backdrop that Williams argues the fixation in recent years with the surveillance state fictionalised by George Orwell may have been misplaced. It was another English science fiction writer, Aldous Huxley, who provided the more prescient observation when he warned that Orwellian-style coercion was less of a threat to democracy than the more subtle power of psychological manipulation, and \"man's almost infinite appetite for distractions\".</p><p>Since the US election, Williams has explored another dimension to today's brave new world. If the attention economy erodes our ability to remember, to reason, to make decisions for ourselves - faculties that are essential to self-governance - what hope is there for democracy itself?</p><p> \"The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will,\" he says. \"If politics is an expression of our human will, on individual and collective levels, then the attention economy is directly undermining the assumptions that democracy rests on.\" If Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat are gradually chipping away at our ability to control our own minds, could there come a point, I ask, at which democracy no longer functions?</p><p> \"Will we be able to recognise it, if and when it happens?\" Williams replies. \"And if we can't, then how do we know it hasn't happened already?\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-38025951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PN1-W021-F021-64KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4595\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

We're spooked when the same set of advertisements tailgate us, yet become furious when our iPhones have no clue where we are when we search for a restaurant (Hello, I am NOT in Fort Wayne). We loathe that our data is mined and scraped, yet still we opt for Googleover DuckDuckGo (never mind that Googleis tracking our moves like an assassin); still we use Facebook (never mind that it harvests our personal information like so many internal organs); and we click ''I agree'' when downloading our apps, knowing full well that those apps are talking to other apps, telling them how much we eat and what music we listen to and when we ovulate. </p><p>  Plus: Has it made one whit of difference that we're now alerted to the use of cookies on websites, thanks to that recent rule issued by the European Union? Speaking for myself, I would say it has not. Those alerts make me feel worse, because they reveal my impatience, my recklessness, my everyday failures of self-regulation. I seem to be forever surrendering my privacy in exchange for some short-term gain, rather than dutifully slogging through the decision tree of the cookie opt-out.</p><p>  So the question becomes: Why do I -- why do many of us -- consistently act in ways that are directly at loggerheads with the privacy values we profess to hold dear? What explains this phenomenon, which experts have taken to calling ''the privacy paradox''?</p><p>  In an attempt at reconciliation -- and expiation and clarification -- I made lots of phone calls and did lots of reading on the topic in recent weeks, much of it online. By the end, I was Google-stalked almost exclusively by ads about privacy-related books and podcasts: I was that deep in a house of meta-horrors. Here, perhaps, was my most liberating discovery: Our conflicting impulses are actually quite rational. As Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology at Carnegie Mellon, points out, sometimes each of the contradictory beliefs in a paradox is perfectly well founded.</p><p>  Let's consider, just as an example, why we are forever skating past the internet's fine print. In 2008 -- 2008! before Instagram, before Uber, before WhatsApp! -- two of Acquisti's colleagues at Carnegie Mellon calculated just how long it would take for the average internet user to read the privacy policies of all the websites he or she visited in a single year. Their answer: over 30 workdays, at a national opportunity cost of $781 billion.</p><p>  Which makes blowing off those policies seem quite reasonable. A necessity, even.</p><p>  So there you have one explanation for this so-called paradox: To fully apprehend our vulnerabilities as digital creatures would require far too much time and energy. More than that: It would require an entirely new set of instincts, a radically different cognitive framework from the one we now possess.</p><p>  Joyce Searls, a privacy activist and consultant in Santa Barbara, Calif., is forever reminding people that we've barely begun to understand who and what we are on the internet, in part because it's a disembodied experience. We think we're alone while we're buzzing through the mists of cyberspace -- that a Google search is akin to thumbing through the Yellow Pages, because it feels just as solitary. But it isn't. We are being watched, tracked; we simply don't realize it, because we can't see it or feel it.</p><p>  Which suggests another reason we're less than conscientious about our online habits: Most of us haven't paid a humiliating price for being watched and tracked. ''We've had a massive experience of walking around naked with no perceived consequences,'' says Searls. Why bother getting dressed?</p><p>  So we carry on. Even though everyone is mutely collecting our queries, preferences, fetishes, anxieties.</p><p>Google. Amazon. Facebook. YouTube. Pandora. Pinterest. The Weather Channel. Reddit. Wikipedia. Major League Baseball. PornHub. Zillow. Your newspaper. Your bank. Your phone carrier. Everyone.</p><p>  Danah Boyd, the founder of the Data &amp; Society Research Institute, perhaps put it best when she wrote we are ''public by default, private through effort.''</p><p>  For most people, that effort -- to change how they search, how they buy stuff, how they connect with others and absorb news -- is just too great. ''There's a sense that the fight to protect your data is unwinnable,'' says Acquisti, of Carnegie Mellon. ''You'd have to learn about other tools, it's costly in time, and it might not even help, because your data is already out there.''</p><p>  Resignation also explains the privacy paradox. It's a perfectly rational response to a situation in which human beings have very little agency.</p><p>  If that's the case, my initial instinct -- to call our privacy habits ''neurotically contradictory'' -- is a rather ungenerous one. ''It's not a neurotic contradiction,'' Shoshana Zuboff, a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, says to me in the nicest possible way. ''It's an intolerable contradiction.''</p><p>  Zuboff is the author of ''The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,'' an ambitious fright-opus that examines the new corporate trafficking in human habits and the consequences for our society. She thinks it's absurd, not to mention blaming the victim, to say that we're reckless with our privacy online. Rather, she argues, we have no choice. Online is where our individual needs get met, because they aren't being met in real life. ''The real institutional world has abandoned us,'' she tells me.</p><p>  As she notes: We call the airlines -- or our insurance companies or our banks -- and spend ten minutes talking to robots, then another 15 on hold, waiting to speak to an actual person. Is it any wonder we handle matters concerning our health, travel, and banking online instead?</p><p>  Zuboff has equal compassion for our promiscuities on social media, as compromising as they may be to our privacy. Status online has become compensation for living in an environment of economic instability. It may even pay economic dividends. Influencers online can make money. (Two words that turn my blood to ice: Instagram celebrity.)</p><p>  What many of us don't realize, when we're online, is how very much the technologies we're using are reshaping our ideas about privacy without our notice. Which in turn reshapes our behaviors.</p><p>  This is one of the core themes of ''Re-Engineering Humanity,'' by Brett Frischmann and Evan Selinger. It's not an accident, they argue, that we treat our privacy differently now. The tools we use have been designed with exactly this end in mind.</p><p>  I think, in my own life, about the first random person whose friend request I accepted on Facebook. I no longer remember his name. I simply remember realizing that he was not, as best as I could discern, a friend of a good friend, but rather had come my way via a loopity skein of loose ties. Still, I clicked ''accept.'' Before I knew it, I was doing this pretty regularly, especially in 2014, when I had a book to sell. (Status! Visibility! Sales!) And all was fine with this freewheeling system until the day that one of those random people -- someone who'd requested my friendship, not the other way around (it was never the other way around) -- wrote me a nasty note on Facebook Messenger, letting me know he'd seen me on television and thought me a perfect idiot.</p><p>  I unfriended him. But I also felt unnerved and rather furious with myself: He had, at that point, presumably seen pictures of my kid, my wedding at City Hall, my 25th high school reunion. How had I decided that such a thing was ... fine?</p><p>  ''The danger that 'privacy' doesn't capture is this idea of creep,'' says Frischmann, an internet law expert at Villanova University. Like letting that random person into your Facebook circle, or -- and this happened in Frischmann's own life -- seeing your child come home from school with a fitness tracking device, which may seem like a win-win (you get free tech; the child might learn about healthy habits) until you consider what it means.</p><p>  ''You're conditioning a generation of kids to accept bodily surveillance by others without question,'' he says.</p><p>  Our uses of big tech are not only based on our own desires, but the desires of those who designed it. There's a frightening automaticity to them. (I accept. Click.) It's as if we're the robots.</p><p>  The irony -- or maybe it isn't? -- is that the demographic most susceptible to the influence of these technologies may also be the savviest about privacy. It was Danah Boyd who set me straight about this. Her book, ''It's Complicated,'' makes it clear that teenagers care deeply about their privacy. The difference is how they go about maintaining it. Some, for instance, just post everything. ''They obfuscate,'' she explains, ''through flooding.''</p><p>  They know that our minds are inefficient threshers, slow and lousy at separating wheat from chaff. But if you tell everyone everything, no one knows where to look or what matters.</p><p>  There is, of course, someone else in American life who regularly floods the zone, namely with his Twitter feed. He, too, has been able to divert and confound through this deceptively simple means. According to a recent Gallup poll, his approval rating is now at 46 percent. Nearly half of Americans don't think he's naked at all. They still think, against all odds, that the emperor is wearing clothes.</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

It is about to start happening right here in the UK. The Government's Online Harms White Paper proposes the most comprehensive regulation of online speech in the Western world. </p><p>The Government is placing legal responsibility on social media platforms, and any other websites with user-generated content, like search engines and web forums, to curate the content posted on their site and to eliminate what they loosely deem as 'harmful'.[1] This is being called 'duty of care' and will require all companies to make huge, costly changes to avoid fines, jail time, or even website blocks. It also calls for the creation of a new regulator, who will have the extraordinary power to decide what is harmful and when websites are failing to comply.These heavy regulations are prompted by what the Government has called 'harmful content' [2]on the internet, such as child exploitation, terrorist material, and promotion of suicide. But the White Paper goes much further by targeting a very wide array of 'harms' - raising the question: what is harmful? The White Paper itself qualifies harms necessitating regulation as legally clear and unclear[3]. For instance, harms with 'less clear legal definitions' include 'intimidation,' 'trolling,' and 'coercive behaviour'-- who will define the intimidating and coercive or trolling and how dependent will this qualification be on the majority power in Parliament? The threat to free speech is palpable. This proposal stands to name the government as the arbiter of acceptability online. But, what's more, the White Paper's proposals will block out small competitors from challenging Big Tech. The Adam Smith Institute's new paper, Safeguarding Progress: The risks of internet regulation[4], explains that this regulation is not only a serious threat to free speech, it is also disproportionately costly to start-ups, hurting competition and innovation.The 'duty of care' will require a large number of personnel, costly automated technologies, and sizeable funding for algorithm redevelopment. The capital required for this overhaul is conceivable for big companies like Google or Facebook, but start-ups just don't have the resources and could be crowded out of the market. No wonder Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg came out in support of state regulation of social media in his Washington Post op-ed.[5] In it, he writes that the government needs to play a role in defining and enforcing the limits of free speech. And what is he doing to uphold these proposed regulations? Companies like Facebook and Youtube are currently employing[6] thousands of people (Facebook currently boasts 50,000[7]) dedicated to monitoring posts and comments, deeming them as acceptable or unacceptable based on company policy. Small start-ups surely lack this capacity, and should regulations be mandated be imposed, they would be scrambling for resources. Furthermore, the rules companies like Facebook have been providing content monitors are complicated and often criticized (undoubtedly foreshadowing shady government rules). Facebook has over 1,000 pages[8] of guidelines dedicated to outlining what is 'unacceptable' speech. These guidelines are by no means comprehensive and are often contradictory. They are, most problematically, often subjective in interpretation. Many feel Facebook has taken too much control and is becoming authoritarian. Critics like Ben Shapiro[9] on the right, for example, feel that their content is being pushed out by a liberal agenda in Big Tech speech policies. Therefore, if the government provides the guidelines, fingers won't be pointed at Big Tech anymore, they'll be pointed at policymakers. But we must also remember that the actions of the technology companies do not sit in a bubble. The increased harshness of their speech policies - which are of course their own private business choices - come in the context of growing state pressure to censor the internet. 'PC culture' and the implications it has on companies' reputations come at the cost of overly cautious censorship. The choice looms ahead: either accept the offensive pockets of the internet or regulate Big Tech into stagnancy while pushing speech limitations to the point of censorship. Eliminating 'the offensive' comes at the steep cost of freedom of speech and innovation.

That\u2019s why the business of collecting, analysing and ringfencing it is making its way out of search, ecommerce and social media and into every other area of the economy \u2014 healthcare, finance, insurance, education, and beyond. </p><p>A Financial Times investigation last week showed that numerous healthcare websites, including WebMD and Healthline, have been sharing sensitive user data with big technology platforms, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Oracle and a number of smaller companies. In the US, there were revelations of Google\u2019s own foray into healthcare data collection and analysis, \u201c Project Nightingale\u201d, conducted with America\u2019s second largest hospital group. Google amassed personal medical records on tens of millions of patients, without notifying them or their doctors. </p><p>Google has also announced plans to move into another industry\u2014 the financial services business \u2014 partnering with Citigroup to offer current accounts. The bank will keep its brands on the product, but Google will mine the data. No prizes for guessing who will walk away with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-in-googles-quest-for-consumer-dominancebanking-11573644601\"> most value from that deal</url>. </p><p>Data mining and monetising has long been the core business model for platform technology companies; it is the reason that, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/innovation-and-growth/navigating-a-world-of-disruption\"> according to McKinsey Global Institute</url>, roughly 80 per cent of the world\u2019s corporate wealth now resides in just 10 per cent of companies, many of them in Silicon Valley. But surveillance capitalism is increasingly the business model for every firm, in every industry. </p><p>Google is keen to enter healthcare and finance in part because its competitors are already there. But Big Tech also has an edge in those sectors <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.futuremajority.org/uploads/report-for-future-majority-on-the-value-of-people-s-personal-data-shapiro-aneja-march-8-2019.pdf\"> relative to older players</url>. Tech companies are not necessarily subject to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act rules, which set privacy standards for traditional healthcare firms and insurance companies, or the penalties that come from breaching them. </p><p>Is it any wonder, then, that traditional healthcare providers are trying to find ways through the HIPAA loopholes themselves? Optum, a data company owned by UnitedHealth Group, has filed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/health-insurers-are-vacuuming-up-details-about-you-and-it-could-raise-your-rates\"> a patent application</url> for data scraping software that would pull healthcare info from Facebook and Twitter. Others have tried to get around the rules by \u201canonymising\u201d data, but some research shows algorithms can decode such data and reassociate it with individuals. </p><p>The bottom line is that the current regulatory system makes no sense at all in the age of surveillance capitalism. Traditional businesses have to abide by rules that newer ones don\u2019t. There is room for regulatory arbitrage, not just in healthcare but also finance, where \u201cfintech\u201d ventures are not subject to the same rules as banks. </p><p>Should we be allowing companies of any sort to collect and monetise data in sensitive areas such as health, financial information, employment and so on? Given the monopoly power, privacy breaches and threats to our political system that have resulted from mass data collection, it is a question worth asking. </p><p>But if we do continue to allow it, we need a level playing field. How can innovation happen when no start-up has a prayer of competing with a Big Tech firm, or large healthcare company, or data broker, that has already grabbed the bulk of user information in any given area and made it proprietary?</p><p>There is one elegant way to deal with the problem \u2014 a public databank, which would be regulated by democratically elected governments. They should decide who is allowed access to citizens\u2019 digital data, and for what purpose it can be collected. Individuals should also be able to see what companies do with their data, and transfer it as and when they like. All key existing civil rights and fairness legislation should automatically apply to such information.</p><p>Such a public data cache could be accessed by properly regulated private sector companies of all sizes. That\u2019s an approach being considered in parts of Europe, and in Canada, where the government of Toronto has decided that data gathered by Google for its Sidewalk \u201csmart city\u201d should be in a public bank. </p><p>One can imagine a public database having huge value (as it already does in China, albeit without the appropriate debate about usage). As societies shift towards embracing digital identity, and probably digital currency (hopefully regulated by democratic governments, rather than Facebook or the Chinese Communist party), public oversight and transparency could create huge productivity gains, innovations and more user trust. Citizens could vote on how their data is leveraged: they might allow it in healthcare research, for example, but reject it in areas that are purely consumer focused. </p><p>The point is that right now we have a system that is not only at risk of bias and fraud, but also completely unfair as a marketplace. That\u2019s not a sustainable situation for either business or liberal democracy. No wonder German chancellor Angela Merkel has called on Europe to create its own digital ecosystem. She\u2019s right that it is time we began asserting our digital sovereignty, not just for political reasons, but for economic ones as well. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/><br/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Rana Foroohar with\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/rana-foroohar\"> myFT</url> and on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/RanaForoohar\"> Twitter</url></emphasis></p><p>Letter in response to this column: </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Legal instruments exist to empower us data subjects / From Sylvie Delacroix and Neil Lawrence, The Alan Turing Institute</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-04d3614e078a11eaa984fbbacad9e7dd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHR-WVD1-DXP9-918G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"913\"/><timeReceived>5:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 17, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002OCP</classCode><className>UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It's also a privacy nightmare. Few people in Washington know more about the issue than Marc Rotenberg, a Georgetown Law Professor who serves as president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). In 1994, he founded the Washington D.C.-based organization to fight to protect individual privacy and civil liberties on the burgeoning computer network. At the time banks and other large commercial interests just beginning to establish an online presence. Today there's a lot more to worry about.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Newsweek\u00a0spoke with Rotenberg about what the emerging world of networked devices means for our privacy--and what protections, if any, exist to protect it. Edited excerpts:</p><p>Big Tech already collects a lot of data on their customers. What's to stop IoT manufacturers from collecting even more? In the absence of a privacy law, like the GDPR in Europe, American consumers who have purchased devices, door locks and thermostats are basically allowing these companies to collect and use their personal data.</p><p>Should we be concerned? It's been very interesting to watch the public response to recent news about Amazon's Ring, the Internet-connected doorbell. We've learned recently that Amazon has actually entered into arrangements with 400 police departments across the country that give police access to the video feed from the Internet-connected device on the front of the home. Most people who bought that product didn't know that that was a possibility and had no idea that was going on. When you have a video camera on the front of someone's home sending a feed to the police, who is most likely to appear in the feed? It's not some bad guy, it's actually going to be the residents. It's not just the privacy risk, it's also the risk of surveillance by law enforcement.</p><p>Any other examples? We've raised concerns about Google's Nest thermostat. There was actually an audio mic that could hear people, which created some Alexa-like functionality. Apparently they're now exploring adding facial recognition to the home thermostat. A device that most people understand in a pretty straightforward way, once connected to the Internet, creates some real risks. This isn't just something consumers need to worry about. The largest drone manufacturer in the world is DJI, a Chinese firm. The Department of Defense, after some testing, figured out that the manufacturer of the device could obtain remote access to the [drone's] imagery and audio. So the DOD suspended the purchase of so-called over-the-counter drones partly out of concern that the device was, itself, keeping information and transferring it to a third party.</p><p>What needs to be done? Much of our work has been to try to get Congress and the agencies to focus on these risks, because they're going to increase rapidly. But it's not just about privacy, it's [also] about public safety. If you have door locks that are connected to the Internet, someone else [can] hack your front door and go into your home. If you had a comprehensive privacy law, then any company that was collecting personally identifiable data would be limited in how it could collect the data, and how it could use the data. We need federal legislation to limit the collection and use of personal data. We need to adopt robust security standards to ensure that Internet-connected devices can't be hacked by others. We need to minimize data collections. And we need to make meaningful decisions about the risks associated with Internet-connected devices, involving automobiles, drones, and door locks. Even thermostats.</p><p>What are the prospects for that kind of regulation? The good news is that privacy, unlike a lot of other issues in Washington, is nonpartisan. So you do see Republicans and Democrats working together on legislation. There are about a dozen bills that have been introduced so far. But there hasn't been much movement. Part of the problem here is that we don't have strong advocacy for privacy within the Congress. And the Federal Trade Commission, which holds itself out as a privacy agency, really has not done enough to inform the Congress about the privacy risks from some of these devices.</p><p>Why isn't the market providing a solution, or a service, that shields people from this exposure? Seems like it would be a selling point. It's very difficult for people to evaluate the privacy risks. The technology rapidly changes and most of the companies are actually making their money off the data, not off the product. The business model makes it unlikely that consumers will be able to make meaningful choices.</p><p>What has to happen for Congress or the Federal Trade Commission to step up and take care of this problem? There has to be a willingness to recognize that market based solutions are not working. That's typically the argument that's made against legislation--\"let's find a market-based solution.\" But if consumers can't meaningfully evaluate the risks, then it's unlikely that they're going to provide incentives in the market that are going to produce better products.</p><p>What will it take to create the sense of urgency needed to enact protections? It's going to require more people understanding the risk of Internet-connected devices. It may take a few well-publicized episodes. I also have said that, in the United States, in addition to privacy legislation, we need a new agency that's tasked with addressing these emerging challenges. In Europe, where you have data protection agencies, one of the issues that they are studying and proposing regulations for is precisely the Internet of Things.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWEEK-NW1467559_2019-11-01.SIG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCS-WNX1-JC85-S003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">5774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newsweek Inc.

But we can take some comfort from the fact that Australia at least has this option in its regulatory toolkit; as King says, it's a feature that few other jurisdictions have.</p><p>Another tool Australia will soon have is a Consumer Data Right, which will first be applied to the banking sector <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/open-banking-a-blueprint-for-a-new-data-economy-20180209-h0vuxk\">as part of the Open Banking regime.</url></p><p>King says the Consumer Data Right, which will allow consumer to ask a financial institution to share their data with other banks or with the consumer themselves, has been designed with competition considerations in mind.</p><p>While the ability to move your data helps to prevent consumers being locked in to any one player in the market, the regime also creates shared data rights, by preventing consumers deleting their data.</p><p>This means a fin tech that has used data to make its products and services more competitive - by, for example, creating lending models that rely on pools of information - wouldn't risk having its model weakened by the deletion of large chunks of data.</p><p>King concedes the lack of a right to delete under the Consumer Data Right is likely to be contentious, and an on-going debate. Like so many things in tech, it will be a question of balancing benefits and drawbacks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Thomson</emphasis></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:j.thomson@fairfaxmedia.com.au\">j.thomson@fairfaxmedia.com.au</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1029761672</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXJ-XVX1-DY19-C1XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><timeReceived>02:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Like food manufacturers that load their products with sugar, Turkle says tech companies design their apps unethically. In the future, she hopes\u00a0we look back on this period as a gross misunderstanding of tech's power. </p><p>When Sherry Turkle looks at how obsessed people have become with their personal devices, she sees the traces of another public health epidemic: obesity. \"You have to eat, and people need to learn how to make good food choices,\" Turkle, an MIT psychologist and author of \"Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other,\" told Business Insider. She said the same is true for technology. Over the past couple decades, Turkle has become a leading voice in the ways technology has been tearing at our social fabric. Roughly 77% of Americans[1] own a smartphone, and the typical person touches\u00a0a phone\u00a0roughly 2,600 times[2] each day. Through polls, studies, and interviews, Turkle has concluded\u00a0this digital lifestyle has made us worse at making in-person connections. \"The way I like to put it is technology can make us forget what we know about life,\" she said. \"One of the things it's made us forget is that we need to tend to our relationships and other people and our own feelings.\"Personal tech is designed a lot like processed foodThe way much of technology is designed mirrors the food industry, Turkle said. Just as major food corporations sell processed foods that are loaded with added sugar and chemicals meant to keep people eating, big tech companies have been repeatedly accused of designing their apps to maximize the time people spend on them. Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, has seen the engineering tricks[3] firsthand. Features like autoplay videos, endless scrolling, and gamification encourage constant use, Harris has said. They help explain how people may plan to watch just one YouTube video and glance at Twitter but somehow end up spending a half hour on both.According to Turkle, the result is a society that craves its technology at all times, regardless of whether it interferes with social lives or goals, such as getting a restful night's sleep. In essence, the tech \u2014 like sugar-laden food \u2014 has become too powerful for human brains. The science of addictive behavior largely supports Turkle's claim. Sweet and salty sensations activate the same reward centers of the brain as red notification badges, vibrations, and dings. In each case, the brain releases a small amount of dopamine[4], a reward-seeking chemical that promotes repeat behavior. Without any oversight that regulates how tech companies design their apps, people are left to rely on willpower alone, Turkle said. Looking at the obesity epidemic, that strategy hasn't worked at all. The US obesity rate has been growing for the past decade \u2014 today, 36.5% of America[5] is clinically obese.The overuse of tech could become just as great a public-health issueAlready, the generation raised on smartphones is showing signs that overuse can be dangerous. Teen suicides now outnumber[6] teen homicides, and mental-health experts suspect phones are playing a role. Specifically, social media has led to greater isolation and loneliness since kids would prefer to be by themselves than socialize offline.\u00a0 Turkle said\u00a0the interviews she's conducted make her\u00a0think that parents are recognizing these deleterious effects and starting to\u00a0set boundaries for their kids' smartphone use. Her hope is that people will eventually look back at the decade-long period after 2007 \u2014 the year the iPhone was released \u2014 as a period of misguided obsession. \"I'm hoping that we're going to look at this [era] as a profound misunderstanding of what this technology could do,\" she said.NOW WATCH: Humans are just starting to understand this nearly invincible creature \u2014 and it's

The Christchurch Call involves a summit between the big social media platforms and a number of governments held in Paris May 15, as part of a reaction to the terrorist attack in Christchurch. The effort is led by New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern who, in partnership with the French President, is seeking new forms of content regulation on social media platforms. A day before the summit there was a 'Voices for Action' meeting between the Prime Minister and civil society groups, which we attended (see photo).Misdirected focusIGP understands the motivations underlying the Christchurch Call. </p><p>We sympathize with the people of New Zealand who were shocked and scarred by the murders and the killer's efforts to publicize his actions on the Internet. But the overwhelming emphasis on social media that this process is promoting seems to us to be badly misdirected. Preventing uploads or erasing the messages of terrorist groups from social media platforms is not the same as preventing terrorist acts or protecting innocent people from hate-inspired violence. And major social media platforms are not the only way terrorists communicate. A false equation between terrorists' use of platforms and terrorist acts seems to underlie much of the post-Christchurch dialogue, and it needs to be challenged. At this time, we should not be having a conversation dominated by the topic of social media regulation. We should instead be having a conversation about intolerance, racism, nationalism, and other tribalist or collectivist groups who are likely to carry out violent attacks. We should be discussing how to mitigate violence and what methods governments can use to better protect the potential victims of terrorist acts. In other words, actual terrorism and violence, and the groups that carry out such acts, should be the primary targets of our response, not the Internet. Instituting aggressive new forms of prior restraint on speech will not undo the crime that was done, nor is there any reason to believe that it will prevent new terrorist acts from happening in the future.The processAs a global Internet Governance process, the Christchurch Call falls short of best practice. It was set up as a government-led initiative designed to allow states to pressure private platform providers to execute a predetermined agenda of stronger and more extensive content controls. We appreciate the efforts of InternetNZ[1] to include civil society groups in the process; without their principled efforts, civil society would have been excluded entirely. As it is, some governments are still resisting civil society inclusion. The leaders of the process refused to share the text of the proposed Pledge until the last minute. It is still embargoed and civil society will not be included in the finalization of the text. It is not clear what will happen to the input provided today during the Voices for Action meeting[2], but is likely it will not have any impact on the current pledge text, which will be discussed and signed tomorrow during the Christchurch call meeting. The Christchurch call summit that will happen tomorrow (15 May) is co-moderated by Prime Minister Ardern and President Macron and only includes around 8 member states and big technology corporations. Prime Minister Ardern reassured us today that this is not the end of the process and we will have more opportunities to get engaged. But if the pledge text is not workable for most of us, in the future we will need to reopen the issue.  To her credit, Prime Minister Ardern seemed to understand the problems with the process and asked us how to lead it better in the future. We believe that multilateral processes are not acceptable for matters dealing with Internet governance issues. Even if they allow various stakeholder groups to participate they would never be on equal footing with the states. The New Zealand government has been very careful not to work with Human Rights violating member states of intergovernmental organizations, but that is not enough. Multilateral processes inevitably lead to including member states and excluding other nongovernmental actors. If this pledge is discussed in the UN general assembly, for example, we cannot exclude human rights-violating member states. Also, some countries that are obvious human rights violators are not recognized as such by their allies. Moreover, we need to consider that some developed countries have started to weaken the rule of law and democracy on the Internet. The New Zealand Prime minister is also going to meet with the King of Jordan about the Christchurch call. All in all, while the exclusion of human rights violators might not happen, inclusion of other actors can be achieved by giving a chance to nongovernmental actors other than big tech corporations to participate effectively and get involved with the negotiations. That way we can overcome the power imbalance and dilute the power of states that don't believe in the interoperable, open and globally connected Internet.The worst of both worlds? One problem with these initiatives is that it places free speech advocates in a netherworld between public and private authority. It is one thing if private platforms are empowered to moderate the content they publish. We might not like the choices they make but at least they are accountable in some ways to the market and their end users. People can abandon them if they go too far or become too arbitrary and there could be some diversity among platforms' policies. On the other hand, if governments attempt to censor directly, then in liberal democracies at least there are legal and due process constraints on what they can do. But when governments conspire to pressure platforms into restricting expression, we get the worst of both worlds. We get government action without the constraints of law; we get the efficiency and discretion of a private actor without the discipline of a competitive market. The Christchurch Call contains several references to the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). It seems the GIFCT is already doing [3]most of the things the New Zealand PM is asking for. Limiting the scope of the Call The pledge text refers repeatedly to 'online service providers' and calls upon them to commit to a range of actions, from prevention of uploads to content take down. We agree with the civil society statement [4] that the term 'online service provider' is too broad. These content regulation measures should not include all forms of Internet infrastructure. While social media platforms can be a better term we need to consider that these platforms provide messaging services . Does this mean that encryption might be endangered? Or more broadly could preventative measures endanger anonymity on the internet? The New Zealand government has assured us that the scope will be limited so that it doesn't include internet infrastructure nor encryption. Defining 'terrorism' and 'extremism' After the fact, when a terrorist act has happened or a terrorist group has been established, it is easier to categorize the act as a terrorist attack. Not all attacks are going to be as obviously terroristic as the Christchurch attack. Not all extremist content is going to incite violence or terrorism. And not all violent videos are going to be of the same nature as the Christchurch attack. The definition of terrorism depends who is defining it, what processes are used, and what political conflicts are involved. Therefore, national laws are not suitable for defining terrorism with global implications because they will be entangled with political and inter-state conflicts. There was a good suggestion during the meeting to define terrorism through a collaborative process including all governmental and nongovernmental actors so that we can reduce the political biases and lobbying that happens at the national level. Is elimination of 'terrorist, violent extremist content' the answer?The pledge seems to be putting forward the elimination of terrorist content as a way to fight terrorism. But elimination of content does not eliminate terrorism and violence. Quite the contrary, the availability of such content might help identify dangerous groups, or discourage people from getting involved with terrorists. The videos can be used in courts as evidence. While removal of explicit attacks videos might make sense these kinds of videos can be identified with certainty only after the attack. Prevention of production and dissemination of such content is an ex ante call that will affect freedom of expression. During the meeting some argued that it is promoting such content by algorithms that is problematic and content removal is not really an effective measure to stop amplification of such content.Global, open and secure Internet The pledge mentions that governments and tech corporations should adhere to the principles of an open and secure Internet. We find these reassurances unconvincing. If these principles are not adhered to we are going to take away the cross border nature of the Internet with multilateral initiatives. States routinely securitize their borders and hamper freedom of movement with arguments about countering terrorism and bringing security to their citizens. In multilateral processes about countering terrorism online, they might make similar arguments. During the meeting it was mentioned that social media can be used as a weapon. This is a dangerous proposition which can have unintended consequences. It is equating the social media problem with major national security issues. When national security is invoked, it can lead to overly restrictive approaches to expression. Collective action and the Internet community We learned a good lesson about Internet community cooperation during the Christchurch process. With the rise of multilateral initiatives and the ever-growing desire of states to regulate the internet, the community needs to work together and take collective action. Many parts of the community have had many collaborations with big technology corporations. Surely big technology corporations could have considered civil society input in this process. Moreover, just paying lip service to human rights by the governments is not enough. They need to show such commitment by fighting to include the Internet community in discussions and refrain from holding these talks in silos limited to big tech corporations. The civil society and some parts of the technical community succeeded to provide their input for this process. We would have liked to have seen the Internet Society take a more active role, however. Moreover, there were some civil society organizations that had access to the pledge text but did not leak it to their peers. We were asked during the meeting what processes are better to discuss issues related to the elimination of terrorist content online. Perhaps a new process which is a continuation of the collaboration effort InternetNZ set in motion might be more suitable than sporadic, closed or single stakeholder efforts. Overall the way to fight with multilateral processes that try to control the internet and have an open, secure and globally connected internet is to work together setting up processes and institutions.

A party that has long preached limited government, free expression and deregulation now has an administration pondering a politically motivated investigation of social media intended to justify a new wave of regulations.<br/><br/>Without question, social media companies Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as well as Google, the web's dominant search engine, have amassed great power in recent years and have had an almost unimaginable impact on politics and culture.<br/><br/>Facebook, a company founded in a dorm room 14 years ago, has recently been hiring linguists, programmers and artificial intelligence experts all around the world to keep its platform from becoming a medium of violence and spreader of lies.<br/><br/>Facebook is being used as a propaganda vehicle for both sides in a Libyan civil war and has been accused of aiding the cause of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Closer to home, it was used by the Russian government to spread misinformation leading up to the 2016 presidential election.<br/><br/>Twitter has long been the social media weapon of choice for conspiracy theorists and provocateurs such as Alex Jones. Jones is peddler of lies, most notably that the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 was a hoax. He also likes to wrap himself in constitutionalism, arguing that his First Amendment right to peddle sickening fantasies requires tech companies to provide an audience.<br/><br/>One by one, social media companies have come to the conclusion that they have no obligation to amplify his voice and that, as a matter of pure self-interest, they should not. Last Thursday, Twitter became the last major company to ban or greatly limit him from its platform.<br/><br/>Enter Big Government: GOP edition.<br/><br/>Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last week that he would convene a meeting with states to discuss ways that social media companies stifle free expression. This comes after some Republican members of Congress and the president complained that tech companies were stifling conservative voices.<br/><br/>We can think of nothing more repulsive to the values of the Constitution, or antithetical to Republican beliefs, than a government inquiry into the role of media in disseminating speech.<br/><br/>Do social media companies stifle some legitimate speech? Almost certainly they do. But if people have a beef with that, they should take it up with the various companies, not run to the government.<br/><br/>What they will find is that such tech companies restrict speech in a limited number of instances to protect the quality of their product, and thus to make more money. They don't want to be a garbage bucket of falsehoods or megaphone of hate speech because that would drive away their customers.<br/><br/>Social media companies are money-grubbing capitalists out to make a buck. Surely, the Republican Party can see the value in that, even in the age of Trump.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMREC-uscp-71vjgrxywyfmq9v0j13</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMREC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T80-HW11-JCW9-X3BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">317182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"527\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Wichita Falls Times Record News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Times Record News (Wichita Falls, Texas)</publicationName><edition>1, TimesRecordNews Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 13, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DFNA</classCode><className>RULE OF LAW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Explaining why the organization declined to take a position on the November ballot initiation, the group wrote: \"Some provisions of Prop. 24 are partial steps forward, so we don't oppose the initiative outright. But we don't support it either, because the forward steps are only partial, and must be weighed against the backward steps and missed opportunities.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Californian recommends a NO vote on Prop. 24. And we are not alone.</p><p> The diverse group of opponents already include two newspapers that seldom agree on anything \u2013 the conservative Orange County Register and the more moderate San Jose Mercury News. For more whiplash, consider the state Republican Party and the ACLU are joined in opposition, while the Democratic Party is neutral.</p><p> The Consumer Federation of California, Color of Change, California Small Business Coalition and Media Alliance oppose Prop. 24, while Consumer Reports is neutral, and Consumer Watchdog and Common Sense back it.</p><p> To say the 52-page proposition is mind-boggling to the average voter is an understatement. But to understand it, a bit of very recent history is needed.</p><p> In 2018, the Legislature passed and governor signed one of the nation's toughest privacy laws, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective in January. The law was so complicated and demanding on businesses that it took until August \u2013 just last month \u2013 for the rules to be finalized.</p><p> As voters now are asked to pass Prop. 24, businesses have not yet figured out how to comply with the 2018 law and consumers have not been given a chance to decide how effective it will be.</p><p> Clearly this is nuts. The 2018 law has its roots in an earlier initiative drive backed by Alastair Mactaggart. The real estate developer withdrew his initiative when the Legislature agreed to pass a law aiming to provide basically the same consumer protections.</p><p> The 2018 law requires certain businesses to tell consumers if they collect or sell personal information, and to notify them of their privacy rights. Consumers also can know what information has been collected and ask that it be deleted. Violations carry penalties of up to $7,500 if intentional, but it allows businesses to avoid penalties by addressing violations within 30 days.</p><p> Mactaggart now has returned to the privacy fight believing that a ballot initiative would lock in consumer protections that could not be easily weakened by the political whims of the Legislature.</p><p> What's troubling is that Mactaggart wrote Prop. 24 in consultation with the tech industry, negotiating with such giants as Google and Facebook. That's why the ACLU, among other groups, complains many of its provisions are favorable to big tech.</p><p> Some of these provisions include exemptions for \"loyalty clubs,\" such as supermarket cards that offer discounts in exchange for tracking purchases. It requires consumers to \"opt out\" of information sharing, rather than \"opting in.\" And those who do opt out may lose their discounts.</p><p> The balance of power between small tech companies and big tech is threatened by the elimination of the ability of businesses to \"cure\" a violation and avoid fines. Clearly a small company may not be able to afford defending itself against claims that would be \"no big deal\" to tech giants.</p><p> Prop. 24 also creates a new state regulatory agency led by political appointees charged with writing regulations to enforce controls on the use of consumer data by businesses. It would be empowered to conduct investigations and impose penalties. Critics fear this new agency would lack public accountability</p><p> .</p><p> Prop. 24 allows the Legislature to make changes to its requirements with a simple majority vote, but only \"to improve its operation, provided that the amendments do not compromise or weaken consumer privacy, while giving attention to the impact on business and innovation.\"</p><p> Huh? What does that even mean? Talk about vague.</p><p>California now has one of the toughest privacy laws in the nation. Let's give it a chance to show what it can do. Prop. 24 is not needed. Vote NO.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-107558e866bdad2714db1eb347ce684151eee5e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C2A9CEBD696 NWBKCA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S7-42G1-JBCN-40R2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"718\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TBC Media<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Here's what the president said:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\" He went on to insist Twitter's fact-checking is another example of big dogs in tech industry trying to \"silence conservative voices \u2026\"</p><p> A couple of things about this:</p><p> First, no president can unilaterally or legally regulate or shut down companies.

Here's what the president said:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\" He went on to insist Twitter's fact-checking is another example of big dogs in tech industry trying to \"silence conservative voices \u2026\"</p><p> A couple of things about this:</p><p> First, no president can unilaterally or legally regulate or shut down companies. That would require some action by Congress and/or the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p> Second, this is another demonstration of candidate Trump tossing raw meat \u2014 and in this particular case, seriously tainted meat \u2014 to his voter base, leaving it up to individuals how to react.</p><p>Twitter ordered fact-checking on Trump's claim that mail-in balloting is an invitation to cheat. Trump reacted in the typical manner, firing back at Twitter's decision makers in a tweet accusing them of \"interfering in the 2020 presidential election (and) as president I will not allow this to happen.\"</p><p> Seemingly a 180-degree turn from President Trump's attitude about the verified facts of 2016 election meddling by Russia, China and other nations' governments.</p><p> In a strange way, Trump made a valid, if not suspect point \u2014 recent presidential elections have for the most part been a mud bath of lies and misrepresentations, so in this president's opinion, anything he says, true or false, should not be corrected or fact-checked.</p><p> It is a dilemma newspaper editors have been dealing with for as long as America has had newspapers: Should readers' opinions be published, if the opinion is based on a known falsehood?</p><p> We get a lot of letters to the editor but it can be difficult, if not flat-out impossible to ascertain the truth and facts when stated in the context of a personal opinion.</p><p> An old newspaper adage is \u2014 when in doubt, leave it out, but that doesn't sit well with some letter writers, because they are sharing a personal thought or opinion, not a dissertation on the truth. That is the nature of opinion, which this page is all about.</p><p> It is a narrow path, as every newspaper editor knows, and sometimes a person's right to state an opinion is negated by the newspaper's responsibility not to misinform readers. Sometimes that misguided opinion is an opportunity for other letter writers to share their more educated voice, as was the case this week with a letter addressing one individual's concerns about masks and CO2. A number of writers did just that, and it's our job to facilitate that exchange.</p><p> As for fact-checking, it must continue to be part of a good news outlet's daily playbook \u2014 even if the \"facts\" being checked come from the president of the United States. Some might argue especially if it's coming from a president.</p><p> In the end, it is every legitimate news outlet's right and responsibility to not intentionally silence public voices, no matter if those voices come from liberals, conservatives or somewhere in between. Every American has a right to be heard.</p><p> This is going to be a tough few months until the November election. Not only will Americans be struggling through an ongoing pandemic, they'll be confronted with a barrage of negative political advertising.</p><p> It is the sort of political and environmental climate that frays nerves and shortens tempers. We can expect all kinds of weird things to happen.</p><p> This newspaper will be with you all the way. If you want to share your opinion, send us a letter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-9b97dbebad298d42fced4eb6580a2b6b1b5524a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28DAD44F930AE2 NWBKCA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601R-X9D1-JBCN-4512-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It's also how the tech giants have behaved in other ways.</p><p> With the release of its iPhone X, Apple joined Facebook and Google as companies pursuing facial recognition technologies that portend an end to old concepts of privacy. Despite their insistence otherwise, those firms and Microsoft have been called de facto silent partners to U.S. intelligence agencies' attempts to vacuum up information from people around the world without their consent. And despite all the benefits they bring, Facebook and Google are villains to both sides of the culture wars.</p><p> They're accused of enforcing left-wing speech codes on acceptable commentary and enabling the far right to spread election-skewing \"fake news\" and bigotry. ProPublica provided a new example Thursday when it showed Facebook provided tools for advertisers to reach anti-Semitic hate groups.</p><p> Now the backlash may be moving beyond rhetoric. In June, European Union regulators slammed Google with a record $2.7 billion fine for seeking to profit by manipulating online search requests.</p><p> In the U.S., the traditional American fear of giant corporations has begun to manifest itself. The same impulse that led to the break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&amp;T in 1982 is flaring as awareness grows of Google's and Facebook's hegemony in advertising and the realization sets in that Amazon may destroy more American jobs than China.</p><p>Google's troubles continued with an Aug. 30 report in The New York Times that Eric Schmidt of Google's parent company Alphabet had pressured the New America Foundation think tank - which Google has supported financially - to push out scholar Barry Lynn and his Open Markets research team. Lynn's sin? Publicly applauding the EU's fine against Google. Such bullying will haunt Google - at least if the anti-monopoly backlash plays out according to the traditional American script.</p><p> But that's a huge if. Standard Oil and AT&amp;T had monopolistic control of gasoline supplies and telephone service, respectively - major bills most American households pay. Google's and Facebook's chief services are addictive - and free. (Except for all the data they collect about you.)</p><p> Still, as everyday life makes clear, Americans are stirred up. The Trump and Sanders wings of the two largest political parties want and expect dramatic change. If they get their way, the most powerful forces in this country are likely to feel the fallout. And that is a category that very much includes Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-2756368</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897DB50F347E1 NWBKMA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHM-0X51-DXVP-V2DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Milford Daily News<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Children may transmit the virus after all. The economy contracts sharply. But first a breath of fresh air: innovative ways that people have moved activities outdoors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you\u2019re looking for a pick-me-up \u2014 to be inspired by human ingenuity in the midst of a whole lot of bad news \u2014 today\u2019s newsletter is for you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I recently asked readers to tell us about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">innovative ways that people were moving activities outdoors</url>, where the coronavirus spreads less easily than it does indoors. Hundreds of you responded.</p><p>My colleagues and I were energized by the ideas. They made us want to move more of our own activities outdoors \u2014 and made us hope that more companies, government agencies and other organizations take similar steps.</p><p>One of our favorites will resonate with many parents, children and teachers: It\u2019s an attempt to hold school in a way that\u2019s both safe and in person.</p><p>Aspire Scholar Academy is a once-a-week school in Provo, Utah, for students ages 12 to 18 who are otherwise home-schooled. It usually operates out of a church, but the school\u2019s leaders were not persuaded that indoor classes would be safe this fall, even if everybody were wearing masks.</p><p>So a school vice president traveled to local Costcos and bought 33 canopies. Students will attend classes under them, on the church grounds. Teachers will use a public-address system.</p><p>\u201cThe kids don\u2019t want Zoom,\u201d Vanessa Stanfill, a member of the school\u2019s board, says. \u201cThey want to be together.\u201d The school has told parents that students will need sunblock and (eventually) snow pants, and it plans to incorporate the surrounding nature into lessons.</p><p>A small, once-a-week school obviously has an easier task moving classes outside than a large public school. But before you dismiss Aspire as irrelevant, remember that many New York City schools moved classes outdoors during the tuberculosis outbreak of the early 1900s. (A recent column, by The Times\u2019s Ginia Bellafante, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">has some wonderful old photos</url>.)</p><p>Among the other innovative ideas we heard from readers:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A ceremony for new American citizens held outside a federal courthouse in Boise, Idaho.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A cabaret troupe in Grand Rapids, Mich., that drives to people\u2019s homes and puts on performances in driveways and yards.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A California psychotherapist seeing clients in a forest, with chairs eight feet apart.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A Pennsylvania company that sells gazebos and that now holds staff meetings outdoors in \u2014 where else? \u2014 a gazebo.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">We\u2019ve posted a longer list, with photos, here</url>.</p><p>THREE MORE BIG STORIES</p><p>1. Kids and the coronavirus</p><p>A new study suggests that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">children can carry at least as much of the coronavirus in their noses and throats as adults</url> \u2014 suggesting they are likely to spread the virus, as well.</p><p>\u201cKids don\u2019t get visibly sick very often, and even when they do, only rarely go on to have complications or to die,\u201d my colleague Apoorva Mandavilli explains. \u201cBut many people have \u2014 wrongly \u2014 extrapolated this to mean that kids don\u2019t get infected.\u201d They do, she added, and they may also pass the virus to others, which is only logical: \u201cKids are adept at spreading other kinds of viruses, including the flu, so why not this one?\u201d</p><p>As usual, it will be important to see if more research confirms these findings. But the study offers one more reason that reopening schools will be complicated. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">This Times map of the U.S.</url> shows where reopenings would create the greatest risks.)</p><p>In other virus developments:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Because of pandemic shutdowns, the U.S. economy shrank in the second quarter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">the fastest rate since at least the 1940s</url>. And <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">today\u2019s looming expiration</url> of expanded jobless benefits has created a new risk for the economy.

Cain had posted <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">a photograph of himself</url>, without a mask, attending President Trump\u2019s indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla., last month; it is unclear when he contracted the virus.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>2. Trump\u2019s empty threat</p><p>Trailing in the polls and facing bad news on the economy and the virus, President Trump on Thursday suggested <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">delaying the Nov. 3 election</url>. Nothing in the Constitution gives presidents that power, and other Republicans shot down the idea.</p><p>I asked Jonathan Martin, a Times political reporter, how to make sense of the threat. His answer:</p><p>\u201cWe should not dismiss, or even minimize, a sitting president who suggests delaying the election. But it\u2019s important to view Mr. Trump\u2019s remark in the context of his longstanding refusal to acknowledge failure, a pattern that predates his entering politics. Should he lose, he will likely seek a rationale. Any uncertainty about the balloting affords him an opening to raise questions about the election\u2019s legitimacy, regardless of whether he challenges the results.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">In a Times Op-Ed</url>, Steven Calabresi, a conservative law professor who opposed Trump\u2019s impeachment last year, called the tweet \u201cfascistic.\u201d</p><p>3. Climate change victims</p><p>In the latest disaster to hit Bangladesh, torrential rains have flooded at least a quarter of the country, inundating nearly a million homes. Two months ago, a cyclone slammed Bangladesh\u2019s southwest, while a rising sea has submerged villages along the coast.</p><p>Scientists project that severe flooding will intensify as climate change increases rainfall in Bangladesh. It\u2019s a story that reflects the unequal burden of climate change\u2019s effects: The average American is responsible for 33 times more planet-warming carbon dioxide than the average Bangladeshi. \u201cThose who are least responsible for polluting Earth\u2019s atmosphere are among those most hurt by its consequences,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">Somini Sengupta and Julfikar Ali Manik write</url>.</p><p>Here\u2019s what else is happening</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The N.B.A. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">resumed last night with two thrilling games</url> after suspending its season more than four months ago.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>\u201cYou want to honor John?\u201d Barack Obama said in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">a eulogy for the civil rights icon John Lewis</url>. \u201cLet\u2019s honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for.\u201d</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Six years after a white police officer killed Michael Brown, a Black teenager, in Ferguson, Mo., another investigation has come to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">the same conclusion as the first</url>: The officer should not be charged.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Lives Lived: Martha Nierenberg was a multilingual biochemist, an entrepreneur (co-founder of Dansk housewares) and a lead plaintiff in an art-restitution case that reaches back to a wealthy family of Budapest Jews. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/morning-briefing\">She died at 96</url>.

But it would be very easy, if you went in expecting fireworks or action or special effects \u2014 all staples of sci-fi today \u2014 to end this movie feeling dissatisfied.

Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Presentation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IAN ALTON ZAFFINO, MD AND SENIOR ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO. INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Good afternoon. I'm Ian Zaffino, I'm the equity research analyst that covers Outfront Media. I have an outperform rating on the company. I have a $32 price starter. The company just reported earnings the other day, very, very strong -- raised their guidance, beat numbers, so I guess something like the 20th quarter in a row that they've beaten their guidance. So pretty impressive run by you guys. And this quarter was particularly notable for its strong growth. What sort of driven that? And maybe just give us a little bit of color on the quarter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JEREMY J. MALE, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, OUTFRONT MEDIA INC.: Yes. Thanks, Ian, for the introduction, and good afternoon, everyone. Yes, we have our numbers out, Monday evening after close. And in Q2, we had a revenue increase of just under 15%, similar increase in EBITDA or OIBDA and a $0.25 increase in the FFO. So strength right the way across the business, actually. Our revenues splits around about 2/3 in billboard and 1/3 in transit.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>So for example, here we have the MBTA in Boston. In New York, we have the MTA. And the relative growth rates were just less than 10% in our billboard business and actually in the high 20s in our transit business. So very strong across the board. And then, if you look at the advertiser base, national advertising went up 20%, and local was up around 10%. So great growth there, also.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>And I guess what's pleasing is that if you sort of look at the last 12 months, in Q3 last year, we were up around 6% and then in Q4, double digits, we were double digits in Q1, and then double digits in top line in Q2. So we're feeling very positive. And we also guided towards double digits in Q3 of '19.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>So yes, good set of numbers and I think it's fair to say that we're doing well, but the industry is also doing well, also. The industry was up 6-and-change in Q1. I think Q2 won't be strong as ours, but it's going to be nicely up. So there does seem to be something secular going on also for the industry, which is really pleasing.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Right. So I think the industry is taking share from traditional media. You guys seem to be also taking share. Maybe just get in your business model a little bit more as far as what makes you Outfront? Where do you guys specialize? Where you're strong? Your transit is very good. Is it your push to digital? What sort of separates Outfront from the pack?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: So if you look at our business, one thing we are is, we are very, very top DMA-focused. So our top 15 markets, which are all within the top 20 DMAs, account for 80%-plus of our revenues. So very much focused towards that top DMAs. What's interesting about that is that when -- national advertisers typically want to be in those top DMAs. So we tend to disproportionately benefit on the plus side when national advertising is strong. So that is the one key differentiator for us. Say for example, for Lamar, who tend to -- has got a wonderful business, but it's just a different type of business that tends to be smaller market focus. So that's one differential. The second differential is that, as I said, we have a very big transit-advertising business. So we have the big franchises, Boston, New York, Washington, Miami, Los Angeles, once again, all top, top markets. And transit at the moment is going through quite a significant digitization process. So you can see it here, if you step out and go into South Bay or whatever, you can see it as you ride the MTA in New York. So we're getting great growth from transit in digital. And we're continuing, obviously, to digitize our billboard footprint. So right now, less than 3% of our assets are generating -- actually, in second quarter this year, over 20% of our revenues, we -- our digital revenues increased by 40% year-on-year in Q2. So total digital as a proportion of our revenues went from 17% to 21% in that 12 months. So we are absolutely a digital growth story right now.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. And can we just delve into that a little bit more? The growth in digital, is that driven by capacity? Is it driven by yield? Maybe give us kind of the components of that growth.</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: Yes. Absolutely. So in transit, for the most part, it's about -- it's been about capacity because we've been building out our footprint. This time last year, we only had a handful of signs on the MTA, and now we've got whatever it's 3,000 signs on the MTA. And our digital transit doubled over that period, reflecting that increase in capacity.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>In the billboard business, we have round numbers. We have a 1,000 digital billboards, and we are adding on about 100 or so a year. We had to do 120, 130 this year. So we're getting growth from that, but we're also seeing yield increases also. So both is the short answer, but the majority of it is being driven by that new transit footprint. And as I implied, the great thing about digital investments that we're making, there's actually a spillover halo effect to our static inventory because the static business is going very well as well.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. And I know you said, I think it's 100 to 150 new digital boards per year. What's the gating factor in there? Can you increase that if you want to? And what sort of the actual whitespace opportunity for that conversion effort?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: So let's think about digital. As I said our revenue is around 20%. We've got about 1,000 boards converted. And both of our competitors -- have about 25,000 boards in total by comparison. So our competitors are both north of that. We got into the game a bit late actually. As you probably remember, we were part of CBS up until 1994, and we were underinvested for years. So we've been playing catch-up.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>When you -- if you look to other out-of-home markets in the world, where the one that, obviously, know well is the U.K., the U.K. digital revenues are now over 50% of the market. So if you look to the U.S., it's less than 30%. So I still think we've got a long runway to go in terms of converting digital.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>For us with our billboards, the gating factors are two things, really. Firstly, you've got to get zoning in order to -- and we have 100 people across the country who are working with different zoning regulations in different counties or different municipalities. And that's not a slamdunk. It's hard work to get a sign. Sometimes you have to get 1 digital, maybe you have to take 6 static faces down or we have to do -- provide some other public service or we have to pay significant sums to the city. There's a range of different ways that we might achieve that. But it's a piece of work. So that's one gating factor.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>And the second is that we look to make a 20% IRR on the digital investments that we're making. And within that IRR, we also include potential loss from static revenues onto that digital board, because digital is still -- it's sought after, you can be far more creative, you can be far more timely and it does attract dollars. We just need to make sure that we're not eating our own lunch. So you have to think about the demand potential within a given market.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>So you put those 2 factors together and let's say, we've been coming out in the hundred range, we're trying to push that out, we're working even harder on development to get that towards 150. And who knows, maybe as we go forward, we might say if we push it off from there.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. And turning back to transit, you guys have been very successful defending some of our contracts, the New York City one was very successful. I think you've also had some new wins as well. There's another big out there in Chicago. Can you touch upon where we are there? What the time line is and what should we should expect?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: Actually. Yes. So on the win side, Boston was a win here 3 years ago. This time last year, we added about in San Francisco and so those are the 2 significant wins. The CTA have a tender right now. The timing is for a submission kind of around the end of August time, and typically it takes them 2 or 3 months to come to a decision-making process. As we've submit a tender, you can understand that I probably wouldn't want to talk about it much beyond that right now other than to say, we have a great footprint to transit advertising. I think that we -- it would be a very nice system to have because I think it would mix blend -- mix and blend very well with the assets that we've already got. And we'll be bidding for it keenly.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. And just if we can stay on that for one more minute is, what is your pitch to these transit authorities? And why have you been so successful?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: So our pitch has very much been about tax. In others words, we have the screen technology. We have screens that we believe have metrics about them that are better than other people's. We then have the ability to communicate with those screens in a very automated way.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>So here in Boston, we control all of the MBTA's traffic information. So if says next train 1 minute, I mean, that's going through us. I mean all of that is coming through us. We're -- similarly, we control all of their alert systems. So we're becoming, if you like, a tech partner on the one hand.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>And the second piece is, guys, we have got the biggest national sales force in the U.S. We've got a great local sales operation here. We'll sell you more dollars, because one way or other, most of these franchises ultimately come down to a revenue share or the significant number of our contracts all have revenue shares within them. And so we believe not only can we give you the tech piece, we can also give you better revenue stream over the next 5, 10 or 15 years whatever the length of the contract. So that's the principle two pieces of the pitch.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. And you talked a lot about tech. If we're going to talk about other tech that you guys have kind of in house right now, you're developing some better attribution systems. Tell us how you're doing that? And how that kind of manifests itself once it gets rolled out? Does that mean higher CPMs? Does this mean higher yield? Like, how do we think about that?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: The industry is going through a big change right now, a couple of big changes. One is that in terms of inventory in the field, we're converting a lot, so we have that incremental opportunity to grow. And then the second piece that the industry is just starting to benefit from is actually trading our inventory in a much more automated way. For the most part, we're still selling our inventory as we've sold it for the last 30 years. Really, it's -- not much has changed. We're now just starting to get to a point whereby we're beginning to trade our media programmatically. So the number of DSPs out there that we could and have some put up -- put our inventory on.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>We are also ourselves creating our own platform, which will be the ability for an agency and advertiser to have a user interface within their offices go on, search our inventory by audience, availability and then add to basket and buy. So it's very different. And the central piece of that is a DMP that is based on information derived from carrier data. So if you think about a bunch of devices going past our board, we can pretty much see in real-time what's going on in front of our boards at any one time. So that's really valuable data and insight that we can now provide to advertisers. So if we can say that, that particular board skews index is highest of these boards for one particular micro audience that you might be after.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>And we're not to the -- by the way, this is all within the boundaries of privacy and everything else. We only look at bundles of -- actually, we're interested in who you are, it's just bundles of device IDs rather than anything else. So as soon as you know that, if you think about it, if you what's happening, you've got a device going past a board that says turn left for McDonald, it's pretty easy to find out you actually did it. And since they had that board, is that any different from when they didn't have it? So what's the incremental effect? What is the attribution? And we work on all sorts of different attribution models to tune in or online or whatever happens to be.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>And we're -- that -- with AleHorn is really now just coming to that party. That party of data and insight attribution of automation and programmatic. And what I find exciting about that is that the growth the industry is achieving at the moment, as we say, we're growing market share within the media market, we've only just started to tap that piece. And I think that will layer on a further stream of incremental growth for as we go forward. So it's a very, very exciting time for the industry.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>I commented on our call on Monday that after the hugely successful leadership over nearly 30 years of Nancy Fletcher, who's run the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, she is retiring at the end of -- this year-end. And it's sort of no coincidence that her replacement is currently with the IAB, the Internet Advertising Bureau. So she's -- and that's -- she's coming with the skills and knowledge of exactly what I was just talking about.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>One -- and just maybe sort of expand on that a little bit further, our local sales have been doing really well for a couple of years now. And as I said last quarter, there are up 10 and before that it was round about the same. And we used to go out and sell billboards, as you'd expect. And we sort of don't now. We go out and try to be a sort of a media consultant to try and understand really what a client is trying to do. And then in terms of, is it -- what is it, shifting awareness or shifting boxes or shifting footfall or blah, blah, blah.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>So we have that discussion and part of that solution will almost certainly be billboards or transit or whatever needs to be. But also we'll then talk about, okay, how can we -- can we overlay mobile on top of that? We've sold nearly 4,000 mobile campaigns whereby through some sort of geofencing or whatever, we'll layer that on top. So we'll geofence a billboard, we'll geofence a store or whatever so, we can offer that.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>And then we'll offer -- we have a big social department now, so how can we max out your campaign on social? We have a social influence of products. So we go outside and hire influencers to work with them to basically get all of their copy or whatever through Instagram immediately. And so we can make sure that you're getting hundreds of thousands or millions, depending on who the advertiser is, incremental impressions, all around (inaudible), all based around an out-of-home campaign. So it's a different from Jack the sign seller, which we were a few years ago.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. And I guess, as you look at the audience analytics, the attribution, a lot of your growth in outdoor has been taking share, but a lot of that has been coming not just from your traditional cadre of advertisers, but also some of the newer industries that really embraced outdoor advertising. But we definitely have some glaring gaps on the category side that outdoor hasn't really penetrated as much or you're underindexed, whether it's CPG, television. Do you see those categories starting to embrace outdoor advertising more now that you have some of the analytics, you have some of the attribution and they know what they are buying? Or -- how long does that process take?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: It's interesting because when you look at the share of outdoor here in the U.S., it's around about 4.5% of all media and that compares roughly to 7.5% on a worldwide basis. So we under index here by quite a bit. Then when you drill into that 4.5%, actually most of that is driven by local because we're still more than -- around 65% local. So actually when you get into national advertisers, it's more like 2%. So we've got a long way to go, if you think only 2% of dollars on average are coming to us.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>We certainly over index in tech, media, entertainment, TV. I mean we're it's -- if you look to the likes of Apples and Netflix or whatever, they're spending more than 10% of their dollars out of home against that 2%. So we have some wonderfully strong advertisers. And what gives us a terrific sort of feeling about our medium is that all of the big tech brands are supporting our medium. So we have Facebook and Google and Hulus of this world.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>And increasingly, a number of the new DTC brands like the DoorDashes and the Seamless and Caspers, et cetera. So we're doing extremely well there and over indexing. But you're right, there's some traditional categories where we are really under indexing and always have, CPG with somewhere like 0.3%. I mean it's just like almost nonexistent. Even with motor you think the motor category would make sense. We -- particularly you have a billboard, which is a beautiful way to have a sort of great [factual] or creative treatment of your car. And you got a vehicular audience if you're on the highways. I mean why wouldn't you be all over it? And so auto has been difficult category for us.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Telecom, for us, actually is lower now than it has been before. For us, it's only a 3% category, but it's has been going backwards for the last couple of years. I do think that when you look at some of the CPGs, you look at a PNG, they have always -- they've had their econometric modeling, they've always just been huge supporters of network TV, and that's it, and that's it and that's it. And changing habits is hard, but I do think to your point is that we're starting to get to a point where we've got the metrics, we've got the right things to go on talk to them and make a really strong pitch now that we didn't have before. So that's part of that incremental layer of opportunities I think that I referred to earlier on.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. Turning to financials now, you typically give full year guidance and usually give a quarter out guidance and you're now calling for double-digit top line growth in the third quarter. But you are facing some pretty tough comps in the fourth quarter. That's when you started to really pick up your growth. I think you're facing low teens type of growth comps. How do you feel about the fourth quarter? And also how do you feel about the third quarter? How much is booked in the third quarter? And then how do you feel at the fourth quarter?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: So in Q3, we guided to roundabout double digits on our call earlier this week. And that's versus about a 6% growth comp last year. So it tends on the safe.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>And we, obviously, wouldn't guide it if we didn't feel comfortable with it. And right now, we would have 90% of Q3 already laid down. We've probably got bit in the back half of September to close out and then we're done.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>When we look to Q4, you're right. Growth last year was 12.7% in Q4 last year. So that's a big hurdle. Now we never guide beyond the quarter that we're in, but I think the fact that we just notched up our, for second time this year, our AFFO guidance from high-single into the double-digit range gives you some assurance that as we look forward, we feel pretty confident about life.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. And you mentioned the AFFO increase, we're looking for about $330 million. That's a lot of free cash flow. Can you give us an understanding what your priorities for that are, as far as M&amp;A, deleveraging, et cetera?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: So I guess the first point is that we're -- we have the 90% of operating income to dividend out. If you look back over last 2 or 3 years, that's -- our yield, when our stock was trading, it certainly shouldn't have been -- the yield was up, whatever, 7%, 8% range, and that's come back down into the 5% range. And yes we'll be thinking about that as we go forward because we would want a yield to remain competitive over time given -- also taking into account other requirements that we might have.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>We continue to want to invest in digital. We do that with -- but we -- all of the organic opportunities that we can find, we do them all. If they make the right IRRs, then we would wish to continue to do that.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>We want to certainly keep our hand in the tuck-in acquisition markets. We've done, I think, 2 in the last sort of 3 to 6 months. And we've actually used a little bit of equity from the ATM along the way to fund those. I think it's fair to -- and then we've got the MTA build-out, which will low ultimately -- when we get the investments back that we're making on behalf through recruitment and revenue share we would have gotten then. We've got that to fund over the next couple of years and that's an incremental $250 million. So we're going to be looking at all of those pieces and trying to thread the needle through that so that we continue to be attractive to our shareholders, we can continue to participate in M&amp;A and as we wish to do, and absolutely continue to build out our current growth opportunities.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. I have more questions, but I'd like to open it up to the audience, so if anyone has any questions and then we can circle back with more of mine.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. Can you talk a little bit about, going back to digital and pricing and the ability to buy the end of [boards] display, do you see dynamic pricing happen where a particular display at 5:00 in government center would generate a certain number of eyeballs? And then getting the pricing for that incremental eyeball, where are we in terms of that side of pricing?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: Yes. Thanks for the question. It's a good question. One of the reasons that we are going down our -- the industry now has great data through the industry body Geopath. But one of the reasons that we are going sort of beyond that is because we want to effectively have real-time data. For the most part, that's about our transit business.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>So if you think about the MTA, we're building out 50,000 screens across the MTA both on train and within the platform environment. And we would like to able to serve out basically based on kind of whose there at the time. In its simplest form, we'd really like to be able to sort of have like drive time at the end of the -- sort of morning rush hour and then home drive time kind of offering as we go forward. And it's quite possible that over time we might have -- we will, in a private market, we might have fixed price in there and then we might in the middle of the day on certain lines we might have some sort of RTB mechanism in that for people to come in and actually bid for eyeballs. So the answer is, yes, it's something that we see down the road. We don't quite have the tech to do it just yet, but we're not too far away.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: (technical difficulty)</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>As far as M&amp;A, I guess the market is 65% is owned by, call it, the top 3, 3.5 people, I guess, if you want to include that. How much of the remaining unconsolidated boards out there are you interested in? What's sort of like the addressable market of our kind of acquisition targets?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: The answer is that there's enough in there to keep us interested and busy for a while. But implicit within that also is the fact that not all of that tail is of interest to us. We are very -- we are absolutely committed to that sort of top 20, top 25 DMA strategy. And the reason for that, it goes back to the 2% of national that I talked about. I think that, that is going to be the fastest-growing piece of the out-of-home industry as we move forward. And I think that those advertisers, those top 200, top 300 advertisers, are basically going to be wanting to buy in those top 20, 25 DMOs disproportionately. And I think that's what we're seeing right now. I firmly believe that, that trend is going to continue. So I won't be competing for assets in that very small DMAs.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>The other thing that we're looking to do and we have done a couple is actually where it makes sense, swap assets as well. So where we have boards in DMAs that make sense, we swap them for boards in DMAs that do. And did one of those here in Boston about 18 months ago, and it's been a great part of our billboard growth here in this market.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. And I know one of your foreign competitors is interested in getting into the U.S. They've expressed that on conference calls. Any color you can add to that as far as how to think that plays out?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: As you probably know, Ian, I worked for said competitor for 13 years. So I know the company pretty well. I've been asked that question a lot when I was wearing a slightly different hat.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>So look, who knows, they've been talking about getting bigger in the U.S. for a while. The only way you can become a significant player in this market is to effectively acquire one of the significant players. You can do it roll up, you can do it organically. So who knows? Maybe they will, maybe they won't. I would guess at any point in time, the relative trading multiples are going to be important. And just, I guess, the relative performance of both businesses at the time and it's probably not easiest year or so for JCD right now, obviously, with the slowdown in Asia, et cetera, where they have a big bit of business. But who knows? We'll wait and see.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. Great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: If you look at the European market, in terms of where it is in out-of-home, and Europe is definitely going through a period of softness, and I was curious, in terms of the relative performance of out-of-home in Europe, given the economic sort of weakness and relate that back to the U.S. in terms of sensitivity, if we go through further economic weakness, how -- compare and contrast and also in a sense provide a little bit of insight as how economically sensitive you are at this point?</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: So when you look at Europe right now, it is -- it's a little bit spotty. Interestingly, the out-of-home market in the U.K., even with all the uncertainty around Brexit, is still doing pretty well right now. I think it was up somewhere like 6% in the second quarter. So it's doing fine.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>We touched just before we came into this meeting, in the Great Recession, GDP down 5%, media down 15%, out-of-home down 15% roughly, whereby local was down a little bit less than that and national was down a little bit more than that. That was in simple terms that was it. If you then sort of just think about what -- as I would, just walk -- unless -- look, it's always dangerous trying to sort of look to future and make assertion. But my belief is that any sort of slowdown here would be more likely to be in the kind of like 2 or 3 quarters of slightly negative GDP. And I believe that if that were the case, then out-of-home, given the fact that we're gaining share right now, I think we could outperform -- continue to outperform media.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>So if all media went from being up whatever it was 4.5% or 5% to say more like flattish, I think maybe the media -- maybe us as a median could still get 1 or 2 points of growth. And then when you think about our front in particular, particularly while we're going through this build-out phase in digitization process, I would like to think that, that could give us another couple points of growth. So as I say, I'm not making predictions here or promises, but I would expect that the industry and Outfront could weather it maybe better today than it would have done a few years ago.</p><p>IAN ALTON ZAFFINO: Okay. I think we're out of time. So I appreciate this. This was very helpful. Thank you.</p><p>JEREMY J. MALE: Thanks for questions.

It was a regret during my term to see HKEX lose Alibaba. I hope the listing reform announced on Tuesday will bring eight or 10 companies like Alibaba to list in Hong Kong,\" Chow said at his last media briefing after the AGM.</p><p>Alibaba decided to list in the US rather than Hong Kong, where its dual-class share structure was not accepted under rules at the time. The loss of the listing - worth US$25 billion - was met with disappointment in Hong Kong and was the spark for the debate over listing rules.</p><p>In what it billed as the biggest listing reform to the exchange in 25 years, HKEX said on Tuesday that from next week it would allow companies with dual-class share structures to list. Such structures are favoured by many tech firms because they allow founders and key managers to keep control even if they hold only minority stakes.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2142536/hong-kong-exchange-accept-listing-applications-under-new-rules\">Hong Kong exchange to accept listing applications under new rules from April 30, chief says</url></p><p>Chow said that he would count the listing reform as among his three major achievements, alongside HKEX's takeover of the London Metal Exchange in 2012 and the setting up of the two Stock Connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges that allowed cross-border trading of Hong Kong and mainland China equities.</p><p>\"HKEX has developed from a local stock market to a global exchange with multiple asset classes,\" Chow said.</p><p>The exchange's benchmark Hang Seng Index closed on Wednesday at 30,328.15, up more than 30 per cent from the 20,677.16 when Chow took office on April 24, 2012.

But according to feedback from a panel of executives consulted by just-style, disruptions also present huge opportunities for retailers and brands to rethink their business models and explore new ways of working \u2013 especially when it comes to using new technologies and data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Marc Compagnon, executive director &amp; group president, Li &amp; Fung:<br/> The unpredictable geopolitical environment will be a major challenge facing our industry in 2019. The US-China trade war is on a lot of retailers' minds and has taken a few turns now, with costs starting to rise. Apparel companies must act fast and diversify production strategies to position themselves to absorb any shock from possible trade conflicts. With a global network of 15,000 suppliers in over 40 markets, Li &amp; Fung is well positioned to help our customers diversify their sourcing portfolios to offset any impact from the trade war.</p><p>Trade aside, another challenge facing the apparel industry is keeping up with the pace of change with consumers. I think in 2019 we'll continue to see the retail sector pushed to the limits in keeping ahead of new technologies, the online effect, pressures from fast fashion retailers, increased complexities in the omnichannel world, and the growth of data. But these disruptions present huge opportunities for retailers and brands to rethink their business models and explore new ways of working, and engaging with their consumers.</p><p>Rick Helfenbein, president &amp; CEO, American Apparel &amp; Footwear Association (AAFA):<br/> After ten tumultuous years, most of the retail and apparel/footwear sectors had finally seen the light of day by early 2018. The industry survived a string of bankruptcies, adjusted excess retail space, learned how to sell online, and welcomed the millennial shopper with open arms.</p><p>Just as relief was settling in, the next retail tsunami was unleashed by President Trump's tariff war with China. This single disruptive tariff action has put much of our industry in a tailspin. We now reside in uncharted supply chain territory given 41% of US apparel and 72% of US footwear originate in China. The mere threat of import tariffs \u2013 even more than the actual implementation \u2013 has left our industry in a difficult position.</p><p>Facing what can likely be characterised as the most disruptive dynamic sourcing shift in recent memory, apparel, footwear and accessory suppliers are vacating the comfort of their existing supply chains and venturing to countries somewhat untested and unknown to their confidence zone. The new cry from financial analysts to industry officials for 2019 is very clear: \"What's your China exposure?\"</p><p>Edwin Keh, CEO of the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA), and lecturer at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania:<br/> 2019 will be full of uncertainties as we deal with country of origin challenges in the current trade uncertainties. While this will occupy lots of operational attention in the short term, there are also going to be long term challenges.</p><p>Now that we are coming up on 2020, all those promises the industry made about improving sustainability practices, transparency, and working conditions need to move from vague commitments to action and change. There are lots of companies who are woefully unprepared and, as result, risk losing credibility and consumer confidence.</p><p>As global consumption patterns shift from online to omni-channel, from developed Western countries to emerging Eastern economies (China and India), and from buying what is inexpensive (price) to buying what is valuable (innovative, meaningful, good), brands have to find deep and meaningful connections with their customers. They must also give them compelling reasons to consume, and finds ways to optimise their supply chains to create seamless, frictionless, customer centric user experiences. This will mean reshaping existing global supply chains, forging new alliances, and bringing on new talent and leadership.</p><p>Robert Antoshak, managing director, Olah Inc:<br/> Many challenges are facing the global apparel industry \u2013 but that's nothing new! However, in 2019 there are three significant challenges worth considering. First, how best to reach an evolving customer; second, how to maximise sustainability initiatives to meet business objectives; and third, how to adapt to a rapidly changing sourcing environment.</p><p>Let's start with our customers. In many countries around the world, consumers are increasingly younger with less disposable income to spend on clothing than previous generations. Moreover, what financial resources these consumers do have may more likely be spent on the latest high-tech gadget than on the latest in denim or knitwear. Besides, many of these consumers are worried about how garments are made these days. And there are concerns over what happens to their clothes once they are discarded. As a result, supply chain transparency has become more important to more consumers.</p><p>Which brings me to sustainability. Although many consumers claim to support sustainable production in the apparel industry, many refuse to pay more for such initiatives simply because they can't afford it, which leaves brands in a pickle. Who's to pay? Sustainability comes with real costs that are either pushed upstream on suppliers or downstream to consumers, if not outright absorbed by brands (which is less likely). In any event, sustainable production remains essential to our industry and can be nurtured if it's supported by sound business practices.</p><p>And then there's the agony of today's sourcing brought to you by the US government. The trade war between the US and China has forced so many companies in our industry to reconsider their sourcing options \u2013 and fast. I mean now. The smart hedge for many companies seems to be in diversification. Long-established supply chains in China are hard to maintain when 25% tariffs are added to the mix. So other countries \u2013 led by Vietnam \u2013 have directly benefited as sourcing has shifted away from China. Additionally, some supply chains have shortened, too, to include sources of production closer to consuming markets. It will be interesting to see if such new sourcing patterns remain in place should the tariff war between the US and China ends suddenly.</p><p>Dr Sheng Lu, associate professor at the Department of Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware:<br/> In my view, uncertainty will remain the single biggest challenge facing the apparel industry in 2019, ranging from a more volatile global economy, the unpredictable outlook of the US-China trade talks to the various possible Brexit scenarios. While uncertainty creates exciting new research opportunities for scholars like me, it could be a big headache for companies seeking a foreseeable market environment to guide their future business plan and investments. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, the increasing digitalisation of the apparel supply chain based on big-data tools and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies means a huge opportunity for fashion companies. Indeed, the apparel industry is quickly changing in nature \u2013 becoming ever more globalised, supply-chain based, technology-intensive and data-driven. Take talent recruitment as an example. In the 2018 US Fashion Industry Benchmarking Study, which I conducted in collaboration with the US Fashion Industry Association (USFIA), 68% of executives surveyed from leading US fashion brands and apparel retailers said they plan to hire more data scientists in the next five years. The advance of digital technologies and the smarter use of data should enable apparel companies to overcome market uncertainties better and improve many aspects of their businesses such as speed to market, operational efficiency and even sustainability.</p><p>Rajiv Sharma, group chief executive, Coats:<br/> A key challenge is the increasing consumer pressure on sustainability, although every challenge also presents opportunity. Our industry can do more here: promoting a circular economy, products using less water during manufacturing, reducing the use of plastic, consuming less electricity etc \u2013 there is much more that can still be done. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The evergreen challenge remains responding to changing consumer trends. Where do they like to buy? What do they want to wear? How much do they want to pay for it? Despite the more uncertain economic outlook, consumers are still spending but the value proposition needs to be right. Brands and retailers that stay close to their consumers are best positioned to understand them, quickly identify subtle changes in behaviour or demands, and then respond accordingly. \u00a0</p><p>Across Asia, particularly India and China, the middle class consumer base continues to grow. Those with a position in these markets will be well placed to take advantage of future opportunities.</p><p>Margin pressure across the industry continues to be high. This, coupled with mixed demand across geographies and segments, will create a push towards more creative solutions. The winners in 2019 will be those players that navigate through a market that is more uncertain, complex and volatile. Each player needs to find a solution that works for them. 'One size fits all' does not work in our industry. \u00a0</p><p>Julia Hughes, president, United States Fashion Industry Association (USFIA):<br/> The obvious answer: tariffs, trade wars, and the uncertainty resulting from 2018's major upheavals in policy, politics, and global markets. The growing trade protectionism in the United States, as well as in Europe, will cause continued trade disruption in 2019, and for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Of course, we can't deny the fact that intellectual property theft and other unfair trade practices in China are major challenges, too \u2013 especially for the fashion industry. We agree with the Trump Administration on the need to find solutions to these challenges. However, higher tariffs, an extended trade war with our largest trading partner, and heightened tensions with allies around the world won't solve the problem; these tactics will only create more challenges for American businesses and consumers.</p><p>We're also concerned about slavery and human trafficking in supply chains, cyber attacks affecting businesses and consumers, climate change (and the need for everyone to do their part to tackle it), and how companies can keep up with the constantly evolving retail landscape.</p><p>Still, there are opportunities. If we think creatively about this new political world, there's a huge opportunity to engage with the Trump Administration as they work to negotiate new bilateral trade agreements, eliminate overly burdensome regulations on businesses, and create new jobs in the United States. Already, we've had some success. The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or the \"New NAFTA,\" contains several helpful provisions for the industry.</p><p>We also see exciting opportunities to challenge the high tariffs on US imports of consumer products like apparel and footwear. And on the retail front, companies can take advantage of the low unemployment and high wages to grow their businesses, if they innovate and rethink their supply chains, their products, and their stores to deliver what consumers really want right now.</p><p>More good news is that we're seeing more and more that consumers, especially millennials and younger consumers, want to buy from sustainable, transparent brands \u2013 more evidence of the business case for working to tackle issues like human trafficking and climate change.</p><p>Matthijs Crietee, secretary general, International Apparel Federation (IAF):<br/> The main challenge is to effectively put to use all of the digital technology that has become available to create stronger, smarter and more sustainable supply chains. A lot of waste, both figuratively and literally speaking, can still be taken out of the supply chain, but effective implementation of the technology requires involvement of the entire supply chain. This is complex, expensive and risky, therefore requiring strong leadership.</p><p>Another major challenge for the industry is to communicate its achievements, particularly in terms of sustainability, to start rebuilding trust. A number of industry initiatives are delivering, but consumers are still largely in the dark. Indicative of this problem is that the 'apparel and textiles as the second most polluting industry' myth is so pervasive.</p><p>Trust is also an issue within the supply chain, where real or perceived bad purchasing practices clash with the good intentions of brands or retailers' CSR departments. The IAF, with a membership of most major industry associations in all continents, will take a larger role in 2019, bringing together in dialogue players from across the supply chain, buyers and manufacturers, large and small. Trust building is hard work, but it is what this industry needs very badly, both internally and externally.</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n G\u00e9hin, Kurt Salmon, part of Accenture Strategy:<br/> 2019 will see another year of accelerating change \u2013 in fact, change has become the new norm.\u00a0Customer expectations are higher than ever, driven by the digital revolution and a plethora of hyper-convenient offers and services available to customers. Consumers are in control, and they are driving the agenda for apparel retailers and manufacturers. Consumers increasingly want the latest trend, now and on their terms.</p><p>An ever-increasing number of new market entrants cater to micro-niches such as sustainable clothing, comfortable work garments for professional women, personalised tees etc. meaning loyalty to established brands is declining, and incumbent players are subject to the \"attack of the minnows\" \u2013multiple small players nibbling at their market share.</p><p>On top of this, we will see some challenging market conditions in mature markets in 2019, with unpredictability in the UK and the US in particular. The uncertainty around global trade terms, given the potential impact of Brexit and the US/China trade war, will certainly have an impact on supply chains and costs, and potentially on consumer demand.</p><p>Dr Achim Berg, senior\u00a0partner at McKinsey &amp; Company and co-leader of McKinsey's Apparel, Fashion &amp; Luxury Group:<br/> Volatility, uncertainty and shifts in the global economy continue to be the top challenges for global fashion executives. As key economic indicators begin trending downward, a number of other potentially destabilising reasons for caution lie ahead. In fact, 70% of the respondents to our BoF-McKinsey State of Fashion survey are concerned about the overall global macroeconomic outlook in 2019.</p><p>Online and omnichannel transformation continue to represent a major challenge for the fashion industry as well.</p><p>The challenge for 2019 that international fashion executives mentioned third most often is the speed at which consumer preferences are changing. In response, fashion companies are working to reduce lead times, increase flexibility, and improve their demand-forecasting capabilities. End-to-end digitisation and advanced analytics play an important role in these efforts.</p><p>Sustainability and transparency, long treated as the subjects of box-ticking exercises, are evolving into transformational features. In this year's survey, these topics were among the top four challenges mentioned by global industry executives for the first time.</p><p>Rick Horwitch, vice president and global retail lead for supply chain strategy at Bureau Veritas Consumer Products Services:<br/> The biggest challenges \u2013 speed, digitization, trust and transparency \u2013 are also the biggest opportunities. The traditional Economics 101 model of Supply and Demand, is being replaced with Economics 101.v2 \u2013 Demand and Supply. Consumers have more choices than ever before. There are more opportunities than at any time in history for retailers, brands and manufacturers to collaborate with each other and directly with the consumer. The key is to create a collaborative value equation that addresses the entire product cycle (concept to consumer). We are living through an amazing retail renaissance. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>To meet this opportunity, long-standing business models, processes and thinking are changing. \u00a0The continuing push for speed, reduced inventories and margin pressure can have a negative impact on the entire process. Companies are harnessing the power of data for all aspects of the value chain. Data with purpose \u2013 advanced analytics, predictive analytics and artificial intelligence \u2013 is key to meeting these opportunities in a proactive manner. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Equally important in a highly connected world where information is instantaneous, is that NOT meeting the customer's expectations could have an immediate, and disastrous, effect. \u00a0Creating trust and transparency along the entire chain can no longer be buzzwords.</p><p>Today's winners have found a way to develop and integrate innovative, collaborative, processes and analytics (a value chain approach) that are improving speed and margin, without sacrificing quality, to meet the trust and transparency needs of the consumer. \u00a0</p><p>Mike Flanagan, CEO of apparel industry consultancy Clothesource:<br/> The industry's biggest problem is a crisis among the Western clothing retailers on whom hundreds of thousands of suppliers worldwide depend \u2013 as well as tens of millions of textile and garment workers in developing countries.</p><p>There's a belief that this is about poor sales. And it's intertwined with beliefs that online retailing is more efficient than physical; that clothes retailing is bound to move online; and that retailers who don't understand this will price themselves out of business \u2013 if they've not already alienated all the millennials who are their natural customers.</p><p>My Emperors' Clothes survey exposed all this months ago. Clothing retailers have their problems: but they're mostly about costs, not sales. They're targeting the young, when the middle-aged are clothing's big spenders. They're concerned with fashion, when their \u00a0customers want style. They're inadequately focused on consumer needs; absurdly deferential to the fads of outside consultants; spendthrift in IT, new branches and, above all, in what they pay their shareholders and senior management. And with no doubt remaining that selling clothes online reduces profits, it is now only a matter of time before the online retail bubble bursts.</p><p>But there's also a lengthening list of other misguided beliefs about our industry:<br/> 1: \"In 2018, British retail saw its worst November in living memory.\" In fact, November 2018 saw higher UK retail sales than any November ever \u2013 and year-on-year growth was the fourth highest in the previous 30 years.</p><p>2: \"Our industry has a spectacularly catastrophic impact on the world's pollution problems.\" The apparel and textile industry is just not big enough to do anything like the amount of damage its detractors claim: summarised in the phrase \"the world's second biggest polluter.\" Yet, as the New York Times finally admitted in late December, the allegation is almost foundless. Yes, there's a lot it is doing wrong \u2013 but our industry can't solve the problems alone.</p><p>3: \"Workers are being ruthlessly exploited.\" Scarcely a day goes by without complaints of awful wages in developing countries \u2013 and even in the onshore garment industry. But the ILO's 2018/19 Global Wage Report showed that between 2008 and 2017, real wages in Bangladesh (actual average wages deflated by CPI) increased 34%. That means workers in factories making garments for export. The ILO report shows almost all emerging economies saw substantial real wages growth over those ten years. It's likely garment wages did too. Claims that \"minimum wages have grown by only x%\" are not the same as cash wages not growing. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>4: \"Innovation needs taxpayer subsidy to survive.\" By the end of 2018, governments had begun to attack the lavish exemptions from laws and taxes they had given internet retailers: the US Congress agreed to impose sales tax on out-of-State retail, while the UK began to show signs of similar sense on business rates; Canada announced its intention to withdraw uneconomic postal subsidies to Chinese businesses selling direct into the Canadian market; Donald Trump signalled similar plans; and India began discussing curbs on internet retailing amid fears about below-cost selling by its minuscule online retail industry. On this issue \u2013 if on few others \u2013 the developed world may well start watching India for advice.</p><p>5: \"Robotics will destroy jobs.\" Robotics have a limited future in garment making. Businesses like Esquel are making huge strides in automation, but they're still employing as many as years ago. Drones have almost no role delivering stuff to people's houses: they'll get regulated like cars and might have a future in getting blood to hospitals, but they'll never deliver a T-shirt.</p><p>6: \"Shareholders will keep letting Big Tech hurl money away.\" Amazon's 2017 losses on European retail were greater than the 2017 losses that drove Sears into bankruptcy. Investors aren't about to lose patience with the likes of Amazon \u2013 they've lost it already: in the last three months of 2018 alone, the paper value of Amazon fell over 30%.</p><p>Against all this, there are huge opportunities. Clothing sales keep growing, our customers are getting better off as they live \u2013 and stay style-conscious \u2013 for longer. Their growing diversity in tastes, body shapes, age, aspirations and priorities offer clothing designers and retailers huge opportunities for making money ethically and sustainably.</p><p>See also:</p><p>Outlook 2019 \u2013 Apparel sourcing trends and strategies</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JSGNWS-132645</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSGNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V71-6CC1-F14X-V546-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343994</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3651\"/><timeReceived>11:31 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Aroq Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>just-style global news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"60915\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001ZKO</classCode><className>LI &amp;

Negotiators had yet to strike a deal as of last Friday, and Trump s remarks cast further doubt on whether they will.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Absent a deal, House Republicans could try to pass a continuing resolution on the strength of their own votes, but there is no guarantee conservative members would agree to that strategy, as they did in December. Furthermore, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would need at least a few Democrats to sign off on a CR to advance it in his chamber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here s what else is on tap:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY</emphasis></p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is set to testify Tuesday before a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee will consider the nominations of Michael Atkinson to be inspector general of the intelligence community and Jason Klitenic to be general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The panel is scheduled to meet again Thursday for a closed briefing.</p><p>On the other side of the Capitol, the House Foreign Affairs subcommittees on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade and Asia and the Pacific will hold a joint hearing on North Korea's biological, chemical, and conventional weapons with outside experts.</p><p>Meanwhile, Navy Secretary Richard Spencer and Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson are slated to testify Thursday before the House Armed Services subcommittees on Readiness and Seapower and Projection Forces. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</emphasis></p><p>The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will gather a group of federal officials Wednesday to game out a path forward on another water-infrastructure bill. Chairman John Barrasso has called for action this year on a new Water Resources Development Act, which lawmakers regularly use to update policy and spending authorizations on water navigation, flood protection, and related environment policy.</p><p>That effort appears to be moving in parallel with a broad infrastructure package. The White House is now floating a $200 billion plan, and Wednesday s hearing will be the third on infrastructure for the Senate environment committee since late December.</p><p>A disaster-relief bill still hangs in the balance as Senate appropriators try to map out a path forward. The chamber s Democrats have called for a resolution on disaster funding as part of broader negotiations on federal spending and budget legislation, which lawmakers must act on before spending authorization expires Jan. 19.</p><p>Meanwhile, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing Thursday on the Environmental Protection Agency s Superfund policies. No witnesses have been announced yet, and the Trump administration hasn t nominated anyone to fill the top slot for the EPA office that controls Superfund, a program designed to clean up the country s most polluted industrial sites. Republican committee leaders recently raised questions about how the agency developed a list released in early December that identifies 21 sites as top priorities.</p><p>That committee will also hold a hearing Friday on legislation to modernize the Puerto Rican electricity utility, a notoriously inefficient and outdated service, and another bill to speed up the regulatory process for liquefied-natural-gas exports. The Trump administration habitually calls for increased LNG sales abroad to boost the bottom lines of American energy companies. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH</emphasis></p><p>House Republicans seem confident that a deal will be reached on Children s Health Insurance Program funding this week, with Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden saying they are looking a six-year deal. Democrats, however, are pushing for more.</p><p>Meanwhile, committees on both sides of Congress will be taking on a slew of health policy topics. The House Rules Committee will consider a bill Tuesday that would require a health care practitioner who is present when a child is born alive following an abortion to exercise care and ensure that that the child is immediately admitted to a hospital. Practitioners who do not follow these requirements could be fined, face up to five years in prison, or both.</p><p>The House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee will hold a hearing Wednesday on the opioid crisis. Members will look at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services efforts to use data to identify people in the Medicare Part D program who may abuse opioids, as well as what tools CMS has to prevent people from receiving unnecessary opioids.</p><p>The Energy and Commerce Committee Health Subcommittee will also mark up three health-related bills that would shield health care professionals from liability when they volunteer during a declared disaster, clarify how drug and device companies can share health care economic or scientific information and establish an over-the-counter monograph user fee program at the Food and Drug Administration. </p><p>On Wednesday, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will hold a hearing on the reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which helps the country prepare for a range of public health threats.</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee will also have a hearing on the long-term-care needs of first responders injured in the line of duty. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAXES</emphasis></p><p>Tax writers are combing the recently passed overhaul bill for areas that may need fixing through upcoming legislation, but they don t expect tweaks to be attached to a bill to fund the federal government.</p><p> I wouldn t anticipate that,  House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters last Thursday.  We re going to make sure any fine-tuning we do is well thought-out. </p><p>Ways and Means announced a subcommittee reshuffle last week, moving Rep. Peter Roskam to lead the Health Subcommittee and Rep. Lynn Jenkins to head the Oversight Subcommittee. Both of these positions will be key this year as Congress mulls another run at repealing the Affordable Care Act and tax writers gear up for a reorganization of the Internal Revenue Service, which would fall under Jenkins s jurisdiction. Rep. Vern Buchanan will chair the Tax Policy Subcommittee this year, just as the panel gets ready to work on technical corrections to the tax bill, a separate tax-extenders bill, and further tax-code changes.</p><p>The need for additional IRS resources to implement the overhaul bill remains an open issue as Congress grapples with funding legislation for fiscal 2018. IRS Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson released her annual <url normalizedValue=\"https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/news/ARC2017-ReleaseArticle?category=Tax%20News\"> report </url> last week, saying the agency would need nearly $500 million over the next two years to implement the tax-code changes. </p><p>Brady said last week that lawmakers are still open to the idea of additional funding and are vetting proposals, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at an economic forum Friday that he expects the IRS to hire a significant number of additional staff for the implementation push.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECHNOLOGY</emphasis></p><p>The Senate is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a House resolution, passed last week, that reauthorizes Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act without the privacy reforms sought by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. The House bill sets no limits on the warrantless use of Americans  intercepted electronic communications by law enforcement, which has been a key sticking point in the months-long debate on reauthorization. </p><p>Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Sen. Rand Paul have both threatened to filibuster similar legislation, and several other senators including Republicans Mike Lee and Steve Daines and Democrat Patrick Leahy have expressed grave reservations about reauthorizing the surveillance program without reforms. The bill would need 60 votes to pass in the upper chamber should any senator choose to filibuster. The foreign electronic surveillance program which the intelligence community insists is vital to national security will expire on Jan. 19 absent another extension.</p><p>Expect more reaction from senators regarding last week s report that Russian-government hackers are seeking to compromise Senate network accounts. On Friday, GOP Sen. Ben Sasse called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to update Congress on what steps the Department of Justice has taken to protect Congress and other federal networks from Russian cyberattacks.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee is having its first tech-focused week of the new year. On Wednesday, the committee will hear from representatives of Facebook, Google, and Twitter on their efforts to fight the spread of terrorist and extremist content on their platforms. The title of the hearing  Is Big Tech Doing Enough?  suggests Silicon Valley may be in for some tough questions.</p><p>On Thursday, the Commerce Committee will convene an executive session to consider the nomination of Brendan Carr, the newest Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission, to a new term. Republicans had hoped to nominate Carr to two consecutive terms last year, after he was tapped last summer to finish out the term of former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. But Sen. Bill Nelson, the ranking member on Commerce, scuttled that approach over concerns that Carr lacks independence from his former boss, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai.</p><p>The House Homeland Security Committee will meet Wednesday to discuss the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation cybersecurity system. Run by the Homeland Security Department, the CDM program is designed to constantly scan and fortify federal networks against cyberattack, but it s still in its early stages. Wednesday s hearing is set to bring together federal stakeholders with industry experts to examine barriers to rolling out the program across the federal government.</p><p>On Wednesday, the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee will hear from representatives of NASA, Boeing, and private-space firm SpaceX for an update on NASA commercial-crew systems development. The House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing Thursday on the manufacturing and innovation of Internet of Things devices.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITE HOUSE</emphasis></p><p>Back in Washington after a long weekend in Florida, President Trump will spend only two days in town before hitting the road in an effort to save a Republican seat in the House. On Tuesday, he will meet with Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. On Wednesday, he will attend the ceremony when the Congressional Gold Medal is presented to former Senate Majority Leader and GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole, who is 94. Then, on Thursday, he will travel to a manufacturing plant outside Pittsburgh to campaign for Rick Saccone, the Republican hoping to fill the vacancy created when GOP Rep. Tim Murphy resigned amid scandal. The special election is March 13. On Friday, the president will host an event related to the 45th annual March for Life, protesting the Supreme Court s 1973 abortion decision. Then, he is back to his Florida golf resort.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-662771</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RDV-VM71-JBNW-32SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1884\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Bipartisan, bicameral interest remains in reform amid high-profile cases of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court s approval of observation of U.S. citizens, but consensus on actual measures remains elusive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senate leadership has signaled that they want to reauthorize the expiring provisions for as long as three months to prevent them for lapsing as lawmakers continue to negotiate. Sen. Rand Paul, a longtime critic of the Patriot Act, has said he d oppose even a temporary extension. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It s kind of [a] game of chicken right now [between] those who want to use it as leverage to do Title I reform and those of us who want to make sure those authorities are still available in the interim,  said Sen. John Cornyn, a McConnell ally on the Intelligence Committee.  We re not gonna decide Title I FISA reform between now and March 15, so that s what we re trying to manage. </p><p>President Trump, Attorney General William Barr, and congressional Republicans met last week on the issue, and Paul <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/1235007093507321857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"> tweeted </url> that Trump said he doesn t want a clean reauthorization of FISA.</p><p>In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hopes to pass a FISA extension this week. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, who wants substantial changes as well, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nadler-tells-fox-news-hes-willing-to-let-fisa-expire-if-no-reauthorization-agreement\"> told </url>Fox News on Thursday that he would let the FISA statute expire if lawmakers couldn t reach a deal. The House Judiciary Committee postponed a markup of its reauthorization legislation in late February and hasn t set another date. </p><p> We re having our own negotiations within our own group, among the Democrats and vis-a-vis the Republicans,  Pelosi said.</p><p>The Congressional Progressive Caucus, who have struck a rare point of agreement with the conservative Republican Freedom Caucus on the issue, have been in talks with leadership on the FISA bill.</p><p> It is our position that the House should pass a very strong, reformed reauthorization,  Progressive Caucus cochair and Judiciary Committee member Pramila Jayapal told reporters Wednesday.</p><p>Jayapal says she continues to push for a definition of the  derived from  clause in the FISA statute, which would help individuals challenge the legality of surveillance done on them, and for requiring that certain surveillance be deleted after three years. The third issue is stronger protection for First Amendment-protected activity, Jayapal said.</p><p>The Senate will return Monday to vote to advance Sen. Lisa Murkowski s substitute amendment to her massive energy bill. Murkowski packaged 18 noncontroversial amendments onto the energy package before the Senate skipped town last week. But that won t go far in placating a restive Democratic caucus that is pulling out all the stops to boost the climate-change impact of the legislation. </p><p>Senators filed roughly 200 amendments on the legislation. A high-profile measure to tack incentives for energy-efficiency improvements to residential and commercial buildings is set for a vote. The outcome on that amendment is so far unclear, and many Republicans are rallying against it. </p><p>Democrats view the building-code measure as the biggest potential guarantee for greenhouse-gas-emission reductions in the energy package. Its inclusion, or lack thereof, may go a long way in determining Democratic support for the package as a whole. The National Association of Home Builders, a lobbying powerhouse, opposes the measure. </p><p>On top of that, Democrats and some Republicans, like Sen. John Kennedy, are pushing an amendment vote on legislation to mandate hydrofluorocarbon phasedowns in the refrigerants industry. Democrats are also pushing a suite of clean-energy tax cuts. The latter is a long shot. A tax-credit attachment to the package will surely generate a revenue-related blue-slip point of order from House members. </p><p>It s a busy week for Murkowski. On Tuesday, she ll hold a hearing to examine the 16 percent cut proposed for the Interior Department in the White House budget for fiscal 2021. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt will testify before the committee. </p><p>Kennedy will also convene the Senate Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee on Tuesday to hear from three members of the Federal Communications Commission on their budget request.</p><p>The next day, Chairman Richard Shelby brings together the Defense Subcommittee to consider Navy and Marine Corps funding while Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith convenes the Legislative Branch panel to review the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget Office. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson will also testify, and hearings on the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation within the Department of the Interior are also slated for Wednesday.</p><p>Finally, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue will appear before Sen. John Hoeven s Agriculture Subcommittee on Thursday.</p><p>The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration is set to hold a contentious <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rules.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-hearing-for-a-member-of-the-federal-election-commission\"> hearing </url> on Tuesday as Sen. Roy Blunt attempts to advance James Trainor s nomination to sit on the Federal Election Commission. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the panel s ranking member fresh off her campaign for president,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/3/klobuchar-opposes-partisan-nomination-to-fec\"> opposes </url> Trainor s advancement       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/703025/white-house-torpedos-bipartisan-tradition-at-independent-agencies\"> without the traditional </url> Noah s Ark-style, simultaneous nomination of a Democrat to the bipartisan board charged with overseeing elections. </p><p>In the House, lawmakers will vote on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2214?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22National+Origin-Based+Antidiscrimination+for+Nonimmigrants%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1\"> No Ban Act </url>, which would limit the administration s ability to restrict immigration and terminate the president s executive actions banning travel from certain countries. Days into his administration, Trump issued an order denying certain visas to travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. That was eventually pared down, but in January, Trump expanded the ban to include Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Nigeria, all countries with substantial Muslim populations.</p><p>It s not likely that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would take up the legislation.</p><p>The House will also take up another immigration-related bill. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5581\"> Access to Counsel Act </url> would guarantee the right to representation to undocumented immigrants during removal, exclusion, or deportation proceedeings. The current statutes only grant representation rights during removal proceedings. Sen. Kamala Harris has similar       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2219\"> legislation </url> in the Senate, but it has not moved in the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Sen. Tim Kaine s bill limiting Trump s military authority to attack Iran may come up for a vote this week as well. Kaine s resolution is set to get a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/68\"> hearing </url> in the House Rules Committee Monday, meaning a vote is likely soon.</p><p>Here s what else is on tap this week:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY</emphasis></p><p>The Senate Armed Services Committee hopes to move three Trump nominees for Pentagon leadership Tuesday: Matthew Donovan, to be undersecretary of Defense for personnel and readiness; William Gillis, to be assistant secretary of Defense for sustainment; and Victor Mercado, to be assistant secretary of Defense for strategy, plans, and capabilities. </p><p>Marine Corps and Navy officials testify to the committee on Wednesday morning on ground-modernization efforts. The committee calls Pentagon officials to testify on personnel programs in the afternoon.</p><p>The House Armed Services Committee keeps up its breakneck pace next week, with eight hearings on the docket.</p><p>The committee calls U.S. Central Command Commander Gen. Kenneth McKenzie and Africa Command Commander Gen. Stephen Townsend to testify Tuesday on U.S. policy in the Middle East and Africa. Lawmakers have pushed back on rumors of a withdrawal from Africa, the first region under Defense Secretary Mark Esper s  blank-slate  review of military deployments around the world.</p><p>Anti-domestic violence and counseling officials testify Tuesday afternoon to the Military Personnel Subcommittee. Also that afternoon, acquisition officials testify to the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee on helicopter acquisition in the 2021 budget.</p><p>The committee hears testimony Wednesday on the United States  sealift capacity. The Pentagon inspector general recently found that Transportation Command had inaccurately tracked sealift capacity, which could lead combatant commands to make  assumptions about the initial availability of equipment and resupply of critical items  during a crisis or major conflict.</p><p>U.S. Southern Command and Northern Command leadership testify to the full committee Wednesday morning on national security policy in North and South America. That afternoon, top research and engineering officials from the Army, Navy, and Air Force testify with Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin on the Pentagon s technology policy in 2021.</p><p>The committee focuses on missile defense in the 2021 budget on Thursday, with testimony from Missile Defense Agency and NORTHCOM leadership. The committee hears that morning from Navy and Marine Corps officials on readiness in 2021.</p><p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee calls the first hearing this week on Afghanistan policy since the U.S. and the Taliban signed a peace accord on Feb. 29, nominally setting the stage for full-blown peace talks in Kabul. Intra-Afghan negotiations are supposed to start on Tuesday, the same day that the committee calls former diplomats and off-Hill experts to testify on the negotiations. </p><p>That morning, House appropriators will examine Trump s 2021 budget request for the State Department.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee hears testimony on the humanitarian crisis in Idlib, Syria. The Europe Subcommittee focuses on the conflict in Ukraine that afternoon.</p><p>The same day, the House Appropriations Committee examines Trump s 2021 budget request for the State Department.</p><p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has one hearing scheduled for next week, on Bashar al-Assad s human rights abuses in Syria.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</emphasis></p><p>The energy package will consume the lion s share of attention in the energy-and-environment world this week. But energy experts will also scrutinize Interior and Energy Department testimony on the budget.</p><p>On top of Bernhardt s Senate testimony, the House is continuing to blitz on spending oversight. The Interior Secretary will appear before the House Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Wednesday.</p><p>As usual with budget testimony, House Democrats are likely to veer into policy matters. Expect subcommittee Chair Betty McCollum to press Bernhardt on the status of approved mining leases in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, a vast network of waterways that cross the Minnesota border with Canada. McCollum, who represents a Minnesota district, is leading legislation to permanently ban development in the wilderness area.</p><p>The Energy and Water Development panel will receive budget testimony Wednesday on the Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy, a program that has been critical in boosting new energy technologies. The program s director, Lane Genatowski, will testify. The Trump administration has repeatedly proposed to nix the program.</p><p>But lawmakers on Capitol Hill prioritize ARPA E, and they ve boosted funding for it in recent years. The Murkowski energy package reauthorizes the program through 2025 with dramatically escalating funding authorization. The bill authorizes $750 million for ARPA E in fiscal 2025.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will hold a hearing Wednesday on Douglas Benevento to be deputy administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency. The hearing will also consider Nuclear Regulatory Commission nominations for David Wright and Christopher Hansen. Wright s term expires this year and Hansen will be a new addition to the commission.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH</emphasis></p><p>Trump signed legislation providing $8.3 billion in supplemental funding to beef up the U.S. s response to the COVID-19 outbreak. But lawmakers are still concerned about the costs and practical impacts the disease can have on U.S. citizens as the disease spreads.</p><p> Public health threats like this outbreak have hidden and higher costs for those who are paid lower wages, who don t have affordable child care, who don t have health insurance, or who are experiencing homelessness,  said Sen. Patty Murray, top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.  As we continue responding to this crisis I m going to stay focused on what all our families are actually experiencing and what they need to keep themselves and their communities safe. </p><p>The House Appropriations subcommittee with oversight of the Health and Human Services Department meets Tuesday on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget for fiscal 2021. CDC Director Robert Redfield, a member of the Coronavirus Task Force, will be among the witnesses testifying.</p><p>The House Committee on Small Business also holds a hearing that morning looking at the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on small businesses, including supply-chain disruptions and the spread of misinformation.</p><p>In the afternoon, the House Homeland Security Committee s Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Subcommittee will look at community perspectives on coronavirus preparedness. Witnesses include health officials from the state health departments in New Jersey and Mississippi. The next morning, the full committee will meet on the federal response to the disease outbreak.</p><p>The House Oversight and Reform Committee s subcommittees on national security and economic and consumer policy will hold a hearing Tuesday afternoon on biodefense and the response to the outbreak. The full committee will have a hearing Wednesday morning on coronavirus preparedness and response, and in the afternoon, the Economic and Consumer Policy subcommittee will have a hearing on travel insurance for coronavirus-related cancellations.</p><p>Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn will be on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify on the agency s fiscal 2021 budget. The hearing is in front of the appropriations subcommittee with oversight of the FDA s budget.</p><p>The House Education and Labor Committee s Workforce Protections Subcommittee will examine the Healthy Families Act from Rep. Rosa DeLauro on Wednesday. The legislation would require businesses with 15 or more employees to provide at least one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 56 hours in a year.</p><p>DeLauro and Murray recently introduced legislation building off of this proposal that would automatically provide 14 days of paid sick leave at the beginning of a public-health emergency, like the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>On Thursday, the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship holds a hearing on how the coronavirus has impacted small businesses  supply chains. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAXES AND TRADE</emphasis></p><p>COVID-19 is making its way into the tax world.</p><p>Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1234694301734580231?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"> pressed </url> House Democrats last week to consider a one-year payroll-tax cut to ease the financial burden for individuals as fears of the virus roil the stock market. Hoyer shot down the idea to reporters during his pen-and-pad briefing last week, saying he didn t think that  tax cuts are the answer to every problem. </p><p>On the Senate side, Finance Committee Republicans remain open to the idea but say the issue isn t yet urgent.</p><p> At this point, the coronavirus has not had a broad impact on the U.S. economy and its effects have been limited,  a Senate Finance Committee aide told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal </emphasis>on Friday.  However, Chairman Grassley and the Senate Finance Committee stand ready to consider appropriate tax-relief responses if that becomes necessary and the extent of the problem can be determined. </p><p>Then on Friday, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Washington Post </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/06/white-house-could-seek-timely-targeted-aid-us-industries-hurt-by-coronavirus-outbreak-top-adviser-says/\"> reported </url> that the White House is considering deferring taxes for the travel and tourism industries, something that Trump could accomplish administratively. </p><p>Both sides have left the door open to stimulus of some sort but there appears to be little agreement on how to go about it in the event the virus continues to be a drag on the economy. </p><p>On the agency side, the IRS s Taxpayer Advocate Service is working with IRS leaders to craft a plan in case employees are affected by the coronavirus, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bloomberg Tax </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/taxpayer-advocate-working-with-irs-on-coronavirus-response\"> reported </url>. It s the middle of tax-filing season, and a multitude of the agency s 75,000 employees calling in sick or avoiding the office could delay processing. Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bloomberg</emphasis> that he expected a briefing on the issue in the coming days.</p><p>There are no tax- or trade-related hearings scheduled in the Ways and Means Committee or Senate Finance Committee this week.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECHNOLOGY</emphasis></p><p>The fight over big tech s legal shield ratchets up another notch on Wednesday. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham will hold a hearing on his new, bipartisan Earn It Act, which forces tech companies to forgo the liability protections afforded to them under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act if they fail to take additional steps to prevent child exploitation on their platforms. The bill would convene a commission, headed by the attorney general, tasked with determining whether platforms should continue to receive such protections.</p><p> Tech companies and civil-liberties groups have already lined up against the legislation, and Graham said last week that tech trade groups would be among those testifying at Wednesday s hearing.</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee will also put pressure on tech platforms at a Tuesday hearing of the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. Lawmakers plan to discuss how the largest platforms particularly Google and Amazon allegedly favor certain products over others in their search results.</p><p>And on Tuesday afternoon, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property will meet to discuss how other countries are handling digital piracy. The hearing is the second in a series planned by subcommittee Chairman Thom Tillis, who hopes to rewrite the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in a way that could see tech platforms lose additional liability protections, this time relating to infringing works posted on their platforms.</p><p>A long-awaited report from the Cyberspace Solarium Commission arrives Wednesday, when lawmakers and commissioners convene to unveil the results of a seven-month effort to establish a long-term cybersecurity strategy for the United States. The effort was modeled off of President Eisenhower s 1953 Project Solarium, which sought a new way to combat the Soviet nuclear threat. That project guided U.S. policy until the end of the Cold War, and commissioners hope Wednesday s report will have a similar impact on U.S. cybersecurity policy.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee will mark up several high-profile tech bills Wednesday. The Access Broadband Act, passed last year by the House, would streamline federal-assistance programs to extend high-speed internet to rural communities. The Industries of the Future Act would push the administration to develop a research plan and increase research investments in technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation wireless networks. And the US SAFEWEB Act would reauthorize a law giving the Federal Trade Commission additional powers to crack down on online scams.</p><p>It s appropriations season on Capitol Hill, and tech is high on this week s agenda. The Senate Appropriations Committee meets Tuesday to examine the proposed budget of the Federal Communications Commission, followed the next day by the House committee. The House Homeland Security Committee meets Wednesday with administration officials to discuss the White House s budget proposal for both the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Homeland Security Department s Science and Technology Directorate.</p><p>The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a markup Wednesday, where lawmakers will consider two cybersecurity bills as well as drone-safety legislation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITE HOUSE</emphasis></p><p>Even while managing the coronavirus situation, Trump has lots of politics on his schedule for this week as well as a remarkable snub of a key political constituency. On Monday, he will meet with supporters and raise political funds for Republicans in Longwood, Florida, north of Orlando. On Tuesday, he will honor another supporter, giving the Presidential Medal of Freedom to retired Gen. Jack Keane, a conservative analyst on Fox News. </p><p>On Thursday, he will be the first president to snub the annual bipartisan St. Patrick s lunch on Capitol Hill, because it is hosted by Pelosi, whom he regularly attacks. Since the lunch began in 1987 to honor the visiting Irish prime minister, presidents have either attended or sent their vice president in recognition of the political clout of 34 million Irish-Americans. Instead, Trump will meet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar alone at the White House as part of his official celebration of St. Patrick s Day. On Friday, he will again leave the White House for another Republican event, the annual meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-705222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCT-VVN1-DY4X-T010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3554\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Pat Roberts told reporters Thursday after the failed cloture vote. </p><p>Congress, however, will likely avoid a government shutdown by passing a continuing resolution by the end of the month. How long the measure will last remains under negotiation between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p><p> We're down that path,  Pelosi told reporters Thursday.  We are now looking at anomalies and the rest, and we'll figure out the timing when we do. </p><p>The question is whether to draft a CR to run until December or into next year. McConnell <url normalizedValue=\"/s/709642/senators-face-uphill-climb-to-get-hurricane-wildfire-relief-amid-covid\"> supports </url> a CR that lasts until December. For Democrats, a February deadline could mean Congress would be working with a Joe Biden administration and perhaps Sen. Chuck Schumer as majority leader on the spending package.</p><p>Both sides want a CR clear of extraneous items, but that doesn t rule out so-called anomalies, narrow changes to funding for certain agencies or programs. The CR won t include provisions meant for any coronavirus aid package, Pelosi told reporters last week, saying  those negotiations are separate from this. </p><p>But ultimately, the parties may disagree on what constitutes a  clean  CR. </p><p> What we ve got to do as appropriators is define  clean,   Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby told reporters last week.</p><p>On the House <url normalizedValue=\"https://rules.house.gov/news/announcement/meeting-announcement-monday-september-14-2020\"> docket </url> this week is a series of education and civil rights-related bills. The House will take up a <url normalizedValue=\"https://meng.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/meng-introduces-resolution-to-denounce-anti-asian-sentiment-caused-by-0\"> resolution </url> from Rep. Grace Meng condemning anti-Asian sentiment caused by coronavirus. The House is also set to vote on Rep.

Jamie Raskin; and Kevin Clinesmith, a former FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty last month as part of U.S. Attorney John Durham s review of the agency s counterintelligence investigation into Trump s 2016 campaign.</p><p>The Treasury Department last week sanctioned four Russia-linked individuals for attempting to interfere in the American election, specifically targeting Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach for his effort to compel corruption investigations based on unsubstantiated narratives.

China has refused; Democrats and arms-control experts have urged President Trump to extend the treaty, which expires in February.</p><p>The House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere Subcommittee convenes virtually on Tuesday to hear testimony on Latin America and the Caribbean from off-Hill experts. That afternoon, the House Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee has called Pentagon officials to testify on the military s use of potentially toxic PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam.</p><p>Each of the four defense and foreign policy committees holds a hearing on Thursday. </p><p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee calls three State Department officials to testify on the firing of Inspector General Steven Linick, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/4/7/47b1f13c-7b02-4b58-a32d-d4cb74ee9291/4260E22C7282CBACBC5D94AA72FAB265.linick-final-redacted.pdf\"> spoke </url> in June with House lawmakers investigating his removal. Linick said Undersecretary of State for Management Brian Bulatao tried to  bully  him; Bulatao will testify. State Department acting legal adviser Marik String and Assistant Secretary of State for political-military affairs R. Clarke Cooper will also testify, presumably on their involvement in the decision to bypass Congress and expedite weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a move Linick had been investigating.</p><p>The Inspector General <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stateoig.gov/system/files/isp-i-20-19.pdf\"> found </url> that the State Department did not fully assess the civilian-casualty risks of selling precision-guided missiles, which the two Gulf countries have used in neighboring Yemen.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who encouraged Trump to fire Linick, provided written answers about the probe. He traveled to Doha over the weekend for the start of intra-Afghan peace talks. Kabul and the Taliban have never negotiated face-to-face before, and the talks may enter a <url normalizedValue=\"/s/709681/biden-forever-wars-critic-could-inherit-afghan-peace-negotiations\"> holding pattern </url> as participants await the results of the U.S. presidential election.</p><p>The House Armed Services Emerging Threats Subcommittee has called members of the congressionally created National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence to testify on the military s investments in AI technologies. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider U.S. diplomatic policy toward China, with testimony from State Department officials. And the Senate Armed Services Committee will hear from Lisa Gordon-Hagerty of the National Nuclear Security Administration about the agency s budget, alongside acquisition chief Ellen Lord and Adm. Charles Richard, commander of Strategic Command.</p><p>Defense hawks added language to the Senate s 2021 defense-policy bill that would let the military edit the NNSA s budget request before it s submitted to the White House for approval. The NNSA is housed within the Energy Department. House lawmakers have introduced a competing proposal, but the two chambers aren t expected to resolve their differences on the legislation before the presidential election.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</emphasis></p><p>A deal over a family of greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons is paving the way for a resurrection of a sprawling Senate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/CC266AB2-6E09-4BEE-88E2-BCFC5C87EBF6\"> energy package </url> that touches on everything from building efficiency codes to carbon capture and electrical-grid cybersecurity.</p><p>Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso and ranking member Tom Carper struck a compromise last week to phase down the use of those gases over a 15-year period in line with a United Nations accord called the Kigali Amendment.

Democrats have fought for months to secure the Clements nomination.</p><p>On the House side of the Capitol, an Energy and Commerce Committee panel will hold a hearing on the potential role of clean-energy investment in a pandemic recovery. A House infrastructure bill passed in July extends renewable-energy tax credits and ponies up billions to improve the electricity grid.

John Larson meant to roll back the administration s payroll-tax-deferment program, but the House s chief administrator, Philip Kiko, said in a letter to staff Friday that the chamber itself won t defer payroll taxes. </p><p>Still, some members may enact the deferment for groups like campaign staff. House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Kevin Brady, a big booster of the White House deferral program that began Sept. 1, told reporters last week that his campaign administration will defer payroll taxes. </p><p>Other Republican campaigns are likely to follow suit. </p><p>Brady also mentioned another looming tax issue: tax extenders, the set of temporary tax provisions Congress must perennially renew. There hasn t been much talk about the block of extenders set to expire at the end of this year, but Brady said he expects negotiations to begin this week. </p><p>As for finding a legislative vehicle on which to attach extenders, the typical target is a government-funding bill, and one happens to be due at the end of this month, with perhaps another due at the end of the year. </p><p>Ways and Means is set to hold a <url normalizedValue=\"https://waysandmeans.house.gov/legislation/hearings/enforcing-ban-imports-produced-forced-labor-xinjiang\"> hearing </url> Thursday on  enforcing the ban on imports produced by forced labor  in the Xinjiang province of China. </p><p>The Senate Finance Committee hasn t announced any hearings this week. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECHNOLOGY</emphasis></p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee will mark up a slew of bills on Tuesday, and several tech-policy proposals are on tap. Senators will vote on bills including the Government Spectrum Valuation Act, the Rural Connectivity Advancement Program Act, and the Ensuring Network Security Act. </p><p>But the markup is perhaps more noteworthy for what s not on the agenda. Earlier this summer, former Commerce Chairman John Thune and committee member Brian Schatz introduced the PACT Act, an attempt to moderately reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Big tech s primary legal shield is also targeted, albeit more aggressively, in the Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act introduced last week by Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker. The committee is not marking up either piece of legislation on Tuesday, however, which almost certainly kicks the fight over Section 230 to a new Congress in 2021.</p><p>With speculation swirling around the Justice Department s reported plan to bring an antitrust case against Google ahead of November s election, the Senate Judiciary Committee looks determined to air its own views on the issue. Lawmakers from the Antitrust Subcommittee will meet Tuesday with top Google executive Donald Harrison for a hearing on whether the tech company is harming competition through its search algorithms. Given the hearing s title  Stacking the Tech: Has Google harmed competition in online advertising?  it s safe to assume Harrison is in for a grilling.</p><p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai may be in for his own grilling on Thursday. The House Energy and Commerce Communications and Technology Subcommittee will meet with FCC commissioners Thursday for a hearing entitled  Trump FCC: Four Years of Lost Opportunities.  In addition to questions about the commission's efforts to close the  digital divide,  lawmakers are likely to press commissioners on the ongoing inquiry into a White House petition asking the commission to reinterpret Section 230. The fate of Republican commissioner Michael O Rielly who had his renomination to the FCC abruptly pulled by the White House after he mildly criticized its Section 230 petition is also a likely topic of discussion.</p><p>The FCC is also busy elsewhere this week. On Monday, the commission will hold a day-long workshop on the development of Open Radio Access Networks, 5G technology widely touted as an economic alternative to the cheap hardware offered by Huawei, China s telecom giant and a purported national security threat. Washington has spent years seeking to convince allies to look beyond Huawei for their 5G needs, and more than one policymaker is pinning the success of that effort on the rapid development and deployment of alternate options like O-RAN.</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Intellectual Property Subcommittee meets Wednesday for a hearing on potential reforms to Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prohibits individuals from trying to undermine technology deployed to prevent copyright violations. </p><p>President Trump's deadline for Chinese tech company ByteDance to sell TikTok the video app popular with American teens arrives on Tuesday, but a sale looks farther away than ever. On Friday, Reuters<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-bytedance-tiktok-exclusive/exclusive-china-would-rather-see-tiktok-u-s-close-than-a-forced-sale-idUSKBN2622L6\"> reported </url> that the Chinese government would rather see TikTok shut down than have its ownership pass to an American firm. That report follows new export controls enacted by the Chinese government late last month, which many saw as an attempt to ensure Beijing could block a TikTok sale if it decided to do so. </p><p>Companies as diverse as Microsoft, Walmart, and Oracle have all expressed an interest in purchasing TikTok after the president signed an executive order seeking to shut down the app over national security concerns. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITE HOUSE</emphasis></p><p>President Trump this week will celebrate a foreign policy accomplishment at the White House in between heavy campaigning in key battleground states. He starts the week on Monday with a visit to McClellan Park in Sacramento County, California to be briefed on the damage done by raging wildfires, followed by a stop in Arizona to conclude a three-day campaign swing. In Phoenix, he will attend a Latinos for Trump event before returning to Washington. On Tuesday, accompanied by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a senior official from the United Arab Emirates, he will preside at the formal signing of the previously announced normalization agreement between the two countries. On Wednesday, he will participate in a phone call with Jewish leaders in advance of Rosh Hashanah, which begins Friday evening. In the evening, he will speak at a fundraising dinner for the National Republican Congressional Committee. On Thursday, he will attend a credentialing ceremony for newly appointed ambassadors to Washington. On Friday, he is back on the campaign trail, with rallies in Bemidji, Minnesota, and Mosinee, Wisconsin.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-709712</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V4-BM41-JBNW-301D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3253\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The National Journal Group, Inc.

The House will move first this week to pass stopgap-spending legislation to avert a Oct. 1 shutdown. The chamber will take up a clean continuing resolution to fund the government until late November. The measure is likely to pass without additional riders such as gun-control provisions or language preventing the president from transferring military construction funds to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. </p><p>You probably wont have that in any CR, but youll probably have some other vehicle for that to be expressed, and we did have that conversation, Progressive Caucus cochair Mark Pocan said after exiting a meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday. House movement on a short-term spending plan comes as the appropriations process in the Senate has run off the rails. The Senate appropriations subcommittees on Tuesday will attempt to markup three funding bills covering the White House, the federal judiciary, the District of Columbia, the Treasury, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development Departments, and the Food and Drug Administration before the full panel takes them up Thursday. Senate Appropriations on Thursday advanced two bills funding the Defense and Energy Departments. Defense spending passed on a party-line vote in light of Republicans defeat of Democrats proposal to limit the Pentagons ability to divert funding to physical barriers on the southern border. Appropriators this week filed legislation forcing another vote this month to terminate the emergency declaration authorizing the transfers between military construction projects. Chairman Richard Shelby had planned to mark up two other bills, but disputes over funding for nongovernmental abortion services and topline funding for domestic priorities, including the Homeland Security Department, postponed their consideration. Appropriators nonetheless expressed cautious optimism that some funding bills could reach the floor as Congress creeps toward an Oct. 1 deadline to fund the government. I hope we wont get so bogged down here that we dont achieve what we, really on a bipartisan agreement, wanted to achieve, which was to avoid a CR, avoid a government shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the panel. The House will also take up legislation to ban forced arbitration this week. With 222 cosponsors, the bill is likely to pass. Sen. Richard Blumenthal has companion legislation in the Senate, but it has not advanced. Additional immigration and election security bills as well as floor votes on the three gun control bills the Judiciary Committee approved last week are expected to come during this work period as well, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Senate this week will spend floor time on confirming more executive-branch nominees. McConnell on Thursday filed cloture on three of Trumps State Department picks, including John Rakolta and Kenneth Howerys nominations for ambassadorial posts in the United Arab Emirates and Sweden as well as Robert Destros bid to be an assistant secretary. Also on the Senates docket are Brent McIntosh and Brian Callanans nominations to work at the Treasury Department as undersecretary and general counsel, respectively. The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Thursday will also consider attorney Eugene Scalia, President Trumps nominee to run the Labor Department. The son of late Justice Antonin Scalia served in various roles at the Labor, Justice, and Education Department. Heres what else is on tap this week: DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY The House Foreign Affairs Committee has subpoenaed President Trumps point man for Afghanistan peace negotiations, Zalmay Khalilizad, to appear at a hearing Thursday. The subpoena is the first the committee has issued this Congress, and comes after requests for his public testimonyin February, April and early Septemberwere unsuccessful, according to a committee press release. The subpoena was issued after President Trump abruptly canceled a secret meeting with the Taliban at Camp David, meant to finalize a peace framework that would have reportedly traded a withdrawal of U.S. troops for certain security guarantees from the Taliban. Trump called the talks \"dead\" last week. The committee has four other hearings lined up for Wednesday. In the morning, climate activist Greta Thunberg testifies to the committee on climate change, and David Stilwell, assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, testifies on U.S. policy in the Asia-Pacific region. Later that afternoon, the committee calls outside experts to testify on the threat of domestic white nationalist terrorism. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has a similarly busy schedule, with two policy hearings, a nominations hearing, and a business hearing scheduled for this week.  The committee calls Stilwell to testify Wednesday on Hong Kong and U.S. policy in the Indo-Pacific region. Senators are pressuring leadership to take up legislation in the next few weeks supporting protestors in Hong Kong. Later in the afternoon, Sen. Marco Rubio presides over the first Western Hemisphere Subcommittee hearing, set to focus on U.S.Colombia relations. At the business hearing Wednesday, the committee takes up ambassadorial nominations for Serbia, Latvia, multiple Pacific island nations, Bulgaria, Romania, the Bahamas, and the U.S. position at the Office of the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva. Also on Wednesday, the committee considers Marshall Billingslea for undersecretary of State for Democracy and Human Rights, and Darrell Issa for the director of the International Development Finance Corporation, along with posts at the Broadcasting Board of Governors and the International Development Finance Corporation. The Senate Armed Services Committee calls outside experts to testify Tuesday on Southeastern Europe. The committee continues to negotiate with the House Armed Services Committee over the defense policy bill. ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT The battle between fossil-fuel allies and representatives of ethanol-producing corn country is likely to return to the spotlight this week. President Trump is approaching a self-imposed deadline Monday to unveil a Renewable Fuel Standard reform package amid an ongoing outcry from agricultural communities over Environmental Protection Agency blending exemptions for oil refiners. The RFS that mandates 15 billion gallons of ethanol are blended into U.S. gasoline annually. But the Trump administration has dramatically increased the number of exemptions doled out to refiners, who say they oppose the standard over logistical and financial burden. Ethanol supports say the exemptions slash 1 billion gallons of required blending. Last week, Trump met with key stakeholders in the debate, including the CEOs of refiners Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum, as well as Sen. Chuck Grassley and other influential corn-state senators. Details of the potential package are murky. Meanwhile, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is set to testify before the House Science, Space and Technology Committee on Thursday. Wheeler may field questions on ethanol blending, but the hearing is focused on the EPAs general treatment of science and technology. The agency has come under repeated fire from Democrats and environmental groups over climate-related and public-health regulations. On Wednesday, a House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee will convene a hearing on the Trump administrations priorities under the Clean Water Act. The EPA, along with the Army Corps of Engineers, finalized a rule last week to repeal the Obama-era Clean Water Rule, which expanded federal authority to regulate bodies of water. Also on Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change will hold a hearing on the path to a net-zero carbon economy, while a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee and the climate select committee holds a hearing on global solutions to climate change. On the other side of the Capitol, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday will look into legislation to boost U.S. production of critical minerals, many of which are used in clean energy products. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, chairman of the committee, and Sen. Joe Manchin, the top Democrat, sponsor the American Mineral Security Act, legislation to assess reserves and expedite mine permitting. HEALTH House lawmakers will continue their scrutiny of how the U.S. government is treating unaccompanied immigrant children. The House Appropriations Labor and Health and Human Services Subcommittee is holding a hearing Wednesday on the mental health needs of children in the Health and Human Services Department's custody. There will be witnesses from the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement and the Office of Inspector General. On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee will also hold a hearing on the treatment of unaccompanied children, including testimony from Customs and Border Protection and the HHS Office of Inspector General and Office of Refugee Resettlement. Both hearings come after the OIG reported earlier this month that facilities housing unaccompanied minors had challenges in addressing the mental health needs of children who had experienced trauma, such as fleeing violence or being separated from their parents. National Journal has also reported on the issues of mental health care in shelters housing immigrant children. Members of the House Veterans Affairs Committee on Wednesday will examine how hiring and retention challenges at the Veterans Affairs Department impact patient care. Lawmakers will look at how pay, cost of living, and administrative barriers impact the VAs hiring abilities. The House Energy and Commerce Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee on Thursday will hold a hearing regarding pharmaceutical product hopping, when a company reformulates or modifies a drug in order to avoid generic competition. According to the Federal Trade Commission, a company can withdraw its original product, forcing patients to use the reformulated version, and enabling the company to keep its market exclusivity. TAXES AND TRADE U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer delivered his responses to House Democrats concerns on the new North American trade agreement on Wednesday, setting the stage for crucial meetings this week. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement working group of Democratic lawmakerswho are are focused on the deal's provisions on labor, the environment, prescription drugs, and the enforcement mechanismwill gather to assess the reply, and then will meet with Lighthizer. The Trump administration is pushing to pass the trade agreement this fall.  On Thursday, House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee Chairman John Lewis will hold a hearing on how the tax code subsidizes hate. Witnesses have not been announced, but lawmakers will likely listen to testimony on white-supremacist organizations with tax-exempt status. TECHNOLOGY Federal antitrust enforcers are likely to get an earful from senators during a Tuesday oversight hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. FTC Chairman Joseph Simons will join Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division, for a meeting to examine enforcement of the antitrust laws. And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concern that enforcementespecially when it comes to the technology industryhas been lacking. Wide-ranging antitrust probes recently announced by state attorneys general against Facebook and Google have convinced many senators that the FTC and DOJ are dragging their feet on competition issues related to big tech. Theyve suggested theyll use their oversight authorities to browbeat federal regulators into following the states leadand on Tuesday, theyll have that chance. Some lawmakers may go one step further and question whether federal agencies are up to the task of policing Facebook, Google, or other giant tech firms. Last week, Sen. Josh Hawley repeatedly told reporters hes worried that the structure of the FTC may not lend itself to pursuing strenuous antitrust actions targeting the tech industry. The industry is itself slated for its own Senate drubbing this week. On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee will meet with representatives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter for a hearing on the companies efforts to remove violent and extremist content from their platforms. All three companies, but especially Facebook and Twitter, have come under serious scrutiny for their failure to crack down on terrorist and white-nationalist content, as well as content that promotes mass violence.  The debate over the tech industrys response to violent content is part of a broader discussion surrounding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants broad legal liability protections to the tech platforms for content posted by their users. Elements of both the right and left are now seeking to dismantle some or all of those protections, in a bid to impose their own preferred content-moderation policies on the platforms. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology meets Wednesday for a hearing on developing NASA capabilities for deep-space exploration. On Thursday, the same committee meets for a hearing on how to better engage American students in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. WHITE HOUSE Lots of politics, a little pomp, and a dash of foreign policy are on President Trumps schedule this week. On Monday, he presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to yet another one of his sports heroes, former New York Yankee pitcher Mariano Rivera, before welcoming Bahrains Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa to the White House. In the evening, its off to Albuquerque for a political rally. On Tuesday and Wednesday, hell be in California to raise political money in Palo Alto, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Back in Washington on Friday, he will throw a state dinner for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-681479</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2G-YT51-JBNW-300Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2388\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

But there s no continuing resolution to put off the advance of a pandemic or to calm the uproar over the killing of unarmed Black people by police.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The House passed on Thursday its version of policing reform legislation. That bill won t advance in the Senate, which <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/707795/gridlock-on-police-reform-highlights-broken-legislative-process\"> failed </url>to pass its own version a day before when Democrats opposed a procedural vote. So far, there is little talk of lawmakers working out a deal this week ahead of a two-week Independence Day recess. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I d say it s on the backburner for a good while, because I don t think there d be any attempt to do anything else when you put a kind of quietus on the process,  Republican Sen. Mike Braun said Thursday of the failed Senate effort.</p><p>Momentum on a bill is  dissipating as we speak,  Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate bill s sponsor, said Thursday. So far, Democrats are sticking to their legislation, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling the Senate effort  toothless. </p><p> The Senate has to do better,  Pelosi told reporters Friday.  So it isn t about this whole thing of equivalence,  why can t you work together,  because they don t share their values on this subject. Not yet, but I hope that they will. </p><p>On Monday, the House will vote on legislation to expand the Affordable Care Act. The measure would expand ACA subsidies for health care premiums, increase federal Medicaid funding, and outlaw so-called junk health plans, among other changes. </p><p>The move is a tack to the center compared to calls for Medicare-for-all, but won t get much attention in the Republican Senate. Still the vote serves to contrast Democrats  health care policy priorities from the administration ahead of the November election, and as cases from COVID-19 spike. The vote also comes as the White House asks the Supreme Court to strike down the ACA in its entirety as part of a case the court will hear this fall. </p><p>The House will likely vote on Monday on two bills the chamber debated after the final votes on Friday. Rep. Josh Gottheimer s Protecting Your Credit Score Act of 2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5332\"> H.R. 5332 </url>, would revamp requirements for credit-reporting agencies.</p><p>The House will also vote Monday on a Congressional Review Act resolution meant to <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/707834/house-steps-into-fight-over-changes-to-anti-redlining-rule\"> roll back </url> a rule that would weaken a key anti-redlining law. The Senate isn t likely to advance that measure, however.</p><p>Later in the week, the House will vote on The Moving Forward Act, a $1.5 trillion infrastructure package. The rules committee is <url normalizedValue=\"https://rules.house.gov/news/announcement/meeting-announcement-hr-2-moving-forward-act\"> set </url> on Monday to consider the bill, which would provide funds for updating roads and bridges, reducing traffic congestion, and a series of green initiatives. The president has suggested he s open to an infrastructure package, but hasn t provided details. Senate Republicans have balked at the price tag of the House Democrats  legislation.</p><p>Senators this week will turn to the National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate voted <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00127\"> 90-7 </url> on Thursday to squash progressive Democrats  filibuster and end debate on the motion to proceed the annual military bill, teeing up a Monday afternoon vote to take it up. </p><p>Senate Armed Services Chairman James Inhofe said last week that he hoped to pass the $741 billion package by Thursday. Senators filed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4049/amendments?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22national+defense+authorization+act%22%5D%7D&amp;r=9&amp;s=2&amp;pageSize=100&amp;page=1\"> 529 amendments </url> before Friday s deadline.

That will include calls to pass bills on housing and rental assistance, hazard pay for essential workers, and relief for small businesses, schools, and state and local governments.</p><p> Democrats are not going to wait until late July to bring some attention to COVID-related issues,  Schumer said. </p><p>With circuit courts as of last week lacking any vacancies for the first time in at least four decades, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/the-judicial-conferences-recommendation-for-more-judgeships\"> a hearing </url> on Tuesday on the Judicial Conference s recommendation that Congress create more positions on the federal bench in order to address those jurisdictions  caseload backlog. </p><p>Federal judges, including Chief Justice John Roberts, last year urged Congress to add nearly <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/705093/senate-republicans-push-to-grow-federal-judiciary\"> two dozen new judgeships </url> for the president and Senate to fill.

The topline figure on the House <url normalizedValue=\"https://armedservices.house.gov/_cache/files/4/c/4c91c1c0-d977-46bb-9a4b-3c0d4775ffbb/35D45A722F7BFAD3E36A9B95A88F6809.fy21-ndaa-chairman-s-mark-summary-vfinal.pdf\"> legislation </url> is $731.6 billion, below the $740.5 billion       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FY%2021%20NDAA%20Summary.pdf\"> authorized </url> in the Senate. </p><p>The two bills contain many similarities, like boosted funding for the new Pacific Deterrence Initiative, and heightened focus on artificial intelligence. Ranking Republican Mac Thornberry has said he could support the bill as written, although Democrats are likely to add more contentious amendments during the markup.</p><p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee convenes remotely Tuesday to hear expert testimony on pandemic-response reforms. Lawmakers are considering legislation that would reorganize the federal bureaucracy and pump money into the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development for pandemic response abroad, and heard from Trump administration officials last week. Democrats are <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/707830/who-exit-looms-over-pandemic-response-reforms\"> wary </url> of endorsing reforms that would undermine the World Health Organization following Trump s move to withdraw.</p><p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee calls Brian Bulatao, a top State Department official, to testify on the firing of inspector general Steven Linick Thursday. Linick said during testimony to the committee that he felt  bullied  at times by Bulatao, who attempted to convince him to drop an investigation of emergency arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>According to a recent <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Foreign Policy </emphasis>story, the Trump administration is <url normalizedValue=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/25/trump-end-review-weapons-sales-congress/\"> considering </url> ending the decades-old practice of informally notifying arms sales to Congress.</p><p>The committee holds two other hearings, both about China. Members hear testimony Tuesday from experts on China s maritime ambitions, and Wednesday on the implications of China s national security law for Hong Kong. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently determined that Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous from mainland China to merit special privileges under U.S. law. The State Department announced sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for undermining Hong Kong s autonomy Friday.</p><p>Hong Kong will also feature in the upcoming floor debate in the Senate over the NDAA, where Sens. Pat Toomey and Chris Van Hollen intend to file legislation as an amendment to the bill that would impose secondary sanctions on Chinese banks. The legislation passed the Senate through voice vote last Thursday, and Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Inhofe has expressed support for the measure.</p><p>Inhofe s floor <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnILvGikwQM&amp;feature=youtu.be\"> speech </url> last week prefacing debate focused almost entirely on China.</p><p>Following a bombshell <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New York Times</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/russia-afghanistan-bounties.html\"> report </url> that a Russian military intelligence unit offered Taliban-linked militants bounties for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan and that the president was briefed on it, and has not authorized a response       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/news/press/release/following-bombshell-nyt-report-that-russia-offered-afghan-militants-bounties-to-kill-us-troops-gillibrand-demands-joint-congressional-investigation\"> some </url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SenDuckworth/status/1277045037071765506\"> lawmakers </url> are calling for hearings and a congressional investigation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</emphasis></p><p>House Democrats are hoping to sign off this week on their biggest climate-related legislative achievement so far this Congress.</p><p>The infrastructure package, a $1.5 trillion measure dubbed the INVEST in America Act, extends tax credits for renewable industries like wind and solar energy, as the sector hemorrhages jobs and struggles to finance projects amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>A range of provisions are also included to invest heavily in transportation sector electrification and encourage new construction with climate change-resistant materials.

Lawmakers and experts continue to lock horns over the environmental rollbacks in the law and the need for domestic production, rather than simply shifting import supply chains away from China. U.S. production of  critical minerals  has tanked since the country led the world decades ago.</p><p>The House Natural Resources Committee will also hold a virtual hearing Monday titled  The U.S. Park Police Attack on Peaceful Protesters at Lafayette Square.  Park police cleared out protestors near the park in front of the White House on June 1 to pave the way for President Trump to stage a photo-op outside of St. John s Church. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH</emphasis></p><p>The Trump administration last week filed a brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the entirety of the Affordable Care Act should be knocked down. The Justice Department said because the individual mandate penalty was removed, the rest of the law is invalidated.</p><p> The entire ACA thus must fall with the individual mandate,  the administration states.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence said Friday during a press briefing with the Coronavirus Task Force that  there may be a tendency among the American people to think that we are back to that place that we were two months.   We re in a much better place. </p><p>COVID-19 cases, meanwhile, continue to<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/16/816707182/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s\"> climb </url> in states such as Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma. </p><p> We want the American people to understand that it s almost inarguable that more testing is generating more cases,  said Pence.  To one extent or another, the volume of new cases coming in is a reflection of a great success in expanding testing across the country. </p><p>Top health officials will update members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Tuesday about the federal government s response to COVID-19. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield, Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir, and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn will testify.</p><p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will also have a hearing via videoconferencing on the U.S. international pandemic preparedness and response.</p><p>The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee holds a hearing to look at COVID-19 s impact on the U.S. territories. House members representing the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam will testify.</p><p>In the House, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee will have a remote hearing Tuesday on a slew of legislation to address mental health, including the Telemental Health Expansion Act, the Suicide Prevention Act, and the Mental Health Parity Compliance Act.</p><p>The COVID-19 response in American Indian communities will be evaluated during an oversight hearing with the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on Wednesday. Senators will also consider legislation to expand the Federal Tort Claims Act coverage to urban Indian health organizations, which are currently not included and have to cover liability costs.</p><p>Then on Thursday, the Senate appropriations subcommittee with oversight of the Health and Human Services Department will look at Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration s initiative to rapidly develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine. Senators will hear from Redfield, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority Acting Directory Gary Disbrow.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAXES AND TRADE</emphasis></p><p>The Senate Finance Committee will hold a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/2020-filing-season-and-irs-covid-19-recovery\"> hearing </url> Tuesday on the impact of COVID-19 on the 2020 tax-filing season. IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig is the sole witness.</p><p>The IRS already pushed back the April 15 filing deadline to July 15, but is considering moving it again to Sept. 15, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg last week.</p><p>The hearing also comes on the heels of a Government Accountability office <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-20-625\"> report </url> released last week showing that the Treasury Department and IRS made coronavirus stimulus payments of up to $1,200 each to more than a million deceased individuals.</p><p>The Finance Committee s subcommittee on international trade, customs and global competitiveness will<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/censorship-as-a-non-tariff-barrier-to-trade\"> hear </url> from experts Tuesday on how censorship can be a nontariff barrier to trade.

The hearing was postponed from March 3.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECHNOLOGY</emphasis></p><p>The congressional effort to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, big tech s primary legal shield, is set to move forward in a big way on Thursday. The Senate Judiciary Committee plans to mark up the EARN IT Act, legislation that ties the tech platforms  legal liability protections to government-approved efforts to combat child sex abuse material online. The bill is controversial, not least because it s viewed by many as a backdoor for the federal government to break end-to-end encryption techniques. </p><p>A separate, more moderate Section 230 reform effort supported by top members of the Senate Commerce Committee was also <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/H1YWxzsgUA\"> introduced </url> last week, suggesting lawmakers could soon split along committee lines.</p><p>The Senate Finance Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness meets Tuesday for a hearing into how the online-censorship practices of China and other authoritarian countries constitutes a nontariff barrier to international trade. As the trade war between Washington and Beijing escalated, the U.S. tech industry has become increasingly vocal about Chinese censorship laws they say deny digital platforms and services the opportunity to compete in the Chinese marketplace. </p><p>Monday s marathon markup in the House Rules Committee of the INVEST Act a massive infrastructure bill being pushed by House Democrats includes several amendments designed to boost broadband deployment in rural and underserved areas. The original bill already sets aside billions in additional funding for broadband infrastructure projects, a longtime policy goal for lawmakers in both parties.</p><p>The House Small Business Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital Access meets Thursday for a hearing on supply chain resiliency, a key issue for a U.S. tech industry heavily dependent on equipment and components manufactured in China and other nations still roiled by the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>The Senate Committee on Banking, House, and Urban Affairs meets Tuesday for a hearing on the digitization of money and payments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITE HOUSE</emphasis></p><p>President Trump has few events on his public schedule as he heads into the week ending in Independence Day celebrations in South Dakota and Washington.

The House passed the CR last week, 301-123. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The CR is necessary because neither chamber approved all 12 funding bills in time. The House has passed 10 of them so far, but the Senate hasn t passed any. The Senate Appropriations Committee passed four of their bills unanimously this month, but <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/681592/democrats-promising-fall-border-battle\"> Democrats last week blocked a package </url> of defense and domestic appropriations bills touched by President Trump s push to fund physical barriers on the southern border. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senate appropriators in the meantime are scheduled to mark up legislation for the Homeland Security, Interior, and Justice Departments as well as the Environmental Protection Agency in subcommittee meetings Tuesday before the full committee considers those bills as well as that for Congress's funding Thursday. </p><p> I hope we can reboot this process and move forward for the sake of our Senate process, for the sake of stable funding for the federal government, and for the sake of our nation's security,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday. </p><p>The Senate is also expected to vote on a privileged <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/54/text\"> resolution </url> ending Trump s emergency declaration that authorized the reprogramming of military construction funds to pay for border barriers. The Pentagon has diverted       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/681411/senators-face-tough-vote-on-diverting-funds-from-local-military-projects\"> over $1 billion </url> from domestic projects, but the resolution s supporters said last week they anticipate the final result will be similar to when the same gambit failed to garner the two-thirds majority necessary to overturn Trump s first veto. </p><p>The House will also tackle border issues this week when it takes up Rep. Veronica Escobar s <url normalizedValue=\"https://escobar.house.gov/sites/escobar.house.gov/files/One-page.pdf\"> bill </url> tightening oversight of Homeland Security Department programs on the border. House leaders pulled the bill in July after other immigration measures were added to the legislation in committee, prompting pushback from some moderate Democrats.</p><p> It became more of an immigration bill than a DHS oversight bill in the process, and the bigger it got, the harder it was to try to get quick agreement on it to move,  Escobar said Thursday.</p><p>The bill is now pared to its original form and Democrats will pursue the other immigration issues separately, Escobar said. The House will also take up Rep. Lauren Underwood s U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act, which sets tighter medical standards when caring for immigrants at the border.</p><p>The Senate s first order of business Monday will be breaking the filibuster on Brian McGuire s nomination to be a deputy undersecretary at the Treasury Department. McConnell had planned to do so Thursday after McGuire, a former McConnell chief of staff, passed out the Finance Committee <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Results%20of%20Executive%20Session%20of%20July%2031,%202019.pdf\"> in July </url> with only Democratic Sen. Bob Casey objecting. But fellow Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul blocked McConnell s request to expedite the confirmation.</p><p> For many years, Senator Paul has advocated to amend tax treaties to protect the privacy of American citizens,  a Paul spokesman said.  Recently, the Department of Treasury has been less than responsive, and Senator Paul has decided to vote against some of their nominees. There is no animosity toward this specific nominee. </p><p>McConnell on Thursday also teed up votes to confirm a number of executive-branch nominees, including Joseph Cella s bid to be ambassador to five Pacific island nations, Daniel Jorjani to be the Interior Department s solicitor, and David Black to be a deputy commissioner of Social Security.</p><p>Nomination work will also continue in committee. The HELP Committee will meet Tuesday to consider advancing Eugene Scalia s nomination as Labor secretary. McConnell s office said Friday that his nomination, as well as that of Air Force Gen. John Hyten s bid to be vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff despite <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/680519/senate-panel-balances-discretion-oversight-in-sexual-assault-investigation\"> allegations of sexual misconduct </url>, could see floor action as soon as this week.</p><p>The Judiciary Committee on Thursday is also expected to advance six district-judge nominees and 5th Circuit nominee Sul Ozerden, despite some Republicans  skepticism of the potential appeals judge. </p><p> I think he ll make it,  Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said of Ozerden.</p><p>In the House, the Judiciary Committee s schedule is packed. The panel will hold a hearing on banning assault weapons Wednesday. Rep. David Cicilline is close to getting the key 218 cosponsors for his assault-weapons bill and has been <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/681264/cicilline-gun-groups-court-moderate-dems-on-assault-weapons-ban\"> seeking </url> more moderate Democrats to sign on to the legislation. </p><p>Judiciary will also convene hearings on potential presidential violations of the emoluments clause, oversight of the administration s failed ban on immigrants from majority Muslim countries, and voting-rights issues.</p><p>The full House will take its first votes Tuesday rather than Monday to accommodate funeral arrangements for Emily Clyburn, House Majority Whip James Clyburn s wife, who died Thursday.</p><p>The House Intelligence Committee is set for a blockbuster <url normalizedValue=\"https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=693\"> hearing </url> Thursday as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is set to testify on the whistleblower complaint related to the Trump administration s contact with an undisclosed foreign leader.</p><p>Less likely to hit the Senate floor before a two-week recess is any legislation to address the recent spate of mass shootings that marred the summer state-work period. Senate Republicans still await word from the White House on what Trump would support, as lawmakers continue to push for modification to existing <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/681447/senators-from-states-with-mass-shootings-zero-in-on-background-checks\"> background-check and red-flag laws </url>.</p><p> The longer it goes, the more difficult it becomes,  said Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. </p><p>Here s what else is on tap this week:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY</emphasis></p><p>House and Senate conferees continue formal negotiations over the massive National Defense Authorization Act this week.</p><p>The committees still hopes to complete the legislation by the end of the month, but will have to hash out agreements on a number of sticking points, the most prominent being whether to allow border construction with Pentagon funds. The issue derailed the defense appropriations package last week. </p><p>Other hot-button issues include whether to backfill accounts diverted for border construction, fund new  low-yield  nuclear weapons, stand up the Space Force as the sixth branch of the military, and whether to prohibit funding for war with Iran. The Senate will vote on a number of nonbinding  motions to instruct  conferees on the most controversial issues this week. Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Jim Inhofe has reportedly prepared a slimmed down package if the conferees cannot resolve the disputes.</p><p> The bills are very similar except for where they re different,  House Armed Services Committee chair Adam Smith quipped to reporters Thursday, before conferees held their first official meeting.</p><p>The Senate and House foreign-affairs committees mark up the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act this week. Speaker Pelosi told reporters that she intends to move the bill  as soon as possible.  </p><p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee marks up several other bills at its business hearing on Wednesday, which would add wildlife trafficking to the State Department s whistleblower reward program, penalize governments that sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China, commit funding for marine debris reduction, and reauthorize the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.</p><p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee marks up non-binding resolutions that condemn China s interference in Hong Kong s affairs, support global health funding, and call for the release of United States citizen Paul Whelan from Russia.</p><p>Back in the Senate, Sen. Mitt Romney calls cochairs of the Syria Study Group, Michael Singh and Dana Stroul, to testify Wednesday on the report to the Near East, South Asia, Central Asia and Counterterrorism Subcommittee. The same day, the full committee hears from State Department officials on how U.S. policy in Mexico and Central America affects migration to the U.S. Mexico border.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</emphasis></p><p>Lawmakers are aiming to polish off a fiscal 2020 defense-authorization bill this week, and the legislation could be a change in federal regulation of a family of chemicals that scientists claim causes a wide range of illness and even death.</p><p>The House and Senate authorization bills, which lawmakers are now reconciling, both prohibit by 2023 the military use of firefighting foams that contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, often referred to as PFAS.</p><p>Still, those negotiating a final bill will have to muscle past White House and chemical-industry opposition to the PFAS phaseouts. The PFAS family, dubbed  forever chemicals  due to the unique length of time they stay in human bodies and the environment, are known for their heat-resistant and nonstick properties.</p><p>Public-health officials, however, say groundwater and other contamination leads to liver damage, cancer, and other adverse health effects.</p><p>Democrats, along with some Republicans, are also pushing language on the defense-authorization bill to designate all PFAS as hazardous chemicals under Superfund law, which could lead to huge cleanup liabilities for the private sector. That language passed as part of the House legislation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell teed up a top Interior Department nomination for floor confirmation this week. Daniel Jorjani, the acting DOI solicitor, is tapped to take over the post permanently. Senators from both sides of the aisle have criticized Jorjani for revising Freedom of Information Act policy to limit mandatory responses.</p><p>Also in the Senate, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee will mark up several bills Wednesday that supporters say could play a critical in curbing greenhouse-gas emissions. The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2019, legislation known as Portman-Shaheen, will be on the agenda, as will the Better Energy Storage Technology Act.</p><p>Portman-Shaheen, led by Sens. Rob Portman and Jeanne Shaheen, is a perennial bill that boosts building-code standards and strengthens public-private partnerships designed to limit energy use in manufacturing processes. The Best Act, sponsored by Sens. Susan Collins and Martin Heinrich, among others, would boost Energy Department research into batteries and other energy storage, which is currently an impediment to renewable energy-deployment. </p><p>And a Senate Appropriations subcommittee will mark up the upper chamber s fiscal 2020 Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency spending bill Tuesday. That account is traditionally one of the most controversial, but last year senators rallied together to pass a bipartisan bill out of committee.</p><p>On the House side, the Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing Thursday to examine  The Department of the Interior s Failure to Cooperate with Congressional Oversight Requests.  Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva has recently threatened to subpoena the department over plans to relocate Bureau of Land Management headquarters in Grand Junction, Colorado. Witnesses are not yet named. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH</emphasis></p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s legislation to lower drug prices is finally here. Pelosi, along with the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committee chairs, rolled out the proposal last week that would allow the Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices. Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans immediately blasted the plan as  a socialist proposal to appease her most extreme members. </p><p>But President Trump did not echo this rhetoric.  I like Sen. Grassley s drug pricing bill very much, and it s great to see Speaker Pelosi s bill today. Let s get it done in a bipartisan way!  he tweeted.</p><p>Now, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee will hold a hearing on Pelosi s bill and a few other drug-pricing bills on Wednesday. On Thursday, the House Education &amp; Labor Committee's Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee will convene a hearing on lowering drug prices and increasing transparency.</p><p>House lawmakers will also examine the health risks associated with e-cigarettes. On Tuesday, the House Oversight and Reform Committee s Economic and Consumer Policy Subcommittee will look at the outbreak of lung illness connected to e-cigarettes, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that youth use of the products has risen. The next day, the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee will also look at the public-health threat of e-cigarettes.</p><p>The House Appropriations Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee will have a hearing Wednesday morning on the international food-assistance programs at the Agriculture Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p><p>The same morning, the House Appropriations Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee will discuss investments in medical research at health institutes. Witnesses include directors of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.</p><p>To wrap up the week, the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee will hold a hearing Thursday on the public-health consequences and costs of gun violence.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAXES AND TRADE</emphasis></p><p>The House Ways and Means Committee has a full plate of health care, trade, and tax legislation. Moving those bills, however, has been complicated. </p><p>The committee has yet to say when or if it will take up Rep. Bill Pascrell s legislation to repeal the state-and-local-tax-deduction cap implemented as part of the 2017 tax-code overhaul. Committee Chairman Richard Neal has said he s open to the legislation.</p><p>Pascrell said last week that they re working on a compromise and the repeal would be temporary, perhaps for two years.</p><p>But Pascrell will still need to convince other Democrats that the repeal won t be a giveaway to taxpayers in expensive homes.</p><p> I think some action needs to be taken about SALT, but what that action is, raises questions of,  Is it fully paid for?   Ways and Means member Rep. Lloyd Doggett asked last week.  Is it fully paid for by those at the top that are getting most of the benefits individually from a SALT repeal? </p><p>Doggett said there will be more discussion on the issue.</p><p>House Democratic members of the working group designated to negotiate a compromise on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement continue talks with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.</p><p>The working group sat down with Lighthizer on Friday to discuss his response to Democratic proposals which Lighthizer submitted to the working group in mid-September. </p><p>Neal told reporters Thursday that  we ve made headway  with the USMCA, but there are still some outstanding issues. Republicans had wanted to reach a deal by the end of this month, but Democrats are not following that schedule. House Democrats just launched a major prescription-drug-pricing plan that could compete for attention with any USMCA implementing bill, but Neal said the committee can handle the workload.</p><p> We re going to sequence these as they fall into line, but I also think that we ve made headway on the trade issue, USMCA, and we don t want to get too far out front, we need some additional agreement with the USTR, but the conversations have been very sound,  Neal said.</p><p>There are no hearings scheduled in the Senate Finance Committee. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECHNOLOGY</emphasis></p><p>The congressional effort to spur antitrust enforcers to tackle the tech industry continues apace this week. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust will meet Tuesday with Bruce Hoffman, the director of the Federal Trade Commission s Bureau of Competition, for a hearing to examine competition in digital technology markets. </p><p>FTC Chairman Joe Simons <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/681593/senate-threatens-to-carve-up-ftc-doj-over-tech-industry-inaction\"> received </url> an earful last week from the same subcommittee for his agency s perceived failure to take big tech to task, and Hoffman is unlikely to fair much better. If last week is any indication, Hoffman may even be forced to make the case that the FTC be allowed to keep the federal antitrust authorities it now shares with the Justice Department.</p><p>The full Senate Judiciary Committee meets Thursday for a markup, where lawmakers will consider advancing legislation requiring the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to ask for demographic data from patent applicants and to make that data public. Sponsored by Sens. Thom Tillis and Mazie Hirono, the IDEA Act is designed to help researchers better understand and hopefully work to close gender, racial and income gaps in patent application rates.</p><p>The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology will meet Tuesday with representatives from the National Science Foundation and others to discuss the potential disruptions artificial intelligence may cause to workforces of the future. On Thursday, the committee will take a look at the problem of online imposters and disinformation from a scientific perspective, meeting with computer scientists from academic institutions and industry to discuss an issue that grows daily in importance ahead of the 2020 elections.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission will hold its monthly open meeting on Thursday. Among other initiatives, the commission will consider allocating $950 million in subsidies for fixed and mobile-broadband-internet support for Puerto Rico. The island territory has struggled with broadband connection issues ever since Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITE HOUSE</emphasis></p><p>This is United Nations week for Trump, who will not return to Washington from New York until Thursday.</p><p>On Monday, he will snub the UN Climate Action summit for his own meeting on religious persecution. On Tuesday, he will address the opening of the General Assembly. From Monday through Wednesday he has scheduled one-on-one meetings with 12 foreign leaders, none more important than the sit-down on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose July phone conversation with Trump has plunged the White House into controversy.</p><p>On Thursday, he will headline a Republican fundraiser before returning to Washington. On Friday, he will speak at an Hispanic Heritage Month reception and he will mark the Jewish high holy days. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, begins at sundown Sept. 29.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-681654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X40-S2B1-JBNW-31XK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3095\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

And lawmakers want to know every word of Mueller's final report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents so that the Committees can proceed with their independent work, including oversight and legislating to address any issues the Mueller report may raise,  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement on Sunday.  The American people have a right to know. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats are clamoring for the full release of the report, which found no evidence Trump or his associates purposefully colluded with the Russian government s documented efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Mueller said his report  does not exonerate  Trump on the question of obstruction of justice, but Attorney General William Barr said he and outgoing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that the  investigation is not sufficient to establish  such a charge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Barr said in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/AG%20March%2024%202019%20Letter%20to%20House%20and%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committees.pdf\"> letter </url> Sunday to the judiciary committees of both chambers that he  as quickly as possible  would  release as much of the Special Counsel report as I can consistent with  Department of Justice policies and applicable law.</p><p>Congressional committees will also continue to investigate the Trump administration, picking up where Mueller left off. Chairman Jerrold Nadler <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/RepJerryNadler/status/1109913142933573632\"> said Sunday </url> that the House Judiciary Committee  will be calling Attorney General Barr in to testify   in the near future.  </p><p> I appreciate the Attorney General s   goal of producing as much information as possible, consistent with the law. I look forward to reviewing that information,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.</p><p>The rest of Congress  business remains on the calendar. The House will take a historic vote this week to override Trump s first-ever veto, of a resolution terminating his emergency order to finance a border wall.</p><p>The measure is expected to fall short of the two-thirds threshold needed to override a veto, as only 13 Republicans joined Democrats to pass the measure in the House last month. Even if it does somehow pass, the Senate is not expected to have enough votes to override a veto either.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Senate is expected to vote down a comprehensive solution to averting the worst effects of climate change, before immediately turning to a stopgap measure meant to pick up the pieces of its devastation. McConnell before the recess teed up a procedural vote on the Green New Deal, a nonbinding resolution laying out Democrats  ambitious agenda to curb the effects of climate change. Following its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/677330/the-senate-spins-as-green-new-deal-vote-approaches\"> expected failure </url>, the Senate will consider a House-passed       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.perdue.senate.gov/news/press-releases/bipartisan-senators-introduce-major-disaster-relief-package\"> relief package </url> sponsored by Senate Republicans providing $13.6 billion to recover from last year s hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural disasters. </p><p>The Senate kicks off the week Monday with a procedural vote on Bridget Bade s nomination to sit on the 9th Circuit. Bade, a magistrate judge for the District of Arizona and former assistant U.S. attorney in Phoenix, successfully passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/02.07.2019%20Results%20of%20Executive%20Business%20Meeting1.pdf\"> last month </url> with the support of all Republicans and some senior Democrats.

The body will vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a measure that would update the Equal Pay Act to try to narrow the gender pay gap. Later in the week, the House will vote on a resolution disapproving of Trump s decision to bar transgender people from serving in the military. </p><p>The Senate Commerce Aviation and Space Subcommittee will also hold an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=B9B4D54A-1085-48F4-9CA8-F0A686D3AA08\"> oversight hearing </url> on Wednesday with testimony from federal transportation officials in light of recent Boeing 737 Max aircraft crashes.</p><p>Here s what else is on tap this week:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY</emphasis></p><p>Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford testify Tuesday to the House Armed Services Committee on the Pentagon s 2020 budget request. Democrats are likely to focus on Trump s decision to divert funding for the construction of a border wall. Marine Commandant Gen. Robert Neller recently warned in a leaked letter that the diversion of funds is causing  unacceptable risk\" to combat readiness. The Pentagon has not released a definitive list of projects that would be defunded.</p><p>Shanahan is also embroiled in a scandal of his own, which Democrats may seize on. The Pentagon inspector general launched an investigation Wednesday into whether Shanahan promoted his former employer of three decades, Boeing, over companies competing for government contracts. Shanahan has recused himself from any matters involving the company since entering government, and has pledged to cooperate with the investigation.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testifies to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, another hearing primed for controversy. Pompeo has not testified to the House since May of last year, when the chamber was still in Republican control.</p><p>The purported purpose of the hearing, the State Department s 2020 budget request, is also likely to generate fireworks. As in prior budget requests, Trump has called for dramatic cuts to the international-affairs budget that Congress is unlikely to authorize. </p><p>Before the Pompeo hearing, the committee holds four hearings Tuesday on the Trump administration s proposal to alter regulations on firearms exports, corruption in South America, U.S. Africa relations, and the U.S. Europe relationship.</p><p>The Armed Services Committee holds its more routine policy hearings after Shanahan s testimony on Tuesday morning. Later that afternoon, the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee hears testimony from Navy officials on the 2020 budget. On Wednesday, Commander Adm. Philip Davidson of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command testifies on activity in the region, and the Military Personnel Subcommittee hears testimony on compensation and duty status for reservists. </p><p>The Strategic Forces Subcommittee holds a hearing Thursday on the Pentagon s nuclear policy in fiscal 2020, and the Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee gets an update on the Pentagon s 2020 budget request for science and technology programs.</p><p>In the Senate, the most notable witness is Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who testifies Thursday on the Energy Department s atomic-energy defense programs.</p><p>His testimony is part of a busy week for the Senate Armed Services Committee, which holds five hearings. Members will hear Tuesday from Army Secretary Mark Esper and Chief of Staff Mark Milley on the Army s 2020 budget and the Future Years Defense Program, and from cyberspace-industry experts on the defense industrial base. Top Navy officials testify Wednesday to the Seapower Subcommittee on the Navy s shipbuilding plans and the 2020 budget, and Air Force officials speak to the Strategic Forces Subcommittee on the space program. </p><p>The Foreign Relations Committee holds hearings Tuesday on Russia's involvement in the long-simmering Ukraine conflict, and on U.S. policy toward North Korea.</p><p>And the committee considers three nominees on Wednesday, including two top positions in the understaffed State Department: Brigadier Gen. David Stilwell to be assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and Robert Destro to be assistant secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</emphasis></p><p>Many Democrats are already signaling they ll vote  present  on the controversial Green New Deal <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/677330/the-senate-spins-as-green-new-deal-vote-approaches\"> resolution </url>, a maneuver they deployed last Congress on a Medicare-for-all vote, and one that s gotten the OK from backers of action on climate change. Meanwhile, Republicans are feverishly highlighting the specific proposals in the resolution. Speaking on the Senate floor earlier this month, McConnell called the Green New Deal  garden-variety 20th-century socialism. </p><p>When the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee holds its confirmation hearing Thursday for Acting Interior Secretary Bernhardt, Democrats, who have called for the Interior Department to release more information about its anticipated offshore-drilling plan, are expected to highlight Bernhardt s work as an energy-industry lobbyist. </p><p>In the House, the Natural Resources Committee will hear from Interior officials Wednesday on the 2020 budget.</p><p>The same day, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Water and Power Subcommittee holds a hearing on the Colorado River drought contingency plan, which states are pushing for Congress to implement. The House Natural Resources Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Subcommittee will meet on the same issue Thursday morning. That subcommittee also meets Tuesday for a legislative hearing regarding several bills on wildlife conservation.</p><p>On Tuesday afternoon, the House Natural Resources Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee will discuss the need to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain. The subcommittee also holds a hearing Thursday on abandoned-mine reclamation.</p><p>On Thursday, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will meet to examine the federal response to the risks associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH</emphasis></p><p>The Trump administration s goal to promote work requirements in Medicaid hangs in the balance as D.C. District Court Judge James Boasberg is expected this week to issue a decision around the legality of Kentucky s and Arkansas s work requirements. Arkansas has received a lot of attention over the implementation of its program since more than 18,000 beneficiaries were disenrolled from the system in 2018 due to noncompliance with the new requirements.</p><p>On Tuesday, the House Budget Committee will be looking at the Health and Human Services Department's 2020 budget.</p><p>The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee will also hold a hearing on the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act to improve the exchange of electronic health information. The hearing will focus on two recent rules issued by HHS to define information blocking and to give patients more control over their records.</p><p>On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee agriculture and Food and Drug Administration subcommittee will have a hearing on the FDA s 2020 budget with outgoing Commissioner Scott Gottlieb.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAXES &amp; TRADE</emphasis></p><p>As filing season enters its final month, some taxpayers are still left wondering what will become of the 30-some expired tax breaks known as extenders. </p><p>Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Ron Wyden recently introduced legislation renewing the extenders for the 2018 and 2019 tax years, but in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/21/18274268/chuck-schumer-2020-senate-elections-interview\"> interview </url> with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vox</emphasis> last week, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will expect concessions to move an extenders bill, pointing to environmental and infrastructure issues as possible points of compromise. </p><p>The House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee is holding a <url normalizedValue=\"https://waysandmeans.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/trade-subcommittee-chairman-blumenauer-announces-subcommittee-hearing\"> hearing </url> Tuesday on creating and enforcing trade rules to benefit American workers. </p><p>The next day, the full committee will <url normalizedValue=\"https://waysandmeans.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/chairman-neal-announces-hearing-2017-tax-law-and-who-it-left-behind\"> examine </url> the 2017 tax law, one of a series of hearings looking at the impact of the GOP's overhaul.</p><p>No Senate Finance Committee hearings are scheduled for this week.</p><p>On trade, Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bwa5ffuTSs\"> told </url> the Fox Business Network in an interview aired Friday that a deal with China is getting  very close.  Chinese officials have said f are set to hold meetings in China March 28 and 29, Reuters reported Thursday. A meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping has been postponed from March until at least April, however. </p><p>The Trump administration received a Commerce Department report weeks ago on whether it can impose national security tariffs on auto imports, but hasn t released the document or announced a decision on whether to move forward with the tariffs. Some trade analysts have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/677236/controversy-over-national-security-tariffs-is-at-full-boil\"> said </url> that the administration may be waiting until a deal with China is finalized before announcing a decision. </p><p>In his Fox Business interview, Trump said the auto and auto-part imports do not pose a security risk. That, however, is likely not an indication of whether he will move forward with the tariffs.</p><p> What poses a security risk is our balance sheet,  he said.  We need a strong balance sheet; otherwise you don t have national security. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECHNOLOGY</emphasis></p><p>As the Senate looks to wrap up negotiations over draft data-privacy legislation, lawmakers want to hear from some industry players other than Facebook, Google, and the rest of the major tech platforms. </p><p>On Tuesday, the Senate Commerce Manufacturing, Trade, and Consumer Protection Subcommittee will meet for a hearing on how a federal privacy law would impact small businesses. Senators will hear from several business representatives, including from the real-estate industry and the start-up community. While most of the discussion around data privacy in Washington has centered on the misuse of personal data by Silicon Valley, experts have warned that small businesses could be hurt by compliance costs imposed via strict privacy rules. Sen. Jerry Moran, the subcommittee's chairman, recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/677416/retailers-small-businesses-caught-in-crossfire-on-data-privacy\"> suggested </url> those rules could be tweaked to accommodate small businesses.</p><p>The House Energy and Commerce Communications and Technology Subcommittee meets Tuesday to mark up the Save the Internet Act, the Democratic House's push to restore the net-neutrality protections repealed by the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission in 2017. If prior hearings on the legislation are any indication, the markup is almost certain to end in a party-line vote. Republican lawmakers have attacked the Democrats for the way they went about drafting the legislation, and are almost universally opposed to the bill's provision that internet service providers be placed back under the utility-style regulatory structure of Title II of the Communications Act.</p><p>The Energy and Commerce Consumer Protection Subcommittee meets Thursday to discuss ways to enhance vehicle technology to prevent drunk driving. While ignition interlock devices are likely to take up a significant amount of the committee s bandwidth, expect at least a few members to raise the benefits of self-driving vehicles as a way to cut down on drunk-driving accidents.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is taking a two-day look at how its enforcement priorities on issues such as privacy, information-sharing, antitrust, and artificial intelligence stack up against a fast-changing international regulatory framework on technology. Starting Monday, the FTC will hear from a slew of tech experts on the impact of different approaches to tech regulation and how commissioners can work with foreign regulators and smooth over disputes on data-sharing, antitrust, and other hot-button tech topics. </p><p>The hearings continue the commission s months-long review of its antitrust and privacy policies in light of new concerns surrounding the pervasive influence of big tech in the American economy.</p><p>The Senate Armed Services Cybersecurity Subcommittee is scheduled to examine the cybersecurity responsibilities of the defense industrial base on Tuesday. Recent reports have suggested an extensive hacking campaign by the Chinese government against American arms manufacturers, and lawmakers are likely to grill industry representatives on the protections they ve put in place to guard sensitive technological secrets from such attacks. </p><p>The House Judiciary Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Subcommittee meets Wednesday for a hearing on the lack of diversity in patents and inventorship and its effect on innovation in the U.S.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITE HOUSE</emphasis><br/></p><p>President Trump starts the week focused on the politics of a close ally and ends it tending to his own politics. On Monday morning, he will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is locked in a close reelection battle back home and hopes for a boost from Trump, who is very popular in Israel. Trump closes the day by welcoming to the White House the reigning Stanley Cup champions of the National Hockey League, the Washington Capitals. On Tuesday, he will have dinner with Netanyahu. On Wednesday, he will present the Medal of Honor posthumously to Army Staff Sgt. Travis W. Atkins, who sacrificed his own life in Iraq in 2007 when he threw himself on an insurgent just as he was detonating a bomb strapped to his body; his action saved the lives of three other American soldiers. On Thursday, the president will go to Grand Rapids, Michigan, for one of his large political rallies designed to help him win a second term.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-677506</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR6-2JK1-JBNW-30NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2792\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Senate and House Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi responded to the affront by backing out of a scheduled meeting with Trump, saying they d work with Republican congressional leaders instead. Trump has said privately that a government shutdown could be politically beneficial, according to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-tells-confidants-that-a-government-shutdown-might-be-good-for-him/2017/11/30/e5328328-d5f5-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html?utm_term=.30be1bf18c93\"> The Washington Post </url></emphasis>, even though Republicans in Congress disagree. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats have argued that they want to see an increase in domestic programs as well as a funding boost for the military. They also want to provide funding for the Children s Health Insurance Program, which provides services to 9 million children, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that provides temporary legal protection to hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the United States as children. Republicans have debated whether to pass a short-term deal for a couple of weeks or longer.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on <url normalizedValue=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-12-17-sen-mitch-mcconnell-rep/story?id=51533836\"> This Week </url> that a government shutdown would not occur.  It's just not going to happen,  he said.</p><p>McConnell also said it s  ridiculous  to not support a year-end deal that doesn t address DACA, since Trump has given Congress a March deadline for when recipients would be at risk for deportation.  There is no crisis,  he said.</p><p>But on <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-mick-mulvaney-on-face-the-nation-dec-3-2017/\"> Face the Nation </url></emphasis>, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said that the overall congressional appropriations process, in which  massive  legislation passes  all at one time or   fails all at one time,  is  sort of managing by crisis to crisis.  He then laid out all of the competing factions in Congress that threaten a shutdown.</p><p> I think there's a group of right-wingers in the House who say they want to shut the government down,  said Mulvaney.  There's a group of Democrats who want to shut the government down over DACA. And there's a group of lawmakers from some of the hurricane states who want to shut the government down until they get what they want.  </p><p> This just sheds light on the fact that the appropriations, the spending system is broken when any little group can sort of hold the government hostage,  he added.  We need to get beyond that. I think that we will, I don't think you'll see a government shutdown. </p><p>On Monday, the Senate will continue churning through nominees, holding a vote to consider Kirstjen Nielsen as Homeland Security secretary, a position left vacant once John Kelly left in July to become Trump s chief of staff. Nielsen was Kelly s top aide at DHS.</p><p>The House, meanwhile, will take up the  Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act,  a top priority of gun-rights groups that is strongly opposed by gun-control organizations. The chamber is also reportedly planning to consider a bill to fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, though that measure was not on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.majorityleader.gov/weekly-schedule/\"> the House s schedule </url> for this week as of Sunday evening.</p><p>At the same time, the two chambers will begin ironing out the differences between their two tax-reform bills. House leaders have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.majorityleader.gov/weekly-schedule/\"> scheduled </url> a vote Monday evening to move to a conference committee, and the Senate will eventually appoint conferees as well.</p><p>Here s what else is on tap:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY</emphasis></p><p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing with outside experts Tuesday on the shared authority between the executive and legislative branches over international accords.</p><p>As it continues investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, the Senate Intelligence Committee is set to hold closed briefings on Tuesday and Thursday.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet for a hearing on evolving international terrorist threats. Officials from the Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice departments, as well as from the director of National Intelligence's office, are slated to testify.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing Thursday on the Defense Department's acquisition-reform efforts. The undersecretary of Defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics and the secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force are set to appear before the panel.</p><p>That same day, the House Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to have a hearing on counterterrorism efforts in Africa featuring officials from the Defense and State departments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</emphasis></p><p>Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt will head to Capitol Hill on Thursday for the first time since his combative Senate confirmation process. Expect Republicans to praise his track record, such as initiating the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, while Democrats criticize his campaign to roll back environmental regulations. </p><p>Pruitt's work at the EPA is largely applauded among Republicans, but at least one of those lawmakers, Rep. Ryan Costello, is trying to sit in on the Energy and Commerce subcommittee panel to challenge the administrator's decision to bar former recipients of EPA grants to fill slots on the agency's advisory committees.</p><p>The House energy committee will also host the Energy Department's top electricity-grid official, Bruce Walker, on Friday to discuss the department's efforts to combat cybersecurity threats. Many lawmakers have been sounding alarm bells about grid vulnerability. Meanwhile, a House Natural Resources subcommittee will hold a hearing Thursday on updating the Interior Department's mission. </p><p>The Senate energy committee will hear testimony Tuesday from second-tier Energy and Interior department nominees. The Senate could move this week on House-passed legislation to overhaul the EPA's brownfields program.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH</emphasis></p><p>The Senate Republicans  tax-reform bill may have hit snags on the way to the vote, but the provision to effectively repeal the individual mandate was locked down after Sen. Susan Collins received some guarantees on legislation to provide cost-sharing-reduction payments and reinsurance funding would be passed separately. Some experts are not so convinced that these measures would offset the uncertainty brought to the market by getting rid of the penalty that consumers incurred if they do not obtain health insurance.</p><p>Lawmakers also have to fund the government by the end of Friday. A continuing resolution released by the House Rules Committee contains a short-term patch for CHIP to cover an  emergency shortfall state  for the rest of the year. Funding for the program ran out at the end of September. </p><p>Members of the Senate Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee will have a hearing Tuesday on the prevention, treatment, and recovery from the opioid crisis.</p><p>The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee will hear from leaders of the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration about the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAXES</emphasis></p><p>The GOP effort to overhaul the tax code has officially gotten further than their failed bid to repeal the Affordable Care Act earlier this year. </p><p>With the 51-49 Senate passage of its tax bill early Saturday morning Sen. Bob Corker was the sole  no  vote among Republicans the big question now is how lawmakers will resolve the differences between that bill and the House version, which breezed through that chamber in November.</p><p>Getting the Senate bill passed took some last-minute dealmaking, and lawmakers were massaging legislative language well into Friday night. There were 11th-hour provisions for Collins to allow a deduction for up to $10,000 in property tax and another for Sen. Ron Johnson to boost the income deduction for pass-through businesses to 23 percent from 17.4 percent.</p><p>The state and local property tax tweak likely won t meet much resistance among House members. In fact, the deduction is essentially a requirement to move the bill in that chamber, as 30-odd GOP lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York and New Jersey rallied to get the same provision inserted into their version and won t likely vote for a bill that doesn t contain something similar.</p><p>The pay-fors and the pass-through rate could be the sticking point, though.</p><p>The Senate bill delays a corporate rate cut from 35 percent to 20 percent for one year, starting it in 2019. That s something that House conservatives like Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows have opposed, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/660543/senate-tax-bill-complicates-hard-won-house-deals?mref=search-result\"> calling </url> the idea  dead on arrival  in early November.</p><p>The House version has a vastly different structure for dealing with pass-through entities, businesses that pass their profits to the owner for tax purposes. That version has a 25 percent tax rate, but with big caveats on how much of that income gets the preferential rate compared to the standard individual rate. The Senate version has a broader 23 percent deduction on pass-through income, albeit with a few guardrails to prevent wealthy individuals from gaming the system.</p><p>The House bill fully eliminates the individual and corporate alternative minimum tax, while the Senate reinstated both, but with a bigger individual exemption, as a last-minute revenue raiser, another potential pressure point.</p><p>The timing of various phase-outs for tax breaks would also need to be worked out. The House bill allows companies to fully write off the cost of certain equipment for only five years, while the Senate bill extends that period with a gradual phase out after 2022 a concession to holdout Sen. Jeff Flake. The Senate bill also phases out many individual tax breaks after 2025.</p><p>The Senate bill also effectively eliminates the Affordable Care Act s individual mandate while the House version does not, though the repeal has support from some House conservatives.</p><p>The bills are likely now to move to a conference committee to resolve differences between the two versions. Lawmakers have been adamant that they want to go to a conference, with House Speaker Paul Ryan <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/937016289448435712\"> tweeting </url> a joke to that effect Saturday morning.</p><p>And in a sign that legislation isn t finished until the president puts pen to paper, there s now a new wrinkle in the conference process: Trump hinted Saturday that the hard-fought-for, permanent, 20 percent corporate rate in both tax bills may now be flexible.</p><p> It could be 22 when it comes out but it could also be 20,  Trump said, according to a Saturday pool report.  We ll see what ultimately comes out. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECHNOLOGY</emphasis></p><p>FBI Director Christopher Wray will testify Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee as part of a routine oversight hearing. Wray is likely to face questions regarding his agency s support for a clean reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a provision that expires at the end of the month. The provision now gives the FBI the ability to access information incidentally collected on Americans without a warrant, and Congress is debating whether to curtail or entirely restrict that access. Wray is also a strong proponent of policies that would allow law enforcement officials to access the encrypted communications of suspected criminals, and may face questions on the encryption debate that periodically sweeps through Congress.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warrennand Rep. David Cicilline are both slated to speak Wednesday at an event on monopolies hosted by liberal tech group Open Markets. Warren has frequently targeted Silicon Valley s top companies for criticism, arguing that firms like Facebook and Google operate like monopolies and make it impossible for competitors to enter the market. The senator (and possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate) has recently begun making the case that big tech s top companies should be broken up to prevent further market abuses.</p><p>The House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Information Technology will meet Thursday for an oversight hearing into the Veterans Affairs Department's cybersecurity and IT systems. The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology will hold two hearings Wednesday, one into the review of the National Science Foundation s Innovation Corps and another into NASA s deployment of large telescopes. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITE HOUSE</emphasis></p><p>Trump s week features a quiet three days in Washington bracketed by two potentially controversial trips out of town. He starts Monday with travel to Utah where he will announce plans to reduce the size of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. The two monuments had been established by Democratic presidents under the 1906 Antiquities Act. On Friday, he will hold a campaign-style rally in Pensacola, Florida, only 60 miles from Alabama, site of a hotly contested Dec. 12 special Senate election. Midweek, he has a light schedule while in Washington, with a planned Cabinet meeting Wednesday and a Hanukkah reception Thursday. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-661352</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R3P-3R91-JBNW-33M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2185\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Lisa Murkowski, the term-limited chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is aiming for a big bipartisan vote. The package, which she and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin introduced just last week, is a compilation of dozens of bills that passed out of the committee last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But that hope of bipartisan consensus is hindered by staunch opposition from environmental groups, who say the research-and-development section are insufficient to address climate change. Those groups, including the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth, are also bashing sections designed to increase natural-gas exports and mining of metals such as uranium and lithium. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The amendment process for the legislation is expected to be rigorous and contentious. Democrats are likely to try to tack legislation onto the package to implement federal royalties for metal mining. Murkowski<url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/704970/mining-fight-roils-energy-package-rollout\"> considers that measure a poison pill </url>. Lawmakers are also aiming to add the Use It Act, which carves out $85 million to boost the Environmental Protection Agency support for carbon-capture technologies.</p><p>A play to put building-code language into the energy-efficiency section is likely to garner the most attention. Many Republicans oppose it, and Murkowski stripped that legislation from the bill passed out of committee. Democrats, meanwhile, say the language is critical to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. </p><p>If the package passes the Senate, it faces an even more tenuous fate in the House, where environmental groups are already leaning on climate hawks to reject it. Democrats in the House are likely to use the legislation to push a suite of clean-energy tax credits, which are a divisive issue across both chambers. </p><p>Both chambers  appropriations-subcommittee hearings roll on this week.</p><p>In the House, on Tuesday, the Agriculture and Financial Services and General Government Subcommittees will hold member days Tuesday. State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs meets on the United States Agency for International Development budget request on as well, while the Legislative Branch Subcommittee will hold a hearing on the House Officers Budget request.</p><p>The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Subcommittee holds a hearing Wednesday on the Environmental Protection Agency s budget request, while the Financial Services subcommittee examines the Treasury Department s budget request as Secretary Steven Mnuchin comes to the Hill.</p><p>Six doctors from the National Institute of Health testify Wednesday for that agency s budget request before the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson will testify on his department's budget request Wednesday, as will Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie.</p><p>As for the Senate, Transportation Security Administrator David Pekoske is scheduled to appear before the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Tuesday.</p><p>The real action is Wednesday, when three Cabinet secretaries: Elaine Chao of Transportation, David Bernhardt of Interior, and Dan Brouillette of Energy testify before separate subcommittees. That day, Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby will convene the Defense Subcommittee to hear from Pentagon officials on budget requests for the National Guard and Reserve. </p><p>Then on Thursday, appropriators will hear from Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on their respective departments  funding needs. </p><p>Lawmakers are set to vote this week on H.R. 1140, the Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act, which would grant Transportation Security Administration officers rights and protections equal to other federal workers.</p><p>Congress may also act to address the spread of the coronavirus as federal officials warn that the disease is almost certain to impact the country. Appropriators continue to negotiate on a multibillion-dollar top-line number, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have already staked their flag on certain conditions. In a joint statement Thursday, they said supplemental measures  must be entirely new funding  earmarked for fighting the virus with  strong provisions  providing affordable vaccines  to all that need it  and assistance for impacted businesses and state and local governments.</p><p>While the Senate is not scheduled to confirm any nominees this week, the Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hear from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/quick-search/nominations?wordsPhrases=&amp;wordVariants=on&amp;congresses[0]=116&amp;nomCivil=on&amp;nomOther=on&amp;pnNumbers=&amp;nomineeNames=&amp;positions=&amp;organizations=&amp;senateCommittees[0]=ssju00&amp;stateTerritories[0]=any&amp;nominationAction=85&amp;dates=datesReceivedInSenate&amp;dateOperator=equal&amp;startDate=&amp;endDate=&amp;dateIsOption=yesterday&amp;searchResultViewType=compact&amp;KWICView=false&amp;q=%7B%22congress%22:%22all%22,%22source%22:%22all%22,%22senate-committee%22:%22Judiciary%22,%22nomination-status%22:%22Referred+to+committee%22%7D&amp;pageSize=250\"> pending nominees </url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/03/04/2020/nominations\"> Wednesday </url>.</p><p>Here s what else is on tap this week:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY</emphasis></p><p>The United States and the Taliban signed a peace agreement in Doha, Qatar on Saturday, setting in motion the withdrawal of U.S. forces from America s longest-running war. The agreement requires the U.S. to draw down to 8,600 troops in-country within 135 days, roughly the same level as when Trump took office, and fully withdraw by May 2021. The Taliban, in exchange, must break ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups that could threaten the U.S. homeland.</p><p>The deal also sets up a prisoner swap of thousands of detainees on March 10, the same day that intra-Afghan talks are planned to begin. Those talks may eventually lead to a peace deal that could formally return the Taliban to the internationally recognized government.</p><p>Trump is likely to herald the agreement in his reelection campaign as proof of his ability to end America s military entanglements abroad. </p><p>No hearings have been scheduled on the deal, partly because of lawmakers  busy schedule with 2021 budgeting.</p><p>Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett kicks off the week Tuesday with testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Later in the day, defense officials testify on U.S. military policy in the Arctic, and behind closed doors on the Pentagon s cyber operations.</p><p>Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley testify to the committee Wednesday afternoon. Both faced sharp questions from House lawmakers last week about the diversion of funding to border construction, and the Navy s shipbuilding account.</p><p>Earlier that morning, lawmakers will examine vetting policies for international military students following the attack by Saudi trainees at Naval Air Station Pensacola, and Navy officials testify about shipbuilding. Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly and other top ranking Navy officials testify on Thursday. </p><p>The House Armed Services Committee has an equally rigorous schedule, with seven hearings scheduled.</p><p>Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville testify Tuesday on the 2021 budget. Later that afternoon, top Air Force officials speak on Space Force readiness, and National Nuclear Security Administration chief Lisa Gordon-Hagerty testifies on her agency's budget. The Navy s shipbuilding account was reportedly cut this year in order to boost nuclear-weapons spending.</p><p>On Wednesday, Barrett returns to Capitol Hill to brief the House Armed Services Committee, Navy officials testify on the aircraft and force-projection programs, and Gen. Paul Nakasone testifies on the U.S. Cyber Command budget. </p><p>The committee ends budget hearings Thursday with testimony from Army and Marine Corps officials on modernization programs.</p><p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee calls former U.S. government officials to testify Tuesday on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The committee marks legislation on Thursday that would reestablish an advisory council to Trump on global health, and mandate an all-of-government approach to global pandemics in light of the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>Sen. Rob Portman presides Thursday over the only Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing scheduled for the week. The State Department s counter-propaganda chief Lea Gabrielle testifies on the global disinformation threat.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</emphasis></p><p>On top of the energy bill on the Senate floor, a slew of energy and environment hearings are taking place in both chambers.</p><p>Brouillette is heading to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday to defend the White House budget for fiscal 2021. He ll likely get an earful from Democrats over White House aims to eliminate the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, a program central to the development of next-generation energy technology.</p><p>The budget boosts funding for coal innovation and carbon capture, as well as nuclear. But the White House is reversing course on funding for the permanent nuclear-waste storage at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. No funds are carved out for that purpose.</p><p>The Energy Department is largely spared from the draconian budget cuts the Trump White House repeatedly proposes. The total budget for Energy is $35.4 billion, a roughly $3 billion decrease from enacted levels.</p><p>Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler is set to testify before a House Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday. Wheeler faced fierce resistance from House Democrats during testimony last week. The budget proposal provides $6.7 billion for the EPA, a higher request than past years but $2.3 billion below the current enacted level.</p><p>Meanwhile, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is taking a pass this week. Instead, Susan Combs, assistant secretary for Policy, Management, and Budget at the Department of the Interior, will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday. Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva is threatening to subpoena the department over a Bureau of Land Management reorganization effort, as well as a discontinued study on mountaintop removal.</p><p>The White House is requesting $12.7 billion for the department, a 16 percent decrease from enacted levels.</p><p>The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is expected to approve Federal Energy Regulatory Commission General Counsel James Danly as a commissioner before the Brouillette hearing. That vote is expected to pass largely along party lines. The committee will also hold a hearing on long-term prospects for global energy markets Thursday.</p><p>And the House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on Wednesday on plastic pollution. That issue has entered into the limelight in recent months. The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s1982/BILLS-116s1982rfh.pdf\"> Save Our Seas 2.0 </url> measure passed the Senate in January. A far more aggressive bill, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3263/BILLS-116s3263is.pdf\"> Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2020 </url>, is now introduced in both chambers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH</emphasis></p><p>The U.S. saw its first fatality from the novel coronavirus COVID-19 in Washington state over the weekend. This prompted a \"Dear Colleague\" letter from Pelosi, discussing plans to get emergency supplemental funding to the floor. Globally, the coronavirus has killed around 3,000 people and sickened more than 87,500.</p><p> The supplemental must also ensure that vaccines are affordable and available to all who need them,  she wrote.</p><p>Lawmakers this week will participate in a slew of hearings focusing on the outbreak and the U.S. response. Senators on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will hear from key health officials on the response to the coronavirus Tuesday. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, Robert Kadlec and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn will testify.</p><p>This comes after the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Patty Murray, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar about reported disputes within HHS around the repatriation of American passengers infected with the disease from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.  In the midst of this domestic and global public health emergency, it is critical that public health officials and their expertise guide any and all decisions about COVID-19 preparedness and response efforts,  wrote Murray and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee top Democrat Sen. Gary Peters.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee s Aviation and Space Subcommittee will have a hearing on the role of global air-transportation companies in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. Witnesses will include the Transportation Department Acting Undersecretary for Policy Joel Szabat, CDC s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Director Nancy Messonnier, and Customs and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan.</p><p>The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Thursday holds a hearing looking at the federal interagency response to the disease outbreak and the preparations for global pandemics. Witnesses include Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary at the Homeland Security Department, and Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS.</p><p>House committees will also hold more hearings on the coronavirus, including two on Wednesday. In the morning, the House Homeland Security Committee will have a hearing looking at a response to a pandemic threat. In the afternoon, the Oversight and Reform Committee s National Security Subcommittee will look at the biodefense and response to the outbreak.</p><p>On Thursday, the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee will have a hearing on understanding the spread of infectious diseases and using  innovative solutions. </p><p>Lawmakers will also take on other public health issues this week. On Tuesday, the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee meets for a hearing on proposals to help patients with substance use disorders. The committee will look proposals like allowing states to restart Medicaid coverage for incarcerated individuals up to 30 days before their release prison.</p><p>Officials from the National Institutes of Health, including Director Francis Collins, will be on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to discuss the department's 2021 budget request with the House appropriations subcommittee that oversees the HHS budget.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAXES AND TRADE</emphasis></p><p>There s a new national taxpayer advocate on the scene, with the Treasury Department and the IRS announcing last week that Erin Collins has taken on the role permanently. Nina Olson, who held the post for 18 years, retired in August. Collins comes to the job from KPMG and the IRS chief counsel s office.</p><p>Collins has  spent the past two decades at one of the most prominent accounting firms in the country, so I d particularly like to discuss her priorities for improving IRS customer service for working folks,  Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement.</p><p>The House Ways and Means Committee meets Tuesday morning for a hearing on the 2021 budget request with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The following day, the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures gathers in the morning for a hearing to examine the impact of the tax code on Native American tribes.</p><p>The Senate Finance Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness, meanwhile, holds a hearing Tuesday on censorship as a nontariff barrier to trade. The lineup of witnesses includes actor Richard Gere, the chairman of the International Campaign for Tibet, as well as legal and think tank experts.</p><p>The United Kingdom is set to publish its formal negotiating objectives for a U.S. trade deal this week. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who met with his British counterpart, Liz Truss, in London last week, will speak on Monday evening at the Oxford Union, giving him a chance to immediately react to the UK's trade position if it's released on Monday as expected.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECHNOLOGY</emphasis></p><p>With just two weeks to go before three key provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act expire, Congress is stuck on a way forward. December s revelation that the FISA court failed to prevent the FBI from improperly surveilling a Trump 2016 campaign associate sparked bipartisan calls for reforming the law, but lawmakers have struggled to reach consensus on how far to take those reforms.</p><p>Last week, the House Judiciary Committee abruptly cancelled the markup of a Senate bill that would end the National Security Agency s controversial (and currently inactive) call detail records program. Progressive Democrats, led by Rep. Zoe Lofgren, objected to the markup without the inclusion of additional reforms. Some Republicans have also called for more far-reaching changes to FISA, despite voiced preferences by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Attorney General Bill Barr that FISA receive a clean reauthorization.</p><p>If lawmakers can t come to a consensus in time, they may move to temporarily reauthorize the three FISA provisions to provide breathing room for reform efforts. Senate Majority Whip John Thune hinted at such a move late last week.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee will hear from Huawei s two chief international competitors on Wednesday, as lawmakers look for ways to provide America s foreign allies with economical alternatives to the Chinese telecommunications giant. Scandinavian telecommunications firms Nokia and Ericsson are slated to testify regarding the security and integrity of the international telecommunications supply chain. </p><p>The Senate Finance Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness will hold a hearing Tuesday on censorship as a nontariff barrier to trade. The hearing is likely to focus heavily on how the  Great Firewall  of China Beijing s efforts to censor the internet for its citizens acts as a trade barrier for U.S. companies, particularly in the technology space. </p><p>The House Small Business Committee is holding back-to-back hearings focused on tech policy. On Tuesday, lawmakers will hear testimony from industry and legal experts on how the Supreme Court s 2018 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">South Dakota v. Wayfair </emphasis>decision which allows a state to collect online sales taxes from businesses who do not have a brick-and-mortar location within its borders has impacted small businesses. On Wednesday, lawmakers will discuss the benefits of blockchain technology for small businesses with a panel of technology experts.</p><p>The House Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce meets Wednesday for a hearing examining a variety of fake or unsafe products being sold on online marketplaces, as well as potential policy solutions.</p><p>Apple and TikTok are once again snubbing an invitation from Sen. Josh Hawley to testify regarding their ties to the Chinese government. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, Hawley is holding a hearing Wednesday on what he calls two  dangerous partners: big tech and Beijing.  The senator has previously argued that TikTok s ownership by a Chinese company, and Apple s storage of user data in China, both represent threats to the data and privacy of American citizens. Hawley introduced a bill that would ban the transfer or storage of user data and encryption keys within Chinese borders. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITE HOUSE</emphasis></p><p>Trump s week is heavy with politics. </p><p>On Monday, after meeting with the representatives of pharmaceutical companies in the afternoon, he goes to Charlotte for a political rally before North Carolina votes on Super Tuesday. On Tuesday, he will address the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference and travel to Bethesda, Maryland to visit the National Institutes of Health. On Wednesday, he will address the Hispanic business group the Latino Coalition Legislative Conference. On Thursday, he goes to Scranton, Pennsylvania, to participate in a live Fox News town hall. On Friday, he s off to Palm Beach, Florida to meet with supporters and raise campaign money.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-705040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBB-7681-DY4X-T00W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3285\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Top intelligence officials and many lawmakers have warned that the Chinese telecommunications firm's products pose a threat to national security. The provision would spike the Trump administration's agreement and reimpose penalties on ZTE, which has repeatedly violated U.S. sanctions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, meanwhile, has unveiled legislation that would limit the president s ability to impose tariffs for national security reasons, requiring congressional approval before they go into effect. Trump has invoked a national security provision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum exported by Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, sparking retaliatory tariffs on a variety of American goods. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week he won t call Corker's measure up as a freestanding bill, so it may be offered as an amendment to the NDAA.</p><p>Other potential amendments lawmakers have submitted include provisions to prohibit selling F-35 joint strike fighters to Turkey until specific conditions are met and to help states bolster their election security, among others. It s not clear yet what amendments may go ahead, and there could be procedural delays. After the NDAA passes the Senate, it will have to be reconciled with the House version and the wrangling that takes place behind closed doors can go on for months.</p><p>The early part of this week will also be dominated by news out of Singapore, where Trump will meet North Korea s Kim Jong-un. The summit is scheduled to take place at 9 a.m. local time on Tuesday 9 p.m. Monday on the East Coast. </p><p> I think I'm very well prepared,  Trump said last week.  I don't think I have to prepare very much. It's about attitude; it's about willingness to get things done. </p><p>Here s what else is on tap this week:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY</emphasis></p><p>The Senate is scheduled to vote Monday evening to open debate on the NDAA for fiscal 2019 after voting 92-4 to proceed last Thursday. </p><p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is set to consider six nominees this week: Kimberly Breier to be the assistant secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs; Kenneth George to be the ambassador to Uruguay; Joseph Mondello to be the ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago; Harry Harris to be the ambassador to South Korea; Tibor Nagy to be assistant secretary of State for African Affairs; and David Schenker to be assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. </p><p>The House Armed Services Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee will hold a hearing Wednesday on the Defense Department's aviation-mishap review and oversight process, while the Readiness Subcommittee will meet for a hearing Thursday on Navy and Air Force depot policy issues and infrastructure concerns. </p><p>The House Foreign Affairs Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee is scheduled to have a hearing Wednesday on resources in the region with officials from the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development. The full committee will gather Thursday for a hearing on democracy promotion with outside experts. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</emphasis></p><p>Environmental policy is likely to grind a bipartisan appropriations push in the Senate to a halt this week, at least temporarily. An Appropriations Committee subpanel will mark up fiscal 2019 spending legislation for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department on Tuesday, and the full committee will likely mark up the EPA and Interior bill later in the week. That legislation is notoriously divisive. </p><p>In recent years, Republicans have tacked riders onto the legislation to address wide-ranging EPA and Interior policy, such as carbon emissions and Endangered Species Act regulations. The House Appropriations Committee passed an EPA and Interior bill last week along party lines. Even Rep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate Democrat who often sides with Republicans on environmental policy, opposed the bill.</p><p>Democrats criticized the legislation s $100 million cut to the EPA budget, a figure well short of the White House call to cut the agency budget by more than $2 billion. The legislation also includes a set of riders, including controversial language to repeal the EPA s Clean Water Rule, which Administrator Scott Pruitt is aiming to trash and replace in the coming months.</p><p>Senate Republicans haven t released their EPA and Interior bill publicly ahead of the markup. The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a range of appropriations bills with overwhelming bipartisan support in recent weeks. </p><p>Also on Tuesday, all five members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will testify before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Expect lawmakers to grill the FERC commissioners over a recent White House directive to devise a plan to bail out financially embattled coal and nuclear plants. The Energy Department is now charged with that task, but FERC, an independent commission that regulates energy markets, would presumably play a role.</p><p>Meanwhile, a House Energy and Commerce subpanel will hold a hearing Thursday on anti-terrorism safeguards at chemical facilities. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives concluded that a deliberate fire sparked a 2013 explosion at a West, Texas chemical facility that killed 15 people.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH</emphasis></p><p>President Trump s Department of Justice has decided it will not defend key portions of the Affordable Care Act from a lawsuit that aims to knock down the law. The DOJ targets provisions that guarantee coverage for everyone, regardless of health status, and the limitations on how much insurance companies can vary premiums based on health status, gender, and age.</p><p>In a brief filed last week, the DOJ asked the court to enter  a declaratory judgment that the ACA s provisions containing the individual mandate as well as the guaranteed issue and community-rating requirements will all be invalid beginning on January 1, 2019. </p><p>On Capitol Hill, the House is expected to start considering legislation to address the opioid epidemic. </p><p> This month, the House is poised to pass meaningful reforms that collectively can make a real difference in our communities. These bills will bolster enforcement efforts to protect our communities, advance prevention and public health efforts, and address coverage and payment issues within Medicare and Medicaid,  House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden and Health Subcommittee Chairman Michael Burgess wrote in an op-ed for Fox News on Wednesday.</p><p>On the other side of Congress, the Senate Finance Committee will hold an executive session on its legislation to address opioid addiction in Medicare and Medicaid, the Helping to End Addiction and Lessen Substance Use Disorders Act of 2018.</p><p>The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee will examine Trump s drug-pricing blueprint on Tuesday, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will testify.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAXES</emphasis></p><p>Summer is in full tilt on Capitol Hill. Congress celebrated seersucker Thursday last week, lawmakers are preparing for their midterm fights, and the Senate is realizing it has way more on its plate than it has time to clear by November.</p><p>So when will tax writers find the time to cross off items on their growing To-Do list?</p><p>McConnell announced last week that the upper chamber would be working through most of August. Much of that time will be devoted to appropriations bills and confirming judicial nominees. </p><p>Theoretically, though, that expanded schedule could be used to take up two items important to tax world: confirming IRS commissioner nominee Charles Rettig and advancing the House-passed bill overhauling the IRS administration. Lawmakers haven t yet given any timeline for those items yet, though Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch has said he d like to hold a hearing on Rettig s nomination  soon. </p><p>Before that, however, Hatch s committee will hold a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/hearing-to-consider-pending-nominations-\"> hearing </url> this Tuesday on the nomination of several tax-court judges and for Jeffrey Kessler to be assistant secretary of Commerce for enforcement and compliance. </p><p>Kessler s hearing will be particularly topical, given Trump s recent, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/668912/uncomfortable-g7-summit-awaits-trump?mref=daily-landing\"> awkward </url> visit to the G7 conference in Canada and the diplomatic turmoil surrounding the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed on key U.S. trade partners. The Enforcement and Compliance       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.trade.gov/enforcement/\"> division </url> monitors steel imports and compliance with trade agreements and antidumping rules.</p><p>In the House, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters Wednesday that he hopes to have a set of technical corrections to last year s tax-overhaul bill by the end of the year. Industry, however, would like them sooner. </p><p>About 100 retail and restaurant companies sent a letter last week to tax writers <url normalizedValue=\"https://nrf.com/sites/default/files/Retail%20-%20Restaurant%20Tax%20Technical%20Corrections%20Letter%20-%20June%202018%20FINAL.pdf\"> asking </url> them to fix what they are dubbing the  retail glitch,  a name taken from the recently fixed  grain glitch  in the tax bill. The retail glitch is a drafting error that causes improvements to retail and restaurants to be written off over as much as 39 years rather than the one year intended by lawmakers. </p><p>But the clock is ticking to advance corrections legislation, at least before the November midterms. There are only a few vehicles on which a technical-corrections bill can ride. The Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill remains the top target, but Sen. John Thune, who helms the committee with jurisdiction over the agency, says he doesn't want extraneous tax riders attached to that bill. Industry may have to wait for the lame-duck session before seeing any legislative fixes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECHNOLOGY</emphasis></p><p>As the Senate takes up the must-pass NDAA this week, top Chinese telecommunications firms ZTE and Huawei could be caught in the middle of the debate. </p><p>Last week, a bipartisan group of senators inserted language into the NDAA that would restore crippling Commerce Department penalties against ZTE should the White House move forward with plans to grant the company a reprieve. ZTE was found to have violated U.S. government restrictions against trading with North Korea and Iran, and along with Huawei its U.S. operations are seen as an acute national security threat by many lawmakers and intelligence officials.</p><p>A majority of senators appear ready to back language blocking the White House s reprieve for ZTE. But some senators are not on board including Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, who told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis> last week that he s opposed to tying Trump s hands as he tries to maneuver through complicated trade issues with China. And several top House Republicans are already expressing their opposition to the measure, raising the prospect that the provision could be stripped from the NDAA during conference even if it does pass the Senate.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission s net-neutrality rules officially expire on June 11, marking the end of federal regulations that prevented internet service providers from blocking, slowing down, or prioritizing certain types of web traffic. The Republican-led FCC voted to overturn those rules in December, but they won t be officially taken out of the Federal Register until Monday.</p><p>The expiration of the old net-neutrality rules comes as the House continues to debate a Congressional Review Act resolution that would overturn the Republican FCC s order to rescind the earlier rules. Experts say that most internet service providers will hesitate to alter the way they prioritize web traffic or price their services until that debate has concluded. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai will address the issue during a Thursday appearance at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.</p><p>Lawmakers continue to debate the pros and cons of tougher disclosure regulations for digital advertisements months after the introduction of the Honest Ads Act. On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee will hold a hearing to map out the contours of the digital advertising ecosystem. Digital ads came under intense fire last year for the role they played in allowing Russian-backed actors to clandestinely influence American social-media users during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee is also taking another look at how to stop foreign actors from interfering in U.S. elections. On Tuesday, the committee will hold a hearing on how best to ensure that law enforcement is equipped to target those seeking to undermine the democratic process in the United States. </p><p>The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will mark up several bills on Wednesday, including the Cyber Safety Act. That bill would clarify protections and responsibilities related to cybersecurity under the Homeland Security Act.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing Wednesday with David Redl, the head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The NTIA is in charge of managing the government s spectrum, which is in high demand by private actors seeking to grow their own network coverage in parts of the country.</p><p>The long-running court battle over the proposed merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner will come to a close on Tuesday, and the decision could have tremendous implications for tech mergers down the line. The DOJ Antitrust Division unexpectedly challenged the vertical merger last year, arguing that the combination of AT&amp;T's telecommunications infrastructure with Time Warner's content could hurt consumers and unfairly disadvantage media competitors. By Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon is expected to decide whether to back the government's argument or allow the merger to proceed.</p><p>The DOJ's decision to go after the merger was a controversial one. Vertical mergers are typically approved by antitrust regulators, and Trump's animus towards CNN, a Time Warner subsidiary, led some to suspect the White House pressured antitrust head Makan Delrahim to target the company as payback. Experts have speculated that a finding in favor of AT&amp;T and Time Warner may lead to an explosion in big tech and media mergers, with major companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere seeing a green light to acquire new firms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITE HOUSE</emphasis></p><p>President Trump's week will be dominated by his time in Singapore and his historic meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. The White House has said little about the rest of the week, giving the president flexibility on his stay in Singapore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-668955</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJ0-DX21-JBNW-3378-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2447\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The National Journal Group, Inc.

Bush will pause a mourning Washington this week as the District prepares for funeral proceedings. The 41st president will lie in state Monday through Wednesday in the Capitol rotunda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The National Cathedral will then hold a memorial service before Bush's body is sent to Texas to be honored and buried. President Trump said Saturday he  would absolutely consider  and  probably  agree to a one- or two-week continuing resolution for Friday s deadline to fund the Homeland Security Department and other agencies that are at risk of shutting down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The parties spent the last week trading blame for the possibility of a shutdown, as Trump dug in his heels on demands for $5 billion in funding for a border wall, rather than the $1.6 billion for border security included in the bipartisan Senate version of a bill funding DHS. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby floated a plan last week to increase the border-related spending to $2.5 billion, while Minority Leader Chuck Schumer suggested a yearlong continuing resolution covering the DHS to avoid a shutdown.</p><p>It also remains to be seen whether a compromise farm bill will be able to withstand opposition from House conservatives, who objected to the removal of language that would have instituted tougher work requirements on some food-stamp recipients. Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts expressed optimism that the deal would pass the Senate. A reauthorization of the nation's flood-insurance program, which was expended on a short-term basis two weeks ago, is also expected to be included in a year-end package.</p><p>Following the waning support for Thomas Farr s nomination to the District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, the Senate will take up the nomination of Bernard McNamee to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Final votes on the nominations of Jonathan Kobes to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and Kathleen Kraninger to a five-year term as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will follow. Senators will also continue to weigh in on a new farm-bill agreement, a trade deal with Mexico and Canada, and a resolution condemning American involvement in the war in Yemen.</p><p>Here s what else is on tap this week:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DEFENSE AND FOREIGN POLICY</emphasis></p><p>The Senate voted 63-37 last week to advance a resolution that would end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led war effort in Yemen, reflecting unease and frustration over the Trump administration s response to both the crisis and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate. Senators could vote to approve the measure this week, but House Republican leaders have already blocked action on a similar resolution. </p><p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has a packed schedule this Tuesday. In the morning and afternoon, members will consider several ambassador nominations. That morning, the East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy Subcommittee also meets for a hearing on China with officials from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development testifying. </p><p>On Wednesday, the Africa and Global Health Policy Subcommittee will hear testimony on Zimbabwe from Matthew Harrington, deputy assistant secretary of State in the Bureau of African Affairs, and from outside experts. Outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake, the subcommittee chair, has long-standing ties to Zimbabwe and served as an official elections observer in the country this summer following the end of Robert Mugabe s 37-year grip on power.</p><p>The Senate Armed Services Committee will meet Tuesday morning to consider Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr. to take over U.S. Central Command and Lt. Gen. Richard Clarke to be commander of U.S. Special Operations Command. On Wednesday afternoon, the Seapower and Readiness and Management Support Subcommittees will hear testimony from key officials on Navy and Marine Corps readiness.</p><p>The House Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee meets Wednesday morning on the Defense Department s artificial-intelligence structure, investments, and applications. Lisa Porter, deputy Defense undersecretary for research and engineering, and Dana Deasy, the DoD s chief information officer, will testify. The following morning, the full committee meets to hear from the National Defense Strategy Commission. </p><p>HASC s Readiness and Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittees will hold a hearing Thursday afternoon on whether Naval surface forces are on the road to recovery, with testimony from Adm. John Aquilino, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and Adm. Christopher Grady, commander of U.S. Fleet Forces Command.</p><p>And the House Foreign Affairs Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations Subcommittee on Wednesday will hold a hearing on international child abductions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</emphasis></p><p>The House Energy and Commerce Environment Subcommittee will make a last-ditch effort this week to push legislation that would overhaul an ethanol-blending mandate known as the Renewable Fuel Standard.</p><p>Subpanel chairman John Shimkus released draft legislation in mid-November to sunset the corn-based ethanol mandate in 2023 but require vehicle manufacturers to sell cars with a higher octane level, which is typically achieved through ethanol blending. Shimkus will hold a hearing on the bill this Wednesday. Witnesses have not yet been announced. Ethanol producers have already vociferously denounced the legislation.</p><p>On the Senate side of the Capitol, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hold a sprawling markup Wednesday on nearly two dozen land-management and energy bills. Most of the bills are parochial and noncontroversial, and they could ride alongside a package that includes Land and Water Conservation Fund reauthorization at the end of this year or early next year.</p><p>Lawmakers in both chambers will also have to button up appropriations negotiations this week on the controversial Environmental Protection Agency and Interior Department account. The continuing resolution expires Dec. 7, and senators on both sides of the aisle are pushing House Republicans to trash a list of environmental riders on Endangered Species Act designations and emissions regulations, among other policy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH</emphasis></p><p>Sen. Chuck Grassley is still pushing to get a prison and sentencing-reform bill through Congress during the lame-duck. The legislation, which is still under discussion, includes provisions that would have some impact on substance-abuse disorders in the federal prison population.</p><p>Inmates would be able to participate in activities, including a substance-abuse program, to earn phone and visitation privileges along with time credit. The legislation would also require the Bureau of Prisons to evaluate and submit a plan to expand the pilot program that provides medication-assisted treatment for heroin and opioid abuse.</p><p>On the House side, the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee will hold a hearing Wednesday on the availability of Sexual Assault Forensic Exams and sexual-assault nurse examiners at hospitals. Only 15 percent of hospitals in the U.S. provide SAFE kits, according to data from the International Association of Forensic Nurses.</p><p>The House Oversight and Government Reform Health Care and Government Operations Subcommittees will look at alternatives to fetal-tissue research in a hearing Thursday. The Health and Human Services Department launched a review in September of all research involving fetal tissue  in light of the serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved. <br/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAXES </emphasis></p><p>House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady s year-end tax <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/674915/extenders-escape-bradys-tax-tenure-intact\"> package </url> got off to a rough start when leadership pulled a procedural vote on the measure set for Friday morning over intraparty disagreements.</p><p>Even if Brady can iron out the differences within his party, the bill still faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where the 60-vote threshold means supporters will have to get at least nine Democrats on board. The package has technical corrections to last year s tax-code overhaul, and Democrats had planned on extracting changes to the $1.5 trillion tax law in exchange for supporting the corrections. The tax package doesn t give them that opportunity with some of the most noncontroversial corrections.</p><p>Though the package is written so that it can get through the Senate with a single cloture vote, avoiding up to 30 hours of debate, the chamber has a packed schedule in the lame-duck session. Brady said last Tuesday that he s talking with Senate Democrats about moving the legislation.</p><p>As of Friday, it was unclear when House Republicans would try again to move the tax package.</p><p>The measure is likely the final tax bill Brady will shepherd before he steps down from his chairmanship to make way for Democrat Richard Neal in January.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee is set to hold a hearing on the nomination of Courtney Dunbar Jones to the U.S. Tax Court, where she would serve a 15-year term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECHNOLOGY</emphasis></p><p>Mark Zuckerberg can breathe a temporary sigh of relief this week, as the spotlight on Capitol Hill turns to Google chief executive Sundar Pichai instead. Lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee will question Pichai on Wednesday in a stated bid to examine the  data collection, use and filtering practices  of the tech platform. That likely means a reprise of GOP complaints that Google as well as its rivals Facebook and Twitter has shown a bias against conservative content hosted on its platform. </p><p>But other areas of concern are also set to be addressed. During a September hearing with Facebook and Twitter executives that Google failed to attend, several lawmakers brought up the search engine s plans to expand into China. Dubbed Project Dragonfly, the proposal has drawn the ire of members of Congress and many Google employees for showing a willingness on the company's part to kowtow to the Chinese government s strict online-censorship requirements. And as debate grinds on over a rework of federal antitrust theory to accommodate companies that traffic in reams of consumer data, Democrats are also likely to address Google s dominant market position.</p><p>It s been down and out several times over the past year, but the Senate s driverless-car bill simply refuses to die. In what has to be its last chance at passage this cycle, Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal </emphasis>that supporters are looking to tack the AV Start Act onto the must-pass spending legislation being debated this week.  We re really close with the trial lawyers,  he said, suggesting that their recalcitrance is the reason why the bill remains stalled. </p><p>But, Thune added, senators would still need to hammer out some changes between AV Start and its companion bill in the House. He said discussions with the lower chamber have already started.  We ll see,  he said.  It s a long way to the finish line, but at least we are making forward progress still. </p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a two-panel hearing Wednesday on China s  non-traditional espionage  against the United States a likely nod to Beijing s theft of intellectual property and rumors of a backdoor for eavesdropping built into Chinese telecommunications equipment now plugged into the grids of the U.S. and allied nations. Lawmakers will hear from top officials at DHS, the Justice Department, and the FBI, as well as academic experts.</p><p>Oral arguments for the DOJ's appeal of the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case are scheduled to begin on Thursday. Earlier this year, a U.S. District Court found that the media mega-merger could go forward, despite the DOJ's moves to block the transaction. The government s appeal is widely considered a long shot.</p><p>The House Judiciary Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee will meet Tuesday to hear from Federal Trade Commission chief Joseph Simons and DOJ antitrust head Makan Delrahim about the state of antitrust enforcement. Big tech s market share and its impact on consumers are always a focus of these hearings, and Tuesday is unlikely to be an exception.</p><p>The House Energy and Commerce Communications and Technology Subcommittee meets Thursday to examine the impact of the Ray Baum s Act, a package of bipartisan telecommunications bills that was signed into law earlier this year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WHITE HOUSE</emphasis></p><p>Back from the G-20 summit in Argentina, President Trump will attend the funeral services for George H.W. Bush on Wednesday at the National Cathedral.

It's happening right now with net neutrality - a critical issue that affects everyone who uses the internet that seems to have fallen off the face of the earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last December, the Trump administration repealed President Obama's net neutrality rules, setting off a firestorm of media attention and - if only briefly - focusing national attention on the need for clear rules ensuring that no internet company can block unpopular websites or unaffiliated services or otherwise discriminate online.</p><p>There was then a brief effort to revive the rules through a highly partisan longshot approach called the \"CRA that made some headway in the Senate but was always, as its sponsors knew too well, dead on arrival in the House of Representatives.</p><p>While well-intentioned, it's no surprise this CRA tactic could not gain a foothold. It fetishized an anachronistic \"public utility approach to net neutrality that many regarded as gratuitous overkill for a largely unregulated internet and a buzzkill for new investment. It also oddly paid worship to administrative regulations that change with every new administration rather than a permanent congressional law. Even if it had succeeded, the Trump FCC could have altered them again. It's kind of like that game of infinite regression.</p><p>In the meantime, the news cycle has churned on, and net neutrality is like a forgotten summer romance. Many have started to believe it was all hype, drummed up by the professional-consultant class to burnish their brands and raise funds, as the internet providers themselves have pledged to live by the rules even in their absence. Making sure they do now falls to the FTC as the honesty-in-advertising cop on the beat.</p><p>As much as we should celebrate consensus - and there seems to be widespread agreement on net neutrality now - legislation still seems to be the obvious coda. Legislation is a kind of \"trust but verify insurance policy against a future provider that may want to, say, favor its new streaming service over those of, say, Netflix or Disney. But there are other reasons, too - interfering with internet traffic to increase profits is not just a salon-dinner theoretical conversation about future misbehavior by internet providers, it's a current day way-of-life for the internet's new gilded monopolies, like Facebook and Google.</p><p>Those companies that collect and profile our data and decide what we can see and where we can go online pose a greater risk of censorship and manipulation of our data than anyone. Washington's big thinkers in technology have come to the party late - after months of front-page stories of how these companies facilitate election interference, hate, and civic chaos and marketplace tyranny that is strip-mining our news, retail and creative industries.</p><p>Many of these leaders are now demanding that that net neutrality cover these Big Tech monopolies, as well as internet providers - something only a new law from Congress can effectively ensure. It would seem obvious to anyone watching the disintegration of the internet that there is a crisis too big to corporate promises or overworked regulators. Net neutrality for all goes to the basic ability of citizens to connect and communicate, to find meaningful information, to organize and participate in the political process in a fair and open way.</p><p>On a bipartisan basis, congressional inaction conjures images of Nero fiddling while the internet burns. There is little disagreement about net neutrality widely applied and little disagreement about reining in abuses that led to the Russia scandal, among others. It's up to party leadership on both sides to prove, contrary to growing populist sentiment in both camps, that they are not made up of decaying old politicians but rather modern problem solvers up to the task of protecting the most important communications medium of our time.</p><p>Poll after poll shows that this is what the public wants by large margins. But the permanent Washington set has been more interested in trying to leverage these poll numbers to make political hay. But that's the politics of cynicism that only fuels resentment of Washington and the spoilation of the internet.</p><p>There is a huge middle ground available here and a real opportunity for the kind of common-sense problem solving Americans routinely tell pollsters that they want. It'll only happen if we drop the political jawboning and get on with the peoples' business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRGAZ-2018261514</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRGAZ2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T93-YFP1-JCB7-100G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146813</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Charleston Newspapers</copyright><publicationName>Charleston Gazette-Mail</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 18, 2018, Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Maybe I refuse to acknowledge the reality of the financial markets, and the need for entrepreneurs to deliver a return for their investors within a reasonable time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I can't help feeling that, whenever a New England company is sold to an out-of-state acquirer for big bucks, we've missed another chance to build a \"pillar\" company of our own. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When Dell Inc.pays $1.4 billion in cash for New Hampshire's EqualLogic Inc.this year after the storage start-up had filed to go public, it feels as if we've missed the opportunity to cultivate another EMC Corp.in our backyard. When VeriSign Inc.buys m-Qube Inc., one of the pioneers of content delivery to cellphones, for $250 million, that's a potentially significant anchor tenant we've lost for the mobile software community here. When Microsoft Corp.buys Softricity Inc., that's a pioneer in application virtualization - delivering software over a network connection - no longer seen as a leading player in the field, and headquartered right here in Boston to boot.</p><p>Let me present the glass-half-full case first. Acquisitions make a lot of money for founders and venture capitalists, who can then fly off and pollinate new companies. Most of the management team of m-Qube is now running other local start-ups like Matchmine, Turbine Entertainment, and Quattro Wireless. Former chief executive Jeff Glass is now an investor at Bain Capital Ventures in Boston.</p><p>Thanks to a decade of fairly steady acquisitions by non-New England purchases, our region is now home to outposts of most major technology companies, from Google to Microsoftto IBM to Oracle. Even cities like Atlanta, Chicago, or Austin don't have such a concentrated cluster of branch offices.</p><p>In some cases, an acquirer will keep growing the group it acquired. Dell is looking to hire more than 50 people at EqualLogic's old headquarters, mostly in engineering. Two of the company's three founders are still there, but chief executive Don Bulens left in June.</p><p>At a time when the stock market's interest in new offerings seems to have died, it's good to be producing companies someone wants to buy. Just last week, Hewlett-Packard Co.bought Colubris Networks of Waltham for an undisclosed sum. (I'm told by someone involved with the deal, but not authorized to talk about it, that the purchase price was only a bit more than the $50 million that had been invested in the company.)</p><p>And taking a company public is expensive. Charley Lax, one of the venture capitalists who put money into Colubris, says that \"it costs us $4 million to take a company public because of Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, which create all sorts of additional paperwork. What company can afford that if their revenues are $40- or $50-million?\" GlassHouse Technologies, another of the companies in the portfolio of Grand Banks Capital, Lax's Newton firm, filed to go public last December but hasn't done so yet. Based in Framingham, GlassHouse earned $40 million in the first nine months of 2007, selling services and technology to help customers manage their data centers.</p><p>Now, my glass-half-empty case.</p><p>Having a branch office is not the same thing as having a pillar company. Pillar companies like Google, Apple, and Intel pull smart people to Silicon Valley from all over the world and attract media attention. Companies that have been bought by out-of-state acquirers, like Monster.com or TripAdvisor (both Massachusetts sites owned by New York parents), often complain to me that no one remembers they're based here.</p><p>By not cultivating our own big companies - this seems obvious - we don't have a big pool of executives who have experience running big companies. \"As you're looking for CEOs to run midstage or later-stage companies, what you don't have here is the executive-level talent who have the experience running significant enterprises, beyond EMC,\" says Lou Volpe of Kodiak Venture Partners, a Waltham firm. \"That's because all the big tech companies are on the West Coast.\"</p><p>In 2006, Kodiak sold one of its companies, IMlogic, to Symantec Corp., a Silicon Valley security company. It was a good deal for everyone involved: roughly $100 million, all cash. At the time, IMlogic was earning about $10 million a year. But IMlogic's chief executive, Francis deSouza, is now a senior vice president at Symantec's California headquarters, and a few months after the IMlogic acquisition, Symantec laid off 71 people at its Waltham office, according to press reports.</p><p>I know that locally run companies can lay off people, too - but somehow job cuts always feel worse when done by remote control.</p><p>Innovative products created can vanish, or become less competitive, once they're absorbed within a big company. In March 2006, Microsoftbought a promising Cambridge start-up called Onfolio, which made software for managing links and information collected during Web research, and moved the team of six people out to Redmond, Wash. Two years later, Onfolio users were posting messages on Microsoft'sOnfolio site with headlines like \"Onfolio is dead.\" One user commented, \"A nice example on how to destroy value. Microsoftacquired it and haven't updated since.\" (Founder J.J. Allaire left Microsoftlast fall and returned to Boston.)</p><p>\"There's a culture here in Boston where low-profile success is expected and high-profile success is not,\" says Paul Deninger, the vice chairman of the investment bank Jefferies &amp; Co., observing that the \"accumulation of great wealth\" and larger-than-life entrepreneurial personalities seem to go against New England's puritanical grain. (Deninger sold his local firm to New York's Jefferies in 2003.)</p><p>\"You need not just financial drive to go public, but emotional drive,\" says former m-Qube chief executive Glass. \"You have to want to be a stand-alone, lasting, self-sustaining company.\" The team at m-Qube had talked about going public, but concluded that their company wasn't yet mature enough.</p><p>A123 Systems, a Watertown developer of next-generation batteries, seems to have the drive. They filed earlier this month to raise $175 million in the public markets.</p><p>But with every substantial company that gets bought, I wonder what might've been.</p><p>EqualLogicchief executive Don Bulens had bought his ticket to go to New York last November. On Tuesday, Nov. 6, he planned to run training sessions for the sales forces at Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, and then start meeting with potential investors.</p><p>But on Monday, EqualLogicgot bought. It was the biggest all-cash acquisition of a venture capital funded start-up, ever.</p><p>We should all be happy, right?</p><p>SIDEBAR:</p><p>Some recent acquisitions by out-of-state buyers</p><p>Hewlett-Packard Co.(Palo Alto, Calif.) - Colubris Networks (Waltham) Price: Undisclosed</p><p>GSI Commerce (King of Prussia, Pa.) - e-Dialog (Lexington) Price: $157 million</p><p>BMC Software (Houston, Texas) - BladeLogic (Lexington) Price: $800 million</p><p>Yahoo Inc.

With this system, the representative said, \"the one who deceives the most will win.\"<br/>After accusing tech giants of 'silencing conservative voices,'\" Trump added, \"We will regulate them vigorously or close them before we allow that to happen.'\"<br/>Trump responded this way after Twitter added a misleading content alert notice to two tweets from the president, who argued that mail ballots were 'fraudulent'' and that \"mailboxes will be stolen,' among other things.<br/>Below the tweets, Twitter placed a link that reads, \"Get the facts about vote by mail'' that guides users to a Twitter 'Moments' page with verified facts and news on the subject.<br/>Trump responded on Twitter, accusing the platform of \"interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election' and insisting that \"as president, I will not allow this to happen.'<br/>Its campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said the company's 'clear political bias' caused the campaign to withdraw \"all of our Twitter advertising months ago.\"<br/>The social media company banned all political advertising since November 2019.<br/>Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday and the call to expand regulation seemed to go against old conservative principles about deregulation.<br/>But some Trump allies, who have alleged bias on the part of tech companies, have questioned whether forums like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy rules that take responsibility for being 'platforms'' under federal law, or be treated more like publishers, that could face content lawsuits.<br/>Such guarantees have allowed unrestricted internet growth for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are in favor of social media companies facing increased scrutiny.<br/>\"Big tech firms get a lot of money from the federal government,\"' Republican Sen.

Three of the world's biggest tech companies have backed off selling facial recognition to law enforcement amid ongoing protests against police brutality.IBM announced on Monday it is halting the sale of \"general purpose\" facial recognition[2]. Amazon on Wednesday announced[3] it was imposing a one-year suspension on the sale of its facial recognition software to law enforcement. Microsoft followed suit on Thursday[4], saying it does not sell facial recognition tech to US police forces and will not do so until legislation is passed governing the use of the technology.It's something of a u-turn, since activists and academics have been advocating for companies not to sell facial recognition to law enforcement on the basis it exacerbates racial injustice for years.Facial recognition is becoming an increasingly popular tool for government agencies and law enforcement to track down criminals, terrorists, or illegal immigrants. </p><p>But withthe Black Lives Matter protests sweeping across the world in the wake of George Floyd's death, there are now fresh calls for the big tech companies to stop selling the technology to police.The argument long put forward by civil rights groups and AI experts is that facial recognition disproportionately affects people of color in two ways.Firstly, like any policing tool operating by systemically racist societies or institutions, it will inevitably be used to target people of color more often.Secondly, the data used to build facial recognition software ingrains it with racial bias which makes it more likely to misidentify women and people of color[5], which would in turn lead to more wrongful arrests. This is because the datasets used to train facial recognition algorithms are often predominantly made up of pictures of white men. Here is a breakdown of exactly what each company has promised: IBMIBM was the first of the three companies to announce it was taking its foot off the pedal on facial recognition, and it's also made the most permanent commitment.CEO Arvind Krishna made the announcement in a letter to members of Congress including Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris on June 8.\"IBM no longer offers general purpose IBM facial recognition or analysis software,\" Krishna wrote. \"IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms.\"He added that IBM hoped to start a \"national dialogue\" on the use of facial recognition by law enforcement.The announcement was welcomed by many, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u2014Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 10, 2020[6] Experts Business Insider spoke to said it was a move in the right direction, but that the language IBM had used in its announcement gave it some room to potentially keep selling facial recognition tech in future.Eva  Blum-Dumontet, a senior researcher at Privacy International who specializes in IBM, told Business Insider[7] the specification that it would stop selling \"general purpose\" software gives the firm room to develop custom software for clients.\"We'll have to see what that means in practice. It's worth bearing in mind that a lot of the work IBM does is actually customized work for their customers, so it's possible we're not seeing the end of IBM doing facial recognition at all, they're just changing the label,\" said Blum-Dumontet. Amazon Even if IBM's announcement was cynically motivated or hedged, it was at least the first domino to fall.Amazon announced on June 10 it was suspending sale of its facial recognition software Rekognition to law enforcement for one year[8].\"We've advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge. We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested,\" Amazon said in its announcement[9].The ACLU said the one-year break doesn't go far enough[10]. \"This surveillance technology's threat to our civil rights and civil liberties will not disappear in a year,\" Nicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties director for the ACLU, said in a press statement.Dr. Nakeema Stefflbauer, an AI ethics policy expert, also told Business Insider that while Amazon's statement is a step in the right direction, it doesn't address what will happen to all the police departments which already have the software. \"Far better than suspending further sales would be recalling the software altogether, as is commonly done with other faulty or unreliable products,\"said Stefflbauer.Andy Jassy, Amazon's head of Amazon Web Services, said in a February 2020 interview that the company does not know how many police forces have bought Rekognition[11].Rekognition has come under particular scrutiny from activists in the past. In July 2018 the ACLU tested the software on members of congress[12]. During the test Rekognition confused 28 congresspeople of color with people who had been arrested. MIT researcher Joy Buolamwini also published a paper in January 2019[13] which found Rekognition was consistently worse at identifying faces belonging to women and people of color.Amazon's response was that the activists and researchers were not paying enough attention to the software's \"confidence threshold,\" a percentage it spits out saying how sure it is it has identified the right person. As it started to sell the tool to police forces however, reports emerged that law enforcement officers weren't paying attention to the tool's confidence threshold either[14], and were even running composite sketches[15] and photos of celebrities[16] through the system in their hunt for suspects. MicrosoftMicrosoft's president Brad Smith said in an interview with the Washington Post on Thursday, June 11, that Microsoft does not sell facial recognition tech to US police forces, and committed to not sell it until a national law governing its use is brought in.\"The number one point that I would really underscore is this: we need to really use this moment to pursue a strong national law to govern facial recognition that is grounded in the protection of human rights,\" said Smith. \u2014Washington Post Live (@postlive) June 11, 2020[17] This came two days after more than 250 Microsoft employees published an open letter[18] calling on the firm to sever business relationships with police forces more generally. Without a legal framework, other companies could rush in to fill the gap. Smith cautioned that giants like Microsoft, Amazon, IBM stepping back entirely from facial recognition could mean smaller companies rushing in to fill the vacuum.\"If all of the responsible companies in the country cede this market to those that are not prepared to take a stand, we won't necessarily serve the national interest or the lives of the Black and African-American people of this nation well. We need Congress to act, not just tech companies alone,\" he said.Dr . Nakeema Stefflbauer voiced similar concerns that less well-known companies could start touting facial recognition to police.\"From a US perspective, these announcements confirm the serious harm that unregulated facial recognition technology in the hands of law enforcement has already caused Black and other [minority] groups to suffer,\" said Stefflbauer.Dr. Steffblauer added that smaller vendors such as Clearview, Kairos, and PredPol could continue selling facial recognition tech without new laws, both in the US and the EU.She added: \"In my opinion, this is the moment when US and EU governments must take technology regulation seriously and pass comprehensive legislation: failure to do so is nothing less than giving permission for an unchecked assault on human rights.\"In an email to Business Insider Joy Buolamwini, who looked at bias in Amazon's facial recognition tech, also stressed the need for a regulatory framework.\"We cannot rely on self-regulation or hope companies will choose to reign in harmful deployments of the technologies they develop,\" she said.\"The first step is to press pause, not just company-wide, but nationwide.\" This still marks a huge shift in the tech companies' attitudes. \"Scholars and activists like Joy Buolamwini, Dr. Timnit Gebru, and Deb Raji are not alone in their push for fairness and accountability in technology that is deployed at scale. But the turnaround from big tech companies is really stunning, in light of the incredible attacks and attempts to discredit these women that their research was initially met with,\" said Stefflbauer.\"It should not be the responsibility of members of a discriminated group to prove that a commercial technology used on millions of people is unfairly targeting and victimizing them, but that has so far been the case.\"In her email to Business Insider, Joy Buolamwini said the tech giants should throw more of their weight behind promoting racial equality.\"I also call on all companies that substantially profit from AI \u2014 including IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and Apple\u2014 to commit at least $1 million each towards advancing racial justice in the tech industry.\"\"The money should go directly as unrestricted gifts to support organizations like the Algorithmic Justice League, Black in AI, and Data for Black Lives that have been leading this work for years. Racial justice requires algorithmic justice.\" Not everyone is convinced the tech firms are acting in good faith. Activist groups and scholars have largely welcomed the companies' decisions to hit pause on selling their tech to police, although not all are convinced the move is ethically motivated.\"It appears the companies are using this moment to capture goodwill so that they get to write the federal regulations on facial recognition,\" Jacinta Gonzalez, a senior campaign director at civil rights group Mijente told Business Insider.\"We cannot allow their lobbyists to write these rules in such a way where the companies will be allowed to profit from Black and brown communities. Facial recognition is a very dangerous technology that further oppresses a people who've long been on the receiving end of racist policing in the United States.\"Read the original article on Business
