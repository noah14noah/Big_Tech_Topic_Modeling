Think again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the strangest charges from the Left against Judge Brett Kavanaugh is that his history shows that he will use his position to expand executive power to the detriment of liberty and individual rights and to the benefit of Big Business. At the very outset this argument reflects a bit of hypocrisy in light of the nearly dozen examples of executive overreach by President Barack Obama that were later struck down by the Supreme Court by 9-0 votes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, Judge Kavanaughs opinions illustrate how strongly he views the separation of powers as the best guarantee of individual liberty-values that have been seriously undermined by rulings over the last decade, shifting power from both the courts and Congress to giant (and in some cases still growing) government bureaucracies, most of which are in the executive branch.</p><p>These bureaucracies, in turn, have counterintuitively provided sanctuary for Big Business to use as protection against smaller competitors with less cachet and fewer connections. It has long been the goal of the prevailing establishment to create a marriage of sorts between Big Business and Big Government, so that the latter-including both Republican and Democratic-can directly engage with concentrated industries that are much easier to control than thousands of smaller interests. For their part, these industries get enormous government support, preference, and protection against competition.</p><p>The basic trigger for this shift has been the so-called Chevron Doctrine, which essentially holds that if a regulatory agency can find any ambiguity in the congressional delegation of authority, it can construe that ambiguity as itself a grant of authority to do almost anything the agency wants to do within the bounds of reason, whether or not Congress ever intended to make such a grant in the first place. This has resulted in the bizarre situation where an agency- which derives its powers from Congress alone-can reverse a court ruling validating another agency's interpretation of a statute simply by viewing the original delegation as ambiguous and coming up with a different interpretation, leaving Congress out of the loop entirely.</p><p>For the first few years after this 1984 ruling, the courts applied the Chevron Doctrine when it was convenient and ignored it when it was not. Justice Antonin Scalia did not generally participate in this shifting of power away from Congress or the courts because he did not always see the ambiguity that the agencies were so eager to discover to expand their own power. But over the last decade the Chevron Doctrine has taken an almost constitutional status as an iron rule of statutory construction. However, the lower courts-led in large part by Justice (then Judge) Neil Gorsuch and Judge Kavanaugh at the 10th Circuit and D.C. Circuit respectively-have begun to raise serious questions about this problem. Justice Clarence Thomas has written a series of strong dissents along the same lines. Indeed, the Supreme Court has already granted review on some of these issues this term.</p><p>The incestuous relationship between Big Government and Big Business goes back to the philosophy of the German intellectuals in the late 19th century, through Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt up to the present. The idea of turning over our government to elite bureaucratic experts has been around a long time, but flourished as the Obama administration unleashed a torrent of regulatory activity. The tip of the spear was the Chevron Doctrine, which, in the bluntest terms, means the government bureaucracy almost always wins, attracting ever more growing power and leverage over private entities while deeppocketed and well-represented corporations climb on board.</p><p>Judge Kavanaughs opposition overlooks this phenomenon and instead cherry picks individual cases in which he appears to side with Big Business against the hapless consumer. But looking at two or three cases ignores the thousands of issues where Chevron has tipped the scales in favor of government, and these cases never get to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh has written strongly on Chevron as an appellate judge and there is no reason to think this and other related issues wont eventually come to the High Court. This is why the National Federation of Individual Businesses (NFIB) made the Gorsuch nomination its top priority last year-and why it will be working so hard for Kavanaugh. NFIB correctly sees Chevron as the key to government support for Big Business at the expense of smaller competitors.</p><p>What too many people don't understand is that the Big Business/Big Government tandem is a killer of opportunity and innovation for small business, which creates more than two thirds of all new jobs and has historically served as a feeder of American innovation-from Charles Kettering in his garage before going to General Motors, up to the current crop in Silicon Valley, where startups have blossomed and transformed the modern technology landscape.</p><p>Quiet-if not secret-arrangements between business and government for the latter to protect the position of the former, of course, predate even the German progressives. Adam Smith's biggest nightmare was the capture by special interests of parts of the government to ward off competition. He was not a cheerleader for established business interests and felt that they would always find some way to conspire against the public interest if left unwatched and unpoliced for monopolizing behavior. As a result, Smith advocated for a strong judiciary clearly independent of the executive branch- primarily to protect private property from government compromised by competing interests.</p><p>Indeed, Smith once said that \"the government of an exclusive company of merchants is, perhaps, the worst of all governments for any country whatever.\" He much preferred the product of a competitive-if sometimes unruly- marketplace ruled by the invisible hand of thousands of entrepreneurs to the tidy reality of a giant expert committee. For him the benefit of the invisible hand was that it relieved the government of having to figure everything out with giant immoveable bureaucracies totally incapable of understanding the needs of local communities.</p><p>It would therefore be a big mistake to construe Kavanaughs views of the separation of powers as somehow a big kiss to corporate interests. The world he will confront if confirmed is one already deeply compromised by crony capitalism, which has hit the middle class hard by the rigidities brought on by freezing market shares and reducing innovation. Just look at the growth unleashed by the Trump administrations deregulatory efforts today-a program that has already reduced job-killing government uncertainty in the marketplace. It will, of course, be great to see a major overall cut in the size of government, but the economic growth began the day the regulatory spigot was turned off.</p><p>Turning off the tap begins with reviewing Chevron, and this Kavanaugh has been doing. In fact he has written so extensively about various problems of the administrative state that it is highly unlikely to be ignored in the near future if he is confirmed. This includes his court of appeals dissent in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Office Board) case in 2008, which became the basis for the Supreme Court's majority opinion. In it, Kavanaugh argued that limiting the presidents authority in PCAOB appointments was unconstitutional. Furthermore, he wrote eloquently expanding his views about the appointments clause in a case involving the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, some version of which is almost certain to be resolved by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Finally, Judge Kavanaugh has been credited with developing the \"major issue\" exception to the Chevron Doctrine. This exception parallels an exception created some years ago by Justice Scalia, which says that if an ambiguity arises out of an overly vague statute that violates the non-delegation doctrine, the courts (and, emphatically, not the agency) must sort out the answer by construing the meaning of the statute themselves.</p><p>The point of all of this is to reduce the size of government, especially the executive branch, not to expand it or increase access to it by Big Business. Many of the tricks used by the previous administration are already being erased by the agencies themselves. It will take a long time to clean the stables thoroughly, but the confirmation of Kavanaugh is certainly a move in the right direction.</p><p>What about Big Tech? The tie-in between Big Business and Big Government has not yet matured in connection with Silicon Valley. The European Union has triggered a major new regulatory regime related to privacy, and it may well make U.S. regulation unnecessary. But like the situation described above, the new EU rules may end up doing more to protect Big Tech than to tame it-a problem signaled by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at his congressional hearings. Google ad revenues apparently rose the day after the rules were put in place.</p><p>Resolution of Big Tech dominance, whether under the antitrust laws or otherwise, is not an imminent issue for Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court now, but in time the problem will get there. It's impossible to predict how it will be sorted out. But some basic principles underlying the Constitution will come into play, such as the role of private property-which Adam Smith and the Scottish Enlightenment viewed as critical to any ordered system of liberty. One of the principal problems with Big Data and privacy protections related to personal information is the huge uncertainty over who really owns the data relating to ourselves. Moreover, if the intellectual property issues are properly addressed, there may be no need for the big bureaucracies that have built up around them.</p><p>This issue looms, unresolved, in the great frontier of new legal challenges to greet Judge Kavanaugh if he is approved this fall. There is no one better versed to contribute here, and in the broader sphere of Big Business and Big Government. Rather than an agent for government power, Kavanaugh will serve as a bulwark against cronyism and powerful Washington bureaucracies.</p><p>C.

Think again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the strangest charges from the Left against Judge Brett Kavanaugh is that his history shows that he will use his position to expand executive power to the detriment of liberty and individual rights and to the benefit of Big Business. At the very outset this argument reflects a bit of hypocrisy in light of the nearly dozen examples of executive overreach by President Barack Obama that were later struck down by the Supreme Court by 9-0 votes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, Judge Kavanaughs opinions illustrate how strongly he views the separation of powers as the best guarantee of individual liberty-values that have been seriously undermined by rulings over the last decade, shifting power from both the courts and Congress to giant (and in some cases still growing) government bureaucracies, most of which are in the executive branch.</p><p>These bureaucracies, in turn, have counterintuitively provided sanctuary for Big Business to use as protection against smaller competitors with less cachet and fewer connections. It has long been the goal of the prevailing establishment to create a marriage of sorts between Big Business and Big Government, so that the latter-including both Republican and Democratic-can directly engage with concentrated industries that are much easier to control than thousands of smaller interests. For their part, these industries get enormous government support, preference, and protection against competition.</p><p>The basic trigger for this shift has been the so-called Chevron Doctrine, which essentially holds that if a regulatory agency can find any ambiguity in the congressional delegation of authority, it can construe that ambiguity as itself a grant of authority to do almost anything the agency wants to do within the bounds of reason, whether or not Congress ever intended to make such a grant in the first place. This has resulted in the bizarre situation where an agency- which derives its powers from Congress alone-can reverse a court ruling validating another agency's interpretation of a statute simply by viewing the original delegation as ambiguous and coming up with a different interpretation, leaving Congress out of the loop entirely.</p><p>For the first few years after this 1984 ruling, the courts applied the Chevron Doctrine when it was convenient and ignored it when it was not. Justice Antonin Scalia did not generally participate in this shifting of power away from Congress or the courts because he did not always see the ambiguity that the agencies were so eager to discover to expand their own power. But over the last decade the Chevron Doctrine has taken an almost constitutional status as an iron rule of statutory construction. However, the lower courts-led in large part by Justice (then Judge) Neil Gorsuch and Judge Kavanaugh at the 10th Circuit and D.C. Circuit respectively-have begun to raise serious questions about this problem. Justice Clarence Thomas has written a series of strong dissents along the same lines. Indeed, the Supreme Court has already granted review on some of these issues this term.</p><p>The incestuous relationship between Big Government and Big Business goes back to the philosophy of the German intellectuals in the late 19th century, through Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt up to the present. The idea of turning over our government to elite bureaucratic experts has been around a long time, but flourished as the Obama administration unleashed a torrent of regulatory activity. The tip of the spear was the Chevron Doctrine, which, in the bluntest terms, means the government bureaucracy almost always wins, attracting ever more growing power and leverage over private entities while deeppocketed and well-represented corporations climb on board.</p><p>Judge Kavanaughs opposition overlooks this phenomenon and instead cherry picks individual cases in which he appears to side with Big Business against the hapless consumer. But looking at two or three cases ignores the thousands of issues where Chevron has tipped the scales in favor of government, and these cases never get to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh has written strongly on Chevron as an appellate judge and there is no reason to think this and other related issues wont eventually come to the High Court. This is why the National Federation of Individual Businesses (NFIB) made the Gorsuch nomination its top priority last year-and why it will be working so hard for Kavanaugh. NFIB correctly sees Chevron as the key to government support for Big Business at the expense of smaller competitors.</p><p>What too many people don't understand is that the Big Business/Big Government tandem is a killer of opportunity and innovation for small business, which creates more than two thirds of all new jobs and has historically served as a feeder of American innovation-from Charles Kettering in his garage before going to General Motors, up to the current crop in Silicon Valley, where startups have blossomed and transformed the modern technology landscape.</p><p>Quiet-if not secret-arrangements between business and government for the latter to protect the position of the former, of course, predate even the German progressives. Adam Smith's biggest nightmare was the capture by special interests of parts of the government to ward off competition. He was not a cheerleader for established business interests and felt that they would always find some way to conspire against the public interest if left unwatched and unpoliced for monopolizing behavior. As a result, Smith advocated for a strong judiciary clearly independent of the executive branch- primarily to protect private property from government compromised by competing interests.</p><p>Indeed, Smith once said that \"the government of an exclusive company of merchants is, perhaps, the worst of all governments for any country whatever.\" He much preferred the product of a competitive-if sometimes unruly- marketplace ruled by the invisible hand of thousands of entrepreneurs to the tidy reality of a giant expert committee. For him the benefit of the invisible hand was that it relieved the government of having to figure everything out with giant immoveable bureaucracies totally incapable of understanding the needs of local communities.</p><p>It would therefore be a big mistake to construe Kavanaughs views of the separation of powers as somehow a big kiss to corporate interests. The world he will confront if confirmed is one already deeply compromised by crony capitalism, which has hit the middle class hard by the rigidities brought on by freezing market shares and reducing innovation. Just look at the growth unleashed by the Trump administrations deregulatory efforts today-a program that has already reduced job-killing government uncertainty in the marketplace. It will, of course, be great to see a major overall cut in the size of government, but the economic growth began the day the regulatory spigot was turned off.</p><p>Turning off the tap begins with reviewing Chevron, and this Kavanaugh has been doing. In fact he has written so extensively about various problems of the administrative state that it is highly unlikely to be ignored in the near future if he is confirmed. This includes his court of appeals dissent in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Office Board) case in 2008, which became the basis for the Supreme Court's majority opinion. In it, Kavanaugh argued that limiting the presidents authority in PCAOB appointments was unconstitutional. Furthermore, he wrote eloquently expanding his views about the appointments clause in a case involving the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, some version of which is almost certain to be resolved by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Finally, Judge Kavanaugh has been credited with developing the \"major issue\" exception to the Chevron Doctrine. This exception parallels an exception created some years ago by Justice Scalia, which says that if an ambiguity arises out of an overly vague statute that violates the non-delegation doctrine, the courts (and, emphatically, not the agency) must sort out the answer by construing the meaning of the statute themselves.</p><p>The point of all of this is to reduce the size of government, especially the executive branch, not to expand it or increase access to it by Big Business. Many of the tricks used by the previous administration are already being erased by the agencies themselves. It will take a long time to clean the stables thoroughly, but the confirmation of Kavanaugh is certainly a move in the right direction.</p><p>What about Big Tech? The tie-in between Big Business and Big Government has not yet matured in connection with Silicon Valley. The European Union has triggered a major new regulatory regime related to privacy, and it may well make U.S. regulation unnecessary. But like the situation described above, the new EU rules may end up doing more to protect Big Tech than to tame it-a problem signaled by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at his congressional hearings. Google ad revenues apparently rose the day after the rules were put in place.</p><p>Resolution of Big Tech dominance, whether under the antitrust laws or otherwise, is not an imminent issue for Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court now, but in time the problem will get there. It's impossible to predict how it will be sorted out. But some basic principles underlying the Constitution will come into play, such as the role of private property-which Adam Smith and the Scottish Enlightenment viewed as critical to any ordered system of liberty. One of the principal problems with Big Data and privacy protections related to personal information is the huge uncertainty over who really owns the data relating to ourselves. Moreover, if the intellectual property issues are properly addressed, there may be no need for the big bureaucracies that have built up around them.</p><p>This issue looms, unresolved, in the great frontier of new legal challenges to greet Judge Kavanaugh if he is approved this fall. There is no one better versed to contribute here, and in the broader sphere of Big Business and Big Government. Rather than an agent for government power, Kavanaugh will serve as a bulwark against cronyism and powerful Washington bureaucracies.</p><p>C.

Think again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the strangest charges from the Left against Judge Brett Kavanaugh is that his history shows that he will use his position to expand executive power to the detriment of liberty and individual rights and to the benefit of Big Business. At the very outset this argument reflects a bit of hypocrisy in light of the nearly dozen examples of executive overreach by President Barack Obama that were later struck down by the Supreme Court by 9-0 votes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, Judge Kavanaughs opinions illustrate how strongly he views the separation of powers as the best guarantee of individual liberty-values that have been seriously undermined by rulings over the last decade, shifting power from both the courts and Congress to giant (and in some cases still growing) government bureaucracies, most of which are in the executive branch.</p><p>These bureaucracies, in turn, have counterintuitively provided sanctuary for Big Business to use as protection against smaller competitors with less cachet and fewer connections. It has long been the goal of the prevailing establishment to create a marriage of sorts between Big Business and Big Government, so that the latter-including both Republican and Democratic-can directly engage with concentrated industries that are much easier to control than thousands of smaller interests. For their part, these industries get enormous government support, preference, and protection against competition.</p><p>The basic trigger for this shift has been the so-called Chevron Doctrine, which essentially holds that if a regulatory agency can find any ambiguity in the congressional delegation of authority, it can construe that ambiguity as itself a grant of authority to do almost anything the agency wants to do within the bounds of reason, whether or not Congress ever intended to make such a grant in the first place. This has resulted in the bizarre situation where an agency- which derives its powers from Congress alone-can reverse a court ruling validating another agency's interpretation of a statute simply by viewing the original delegation as ambiguous and coming up with a different interpretation, leaving Congress out of the loop entirely.</p><p>For the first few years after this 1984 ruling, the courts applied the Chevron Doctrine when it was convenient and ignored it when it was not. Justice Antonin Scalia did not generally participate in this shifting of power away from Congress or the courts because he did not always see the ambiguity that the agencies were so eager to discover to expand their own power. But over the last decade the Chevron Doctrine has taken an almost constitutional status as an iron rule of statutory construction. However, the lower courts-led in large part by Justice (then Judge) Neil Gorsuch and Judge Kavanaugh at the 10th Circuit and D.C. Circuit respectively-have begun to raise serious questions about this problem. Justice Clarence Thomas has written a series of strong dissents along the same lines. Indeed, the Supreme Court has already granted review on some of these issues this term.</p><p>The incestuous relationship between Big Government and Big Business goes back to the philosophy of the German intellectuals in the late 19th century, through Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt up to the present. The idea of turning over our government to elite bureaucratic experts has been around a long time, but flourished as the Obama administration unleashed a torrent of regulatory activity. The tip of the spear was the Chevron Doctrine, which, in the bluntest terms, means the government bureaucracy almost always wins, attracting ever more growing power and leverage over private entities while deeppocketed and well-represented corporations climb on board.</p><p>Judge Kavanaughs opposition overlooks this phenomenon and instead cherry picks individual cases in which he appears to side with Big Business against the hapless consumer. But looking at two or three cases ignores the thousands of issues where Chevron has tipped the scales in favor of government, and these cases never get to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh has written strongly on Chevron as an appellate judge and there is no reason to think this and other related issues wont eventually come to the High Court. This is why the National Federation of Individual Businesses (NFIB) made the Gorsuch nomination its top priority last year-and why it will be working so hard for Kavanaugh. NFIB correctly sees Chevron as the key to government support for Big Business at the expense of smaller competitors.</p><p>What too many people don't understand is that the Big Business/Big Government tandem is a killer of opportunity and innovation for small business, which creates more than two thirds of all new jobs and has historically served as a feeder of American innovation-from Charles Kettering in his garage before going to General Motors, up to the current crop in Silicon Valley, where startups have blossomed and transformed the modern technology landscape.</p><p>Quiet-if not secret-arrangements between business and government for the latter to protect the position of the former, of course, predate even the German progressives. Adam Smith's biggest nightmare was the capture by special interests of parts of the government to ward off competition. He was not a cheerleader for established business interests and felt that they would always find some way to conspire against the public interest if left unwatched and unpoliced for monopolizing behavior. As a result, Smith advocated for a strong judiciary clearly independent of the executive branch- primarily to protect private property from government compromised by competing interests.</p><p>Indeed, Smith once said that \"the government of an exclusive company of merchants is, perhaps, the worst of all governments for any country whatever.\" He much preferred the product of a competitive-if sometimes unruly- marketplace ruled by the invisible hand of thousands of entrepreneurs to the tidy reality of a giant expert committee. For him the benefit of the invisible hand was that it relieved the government of having to figure everything out with giant immoveable bureaucracies totally incapable of understanding the needs of local communities.</p><p>It would therefore be a big mistake to construe Kavanaughs views of the separation of powers as somehow a big kiss to corporate interests. The world he will confront if confirmed is one already deeply compromised by crony capitalism, which has hit the middle class hard by the rigidities brought on by freezing market shares and reducing innovation. Just look at the growth unleashed by the Trump administrations deregulatory efforts today-a program that has already reduced job-killing government uncertainty in the marketplace. It will, of course, be great to see a major overall cut in the size of government, but the economic growth began the day the regulatory spigot was turned off.</p><p>Turning off the tap begins with reviewing Chevron, and this Kavanaugh has been doing. In fact he has written so extensively about various problems of the administrative state that it is highly unlikely to be ignored in the near future if he is confirmed. This includes his court of appeals dissent in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Office Board) case in 2008, which became the basis for the Supreme Court's majority opinion. In it, Kavanaugh argued that limiting the presidents authority in PCAOB appointments was unconstitutional. Furthermore, he wrote eloquently expanding his views about the appointments clause in a case involving the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, some version of which is almost certain to be resolved by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Finally, Judge Kavanaugh has been credited with developing the \"major issue\" exception to the Chevron Doctrine. This exception parallels an exception created some years ago by Justice Scalia, which says that if an ambiguity arises out of an overly vague statute that violates the non-delegation doctrine, the courts (and, emphatically, not the agency) must sort out the answer by construing the meaning of the statute themselves.</p><p>The point of all of this is to reduce the size of government, especially the executive branch, not to expand it or increase access to it by Big Business. Many of the tricks used by the previous administration are already being erased by the agencies themselves. It will take a long time to clean the stables thoroughly, but the confirmation of Kavanaugh is certainly a move in the right direction.</p><p>What about Big Tech? The tie-in between Big Business and Big Government has not yet matured in connection with Silicon Valley. The European Union has triggered a major new regulatory regime related to privacy, and it may well make U.S. regulation unnecessary. But like the situation described above, the new EU rules may end up doing more to protect Big Tech than to tame it-a problem signaled by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at his congressional hearings. Google ad revenues apparently rose the day after the rules were put in place.</p><p>Resolution of Big Tech dominance, whether under the antitrust laws or otherwise, is not an imminent issue for Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court now, but in time the problem will get there. It's impossible to predict how it will be sorted out. But some basic principles underlying the Constitution will come into play, such as the role of private property-which Adam Smith and the Scottish Enlightenment viewed as critical to any ordered system of liberty. One of the principal problems with Big Data and privacy protections related to personal information is the huge uncertainty over who really owns the data relating to ourselves. Moreover, if the intellectual property issues are properly addressed, there may be no need for the big bureaucracies that have built up around them.</p><p>This issue looms, unresolved, in the great frontier of new legal challenges to greet Judge Kavanaugh if he is approved this fall. There is no one better versed to contribute here, and in the broader sphere of Big Business and Big Government. Rather than an agent for government power, Kavanaugh will serve as a bulwark against cronyism and powerful Washington bureaucracies.</p><p>C.

Boyden</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the strangest charges from the Left against Judge Brett Kavanaugh is that his history shows that he will use his position to expand executive power to the detriment of liberty and individual rights and to the benefit of Big Business. At the very outset this argument reflects a bit of hypocrisy in light of the nearly dozen examples of executive overreach by President Barack Obama that were later struck down by the Supreme Court by 9-0 votes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, Judge Kavanaugh's opinions illustrate how strongly he views the separation of powers as the best guarantee of individual liberty--values that have been seriously undermined by rulings over the last decade, shifting power from both the courts and Congress to giant (and in some cases still growing) government bureaucracies, most of which are in the executive branch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These bureaucracies, in turn, have counterintuitively provided sanctuary for Big Business to use as protection against smaller competitors with less cachet and fewer connections. It has long been the goal of the prevailing establishment to create a marriage of sorts between Big Business and Big Government, so that the latter--including both Republican and Democratic--can directly engage with concentrated industries that are much easier to control than thousands of smaller interests. For their part, these industries get enormous government support, preference, and protection against competition.</p><p>The basic trigger for this shift has been the so-called Chevron Doctrine, which essentially holds that if a regulatory agency can find any ambiguity in the congressional delegation of authority, it can construe that ambiguity as itself a grant of authority to do almost anything the agency wants to do within the bounds of reason, whether or not Congress ever intended to make such a grant in the first place. This has resulted in the bizarre situation where an agency--which derives its powers from Congress alone--can reverse a court ruling validating another agency's interpretation of a statute simply by viewing the original delegation as ambiguous and coming up with a different interpretation, leaving Congress out of the loop entirely.</p><p>For the first few years after this 1984 ruling, the courts applied the Chevron Doctrine when it was convenient and ignored it when it was not. Justice Antonin Scalia did not generally participate in this shifting of power away from Congress or the courts because he did not always see the ambiguity that the agencies were so eager to discover to expand their own power. But over the last decade the Chevron Doctrine has taken an almost constitutional status as an iron rule of statutory construction. However, the lower courts--led in large part by Justice (then Judge) Neil Gorsuch and Judge Kavanaugh at the 10th Circuit and D.C. Circuit respectively--have begun to raise serious questions about this problem. Justice Clarence Thomas has written a series of strong dissents along the same lines. Indeed, the Supreme Court has already granted review on some of these issues this term.</p><p>The incestuous relationship between Big Government and Big Business goes back to the philosophy of the German intellectuals in the late 19th century, through Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt up to the present. The idea of turning over our government to elite bureaucratic experts has been around a long time, but flourished as the Obama administration unleashed a torrent of regulatory activity. The tip of the spear was the Chevron Doctrine, which, in the bluntest terms, means the government bureaucracy almost always wins, attracting ever more growing power and leverage over private entities while deep-pocketed and well-represented corporations climb on board.</p><p>Judge Kavanaugh's opposition overlooks this phenomenon and instead cherry picks individual cases in which he appears to side with Big Business against the hapless consumer. But looking at two or three cases ignores the thousands of issues where Chevron has tipped the scales in favor of government, and these cases never get to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh has written strongly on Chevron as an appellate judge and there is no reason to think this and other related issues won't eventually come to the High Court. This is why the National Federation of Individual Businesses (NFIB) made the Gorsuch nomination its top priority last year--and why it will be working so hard for Kavanaugh. NFIB correctly sees Chevron as the key to government support for Big Business at the expense of smaller competitors.</p><p>What too many people don't understand is that the Big Business/Big Government tandem is a killer of opportunity and innovation for small business, which creates more than two thirds of all new jobs and has historically served as a feeder of American innovation--from Charles Kettering in his garage before going to General Motors, up to the current crop in Silicon Valley, where startups have blossomed and transformed the modern technology landscape.</p><p>Quiet--if not secret--arrangements between business and government for the latter to protect the position of the former, of course, predate even the German progressives. Adam Smith's biggest nightmare was the capture by special interests of parts of the government to ward off competition. He was not a cheerleader for established business interests and felt that they would always find some way to conspire against the public interest if left unwatched and unpoliced for monopolizing behavior. As a result, Smith advocated for a strong judiciary clearly independent of the executive branch--primarily to protect private property from government compromised by competing interests.</p><p>Indeed, Smith once said that \"the government of an exclusive company of merchants is, perhaps, the worst of all governments for any country whatever.\" He much preferred the product of a competitive--if sometimes unruly--marketplace ruled by the invisible hand of thousands of entrepreneurs to the tidy reality of a giant expert committee. For him the benefit of the invisible hand was that it relieved the government of having to figure everything out with giant immoveable bureaucracies totally incapable of understanding the needs of local communities.</p><p>It would therefore be a big mistake to construe Kavanaugh's views of the separation of powers as somehow a big kiss to corporate interests. The world he will confront if confirmed is one already deeply compromised by crony capitalism, which has hit the middle class hard by the rigidities brought on by freezing market shares and reducing innovation. Just look at the growth unleashed by the Trump administration's deregulatory efforts today--a program that has already reduced job-killing government uncertainty in the marketplace. It will, of course, be great to see a major overall cut in the size of government, but the economic growth began the day the regulatory spigot was turned off.</p><p>Turning off the tap begins with reviewing Chevron, and this Kavanaugh has been doing. In fact he has written so extensively about various problems of the administrative state that it is highly unlikely to be ignored in the near future if he is confirmed. This includes his court of appeals dissent in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Office Board) case in 2008, which became the basis for the Supreme Court's majority opinion. In it, Kavanaugh argued that limiting the president's authority in PCAOB appointments was unconstitutional. Furthermore, he wrote eloquently expanding his views about the appointments clause in a case involving the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, some version of which is almost certain to be resolved by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Finally, Judge Kavanaugh has been credited with developing the \"major issue\" exception to the Chevron Doctrine. This exception parallels an exception created some years ago by Justice Scalia, which says that if an ambiguity arises out of an overly vague statute that violates the non-delegation doctrine, the courts (and, emphatically, not the agency) must sort out the answer by construing the meaning of the statute themselves.</p><p>The point of all of this is to reduce the size of government, especially the executive branch, not to expand it or increase access to it by Big Business. Many of the tricks used by the previous administration are already being erased by the agencies themselves. It will take a long time to clean the stables thoroughly, but the confirmation of Kavanaugh is certainly a move in the right direction.</p><p>What about Big Tech? The tie-in between Big Business and Big Government has not yet matured in connection with Silicon Valley. The European Union has triggered a major new regulatory regime related to privacy, and it may well make U.S. regulation unnecessary. But like the situation described above, the new EU rules may end up doing more to protect Big Tech than to tame it--a problem signaled by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at his congressional hearings. Google ad revenues apparently rose the day after the rules were put in place.</p><p>Resolution of Big Tech dominance, whether under the antitrust laws or otherwise, is not an imminent issue for Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court now, but in time the problem will get there. It's impossible to predict how it will be sorted out. But some basic principles underlying the Constitution will come into play, such as the role of private property--which Adam Smith and the Scottish Enlightenment viewed as critical to any ordered system of liberty. One of the principal problems with Big Data and privacy protections related to personal information is the huge uncertainty over who really owns the data relating to ourselves. Moreover, if the intellectual property issues are properly addressed, there may be no need for the big bureaucracies that have built up around them.</p><p>This issue looms, unresolved, in the great frontier of new legal challenges to greet Judge Kavanaugh if he is approved this fall. There is no one better versed to contribute here, and in the broader sphere of Big Business and Big Government. Rather than an agent for government power, Kavanaugh will serve as a bulwark against cronyism and powerful Washington bureaucracies.</p><p>by C. BOYDEN GRAY</p><p>C.

Even after the five banks in the State deal with a fresh surge in bad loan losses - guided by the sector at as much as EUR 3.6 billion for 2020 - they face a squeeze from lower-for-longer interest rates and muted loan growth. </p><p>For Roebben, plotting consolidation is the wrong obsession. </p><p>\"Just looking at the sector as the competition between banks is a very narrow view. </p><p>\"I feel the heat from the fintechs. I feel the heat from the niche players [selling one financial product]. I feel the heat from big tech. Big time,\" Roebben says. </p><p>\"The real race that's going on is about who can define a sustainable, financial services model with digital at the core. </p><p>\"Who can make that work? Because that's what the customers are asking for.\" </p><h>The last crisis The </h><p>pandemic has resulted in an acceleration in the shift of financial activity to online. </p><p>And as traditional banks continue to deal with the legacy of the last crisis and invest billions to overhaul creaking IT systems, the likes of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon, which have all entered the financial arena with differing strategies in recent years, are threatening the old model. </p><p>Still, KBC Bank Ireland, which grew out of KBC's 1978 purchase of Irish Intercontinental Bank (IIB), before going on to build up a 10 per cent share in the mortgage market before the 2008 property crash, thinks it might have the right formula. </p><p>After pumping EUR 1.4 billion into the Irish unit to keep it afloat during the financial crisis and reviewing options, including an exit, the Brussels-based group affirmed its commitment to Ireland in early 2017 - focusing on developing a digital-first bank with a minimal network of 16 branches, or \"hubs\" as it likes to call them. </p><p>The company has built up customer numbers by 30 per cent since then to 314,000. It offers a mobile app, a virtual wallet that offers customers access to the likes of Apple Pay and Fitbit Pay, and free day-to-day banking to those who deposit EUR 2,000 a month into their current account. These products are loss leaders for a bank that still makes most of its money from its subscale EUR 10 billion mortgage book. </p><p>Put simply, KBC needs its new customers to do more business. </p><p>It's hoping that a move this year to become a fully fledged bank and insurance group with pensions and life product offerings from a local branch of its Belgian insurance unit will give it an edge. It launched in May with an initial digital pension product that promises to \"take the complexity out of pensions\" and give savers \"full control of their financial future based on their own personal circumstances\". </p><p>With only a third of private sector workers in Ireland currently paying into pension plans, according to Government figures, and auto-enrolment coming down the tracks, the opportunity is clear. </p><h>Belgian blueprint The Belgian blueprint, which will see KBC Bank Ireland exit its existing relationship as an intermediary for Irish Life, replicates its parent group's own \"bancassurance\" model.</h><p>The group itself emerged from a 1998 tie-up between two Belgian lenders and an insurance company and is one of the few among a wave of such combinations in the decade leading up to the 2008 crash to survive. </p><p>Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland, Allianz and ING all tried variations of an insurance-banking combination but, for different reasons, ended up unwinding the two businesses. </p><p>More locally, the 1999 merger of Irish Life and the Irish Permanent Building Society - to create Irish Life &amp; Permanent - would be reversed less than a decade and a half later, as the Government sought to recoup its EUR 4 billion bailout of the banking side of the group. </p><p>The bancassurance model should work well in theory, as each part has different business cycles. At the moment, the insurance arm is propping up the profits of KBC Group, as banks globally set aside large provisions for an expected spike on loan losses resulting from Covid-19. </p><p>\"But there has to be a very careful balancing [between both arms] in terms of incentivising cross-selling ,\" says Roebben. </p><p>The move into the life and pensions business is \"significant\" and \"underlines the strategic commitment\" of the group in Ireland, he says. </p><p>Aside from the enormous losses racked up in the Irish market during the financial crisis, KBC has found the going tough here in recent times.</p><p>In late 2018 its Dublin headquarters and two branches were subject to arson attacks after it moved to repossess a farm in Co Roscommon, almost a decade after it took proceedings to recover money owed. </p><p>The farming family condemned the incidents. </p><p>Last November, KBC Group chief executive Johan Thijs was forced to apologise for \"insensitive\" comments on the country's tracker-mortgage scandal, which had drawn censure from Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and consumer activists. </p><p>Thijs had criticised the Central Bank of Ireland on a conference call with financial analysts for its continued focus on the scandal, and said this \"nitty-gritty stuff\" was holding the industry back. \"When it happened, I immediately [realised] this was not going to be a good day for me,\" recalls Roebben. </p><p>\"It's sometimes very hard for people from the outside to understand what really happened here [with trackers] . . . how deep the wound is, how big the rupture in trust between banks and the Irish people. And we're still not over that. It's still very raw.\" </p><h>KBC Bank Ireland has set aside EUR 14 million for a likely fine, as the Central Bank continues enforcement investigations against the country's banks for their role in the debacle. </h><p>Roebben says he hopes the regulator will complete its investigation into his bank this year. </p><p>Meanwhile, KBC Bank Ireland, which reported a EUR 55 million loss for the first half of the year as it booked EUR 95 of loan impairment charges, has also had to put off handing over a dividend on 2019 earnings to its Belgian parent, as regulators discourage payouts during Covid-19. </p><p>Does the bank, which has only returned EUR 410 million of its EUR 1.4 billion crisis-era parental bailout, expect to ever repay the bill in full? </p><h>'Not an obsession' \"It's not an obsession of the shareholder to get the EUR 1.4 billion back fast,\" </h><p>says Roebben. </p><p>The pressure, he says, is to roll out digital innovation being developed across the KBC Group, to build up a sufficient customer base of 400,000-500,000 customers and to convince them to share enough of their business.</p><p>\"When you get into that level, we will have achieved a model that gives us sufficient return on capital costs,\" he says. </p><p>\"We haven't won this race. But I think we're running the right race. </p><p>\"There is a real good opportunity for us to make it work - to carve out a profitable niche.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4328008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K1-19V1-JC8Y-802Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1241\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002CUH</classCode><className>IRISH INTERCONTINENTAL BANK LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

[Photo provided to China Daily] &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ann Cairns outlines Mastercard's role in using technology to make financial services secure in China</p><p>With artificial intelligence, big data and cybersecurity receiving prominence in China's quest for innovation-powered businesses, financial services major Mastercard will seek to strengthen the country in those areas, said Ann Cairns, president of the company's international operations.</p><p>On April 5, Mastercard promoted Cairns to vice-chairman, effective June 1. She will focus on a range of strategically important initiatives like financial inclusion, and empowerment and promotion of women within the company and in the communities Mastercard serves.</p><p>Mastercard is in the process of applying for a business license in China. It already serves millions of Chinese people visiting other countries for travel, business or education, by facilitating payments between the banks of merchants and banks or credit unions that issue branded debit and credit cards.</p><p>Cairns noted it is a challenge to balance ease of use with safety, and that is where the regulators step in. \"For the payments market in China, the big tech companies aren't regulated in the same way as the banks, and that creates an unlevel playing field. In that kind of situation, I'd expect that people would look at the regulations and say, 'How can we make sure that it's fair and that things are working in a secure manner?'\" she said.</p><p>Cairns believes China provides vast opportunities for financial services companies like Mastercard. For, according to a report from the China Tourism Academy, there were 131 million outbound Chinese travelers in 2017. No other country in the world has as many, and a significant number of them use Mastercard products.</p><p>To diversify its financial offerings in China, Mastercard launched a holistic service plan for major Chinese banks on April 11. The service plan helps banks to maintain their competitive advantages effectively, in terms of solutions and products. Leveraging Mastercard's global resources, the integrated services cover a number of areas, including market research, product design and data analytics.</p><p>To explore artificial intelligence, Mastercard acquired Applied Predictive Technologies, a cloud-based analytics provider. APT's test-and-learn technology can tell a retail business where might be the best place to open a shop, in terms of demographics.</p><p>Mastercard has also invested in cybersecurity-related measures like biometric authentication and anti-fraud tools, and developed safety nets that banks use to protect themselves from fraudsters and cybercrime. It has bought companies that have algorithms to identify non-typical, or fraudulent, behavior.</p><p>\"We are obviously going to invest in future protection of ourselves, and the newcomers (in the payments market) ... should be investing in safety and security, too, because if they suffer big cyberattacks or big breaches, it would affect them on their market credibility,\" Cairns said.</p><p>Mastercard knows how to compete against both traditional card players and tech giants. It is also familiar with building partnerships with local companies and designing things that work for the local environment, she said.</p><p>Cairns herself loves accomplishing tasks such as building things and fixing things. She majored in pure mathematics, and landed her first job as a research engineer, designing and testing pipelines for oil rigs in the North Sea.</p><p>The first female engineer qualified to work on offshore oil rigs in the United Kingdom, she became the head of offshore engineering and planning at British Gas, managing a team of more than 50 engineers at a very early age.</p><p>\"I started off as an engineer and what that taught me was two things: first of all, I love building things; and second of all, I love fixing things.\"</p><p>She made a career transition later, working in senior management positions in global retail and investment banking operations across Europe and the United States for more than 25 years.</p><p>\"Both (building things and fixing things) are applicable in the payments industry because a lot of what I'm doing is building products for the future and trying to fix problems for customers,\" she said during the China Development Forum in Beijing in March.</p><p>\"In the technology industry, things are changing all the time. You have to think about how to keep current while you still run your day job.\"</p><p>One of the things she does to keep current is travel all over the world - about 44 weeks a year. When she is in different countries, she buys a lot of products and services to see how they work. She also looks at what other companies, especially technology companies that may disrupt the payments market, are doing. For instance, she visited Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.</p><p>Similarly, in the past, she had visited Google, Apple and Airbnb's headquarters in California. She said she could see what other people think and what Mastercard can do to keep itself competitive.</p><p>\"We actually think that it's good to have disruption in the market because it causes a market change.

[Photo provided to China Daily] &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ann Cairns outlines Mastercard's role in using technology to make financial services secure in China</p><p>With artificial intelligence, big data and cybersecurity receiving prominence in China's quest for innovation-powered businesses, financial services major Mastercard will seek to strengthen the country in those areas, said Ann Cairns, president of the company's international operations.</p><p>On April 5, Mastercard promoted Cairns to vice-chairman, effective June 1. She will focus on a range of strategically important initiatives like financial inclusion, and empowerment and promotion of women within the company and in the communities Mastercard serves.</p><p>Mastercard is in the process of applying for a business license in China. It already serves millions of Chinese people visiting other countries for travel, business or education, by facilitating payments between the banks of merchants and banks or credit unions that issue branded debit and credit cards.</p><p>Cairns noted it is a challenge to balance ease of use with safety, and that is where the regulators step in. \"For the payments market in China, the big tech companies aren't regulated in the same way as the banks, and that creates an unlevel playing field. In that kind of situation, I'd expect that people would look at the regulations and say, 'How can we make sure that it's fair and that things are working in a secure manner?'\" she said.</p><p>Cairns believes China provides vast opportunities for financial services companies like Mastercard. For, according to a report from the China Tourism Academy, there were 131 million outbound Chinese travelers in 2017. No other country in the world has as many, and a significant number of them use Mastercard products.</p><p>To diversify its financial offerings in China, Mastercard launched a holistic service plan for major Chinese banks on April 11. The service plan helps banks to maintain their competitive advantages effectively, in terms of solutions and products. Leveraging Mastercard's global resources, the integrated services cover a number of areas, including market research, product design and data analytics.</p><p>To explore artificial intelligence, Mastercard acquired Applied Predictive Technologies, a cloud-based analytics provider. APT's test-and-learn technology can tell a retail business where might be the best place to open a shop, in terms of demographics.</p><p>Mastercard has also invested in cybersecurity-related measures like biometric authentication and anti-fraud tools, and developed safety nets that banks use to protect themselves from fraudsters and cybercrime. It has bought companies that have algorithms to identify non-typical, or fraudulent, behavior.</p><p>\"We are obviously going to invest in future protection of ourselves, and the newcomers (in the payments market) ... should be investing in safety and security, too, because if they suffer big cyberattacks or big breaches, it would affect them on their market credibility,\" Cairns said.</p><p>Mastercard knows how to compete against both traditional card players and tech giants. It is also familiar with building partnerships with local companies and designing things that work for the local environment, she said.</p><p>Cairns herself loves accomplishing tasks such as building things and fixing things. She majored in pure mathematics, and landed her first job as a research engineer, designing and testing pipelines for oil rigs in the North Sea.</p><p>The first female engineer qualified to work on offshore oil rigs in the United Kingdom, she became the head of offshore engineering and planning at British Gas, managing a team of more than 50 engineers at a very early age.</p><p>\"I started off as an engineer and what that taught me was two things: first of all, I love building things; and second of all, I love fixing things.\"</p><p>She made a career transition later, working in senior management positions in global retail and investment banking operations across Europe and the United States for more than 25 years.</p><p>\"Both (building things and fixing things) are applicable in the payments industry because a lot of what I'm doing is building products for the future and trying to fix problems for customers,\" she said during the China Development Forum in Beijing in March.</p><p>\"In the technology industry, things are changing all the time. You have to think about how to keep current while you still run your day job.\"</p><p>One of the things she does to keep current is travel all over the world - about 44 weeks a year. When she is in different countries, she buys a lot of products and services to see how they work. She also looks at what other companies, especially technology companies that may disrupt the payments market, are doing. For instance, she visited Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.</p><p>Similarly, in the past, she had visited Google, Apple and Airbnb's headquarters in California. She said she could see what other people think and what Mastercard can do to keep itself competitive.</p><p>\"We actually think that it's good to have disruption in the market because it causes a market change. If we react to that change and take our technology forward, then usually it's positive,\" she said.</p><p>\"Considering that we've connected up to 27,000 banks around the world in 45 million end points, if we see a good idea, we aren't just going to sit here and let someone else do that.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1496/26/152566207928.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1496/26/152566207928.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDUS-115874859</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S8F-GMK1-JDJN-62C6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411374</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"940\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 China Daily Information.

She will focus on a range of strategically important initiatives like financial inclusion, and empowerment and promotion of women within the company and in the communities Mastercard serves.</p><p>Mastercard is in the process of applying for a business license in China. It already serves millions of Chinese people visiting other countries for travel, business or education, by facilitating payments between the banks of merchants and banks or credit unions that issue branded debit and credit cards.</p><p>Cairns noted it is a challenge to balance ease of use with safety, and that is where the regulators step in. \"For the payments market in China, the big tech companies aren't regulated in the same way as the banks, and that creates an unlevel playing field. In that kind of situation, I'd expect that people would look at the regulations and say, 'How can we make sure that it's fair and that things are working in a secure manner?'\" she said.</p><p>Cairns believes China provides vast opportunities for financial services companies like Mastercard. For, according to a report from the China Tourism Academy, there were 131 million outbound Chinese travelers in 2017. No other country in the world has as many, and a significant number of them use Mastercard products.</p><p>To diversify its financial offerings in China, Mastercard launched a holistic service plan for major Chinese banks on April 11. The service plan helps banks to maintain their competitive advantages effectively, in terms of solutions and products. Leveraging Mastercard's global resources, the integrated services cover a number of areas, including market research, product design and data analytics.</p><p>To explore artificial intelligence, Mastercard acquired Applied Predictive Technologies, a cloud-based analytics provider. APT's test-and-learn technology can tell a retail business where might be the best place to open a shop, in terms of demographics.</p><p>Mastercard has also invested in cybersecurity-related measures like biometric authentication and anti-fraud tools, and developed safety nets that banks use to protect themselves from fraudsters and cybercrime. It has bought companies that have algorithms to identify non-typical, or fraudulent, behavior.</p><p>\"We are obviously going to invest in future protection of ourselves, and the newcomers (in the payments market) ... should be investing in safety and security, too, because if they suffer big cyberattacks or big breaches, it would affect them on their market credibility,\" Cairns said.</p><p>Mastercard knows how to compete against both traditional card players and tech giants. It is also familiar with building partnerships with local companies and designing things that work for the local environment, she said.</p><p>Cairns herself loves accomplishing tasks such as building things and fixing things. She majored in pure mathematics, and landed her first job as a research engineer, designing and testing pipelines for oil rigs in the North Sea.</p><p>The first female engineer qualified to work on offshore oil rigs in the United Kingdom, she became the head of offshore engineering and planning at British Gas, managing a team of more than 50 engineers at a very early age.</p><p>\"I started off as an engineer and what that taught me was two things: first of all, I love building things; and second of all, I love fixing things.\"</p><p>She made a career transition later, working in senior management positions in global retail and investment banking operations across Europe and the United States for more than 25 years.</p><p>\"Both (building things and fixing things) are applicable in the payments industry because a lot of what I'm doing is building products for the future and trying to fix problems for customers,\" she said during the China Development Forum in Beijing in March.</p><p>\"In the technology industry, things are changing all the time. You have to think about how to keep current while you still run your day job.\"</p><p>One of the things she does to keep current is travel all over the world - about 44 weeks a year. When she is in different countries, she buys a lot of products and services to see how they work. She also looks at what other companies, especially technology companies that may disrupt the payments market, are doing. For instance, she visited Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.</p><p>Similarly, in the past, she had visited Google, Apple and Airbnb's headquarters in California. She said she could see what other people think and what Mastercard can do to keep itself competitive.</p><p>\"We actually think that it's good to have disruption in the market because it causes a market change. If we react to that change and take our technology forward, then usually it's positive,\" she said.</p><p>\"Considering that we've connected up to 27,000 banks around the world in 45 million end points, if we see a good idea, we aren't just going to sit here and let someone else do that.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn\">jiangxueqing@chinadaily.com.cn</email></p><p>Ann Cairns, president of Mastercard's international operations, makes a point at a roundtable at the Singapore FinTech Festival in November last year.

The social media giant informed Kelly, a conservative commentator, that his account was permanently suspended 'due to multiple or repeat violations of the Twitter rules.' Conservative pundits, journalists, and politicians criticized Twitter's decision to ban Kelly, with some alleging that his ban was the latest example of perceived anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley. While some might be infuriated with what happened to Kelly's Twitter account, we should bewary of[1]calls[2]for government regulation of social media andrelated investigations[3]in the name of free speech or the First Amendment. </p><p>Companies such as Twitter and Facebook will sometimes make content moderation decisions that seem hypocritical, inconsistent, and confusing. But private failure is better than government failure, not least because\u2014unlike government agencies\u2014Twitter has to worry about competition and profits.A Lack of ConsistencyIt's not immediately clear why Twitter banned Kelly. A fleeting glance of Kelly's Twitter feed reveals plenty of eye roll-worthy content, including his calls for thepeaceful breakup of the United States[4]and his assertion that only an existential threat to the United States can save the country. His writings at the conservative websiteThe Federalistinclude bizarre and unfounded declarationssuch as[5], 'barring some unforeseen awakening, America is heading for an eventual socialist abyss.' In the same article, he called for his readers to 'Be the Lakota' after a brief discussion about how Sitting Bull and his warriors took scalps at the Battle of Little Bighorn. Inanother article[6],Kelly made the argument that a belief in limited government is a necessary condition for being a patriot. Twitter might be able to point to other content they consider more offensive than what I just highlighted. But from what I can tell, Kelly's content hardly qualifies as suspension-worthy. I must confess that I didn't know Kelly existed until I learned the news of his Twitter ban, so it's possible that those backing his ban from Twitter might be able to point to other content they consider more offensive than what I just highlighted. But from what I can tell, Kelly's content hardly qualifies as suspension-worthy.

Richard Spencer, the white supremacist president of the innocuously-named National Policy Institute who ponderedtaking my      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/alt-right-trump-washington-dc-power-milo-214629boss'\">https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/alt-right-trump-washington-dc-power-milo-214629boss'</url> office[11], remains on Twitter, although his account isno longer verified[12].Private Speech StandardsAll of the of the debates about social media content moderation have produced some strange proposals. Earlier this year I attended theLincoln Network's Reboot conference[13]and heard Dr. Jerry A. Johnson, the president and chief executive officer of the National Religious Broadcasters, propose that social media companies embrace the First Amendment as a standard. Needless to say, I was surprised to hear a conservative Christian urge private companies to embrace a content moderation standard that would require them to allow animal abuse videos, footage of beheadings, and pornography on their platforms. Facebook, Twitter, and other social media companies have sensible reasons for not using the First Amendment as their content moderation lodestar. These standards are enforced by human beings (and the algorithms human beings create) who make mistakes and can unintentionally or intentionally import their biases into content moderation decisions. Rather than turning to First Amendment law for guidance, social media companies have developed their own standards for speech. These standards are enforced by human beings (and the algorithms human beings create) who make mistakes and can unintentionally or intentionally import their biases into content moderation decisions. Another Twitter controversy from earlier this year illustrates how difficult it can be to develop content moderation policies. Shortly after Sen. John McCain's death, a Twitter user posted a tweet that included a doctored photo of Sen. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, crying over her father's casket. The tweet included the words 'America, this ones (sic) for you' and the doctored photo, which showed a handgun being aimed at the grieving McCain. McCain's husband,Federalistpublisher Ben Domenech,criticized[14]Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for keeping the tweet on the platform. Twitter later took the offensive tweet down, andDorsey apologized[15]for not taking action sooner.The tweet aimed at Meghan McCain clearly violatedTwitter's rules[16], which state: 'You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people.' Twitter's rules also prohibit hateful conduct or imagery, as outlined in its 'Hateful Conduct Policy[17].' The policy seems clear enough, but a look at Kelly's tweets reveals content that someone could interpret as hateful, even if some of the tweets are attempts at humor. Is portraying Confederate soldiers as 'poor Southerners defending their land from an invading Northern army[18]' hateful? What about a tweetbemoaning women's right to vote[19]? Or tweets that describe our ham-loving neighbors to the North as 'garbage people[20]' and violence as 'underrated[21]'? None of these tweets seem to violate Twitter'scurrent content policy[22], but someone could write a content policy that would prohibit such content.Tough CallsImagine you are developing a content policy for a social media site, and your job is to consider whether content identical to the tweet targeting McCain and content identical to Kelly's tweet concerning violence should be allowed or deleted. You have four policy options: Many commentators seem to back option 3, believing the tweet targeting McCain should've been deleted while Kelly's tweet should be allowed. That's a reasonable position. But it's not hard to see how someone could come to the conclusion that 1 and 4 are also acceptable options. Of all four options, only option 2, which would lead to the deletion of Kelly's tweet but also allow the tweet targeting McCain, seems incoherent on its face. Social media companies can come up with sensible-sounding policies, but there will always be tough calls. Having a policy that prohibits images of nude children sounds sensible, butthere was an outcry[23]after Facebook removed an Anne Frank Center article that had as its feature image a photo of nude children who were victims of the Holocaust. Facebook didn't disclose whether an algorithm or a human being had flagged the post for deletion.In a similar case, Facebook initially defended[24] its decision to remove Nick Ut's Pulitzer Prize-winning photo'The Terror of War[25],'which shows a burned, naked nine-year-old Vietnamese girl fleeing the aftermath of a South Viernamese napalm attack in 1972. Despite the photo's fame and historical significance, Facebook toldThe Guardian, 'While we recognize that this photo is iconic, it's difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others.' Facebook eventually changed course and allowed users to post the photo, citing the photo's historical significance:Because of its status as an iconic image of historical importance, the value of permitting sharing outweighs the value of protecting the community by removal, so we have decided to reinstate the image on Facebook where we are aware it has been removed.What about graphic images of contemporary and past battles? On the one hand, there is clear historic value to images from the American Civil War, the Second World War, and the Vietnam War, some of which include graphic violent content. A social media company implementing a policy prohibiting graphic depictions of violence sounds sensible, but like a policy banning images of nude children, it will not eliminate difficult choices or the possibility that such a policy will yield results many users will find inconsistent and confusing. Given that whoever is developing content moderation policies will be put in the position of making tough choices, it's far better to leave these choices in the hands of private actors rather than government regulators. Unlike the government, Twitter has a profit motive and competition. As such, it is subject to far more accountability than the government. We may not always like the decisions social media companies make, but private failure is better than government failure. An America where unnamed bureaucrats, not private employees, determine what can be posted on social media is one where free speech is stifled.Misguided Calls for Government RegulationTo be clear, the call for increased government intervention and regulation of social media platforms is a bipartisan phenomenon. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) has discusseda range of possible social media policies[26], including a crackdown on anonymous accounts and regulations modeled on the European so-called 'right to be forgotten.' If such policies were implemented (First Amendment issues notwithstanding), they would inevitably lead to valuable speech being stifled. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR)has said[27]he's open to carve-outs ofSection 230[28]of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online intermediaries such as Facebook and Twitter from liability for what users post on their platforms. When it comes to possibly amending Section 230 Sen. Wyden has some Republican allies. Never mind that some of these Republicansdon't seem to fully understand[29]the relevant parts[30]of Section 230. That social media giants are under attack from the left and the right is not an argument for government intervention. That social media giants are under attack from the left and the right is not an argument for government intervention. Calls for Section 230 amendment or 'anti-censorship' legislation are a serious risk to free speech. If Section 230 is amended to increase social media companies' risk of liability suits, we should expect these companiesto suppress more speech[31]. Twitter users may not always like what Twitter does, but calls for government intervention are not the remedy.

The social media giant informed Kelly, a conservative commentator, that his account was permanently suspended 'due to multiple or repeat violations of the Twitter rules.' Conservative pundits, journalists, and politicians criticized Twitter's decision to ban Kelly, with some alleging that Kelly's ban was the latest example of perceived anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley. While some might be infuriated with what happened to Kelly's Twitter account, we should be wary of[1] calls[2] for government regulation of social media and related investigations[3] in the name of free speech or the First Amendment. </p><p>Companies such as Twitter and Facebook will sometimes make content moderation decisions that seem hypocritical, inconsistent, and confusing. But private failure is better than government failure, not least because unlike government agencies, Twitter has to worry about competition and profits. It's not immediately clear why Twitter banned Kelly. A fleeting glance of Kelly's Twitter feed reveals plenty of eye roll-worthy content, including his calls for the peaceful breakup of the United States[4] and his assertion that only an existential threat to the United States can save the country. His writings at the conservative website The Federalist include bizarre and unfounded declarations such as[5], 'barring some unforeseen awakening, America is heading for an eventual socialist abyss.' In the same article he called for his readers to 'Be the Lakota' after a brief discussion about how Sitting Bull and his warriors took scalps at the Battle of Little Bighorn. In another article[6] Kelly made the argument that a belief in limited government is a necessary condition for being a patriot. I must confess that I didn't know Kelly existed until I learned the news of his Twitter ban, so it's possible that those backing his ban from Twitter might be able to point to other content that they consider more offensive that what I just highlighted. But, from what I can tell Kelly's content hardly qualifies as suspension-worthy. Some [7]o[8]pponents[9] of Kelly's ban[10] (and indeed Kelly himself[11]) were quick to point out that Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan still has a Twitter account despite making anti-semitic remarks. Richard Spencer, the white supremacist president of the innocuously-named National Policy Institute who pondered taking my [12]boss' office[13], remains on Twitter, although his account is no longer verified[14]. All of the of the debates about social media content moderation have produced some strange proposals. Earlier this year I attended the Lincoln Network's Reboot conference[15] and heard Dr. Jerry A. Johnson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Religious Broadcasters, propose that social media companies embrace the First Amendment as a standard. Needless to say, I was surprised to hear a conservative Christian urge private companies to embrace a content moderation standard that would require them to allow animal abuse videos, footage of beheadings, and pornography on their platforms. Facebook, Twitter, and other social media companies have sensible reasons for not using the First Amendment as their content moderation lodestar. Rather than turning to First Amendment law for guidance, social media companies have developed their own standards for speech. These standards are enforced by human beings (and the algorithms human beings create) who make mistakes and can unintentionally or intentionally import their biases into content moderation decisions. Another Twitter controversy from earlier this year illustrates how difficult it can be to develop content moderation policies. Shortly after Sen. John McCain's death a Twitter user posted a tweet that included a doctored photo of Sen. McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, crying over her father's casket. The tweet included the words 'America, this ones (sic) for you' and the doctored photo, which showed a handgun being aimed at the grieving McCain. McCain's husband, Federalist publisher Ben Domenech, criticized[16] Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for keeping the tweet on the platform. Twitter later took the offensive tweet down, and Dorsey apologized[17] for not taking action sooner. The tweet aimed at Meghan McCain clearly violated Twitter's rules[18], which state: 'You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people.' Twitter's rules also prohibit hateful conduct or imagery, as outlined in its 'Hateful Conduct Policy[19].' The policy seems clear enough, but a look at Kelly's tweets reveal content that someone could interpret as hateful, even if some of the tweets are attempts at humor. Is portraying Confederate soldiers as 'poor Southerners defending their land from an invading Northern army[20]' hateful? What about a tweet bemoaning women's right to vote[21]? Or tweets that describe our ham-loving neighbors to the North as 'garbage people[22]' and violence as 'underrated[23]'? None of these tweets seem to violate Twitter's current content policy[24], but someone could write a content policy that would prohibit such content. Imagine developing a content policy for a social media site and your job is to consider whether content identical to the tweet targeting McCain and content identical to Kelly's tweet concerning violence should be allowed or deleted. You have four policy options: Many commentators seem to back option 3, believing that the tweet targeting McCain should've been deleted while Kelly' tweet should be allowed. That's a reasonable position. But it's not hard to see how someone could come to the conclusion that 1 and 4 are also acceptable options. Of all four options only option 2, which would lead to the deletion of Kelly's tweet but also allow the tweet targeting McCain, seems incoherent on its face. Social media companies can come up with sensible-sounding policies, but there will always be tough calls. Having a policy that prohibits images of nude children sounds sensible, but there was an outcry[25] after Facebook removed an Anne Frank Center article, which had as its feature image a photo of nude children who were victims of the Holocaust. Facebook didn't disclose whether an algorithm or a human being had flagged the post for deletion.In a similar case, Facebook initially defended[26] its decision to remove Nick Ut's Pulitzer Prize-winning photo 'The Terror of War,'[27] which shows a burned, naked nine year old Vietnamese girl fleeing the aftermath of an South Viernamese napalm attack in 1972. Despite the photo's fame and historical significance Facebook told The Guardian, 'While we recognize that this photo is iconic, it's difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance and not others.' Facebook eventually changed course, allowing users to post the photo, citing the photo's historical significance: Because of its status as an iconic image of historical importance, the value of permitting sharing outweighs the value of protecting the community by removal, so we have decided to reinstate the image on Facebook where we are aware it has been removed. What about graphic images of contemporary and past battles? On the one hand, there is clear historic value to images from the American Civil War, the Second World War, and the Vietnam War, some of which include graphic violent content. A social media company implementing a policy prohibiting graphic depictions of violence sounds sensible, but like a policy banning images of nude children it will not eliminate difficult choices or the possibility that such a policy will yield results many users will find inconsistent and confusing. Given that whoever is developing content moderation policies will be put in the position of making tough choices it's far better to leave these choices in the hands of private actors rather than government regulators. Unlike the government, Twitter has a profit motive and competition. As such, it is subject to far more accountability that the government. We may not always like the decisions social media companies make, but private failure is better than government failure. An America where unnamed bureaucrats, not private employees, determine what can be posted on social media is one where free speech is stifled. To be clear, calls for increased government intervention and regulation of social media platforms is a bipartisan phenomenon. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) has discussed a range of possible social media policies[28], including a crackdown on anonymous accounts and regulations modeled on the European so-called 'right to be forgotten.' If such policies were implemented (the First Amendment issues notwithstanding), they would inevitably lead to valuable speech being stifled. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) has said[29] that he's open to carve-outs of Section 230[30] of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online intermediaries such as Facebook and Twitter from liability for what users post on their platforms. When it comes to possibly amending Section 230 Sen. Wyden has some Republican allies. Never mind that some of these Republicans don't seem to fully understand[31] the relevant parts[32] of Section 230. That social media giants are under attack from the left and the right is not an argument for government intervention. Calls for Section 230 amendment or 'anti-censorship' legislation are a serious risk to free speech. If Section 230 is amended to increase social media companies' risk of liability suits we should expect these companies to suppress more speech[33]. Twitter users may not always like what Twitter does, but calls for government intervention are not the remedy.

From the sanctums of Brussels, the bustle of the American campaign trail and the leafy car parks of British technocracy, the same clamour is rising: Silicon Valley has grown too big, and it's time for competition regulators to step in.</p><p>The EU, the USA and the UK have all produced detailed plans for checking the power of big tech - a trend that may in the end prove more consequential than the concurrent sea change happening around privacy. Yet the three blocs are also divided on what is wrong and what precisely should be done about it.</p><p>In the EU, the European Commission has scrutinised and punished US tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, led by its competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/14/ec-threatens-apple-competition-investigation-app-tax/\">who on Thursday promised to investigate Ek's claims</url> ).</p><p>In the US, the Democrat presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has announced a bold if hazy plan to \"break up big tech\". In the UK, a panel of experts led by Harvard professor Jason Furman, a former adviser to Barack Obama, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/14/ec-threatens-apple-competition-investigation-app-tax/\">reported last week that there is too little competition in British digital markets</url> and proposed a raft of measures to fix it.</p><p>Each approach differs in its goals and philosophies, and it is unclear which one will create the best deal for\u00a0consumers. The modern history of competition law starts in the USA in the late 19th century, when powerful corporate \"trusts\" consolidated hundreds of small railways into empires capable of dictating terms and fixing prices.</p><p>Some were broken up, and over the next 30 years politicians extended that approach to meat, tobacco and, most famously, to Standard Oil, which once controlled almost 90pc of the US oil industry but that was eventually divided into 34 separate companies in 1911.</p><p>The justification for doing this was broad: \"If we will not endure a king as a political power,\" said senator John Sherman, \"we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale of any of the necessaries of life.\"</p><p>Today, however, the grounds for antitrust action in the USA have drastically narrowed to a concern for \"consumer welfare\". In the crucible of US courts, that is often narrowed further to the question of whether a given merger will reduce or increase prices. This question is easily gamed by big firms' armies of in-house economists and analysts, and in any case hardly applies to firms such as Google and Facebook whose services are free.</p><p>\"Consumer welfare by itself is a pro-monopoly model,\" says Phillip Blond, director of the think tank ResPublica, which released its own report on \"Technopoly\" last\u00a0year.</p><p>\"An efficient firm can justify buying up a rival if the new organisation offers lower prices. But by this logic, why not let everything in the world be run by one firm, which can\u00a0benefit from economies of scale?\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/14/ec-threatens-apple-competition-investigation-app-tax/\">Tax on Amazon and Google | What is digital services tax?</url></p><p>Elizabeth Warren hopes to change that. Recalling John Sherman\u00a0with her language of \"too much power\", she has called for US regulators to unwind some of the biggest technology mergers of the last 10 years, including Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram and Google's takeover of DoubleClick.</p><p>More radically, she also wants to make it illegal for companies above a certain size to run online marketplaces in which their own products compete.\u00a0Sufficiently big marketplaces would be designated \"platform utilities\", and strictly regulated to ensure non-discriminatory dealing.</p><p>That raised blood pressure for many in the Valley because it goes to the heart of the way big tech operates. Google and Facebook have prospered in part by buying start-ups before they can turn into rivals.</p><p>Imagine what the world would be like if Facebook was now having to compete with WhatsApp and Instagram rather than using them as giant cudgels against Snapchat and Apple's iMessage.</p><p>Imagine how differently the giant service ecosystems of Google, Apple and Amazon would function if they were not permitted to serve simultaneously as highway owners, traffic police and trucking firms.</p><p>Such situations are very common. Google has historically forced smartphone makers who use its Android operating system to bundle its own apps with new phones.</p><p>Amazon allows all kinds of companies to sell products on its website but subjects them to strict and ever-changing conditions such as banning them from selling the same products for lower prices elsewhere, all while analysing the data about what sells and what doesn't, and marketing its own, rival products.</p><p>Amazon's cloud services arm, AWS, also stores and processes data for some of Amazon's fiercest competitors, such as Netflix. Amazon says this data is safe and can be comprehensively encrypted, but there is, at least, a conflict of interest.</p><p>Warren's approach has critics, though, and they are not just in the Valley. \"The plan risks ossifying online products where they are today,\" says David Stallibrass, a former director of the Office of Fair Trading, which was the UK's competition regulator until 2014.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/14/ec-threatens-apple-competition-investigation-app-tax/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>\"It used to be when you bought a computer you would buy the modem and the hard drive separately. If the Warren proposal had come in 1984, it may be that we'd still be doing that.\"</p><p>It's not that platform-product conflicts aren't dangerous, he says; it's just that they should be dealt with on a discretionary basis by competition regulators, rather than banned completely at the risk of huge loss for consumers.</p><p>That brings us to the EU. Since her appointment in 2014, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/14/ec-threatens-apple-competition-investigation-app-tax/\">Vestager has pursued tech companies vigorously</url>, fining Google (EURO)4.3bn (\u00a33.7bn) for its policies on pre-installed apps. As a result, Google's apps are no longer mandatory in the EU, and Google now actually charges phone makers to carry them (Google is appealing against the fine). The EU's standards for what hurts consumers are wider and more varied than many US judges', letting it intervene in cases where price is not at issue.</p><p>Prof Furman's review, commissioned by the British Treasury,\u00a0takes a third path. It rejects\u00a0Warren's approach because\u00a0it entrenches a \"utility\" operator's monopoly in exchange for\u00a0tighter regulation, reducing\u00a0the dynamism of competitive markets.</p><p>But it also argues that relying solely on big regulators throwing big punches creates delays and uncertainty. Instead it describes a new system for continuously negotiating a \"code of conduct\" with the tech industry, setting standards up front rather than punishing after the fact, alongside greater powers for the Competition and Markets Authority.</p><p>Stallibrass finds that a sensible way forward. \"Antitrust has its impact on the market through deterrence,\" he says, \"and to deter it has to be predictable.\"</p><p>\"It took eight years and two attempts for the European Commission to form a case against Google Shopping. During those eight years firms didn't have any guidance about what was and what was not acceptable, and even now the case has been appealed.\"</p><p>But Blond is disappointed by the report's reliance on \"consumer welfare\", even if it is a broader version than often used in the US. \"Post-Brexit Britain has the chance to really reinvent competition policy,\" he says. \"It could be leading the world. But nobody can lead the world with a code of conduct.\"</p><p>Still, that is not the only trick up Prof Furman's sleeve. In order to shake up the market, he proposes that users' data should be portable between different services.</p><p>Just as you might switch your account from one energy provider to another, or from one bank to another, you could shift your friends lists, photos and message histories from Facebook to elsewhere.</p><p>This makes intuitive sense: isn't your search history your own history? Didn't you generate it with the sweat of your brow? Why shouldn't you pick it up from Google, take it over to a competitor and let some new algorithms nibble away at it? In theory, users would be less locked into their services, which would need to work harder to retain them.</p><p>The problem is that this would put the onus on consumers to bother switching, who probably won't. According to Ofgem, the energy regulator, 60pc of British households are still on default energy tariffs, despite these being generally the most expensive plans.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/14/ec-threatens-apple-competition-investigation-app-tax/\">What is the Open Data Institute?</url></p><p>\"Even in markets where people have a clear financial incentive to switch to a new service, there's been a long record of consumer inertia,\" says Catherine Miller, director of policy at Doteveryone, a tech ethics think tank.</p><p>\"Given that people don't change their habits even for cash in hand, how likely are they to switch their social networks for less tangible benefits?\"</p><p>Worse, true data portability could be a privacy nightmare. Many of the biggest privacy scandals of the last two years, from Cambridge Analytica to the recent revelation that some pregnancy apps are keeping Facebook up to date on their users' menstrual cycles, have sprung from the way data is shared between different services.</p><p>\"You could create an open data standard and suddenly half the population are sharing every bit of their internet usage with a company that they don't even recognise,\" says\u00a0Stallibrass.</p><p>A more promising proposal is to compel some big tech firms to open up their data to the world. This data would be anonymised, relating to broad consumer trends rather than individual customers, but it would still be a rich resource.</p><p>Citing the small industry that has grown up around the real-time transit data released by Transport for\u00a0London, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/14/ec-threatens-apple-competition-investigation-app-tax/\">Prof Furman's report argues</url> that this would open the market to new challengers, which could feast on the information\u00a0that incumbents have spent years collecting.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/14/ec-threatens-apple-competition-investigation-app-tax/\">FAQ | Open Banking</url></p><p>Suppose, says Jeni Tennison, chief executive of the Open Data Institute, whose work on \"open banking\" helped inform the Furman review, that Amazon was forced to divulge its\u00a0insights about what products prosper and what kinds of people buy\u00a0them.</p><p>That might not only help Amazon's competitors but create niches for new companies to form, like sea creatures huddling in the warmth of an underwater vent. Next to Warren's Teddy Roosevelt impression, this may\u00a0seem like small beer. But then Britain could never wield the same power over US companies that the US itself can.</p><p>When the Spanish government ruled against Google's news service, Google simply suspended that service in Spain.</p><p>And in fact, all these three approaches, should they end up coming to fruition, may actually work together: Prof Furman's report devotes many pages to ways in which\u00a0Britain can collaborate with other competition regulators around the world.</p><p>If that happens, the days when tech giants snapped up start-ups like John D Rockefeller in a hoodie, and took fees from their rivals for the privilege of competing with them, may eventually seem as remote as the age of Standard Oil.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-52629667</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN8-C721-F021-6566-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1888\"/><timeReceived>3:32 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 16, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

In a speech in Berlin accompanied by a website titled \"Time to Play Fair\", Spotify's chief executive Daniel Ek accused Apple of using its control over the iPhone's App Store to systematically suppress competition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The smartphone giant, he claimed, had charged extortionate fees, impeded in-app purchases and even arbitrarily rejected bug fixes - all, he implied, in order to give an unfair advantage to its own Apple Music.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He chose his moment well. From the sanctums of Brussels, the bustle of the American campaign trail and the leafy car parks of British technocracy, the same clamour is rising: Silicon Valley has grown too big, and it's time for competition regulators to step in.</p><p>The EU, the USA and the UK have all produced detailed plans for checking the power of big tech - a trend that may in the end prove more consequential than the concurrent sea change happening around privacy. Yet the three blocs are also divided on what is wrong and what precisely should be done about it.</p><p>In the EU, the European Commission has scrutinised and punished US tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, led by its competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager (who on Thursday promised to investigate Ek's claims).</p><p>In the US, the Democrat presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has announced a bold if hazy plan to \"break up big tech\". In the UK, a panel of experts led by Harvard professor Jason Furman, a former adviser to Barack Obama, reported last week that there is too little competition in British digital markets and proposed a raft of measures to fix it.</p><p>Each approach differs in its goals and philosophies, and it is unclear which one will create the best deal for consumers. The modern history of competition law starts in the USA in the late 19th century, when powerful corporate \"trusts\" consolidated hundreds of small railways into empires capable of dictating terms and fixing prices.</p><p>Some were broken up, and over the next 30 years politicians extended that approach to meat, tobacco and, most famously, to Standard Oil, which once controlled almost 90pc of the US oil industry but that was eventually divided into 34 separate companies in 1911.</p><p>The justification for doing this was broad: \"If we will not endure a king as a political power,\" said senator John Sherman, \"we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale of any of the necessaries of life.\"</p><p>Today, however, the grounds for antitrust action in the USA have drastically narrowed to a concern for \"consumer welfare\". In the crucible of US courts, that is often narrowed further to the question of whether a given merger will reduce or increase prices. This question is easily gamed by big firms' armies of in-house economists and analysts, and in any case hardly applies to firms such as Google and Facebook whose services are free.</p><p>\"Consumer welfare by itself is a pro-monopoly model,\" says Phillip Blond, director of the think tank ResPublica, which released its own report on \"Technopoly\" last year.</p><p>\"An efficient firm can justify buying up a rival if the new organisation offers lower prices. But by this logic, why not let everything in the world be run by one firm, which can benefit from economies of scale?\" Elizabeth Warren hopes to change that. Recalling John Sherman with her language of \"too much power\", she has called for US regulators to unwind some of the biggest technology mergers of the last 10 years, including Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram and Google's takeover of DoubleClick.</p><p>More radically, she also wants to make it illegal for companies above a certain size to run online marketplaces in which their own products compete. Sufficiently big marketplaces would be designated \"platform utilities\", and strictly regulated to ensure non-discriminatory dealing.</p><p>That raised blood pressure for many in the Valley because it goes to the heart of the way big tech operates. Google and Facebook have prospered in part by buying start-ups before they can turn into rivals.</p><p>Imagine what the world would be like if Facebook was now having to compete with WhatsApp and Instagram rather than using them as giant cudgels against Snapchat and Apple's iMessage.</p><p>Imagine how differently the giant service ecosystems of Google, Apple and Amazon would function if they were not permitted to serve simultaneously as highway owners, traffic police and trucking firms.</p><p>Such situations are very common.</p><p>Google has historically forced smartphone makers who use its Android operating system to bundle its own apps with new phones.</p><p>Amazon allows all kinds of companies to sell products on its website but subjects them to strict and ever-changing conditions such as banning them from selling the same products for lower prices elsewhere, all while analysing the data about what sells and what doesn't, and marketing its own, rival products.</p><p>Amazon's cloud services arm, AWS, also stores and processes data for some of Amazon's fiercest competitors, such as Netflix. Amazon says this data is safe and can be comprehensively encrypted, but there is, at least, a conflict of interest.</p><p>Warren's approach has critics, though, and they are not just in the Valley. \"The plan risks ossifying online products where they are today,\" says David Stallibrass, a former director of the Office of Fair Trading, which was the UK's competition regulator until 2014.</p><p>\"It used to be when you bought a computer you would buy the modem and the hard drive separately. If the Warren proposal had come in 1984, it may be that we'd still be doing that.\"</p><p>It's not that platform-product conflicts aren't dangerous, he says; it's just that they should be dealt with on a discretionary basis by competition regulators, rather than banned completely at the risk of huge loss for consumers.</p><p>That brings us to the EU. Since her appointment in 2014, Vestager has pursued tech companies vigorously, fining Google (EURO)4.3bn (\u00a33.7bn) for its policies on pre-installed apps. As a result, Google's apps are no longer mandatory in the EU, and Google now actually charges phone makers to carry them (Google is appealing against the fine). The EU's standards for what hurts consumers are wider and more varied than many US judges', letting it intervene in cases where price is not at issue.</p><p>Prof Furman's review, commissioned by the British Treasury, takes a third path. It rejects Warren's approach because it entrenches a \"utility\" operator's monopoly in exchange for tighter regulation, reducing the dynamism of competitive markets.</p><p>But it also argues that relying solely on big regulators throwing big punches creates delays and uncertainty. Instead it describes a new system for continuously negotiating a \"code of conduct\" with the tech industry, setting standards up front rather than punishing after the fact, alongside greater powers for the Competition and Markets Authority.</p><p>Stallibrass finds that a sensible way forward.</p><p>\"Antitrust has its impact on the market through deterrence,\" he says, \"and to deter it has to be predictable. It took eight years and two attempts for the European Commission to form a case against Google Shopping.</p><p>During those eight years firms didn't have any guidance about what was and what was not acceptable, and even now the case has been appealed.\"</p><p>But Blond is disappointed by the report's reliance on \"consumer welfare\", even if it is a broader version than often used in the US. \"Post-Brexit Britain has the chance to really reinvent competition policy,\" he says. \"It could be leading the world. But nobody can lead the world with a code of conduct.\"</p><p>Still, that is not the only trick up Prof Furman's sleeve. In order to shake up the market, he proposes that users' data should be portable between different services.</p><p>Just as you might switch your account from one energy provider to another, or from one bank to another, you could shift your friends lists, photos and message histories from Facebook to elsewhere.</p><p>This makes intuitive sense: isn't your search history your own history? Didn't you generate it with the sweat of your brow? Why shouldn't you pick it up from Google, take it over to a competitor and let some new algorithms nibble away at it? In theory, users would be less locked into their services, which would need to work harder to retain them.</p><p>The problem is that this would put the onus on consumers to bother switching, who probably won't. According to Ofgem, the energy regulator, 60pc of British households are still on default energy tariffs, despite these being generally the most expensive plans.</p><p>\"Even in markets where people have a clear financial incentive to switch to a new service, there's been a long record of consumer inertia,\" says Catherine Miller, director of policy at Doteveryone, a tech ethics think tank.</p><p>\"Given that people don't change their habits even for cash in hand, how likely are they to switch their social networks for less tangible benefits?\" Worse, true data portability could be a privacy nightmare. Many of the biggest privacy scandals of the last two years, from Cambridge Analytica to the recent revelation that some pregnancy apps are keeping Facebook up to date on their users' menstrual cycles, have sprung from the way data is shared between different services.</p><p>\"You could create an open data standard and suddenly half the population are sharing every bit of their internet usage with a company that they don't even recognise,\" says Stallibrass.</p><p>A more promising proposal is to compel some big tech firms to open up their data to the world. This data would be anonymised, relating to broad consumer trends rather than individual customers, but it would still be a rich resource.</p><p>Citing the small industry that has grown up around the real-time transit data released by Transport for London, Prof Furman's report argues that this would open the market to new challengers, which could feast on the information that incumbents have spent years collecting.</p><p>Suppose, says Jeni Tennison, chief executive of the Open Data Institute, whose work on \"open banking\" helped inform the Furman review, that Amazon was forced to divulge its insights about what products prosper and what kinds of people buy them.</p><p>That might not only help Amazon's competitors but create niches for new companies to form, like sea creatures huddling in the warmth of an underwater vent. Next to Warren's Teddy Roosevelt impression, this may seem like small beer. But then Britain could never wield the same power over US companies that the US itself can.</p><p>When the Spanish government ruled against Google's news service, Google simply suspended that service in Spain.</p><p>And in fact, all these three approaches, should they end up coming to fruition, may actually work together: Prof Furman's report devotes many pages to ways in which Britain can collaborate with other competition regulators around the world.</p><p>If that happens, the days when tech giants snapped up start-ups like John D Rockefeller in a hoodie, and took fees from their rivals for the privilege of competing with them, may eventually seem as remote as the age of Standard Oil.</p><p>'Post-Brexit Britain has the chance to really reinvent competition policy. It could be leading the world.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Elizabeth Warren wants tech giants untangled</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUTELE-147429238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUTELE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNF-HF21-JCBW-N05P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334988</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58170\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 17, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFJT</classCode><className>SPOTIFY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There is no better example of the way government has sought to exert control on the private sector than by using anti-trust laws, supposedly aimed at breaking up monopolies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It isn't that government should disregard policies that seek to discourage monopolistic behavior. However, instead of government reinforcing the market as an instrument of competition, it has induced the conditions that are favorable for monopolies to develop. Government and corporate entities have effectively been able to form coalitions that suppress competition, by politicians granting business elites the privilege of writing the parameters that regulate the very same industries to which these corporations belong. One would be hard-pressed to find any condition under which monopolies have formed without the help of government.</p><p> On the contrary, the Internet is a good example of an industry that has been allowed to proliferate with minimal regulation, resulting in maximum efficiency and innovation. Yet government is constantly seeking to dismantle the very same tech syndicates who have helped create the Internet revolution from which the majority of people have benefited.</p><p> The Department of Justice and other federal bureaucrats claim that industry dominance and massive market capitalization are the reasons why tech titans like Google, Facebook and Amazon have fallen into political cross-hairs. However, market size shouldn't unilaterally constitute anti-trust regulation if there are no ill-effects of market dominance. The forces that characterize a true monopoly result from the outcome of one firm hijacking the market, siphoning off competition, artificially inflating prices and reducing output quality ... none of which exists in the tech industry.</p><p> No one denies that Google has achieved Internet dominance, but the conditions that reflect the state of Internet search in no way constitutes anti-trust regulation. There are no harmful side-effects that accompany Google's dominance. In the first place, Google has revolutionized the way users explore data, cataloging the web as efficiently as anyone. Secondly, they continue to add utilities that significantly improve user experience, all without any cost to consumers. Moreover, because technology has been devoid of heavy regulation, there is still Internet search participation from competitors such as Bing, Yahoo and Duck-Duck-Go, just to name a few.</p><p>Facebook is another high-profile target of government regulation similar to Google. Government believes that social media need to be protected from the control that Facebook has on the market. Yet, even with Facebook's social-media presence there have been no harmful consequences within the social-networking domain. Facebook has developed unprecedented ways to interact without any added costs, none of which have been to the detriment of competition. Additionally, networking outlets like Twitter, Snapchat and LinkedIn offer reputable alternatives to Facebook.</p><p>Amazon is another company that has also remained in government's line of sight. Yet, Amazon has revolutionized online retail shopping by offering speed, convenience and choice for its users with minimal costs. Although Amazon has a large share of the e-commerce market, online shoppers continue to experience quality service without added pricing. Furthermore, other online retailers exist as an option to Amazon.</p><p> Thus, like Facebook and Google, Amazon's online presence has produced more benefits than costs.</p><p> Although the tech triad of Google, Facebook and Amazon share much of the same commercial success, the industries they have come to \"dominate\" all continue to operate with efficiency, innovation and with minimal costs to end-users. Lawmakers typically initiate anti-trust measures for the benefit of protecting consumers against unfair pricing and lack of choice. Seeking to dismantle businesses entirely on the basis of market dominance, especially in the absence of monopolistic effects, would only serve to punish success and productivity.</p><p>     Gwayne Gautreaux studied international political economy through Penn State's World Campus and has researched trade, foreign policy and economic indicators that predict market outcomes.

It is not before time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For too many years, big digital companies have shopped around the world looking for low-tax countries to park much of their revenue, handing them huge financial gains. Last week Google finally relented and agreed to pay almost half a billion dollars to Australia's tax office after having its accounts closely scrutinised going back a decade from 2018. The ATO has also raked in more than $1.2 billion from Microsoft, Apple and Facebook during the past two years under tougher anti-tax avoidance laws for multinationals with annual global income of more than a $1 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australia is not alone in tightening its grip on tax revenues, with France going a step further and agreeing to a new digital tax, forcing mostly big US tech companies to hand over 3 per cent of all revenue accrued within the country. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-election-digital-tax/britains-johnson-backs-digital-tax-despite-trumps-ire-idUSKBN1Y80TD\">backed a similar tax</url> in Britain. US President Donald Trump       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/business/trump-france-tariffs.html\">was quick to defend the American companies</url>, threatening to hit France with increased tariffs on many of its products.</p><p>But most countries agree that more needs to be done to clamp down on big tech companies, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/public-consultation-document-secretariat-proposal-unified-approach-pillar-one.pdf\">the OECD</url> leading a push to introduce a new global tax regime to ensure they pay their fair share.

That could have happened to anyone. As each day drifts past, it is getting harder to be sure what <person><nameText>Theresa May's </nameText></person>government stands for. Or even what it might do tomorrow. Will it raise taxes or lower them? Will it reduce immigration and, if so, which kind? Will it raise public sector wages in more places, or continue the freeze? The vacillations and disunity and the panic about the mysterious \"youth vote\" - discussed at the Tory party conference last week as if it were a new pandemic virus - make it hard to predict.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I recently asked a cabinet minister to tell me what the point of this government is, and why anyone should vote for it. He thought for a while, then said: \"To keep <person><nameText>Jeremy Corbyn </nameText></person>out.\"</p><p>Anything else? I asked. He couldn't say. Personally, I think Corbyn is a dangerous ideologue who could ruin this country. But \"not being Corbyn\" is not enough.</p><p>Governing is a horribly complex, thankless business. It's difficult to explain the nuances of responsible government when you're up against an ideologue such as Corbyn, on fire with the purity of his principles. But the answer to the Labour leader is not small, apologetic gestures. When the prime minister announced that she would freeze student tuition fees at \u00a39,250 last week, I was surprised. My children have not reached university age yet, so I thought that the maximum tuition fees were still \u00a39,000. May has a knack of drawing attention to problems, while offering insufficient solutions.</p><p>To respond effectively to Corbyn, you first need to accept where he has a point. When he talks about the \"rigged economy\", it resonates. In our country, big tech companies get away with avoiding huge amounts of tax. Speculative foreign buyers hoard new flats that could have housed teachers and nurses. Some commuters in the southeast have lost their jobs waiting for trains that never came. And many of us are treated with contempt and suspicion if we try to open a bank account, take out a loan or get broadband.</p><p>None of these things are easy to put right. But with a few heroic exceptions, this government is increasingly looking too weary to try.</p><p>In Manchester last week some Conservatives were passionately replaying the old philosophical clash between free markets and interventionism. But this is a false choice. It is only right to curb the excesses of capitalism, challenge vested interests and regulate monopolies on behalf of the consumer and the little guy. The fact that I want to see intelligent regulation of driverless cars and AI does not mean that I want a centralised economy in which ministers impose rent controls.</p><p>May needs to do much more to explain the difference. And she needs to do so because the public seems to have largely moved on from Brexit. It is worried about the NHS, about inflation, about terrorism, just at the time when the colossal effort of Brexit is sucking Whitehall's energy away from everything.</p><p>Delivering Brexit would be tough enough without warring ministers. Weakened by the election, the prime minister has an almost impossible task in holding the ring. She did a good job in Florence two weeks ago, getting agreement in principle to a transitional deal. But she also deferred the fundamental question of which model she would choose, Canadian-style or Norwegian-style, if the European Union does not yield to her plea to find a third way. That is an issue on which she is too weak to impose unity in her cabinet.</p><p>Fifteen months after the referendum, the continued lack of a detailed immigration policy leaves the country no wiser and makes it impossible to flush out Corbyn.</p><p>The Labour leader, like President Donald Trump, is a populist who speaks of governing for all the people, but in practice seems interested only in handing power to his cronies. That is surely what the country should most fear.</p><p>The prime minister had a prime opportunity to make this case in Manchester, which with its new mayor is the foremost example of the Conservatives' radical devolution of power over everything from economic development to the NHS. But once again, her reluctance to credit the government of David Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, with any achievements deprived her of ammunition.</p><p>The main thing keeping <person><nameText>Theresa May </nameText></person>in place is <person><nameText>Jeremy Corbyn </nameText></person>- or rather Tory MPs' fear of another election that he might win. Many would like her to soldier on until March 2019, when they imagine that Britain will miraculously leave the EU and a new leader will have time to build a new vision for Britain. But that blueprint does not allow for events. A leadership contest is in fact unlikely to prompt a snap election, but there could be an unforeseen event that will.</p><p>The longer the government stumbles on, the more voters see it as clinging on to power for its own sake. And the more likely it becomes that it will mishandle something that Corbyn could exploit. Until May sets a date for her departure, there will be drift. And that is far more deadly than a cough.Lady Cavendish was head of David Cameron's policy unit at No 10 from 2015-16</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-38049650</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PNF-G561-JCJY-G3N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 8, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODNCRkRDNTI0RkM4NEE0OEE2M0VEQUEzRDk4RTkzRDc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTQ2RUE5QUY1ODcwNDEyNThDNEI1OTlEMUY3ODQxMjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0009P2L</classCode><className>TUITION FEES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLR8</classCode><className>UK CONSERVATIVE PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

So I'm working a lot with [Microsoft CEO] Satya [Nadella] and the product leaders who work with Satya about 'yes, let's be super ambitious, let's drive this stuff forward'.\" Throughout his 62 years, Gates has never been accused of being anything other that super ambitious in all he does. From technology to business to philanthropy, he has a hunger to learn that remains undimmed by his amassing a $US86 billion fortune that makes him the world's second-richest man behind Amazon chief Jeff Bezos.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The shelves in his office are crammed with books attesting to his wandering mind. There is a section devoted to global health trends, to pandemics, diseases, cures, and of course, philanthropy.</p><p>Another covers US and global politics, especially China, another is full of the classics of literature, and still more space is dedicated to tomes on computers, the brain and the future.</p><p>While his main job is running the massive Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest charitable body, Gates remains intrigued not only by the future of technology but by the genie that has been unlocked by the world's new tech giants.</p><p>The rise and rise of the so-called \"big four\" - Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook - has transformed the way we live and work in a way that Gates himself did with Microsoft's personal computer revolution in the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>\"The tech companies, in terms of impact - it's phenomenal to see that vision that software and internet services would be a huge deal is largely coming true,\" he says.</p><p>Microsoft, with a market value of $700 billion, remains a part of this club and is often described as the fifth of the tech giants.</p><p>Gates still holds a 1.3 per cent stake in the company. As its founder, he is watching with interest a growing global backlash - dubbed by many the \"tech lash\" - and debate about the size, dominance and influence of the tech giants.</p><p>Gates has been here before. The rise and rise of Microsoft in the'80s and'90s led to an anti-trust showdown with the US government in 2001 amid claims the company had become a monopoly that engaged in anti-competitive practices. Seventeen years later, Gates is watching on as the new generation of tech giants gets hit with similar claims and more.</p><p>Amazon has been accused of destroying bricks and mortar retailers with its online shopping platform, Facebook has apologised for allowing fake news and Russian propaganda on its sites, and Apple and Google face accusations of monopoly abuse, among other claims.</p><p>Gates believes the transformative benefits of these companies for our lives is overwhelmingly positive, but he agrees there needs to be a debate and there needs to be scrutiny of this new era of Big Tech.</p><p>\"Absolutely people should be debating these tech giants,\" he says, \"whether it's privacy or how people consume the news, or hate speech. They'd be crazy not to be talking about the government policies that touch on the services that these companies offer. When it comes to competition, they should be looking - do they feel it's healthy and all that. So I don't think that there is too much talk about it.' Gates cites Franklin Foer's World Without Mind: The existential threat of big tech (2017), which offers a dark vision of the way the tech giants are trampling on privacy and pushing us towards the automation and homogenisation of social, political and intellectual life. \"There was a book, World Without Mind, where the guy really didn't get into the key issues all that much, but it's good that it's debated,\" he says. \"All these (tech) companies are trying to be largely beneficial, but governments are there to check in terms of each policy in each country what the rules of the road are.\" As far as Gates' work with Microsoft is concerned, there are few rules of the road. As the founder, he has the freedom to roam across the business and to suggest ideas and innovations, even though there is no longer an obligation for the company to take them up. His penchant for looking beyond the horizon sees him increasingly intrigued with the potential of the world of artificial intelligence, a topic that still divides some of the world greatest thinkers and innovators.</p><p>World-renowned physicist Steven Hawking and billionaire investor and entrepreneur Elon Musk have warned that AI may one day be able to destroy our civilisation. \"Success in creating effective AI could be the biggest event in the history of our civilisation,\" says Hawking. \"Or the worst. We just don't know.\" Musk, head of Telsa and SpaceX, believes AI poses \"a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilisation\" because robots may one day be able to do everything better than humans.</p><p>Two years ago, Gates was also wary of AI. \"I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence,\" he said in January 2015. \"With artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon.\" But as he has looked more closely at the issue, he has become an optimist, believing that AI could be harnessed as a force for good rather than evil.</p><p>\"It's like a lot of new technology,\" he says. \"You know, is it good that we embraced cell phones? On balance, yes. Are there ways that they're used in terms of how people consume their news or how kids socialise with each other, are there things there that we need to be careful about?</p><p>\"AI is very similar in that it's going to raise productivity. And so if AI helps us to cure cancer or find new malaria drugs, that's pretty non-controversial.\" He says progress in AI will see machines doing more people's jobs, but says that can also be harnessed for good.</p><p>\"In a sense you could say that's good news. It means you're able to make the goods and services with fewer people. And if you really free up people, and governments are enlightened about it, if those people go into reducing class size and helping old people and helping special needs kids, having an extra human resource if it's properly allocated is a big win.\" Gates says the alternative is to retreat and accept a less productive and forward-looking world, something he could never condone. \"You certainly wouldn't want to run the clock backwards and have less productivity and say 'oh, this is great, we all get to farm again, nobody has to worry about unemployment, we're just trying to get barely enough to eat'. So time and innovation has been largely beneficial.\" He is still passionate about innovation and leadership. A year ago, after meeting with the then incoming president Donald Trump, he said he hoped Trump would \"organise things, get rid of regulatory barriers and have American leadership through innovation\". A year on, Gates says it is \"complicated\" to assess Trump's performance so far as president.</p><p>\"Well it is a very complicated thing, because some of the things about strong relationships with other countries, he has kind of thrown up the traditional approach in terms of trade and even mutual cooperation through the UN.\" Gates hopes Trump's \"America First\" approach does not translate into an insular approach to the world's problems, a move that would go against everything his Foundation stands for.</p><p>\"You do have to worry that people take the rhetoric around America First and interpret that to say, 'okay, we don't need to stop pandemics in other countries, we don't need to help create stability in those countries'. So it's a very political situation in the America First context - will the things we think are important about stopping pandemics, raising agricultural productivity, will those things continue?\" \"Some things, some leading indicators, are clearly worrisome, like pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord, because African farmers are the ones who already to some degree and increasingly will be bearing the brunt of climate change. That's something we wish hadn't happened.\" One of Gates' many quests is to encourage today's new crop of billionaires to follow his lead in giving away their wealth for good causes. He has pledged to give away 99 per cent of his during his lifetime, with the Gates Foundation currently handing out more than $US5 billion a year to charitable causes.</p><p>In 2010, Gates and fellow US billionaire Warren Buffett formed the Giving Pledge, a campaign to encourage wealthy people to give at least half of their net worth to philanthropy. The group now has a remarkable 158 members ,and Gates is happy that a new crop of billionaires, from Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to Elon Musk and even Australia's Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest are among the signatories.</p><p>\"I know Andrew (Forrest) very well. Andrew has been a great philanthropist, a super-energetic guy. He came to me and talked about how you could make it clear to people [about modern-day slavery] and we brainstormed about, hey, could you really measure it, and he came up with the index [to rank countries based on the prevalence of slavery].\" Gates hopes today's new wave of billionaires, many created by the tech revolution, will underpin America's rich history of private philanthropy. \"The US has a history of quite a bit of philanthropy.</p><p>The most famous are from the turn of the century - Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ford Foundation. Those are the three giants.</p><p>\"There is a new wave, that as you are seeing large fortunes created, it's very appropriate that a reasonable percentage of those people commit a high percentage of that money to various philanthropic things.\" Gates last month called for Australia to become the regional champion of a historic drive to completely eradicate malaria from Asia within 10 years. The Turnbull Government is backing the push as a part of Gates' ambition to help eradicate the disease worldwide by 2040.</p><p>He likes Australia and has visited at least a dozen times. Last year, he travelled to central Queensland to see how digital agriculture is being used to raise local cattle and how it might be applied in places such as Africa.</p><p>\"I love going to Australia,\" he says. \"\"Last Fall, Melinda and I were bicycling around Melbourne and I was saying to her, hey, we've got to come to the Australian (tennis) Open at some point.\" Such is the speed and scale of Gates' philanthropy - his Foundation has given away $US28 billion since 2007 - that he is no longer the world's richest man. He was eclipsed last year by Amazon's Bezos, but he doesn't care.</p><p>\"The reason I'm not the world's richest man is because I've given money away - I will be getting less and less rich all the time,\" he says, smiling.\"We've gotten great impact from the money we've given, and we're going to keep on doing it, so I'll go lower and lower... it's great fun.\" Cameron Stewart is also US Contributor for Sky News Australia</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20180216DealNSW12000360127764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RN7-WWY1-JD3N-54RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>DealNSW Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 16, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>BILL &amp;

Editorial content from other publications and authors is provided to give readers a sampling of regional and national opinion and does not necessarily reflect positions endorsed by the Editorial Board of The Daily News.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FacebookCEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>congressional testimony last week illuminated shortcomings in how the United States has responded to the digital age. Among them are a failure to adequately safeguard the privacy of citizens, a reluctance to hold big business accountable, and a lack of understanding of the issue among senators.</p><p> It also illuminated the need for Congress and state legislatures to protect consumers and establish standards for social media companies.</p><p> The odds of that happening appear slim in the wake of <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>testimony, which included now-tiresome apologies for failing to keep private data private. Facebook\u2014 and similar companies \u2014 cull mountains of information regarding the personal lives and personal preferences of citizens for the purpose of selling that information to advertisers. It is a smart business model, one that has made <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>a billionaire many times over, but it is one that belies the idea of privacy. For example, Facebookcollects data even about people who are not members of the site.</p><p> All of this has drawn new attention in the wake of the 2016 election. Facebookexposed the data of up to 87 million users to a Russian-American researcher at Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked for the Trump campaign.</p><p> Regardless of the influence of Cambridge Analytica and its targeted advertisements (and targeted fake news) during the campaign, the fact is that those who voted for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>had myriad reasons for doing so. It would be inaccurate to suggest that the meddling swayed the election, but it also would be misguided to ignore the impact outside forces are having upon our democratic system.</p><p> The failure of the United States to take data privacy seriously stands in contrast to what is being done in Europe. On May 25, the European Union will enact the General Data Protection Regulation, a new privacy law designed to ensure that consumers understand what information is being collected. Among the provisions, companies that collect data must request consent from users; firms must notify users of a data breach within 72 hours of discovering it; and companies must allow users to request a copy of the information that has been collected about them.</p><p> Judging from last week's hearings, such detailed protections appear to be beyond the scope of Congress, as several senators revealed they have little understanding of how Facebookand social media work. In questioning <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>about possible oversight, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said, \"OK, would you submit to us some proposed regulations?\"</p><p> Allowing the fox to guard the henhouse has become all too common for Congress, which frequently allows stakeholders to devise solutions for the problems they have created. Consulting experts who can view an issue from all angles would be a far more effective approach. As Lee Drutman wrote for Vox.com: \"This is how corporate power works in Washington these days. Time and time again, it's the industry lobbyists who write the bills. That's just what Graham is used to seeing. Why should this time be different?\"</p><p> The loser in that process is the public. Four years ago, big tech companies fought against a proposed online bill of rights; that opposition has had predictable results. Citizens should let lawmakers around the country know that we expect our online activity to remain private instead of allowing it to be viewed as a vein of gold ready for mining.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKWA-2628788e50bf7234c646ee3a9377e11d8a36f61</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289CBBEDC4A607 NWBKWA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4X-FNG1-JBCN-405T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Bezos, as owner and publisher of the Washington Post, has kept that paper among the most prominent in the world. In Colorado, we have thousands of good-paying jobs at Amazon facilities. And as consumers, we benefit from the efficiency of their product delivery service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, while we\u2019ve come to praise Amazon and Bezos, we also need to be honest about a darker side. </p><p>Killing Free Speech, a provocative and thought-provoking two-part documentary, has been censored and is not available on Amazon. Killing Free Speech is not the first work by Danish-American documentary producer Michael Hansen that has incurred the wrath of Amazon. A previous work on mass migration and militant Islam in Europe was similarly given the boot.</p><p>And it is not just voices from the Right that have been subjected to censorship. Left-wing radical Michael Moore\u2019s Planet of the Humans was dropped for an extended period from YouTube over a spurious copyright beef. Citizen K, a withering portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the post-Soviet kleptocracy, was also pulled from Amazon. Censorship of views that are not popular with tech giants is growing, and we need to address the issue honestly and openly. </p><p>Censorship is just plain wrong. And no, these are not merely private actors exercising business decisions. These are companies that operate on publicly regulated airwaves, on cable systems that are similarly regulated, and operate businesses that always have their hand out for more and more governmental subsidies. </p><p>It invites the question of what must Amazon be afraid of? Why are they so thin-skinned?</p><p>Thomas Jefferson wrote that \u201cour liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.\u201d Today, the platforms for delivering political views are different than at the time our nation was founded, but this basic and immutable concept still remains true.</p><p>Even if you are totally apolitical, you should still be very concerned about Amazon\u2019s behavior. </p><p>It is widely reported that popular and innovative streaming services such as Peacock, HBO Max, and AT&amp;T TV are not available to consumers on Amazon\u2019s Firestick and FireTV, which are industry-leading.</p><p>Yet, favored companies such as Hulu, Disney, and Netflix are readily available on those Amazon devices.</p><p>Most suspect this disparity is due to data sharing arrangements that only favor Amazon but cost consumers the right to access whatever services they want. Consumers should be free to choose, and they should also know what personal data is being shared with whom and for what reasons. For example, when my son and I watch The Lion King on Disney+, we aren\u2019t also signing up to let others know it\u2019s time for a new order of diapers and wipes.</p><p>Moreover, during this time of a pandemic, many Coloradans are doing their part by staying at home. Students are taking their lessons at home using a variety of content options. With the growing importance of video streaming services, it is essential that access be fully transparent and open.</p><p>On July 27, Bezos and the CEOs of Apple, Alphabet, and Facebook appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, where Coloradan Reps. Ken Buck and Joe Neguse each asked tough and pointed questions. But one hearing is not enough. They need more follow-up \u2014 to include bringing other senior officials from those companies before the committee.</p><p>Buck, as a former assistant United States attorney and a district attorney, along with Neguse, the former executive director of the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, were uniquely qualified to address these issues and posed fair but tough and challenging questions. Buck, a former prosecutor, asked particularly probing questions of Bezos concerning highly unethical practices at Amazon. More of the same needs to happen to hold these giants of the tech world accountable. </p><p>It is interesting that all four of these tech giants advocated for so-called \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d regulations on the internet, and yet, they currently violate several essential net neutrality principles. For example, Google and Apple both engage in \u201cpaid prioritization,\u201d while Amazon blocks competing streaming services. These companies are calling for net neutrality rules on every other internet user, and yet, they violate those rules themselves.</p><p>The tech giants don\u2019t just manipulate their platforms to exclude commercial competitors; they exclude ideological ones as well. Much of the focus in this regard has been on Facebook, Twitter, and Google \u2014 but Amazon, the world\u2019s dominant online retailer, has also, to use Google\u2019s terminology, \u201cshifted towards censorship.\u201d The tech giant is a digital book-burner, censoring books it considers to be too politically controversial, including criticism of Islamist extremism.</p><p>Congress, and in particular Reps. Buck and Neguse, should continue to look into the anti-competitive behavior of Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple. There should be more hearings where these CEOs and leaders are forced to answer questions on the record. In Colorado, we have many high-tech companies and want to attract more \u2014 by standing up to the \"Big Four,\" they will be standing alongside the job creators in the fast-growing Colorado technology sector. Many of my newest constituents moved to Colorado Springs for jobs in the tech sector \u2014 a trend I want to foster and grow. </p><p>Congress needs to enact legislation to protect the concept of an open internet that applies to all parts of the internet ecosystem \u2014 including the Big Tech companies.</p><p>This is not a partisan question by any means; tough questions were posed by both liberals and conservatives, Democrats, and Republicans. There is lots of talk of bipartisanship \u2014 maybe this is one area where we can actually make it happen.</p><p>Dave Williams serves in Colorado's state House of Representatives.</p><p>Photo Caption:Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon.com, speaks in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, D.C.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2443591884</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VW-SJ41-JBHT-D0RX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1014\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Der Streit zeigt, wie sehr Amerikas Liebe zu den Tech-Konzernen erkaltet ist.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Einer der h\u00f6chsten Werte der USA ist traditionell der Fortschritt. Der Glaube an die positiven Folgen von Technologie war lange so stark, dass sich entsprechende Unternehmen praktisch alles erlauben konnten. Datenschutz? Kartellgefahr? Nicht so wichtig. Facebook, Apple und Co. hatten bisher eine Art regulatorischen Freifahrtschein.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nun pl\u00f6tzlich ist dieses Privileg bedroht. Amerikas Tech-Konzernen schl\u00e4gt ungewohnt viel Widerstand entgegen.</p><p>\"Man hat uns gesagt, dass Innovation immer gut ist\", wetterte der kalifornische Abgeordnete Brad Sherman bei einer Anh\u00f6rung am Mittwoch im US-Kongress. Doch dem sei nicht so. \"Die innovativste Sache in diesem Jahrhundert geschah, als Osama bin Laden die innovative Idee hatte, zwei Flugzeuge in T\u00fcrme zu steuern.\" Und die Libra, die geplante Digitalw\u00e4hrung von Facebook, k\u00f6nnte f\u00fcr Amerika sogar noch gef\u00e4hrlicher werden als bin Laden, f\u00fcgte Sherman allen Ernstes hinzu.</p><p>Es ist das erste Mal \u00fcberhaupt, dass sich der Kongress mit dem Libra-Projekt befasst, das die Art, wie wir bezahlen, revolutionieren soll. Die entsprechenden zweit\u00e4gigen Anh\u00f6rungen gerieten zu einer Generalabrechnung mitFacebook. Die Abgeordneten bombardierten den nach Washington angereisten Libra-Chef David Marcus mit Kritik. Der Konzern, der lange als amerikanisches Leuchtturmunternehmen gefeiert wurde, wirkte pl\u00f6tzlich eher wie ein Hort des B\u00f6sen.</p><p>\"Ich traue Euch Jungs nicht\", beschied die republikanische Senatorin Martha McSally Libra-Chef Marcus. \"Und ich bin nicht allein.\"</p><p>Facebook sei mit \u00fcber zwei Milliarden Nutzern \"kein Unternehmen mehr\", warnte US-Senator John Kennedy. \"Es ist ein Staat.\"</p><p>Mit Libra w\u00fcrden Facebook und seine Partner \"immense wirtschaftliche Macht aus\u00fcben, die W\u00e4hrungen und Regierungen destabilisieren k\u00f6nne\", sagte Maxine Waters, die demokratische Vorsitzende des Finanzausschusses im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus.</p><p>Marcus, 46, Anzug und Krawatte statt Hoodie, kurze graue Haare, randlose Brille, lie\u00df das parlamentarische Trommelfeuer \u00e4u\u00dferlich beherrscht \u00fcber sich ergehen. Er antwortete ausgesucht h\u00f6flich. Nur manchmal verzogen sich seine Lippen zum d\u00fcnnen Strich, und Marcus faltete die H\u00e4nde wie zum Gebet.</p><p>\"Bringing the world closer together\", die Welt enger zusammenbringen, so lautet Facebooks selbsterkl\u00e4rtes Ziel. Bei der Libra scheint das schon vor dem Start des Projekts gelungen zu sein - nur eben anders, als es sich die Techies aus dem kalifornischen Menlo Park erhofft hatten. Vereint ist die Welt vor allem im Widerstand gegen Facebook.</p><p>   Politiker, Experten und Aufsichtsbeh\u00f6rden in vielen L\u00e4ndern teilen die Sorge, dass die Privatw\u00e4hrung Risiken f\u00fcr das Finanzsystem, den Wettbewerb und die Gesellschaft bringt. Die G7-Finanzminister   haben ihre Bedenken genauso kundgetan   wie US-Notenbankchef Jerome Powell   oder Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump   .   </p><p>Im US-Kongress verbindet Demokraten und Republikaner ein wachsendes Misstrauen gegen einen Konzern, der Datenschutz vielfach ignoriert hat und gegen den die Verbraucherschutzbeh\u00f6rde FTC gerade eine Strafe von f\u00fcnf Milliarden Dollar verh\u00e4ngt hat.</p><p>Amerika durchlebt einen Fall von entt\u00e4uschter Liebe. In einer Umfrage des Meinungsinstitutes Harris zur Reputation der 100 bekanntesten Unternehmen ist Facebook von Platz 51 der Rangliste auf Platz 94 im Jahr 2019 abgest\u00fcrzt. Traditionell ist den Amerikanern Datenschutz eher gleichg\u00fcltig, aber nach einer Serie von Skandalen wird vielen doch zunehmend mulmig.</p><p>Die EU habe Regelungen beschlossen, die ihren B\u00fcrgern Kontrolle \u00fcber die eigenen Daten gebe, lobte der republikanische Senator Mike Crapo. \"Wir m\u00fcssen \u00e4hnliche Verpflichtungen etablieren.\" Es passiert nicht oft, dass US-Politiker Europa als Vorbild zitieren.</p><p>\"Facebook ist gef\u00e4hrlich\", sagte Senator Sherrod Brown aus Ohio. Das soziale Netzwerk habe den politischen Diskurs zerst\u00f6rt, den Journalismus kaputtgemacht, die russische Wahlkampfeinmischung zugelassen und dabei geholfen, einen V\u00f6lkermord auszul\u00f6sen. \"Sie zerst\u00f6ren unsere Demokratie.\"</p><p>Als Zuckerberg j\u00fcngst Nancy Pelosi kontaktierte, war die Sprecherin des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses laut einem Bericht der \"Washington Post\" f\u00fcr den ber\u00fchmten Gr\u00fcnder nicht zu sprechen - und sie rief auch nicht zur\u00fcck.</p><p>Facebook ist nicht der einzige Tech-Konzern, der in Ungnade f\u00e4llt. Vor allem die Demokraten, die im liberalen Silicon Valley lange nat\u00fcrliche Verb\u00fcndete sahen, lehnen sich inzwischen auch gegen andere Firmen auf. Selbst die Forderung von Pr\u00e4sidentschaftsbewerberin Elizabeth Warren, die Internetgiganten Amazon, Google und Facebook zu zerschlagen, wird zunehmend ernsthaft diskutiert.</p><p>Parallel zur Libra-Anh\u00f6rung besch\u00e4ftigte sich diese Woche noch ein Ausschuss mit der Macht und den Praktiken der Tech-Riesen. Der Facebook-Konzern, zu dem neben dem sozialen Netzwerk auch die Dienste Instagram, WhatsApp und Facebook Messenger geh\u00f6ren, geriet auch dort ins Visier: \"Wenn ein Konzern vier der sechs weltweit gr\u00f6\u00dften Institutionen gemessen an aktiven Nutzern besitzt, dann gibt es daf\u00fcr ein Wort\", sagte der demokratische Abgeordnete Joe Neguse. Und zwar: \"Monopol.\"</p><p>Das Marktdurchdringungsmodell von Facebook funktioniere nach der Methode \"Catch and kill\", urteilte auch sein Senatskollege Mark Warner. Immer wenn ein Herausforderer dem Riesen gef\u00e4hrlich werde, kaufe man dessen Technologie oder Idee einfach auf. Ob das auch bei Libra so laufen solle?</p><p>Libra-Topmanager Marcus blieb nur, immer wieder zu beteuern, dass man nicht starten werde, bevor alle regulatorischen Bedenken gekl\u00e4rt seien.

He took a pay cut to become the general manager of Grab (then called GrabTaxi) and found himself working thrice as hard as he did at Accenture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The change, he says, was worth it. The numbers for the ride-hailing mobile platform offering private car, taxi, bike and shuttle rides are sizzling. In June this year, the Malaysia-established app celebrated its fifth anniversary. Its services were available in 55 cities in seven South-east Asian countries. Its ride volume had more than doubled to 2.5 million rides daily from six months before, while app downloads had tripled to 45 million devices from June 2016.</p><p>Fast forward five months to the present: Grab is in 142 cities in seven South-east Asian countries - and an eighth country, Cambodia, might be added soon. Its ride volume is steadily moving towards 4 million a day. And app downloads have crossed 68 million.</p><p>\"I have to update these figures in my head every month because they keep changing,\" says Mr Lim, with a laugh.</p><p>In Oct 2015, the Malacca-born 35-year-old was made Singapore country head. Grab continues to expand quickly, introducing one new service after another to its 4million Singapore users alone. And though it's running at a loss for now, investors are queueing up to pump money into the company. In July, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and Japanese telco and Internet conglomerate SoftBank poured US$2 billion into Grab, the largest single financing in the history of the region.</p><p>You accepted a lower pay to join Grab when it was just one-year-old. Did you have a hunch it'd be so successful'</p><p>Actually, I wasn't sure. But I am a risk-taker - I love extreme sports: bungee-jumping, scuba-diving, mountain-climbing, and so on. But Grab had just gotten funding from various investors, including Vertex, a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings. So that gave me some assurance. Apart from that, I was interested in the subject of transport. It's something that everyone has issues with. My last three years at Accenture was spent in Jakarta. And I knew how bad traffic and transport woes affect everyone.</p><p>Tell us about the early days of Grab.</p><p>I think at that time, they were looking for someone who was crazy enough to take up the challenge. They wanted someone who could roll up his sleeves and get things done. I remember I was camping out at the airport, at a little coffee-shop where taxi drivers hung out. And I would pitch the Grab app to them and begged them to try it out. I would jump into taxis when they were queueing at the airport and try to get them to sign up. I spoke to hundreds of drivers. I gave them my mobile number and they'd call me at 3am if they couldn't get the app to work. We had only 10 people then. Now, in Singapore alone, we have more than 1,000 working in various capacities. And we have a call centre to handle the calls.</p><p>Grab has been quick to leap over various regulation hurdles. When the government ruled that private hire cars are not exempted from child seat requirements, you responded within a month with the introduction of GrabFamily, vehicles specifically for families with young children. When you were given three months to get all your drivers licensed, you got that done too.</p><p>We're doing things that no one has done before. There's a lot of uncharted territory. So we've learnt to respond quickly to challenges. When I was in Accenture and working on a project in Jakarta, that took us a year. Now I have to turn around a campaign in a matter of days or weeks. In fact, we're rolling new things every two or three months. We're now the only one to offer taxi, private car, minivan and bus services.</p><p>Are you redesigning the app too'</p><p>We're going to have to redesign the app because there's just so many services on it. We've also realised that even though we started out as taxi app, there's so much we can do with our platform. We had introduced GrabPay to make transactions for passengers seamless. But now GrabPay has become a widely-used cashless platform. So the next logical step is to see how we can expand GrabPay for all kinds of transactions outside of the Grab platform, such as shopping and dining. And we're not just partnering the big malls like those of CapitaLand. We're also getting the small merchants who traditionally don't deal with cashless transactions to try GrabPay.</p><p>You going back to the ground to teach the uncles and aunties one by one.</p><p>That's right. We're teaching them that just because they don't see the actual cash, it doesn't mean it isn't there. We're beginning with the small shop owners in Telok Ayer, and we'll spread to the rest of the island. We started out by wanting to make Grab the first app you go to for all your transport needs. Now we want to become all your payment needs.</p><p>Are you gunning for global domination'</p><p>Not global. Just regional. There are 750 million people in South-east Asia. And we've hit 68 million downloads. There's still a big gap there.</p><p>But your ambitions look similar to that of huge tech companies in China and the US.</p><p>We take a lot of inspiration from China. In fact, there's a similar company in China called Didi Chuxing, which is the largest ride-hailing firm in the world - they're also one of our investors. I met the CEO recently and he felt that Grab has a bigger challenge because in South-east Asia, there hasn't been any big tech companies that have come up. In China, you have Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (or BAT), the three giants that have paved the way for other Chinese tech companies. And we are kind of doing that for South-east Asia in terms of attracting talents, building a platform that can scale regionally, and serving a huge population. Hopefully we can be the BAT of South-east Asia and pave the way for other tech companies here.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Kell Jay Lim</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-181532</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R1N-JMN1-DYX4-02B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"971\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 25, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001ZX8</classCode><className>ACCENTURE PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ACN (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

Indeed, all four Big Tech head honchos (the others being Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Sundar Pichai). Bezos has testified on Capitol Hill before, so that alone is worth the price of admission. It starts around noon and we'll be carrying it live on CNBC.     The moment is akin to when the Big Banks were hauled before Congress after the financial crisis; parallels are even being drawn to the tobacco industry's comeuppance in the 1990s. Except, as Stratechery's Ben Thompson points out , there hasn't been a crisis (although the speech and bias issues are moving in that direction, and privacy remains a top concern), and these companies are still wildly popular. Amazon had a 91% favorability rating as of December, per The Verge ; Google's was 90%, Apple's 81%, and Facebook's 71%.     Let's go back to the speech, bias, and privacy issues, which will likely play a big role in today's questions from the House antitrust subcommittee. If this is an hearing, Thompson argues, then the hearing should primarily focus on competition and whether there is enough of it so that users have a real choice in the market. The problem is that the remedy for not enough competition is competition, and increased regulation usually has the  effect on industries.    \"Effective tech regulation requires new laws,\" Thompson writes, as opposed to fines or other traditional antitrust remedies, which is why he says Congress ought to be at the forefront of the government response here, as opposed to states or agencies like the FTC. To that end, I'll be listening closely for hints of what those new laws might look like.     Apple and Google, to Thompson, have \"much more significant antitrust issues\" than Amazon and Facebook. (Hence why Cook has often been quick to point figures at the other companies' practices.) Apple's issues primarily relate to its App Store fees and restricted competition on the iPhone; Google's range from its search results to its ad exchanges; Amazon has supplier and cloud questions to contend with, and Facebook will have to answer to its Instagram acquisition and plans with messaging and Shops.     There's a deeper issue at stake here, too. As Andy Kessler wrote , \"Listen closely and you may hear rumblings of the antitrust 'theory of competitive harm.'\" Sounds normal in an antitrust hearing, no? But in fact, the theory of harm, if it gains significant traction vis-a-vis Big Tech, would supplant the traditional need to demonstrate harm in order to justify government intervention. And it could open the door to using antitrust law more generally, to address social issues like inequality.     Quick example from my own life yesterday. We had to very quickly clear out some old dining room furniture, with nowhere to put it except on the front porch. Not ideal! I needed to get rid of it I put the table up on our local Facebook \"Buy Nothing\" page, and the cabinet I listed on our local Facebook \"Yard Sale\" group. Both were snapped up within thirty minutes. The table was gone before dark, and the cabinet is being picked up today. Meanwhile, my Craigslist posting for the cabinet--same photos, same price--languished for hours without a single response.     So what's the takeaway? Facebook is the new Craigslist, and, if they allowed auctions, I'd argue it would quickly become the new eBay. Bad for competitors (i.e., \"competitive harm\"), but great for us consumers--i.e., no consumer harm. No wonder Facebook has such high favorability ratings in spite of all its controversies. Should their commerce activity be restricted to force people back on other platforms? That's the trillion-dollar question.     You probably won't see me at 1 p.m., but we'll pop on at 2 p.m. with--oh yes--the Fed decision and market reaction. See you soon!    Kelly    P.S. The Exchange is now a podcast!

Kelly Loeffler accepted thousands of dollars from Google donors despite saying she wouldn't take Big Tech money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Loeffler, the front-runner in Georgia's U.S. Senate special election, received just under $10,000 from Google's NetPAC and some of the tech company's current and former key federal lobbyists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NetPAC, a federal political action committee founded in 2006 for Google staff to pool their personal resources for candidates and organizations that share the company's \"common values,\" gave $5,000 to Loeffler last December.</p><p>Nick Pearson, Google's senior manager of government affairs, donated $2,000 to Loeffler last winter. Lee Dunn also contributed $2,800 in March. Dunn was Google's long-term head of outreach, but she gave to the senator when she was the company's director of cloud policy.</p><p>Loeffler's Google-linked donations are legal and a pittance compared to the monster $17.6 million she raised by June 30 for her multiparty, free-for-all election to stay in the Senate. Her closest fundraising competitor, Democratic Ebenezer Baptist Church senior pastor Raphael Warnock, brought in $4.3 million during the same time period. </p><p>Yet the contributions are jarring compared with Loeffler's rhetoric on Big Tech.</p><p>Like many members of her party, Loeffler, a former CEO of Bakkt, which offers a federally regulated Bitcoin market, touted how she's fought \"to stop tech monopolies from silencing conservatives\" in ads. She's criticized her opponents, too, for adopting a \"dangerous\" stance by \"taking the side of Big Tech\" on the campaign trail.</p><p>But Loeffler hasn't just been talk. She introduced the Stopping Big Tech Censorship Act in June, which would lift the liability shield protecting companies that restrict constitutionally protected speech. She co-sponsored Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley's Limiting Section 230 Immunity to Good Samaritans Act as well. That bill would allow people in the United States to sue firms that censor political speech in bad faith.</p><p>\"I will never be silenced by the swamp and the fake news that want to attack conservative speech,\" she told voters last month. \"I don't take money from Big Tech. I speak out against it.\"</p><p>Loeffler isn't the only lawmaker tech companies have invested in. Rep. Doug Collins, the ex-top House Judiciary Republican, has accepted more than $222,000 from similar company PACs and employees since 2011, though he hasn't taken a specific anti-Big Tech pledge. He's simply promised not to be beholden to the industry.</p><p>A spokesman for Loeffler seized on Collins's record when asked about Loeffler's.</p><p>\"While Kelly Loeffler has been the leading voice in the U.S. Senate to hold Big Tech accountable, Doug Collins has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from Big Tech and slow-walked investigations into their silencing of conservative voices,\" he told the Washington Examiner. \"Doug Collins is Big Tech's puppet, and it's exactly what you would expect from a lobbyist-loving career politician.\"</p><p>Loeffler was appointed to the Senate in January by GOP Gov. Brian Kemp after then-Sen. Johnny Isakson announced his departure from the seat two years before his term was up due to health concerns. She has an average lead of 4.3 percentage points in her 21-person field, according to election prognosticator RealClearPolitics. </p><p>If no candidate receives a majority of the vote on Nov. 3, the first- and second-place finishers will contest a Jan. 5 runoff. Collins routinely trails Loeffler in polls while remaining ahead of his Democratic rivals.</p><p>Photo Caption:Sen.

Voters are meant to understand that if a government takes action to allow business to flourish, jobs will automatically flow. Everyone will benefit!</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That implied calculus was tightly woven into Jason Kenney's victory speech in Alberta this week and is the subtext for so much of the bread-and-butter rhetoric from leaders across the land.</p><p>But it's a calculus that's increasingly dubious, and it risks falling apart under pressure from two unstoppable forces: automation and climate change.</p><p>\"Albertans have elected a government that will be obsessed with getting this province back to work,\" Kenney told his supporters Tuesday night.</p><p>He went on to describe the flight of capital from Alberta's oilpatch and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs along with it.</p><p>\"Today, with this election, we begin to stand up for ourselves, for our jobs and for our future.\"</p><p>Well, good luck with that.</p><p>There's no doubt Alberta's economy is limping. Unemployment is abnormally high, oil and gas activity is lacklustre, wages are flat and the flood of workers flying in from across the country has generally dried up.</p><p>The oil and gas sector employed 226,500 people in 2014. But by 2018, employment had dropped to 185,800, according to analysts at PetroLMI, relied upon by labour and industry alike to have a good read on the energy job market. This year, they see the disappearance of a further 12,500 jobs - a drop of seven per cent - to just 173,300 jobs.</p><p>BMO Capital Markets is projecting an almost-invisible 0.2 per cent increase in employment in Alberta this year - the lowest in Canada and far below the national average of 1.6 per cent.</p><p>The challenge comes in the solutions.</p><p>According to Kenney, if they build a pipeline, the jobs will come. Alberta will get a fair price for its oil, investment and entrepreneurialism will thrive, and the good old days will be back.</p><p>But like in any downturn, companies look for more efficient ways to get ahead. There is almost no chance that companies will ever do business the way they used to - even if oil and gas prices are high, the pipeline is up and running, and investment comes back.</p><p>The worker-heavy construction phase of developing the oilsands is largely over. Instead, companies are looking for ways to cut costs and compete internationally, often by adopting new technology.</p><p>The dry words of PetroLMI lay it out: \"Over the next three to five years, artificial intelligence and machine learning technology will likely be applied to data analytics to replace specific industry knowledge possessed by individuals in sophisticated occupations. Rather than aiding in decision-making, increasingly machines will make their own decisions based on a huge number of data points.\"</p><p>Suncor replacing truck drivers with autonomous vehicles is only a sign of things to come. Big Oil is partnering with Big Tech, and while there may well be profits in the offing, the labour force will require a major adjustment.</p><p>At the same time, climate change is breathing down the neck of the industry. Investors and financiers need to protect their balance sheets, forced by shareholders, regulators and a realization that a low-carbon economy is at hand.</p><p>What happens to the workforce? Again, from PetroLMI: \"Efforts to make Canada's oil and gas industry more environmentally sustainable and socially responsible, while remaining globally competitive, are changing skills and occupations across all of its subsectors.\"</p><p>All of this doesn't mean there won't be new jobs. There will be fewer people and different people than in the past. Some analysts have pegged the risk of jobs replaced by automation as high as 60 per cent across Canada. But perhaps the oil and gas workforce won't be as hard hit as others.</p><p>At the Conference Board of Canada, analyst Sabrina Bond looked in detail at the effect of three key technologies being adopted by the natural resource sector - drones, autonomous vehicles and the so-called internet of things (computing devices embedded into everyday items).</p><p>She found that for natural resources as a whole, including energy, mining and forestry, the workforce would shrink by about 12.8 per cent, or 119,300, by 2040.</p><p>For the energy sector specifically, the losses were less. The three technologies would lead to a net job loss of less than five per cent, because the energy industry has a heavier reliance on shipping and infrastructure than elsewhere.</p><p>Regardless, it's a conundrum that is not confined to energy or Alberta.</p><p>GM is planning on adding several hundred high-tech jobs at its innovation centre for electric and autonomous vehicles in Markham, Ont. That's cold comfort for the 2,500 factory workers facing job loss as their plant closes just down the road in Oshawa.</p><p>Twitter: @hscoffield</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019041954131417</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VXG-2SN1-JBTY-W01R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Oil &amp;

The treasury still has to issue new guidelines on how the tax will be implemented. But it appears that potential targets include online taxi-hailing platforms. If experiences elsewhere are anything to go by, Kenya s move to tax online commerce could put it on a collision path with Western governments and multinationals. One of the market leaders   Uber   has already warned the government that such a move could result in trade wars and retaliatory tax actions by the US.<br/><br/>Taking on giants<br/><br/>Like France and India before it, Kenya is trying to get its cut of every digital transaction within its territory. The argument is that it is only fair to tap into the revenue accrued from the digital economy taking place within their territory. Companies registered elsewhere and operating in their territory earn income from the same but do not pay taxes, the argument goes.<br/><br/>But this is easier said than done. In 2016 India imposed digital taxes on technology companies involved in digital advertising. In 2018 the country introduced a provision requiring companies to pay tax on domestic income accrued from a digital platform. The provision requires non-resident big tech companies to pay direct taxes on domestically earned income.<br/><br/>In retaliation, the US conducted an inquiry and capped the number of Indian foreign workers. The move was detrimental to India.<br/><br/>Earlier this year France imposed a digital tax on big tech multinational companies. It required them to pay a 3% tax on total annual revenue generated . This sparked a trade war with the US which saw this as double taxation of its companies and their partners. But two months later, the two countries agreed on a compromise. France said it would tax big tech companies but scrap the tax as soon as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development comes up with a way to properly tax tech companies. And it agreed to refund any over-payments that might occur in the meantime.<br/><br/>OECD s proposed model<br/><br/>The OECD is an intergovernmental economic organisation, founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. Countries use its model convention on taxation as a template for allocating taxation rights between them. <br/><br/>The model allocates the primary right to tax to the country from which capital originates (the home, or resident country) rather than the country in which the investment is made (the host, or source country). <br/><br/>Challenges arise when two or more countries claim rights to tax a party   what s known as double taxation. The OECD has tried to get states to agree on a harmonised form of tax and processes in the case of cross border transactions. Its convention addresses double taxation   but not conclusively. And when e-commerce took root, new challenges arose, including jurisdiction issues, conflict of laws among nations and double taxation. <br/><br/>On top of this, easy loopholes developed that helped in tax evasion especially by companies dealing with intangible goods and services.<br/><br/>The OECD agreement proposed the concept of significant economic presence. This states that a non-resident is liable to tax in the country of sales even if the taxpayer has no fixed place of business within the geographic boundary of the country of sales. <br/><br/>In the case of the European Union tax kicks in if:<br/><br/><br/>- The non-resident exceeds  7 million in annual revenues from digital services in a European Union member state, and<br/>- it has more than 100,000 users who access its digital services in a member state in a tax year, or<br/>- it enters into more than 3,000 business contracts for digital services in a member state in a tax year.<br/><br/><br/>The other proposal is described as an  interim  3% digital services tax on gross revenues derived from activities in which users are deemed to play a major role in value creation.<br/><br/>Jurisdiction challenges<br/><br/>The United States exercises personal and territorial jurisdiction which can be termed as the legal power and authority by a state to impose a tax. <br/>The US relies on the OECD model law requirements to exercise jurisdiction on a tax subject that has physical offices within a region. If the company is not incorporated   or has no physical office   the government gains territorial jurisdiction by establishing substantial minimum contracts with the state. Minimum contacts include systematic and continuous action within the state. Such action results in a large volume of interstate business, in the course of which subject received benefits and protection of the laws of the state.<br/><br/>India s rules on jurisdiction are similar. It claims to acquire authority over a subject through territorial and personal jurisdiction. It introduced a digital tax known as an equalisation levy in 2016. This imposed a levy on any business to business transactions, including the digital advertising transactions famously known as the Google tax.<br/><br/>It has also introduced another digital tax similar to the OECD proposed model. And it has released guidelines on what constitutes a significant economic presence similar to the OECD s proposals. It used this law to sue Uber for failure to comply with the taxation law.<br/><br/>Kenya might trigger a trade war with the US if it goes ahead and imposes a digital tax. But it would be complying with the international guidelines proposed by the OECD. <br/><br/>In my view it should come up with guidelines that bring about clarity on exactly who and what is been targeted.<br/><br/>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

With effect from 7 November 2019, goods and services supplied in the digital marketplace will now be subject to income and VAT tax.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The taxes hardly come as a surprise to Kenyans as the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) made a clear declaration in the 2018 KRA Annual Summit of its intention to broaden its tax base by introducing taxes on the emerging digital economy. Even before then, there were signals of future tax changes, with the VAT Act, 2013 envisaging VAT on downloaded electronic services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All this comes after the large-scale technological and digital developments Kenya has experienced in the past two decades, ranking third among African countries with the highest Bitcoin usage in 2019 and with a population that has a remarkably high appetite for online betting, borrowing and purchases.</p><p>The ins and outs of the new taxes</p><p>Section 4 of the Finance Act amends the Income Tax Act to include 'income accruing through a digital marketplace' as taxable income. Likewise, section 18 of the Act expands the VAT Act to be 'applicable to supplies made through a digital marketplace'.</p><p>The Act broadly defines a digital marketplace as 'a platform that enables the direct interaction between buyers and sellers of goods and services through electronic means.' This broad catch-all provision seeks to ensure that entities generating income through a digital platform are captured. The most obvious targets of the provision are expected to be e-hailing platforms and online selling marketplaces such as Uber and Jumia.</p><p>How the new provisions will be implemented</p><p>While the Act indicates that the measure to tax income from digital transactions entered into force on 7 November 2019, it also states that the Cabinet Secretary of National Treasury and Planning shall make regulations to provide for the mechanisms of implementation. There is no clear timeline as to when these regulations shall be published, posing a practical challenge to implementation of the provisions. This means that enforcement of this tax will be delayed.</p><p>It would be beneficial to stakeholders in the digital and technological sector if the regulations were to clearly set out:</p><p> the specific income that is subject to the tax provisions;the applicable rates of tax to be applied (particularly in the case of non-resident persons without a permanent establishment in Kenya); andthe party responsible for accounting for the taxes.</p><p>As of February 2020, it remains unclear whether these taxes are operational, given the absence of clear guidelines on how these would operate.</p><p>Across the border</p><p>Taxation of the digital economy is not a novel concept in the world, with countries such as India and France jumping on the bandwagon in recent times. Globally, the introduction of digital taxes is fast becoming infamous for setting off retaliatory trade wars between countries.</p><p>In 2016, India imposed digital taxes (commonly dubbed the 'Google Tax') on tech companies involved in digital advertising. The tax seemed to target Over-the-Top (OTT) service providers such as Google, Twitter and Facebook. In 2018, the country went further, introducing a provision requiring companies to pay tax on domestic income accrued from a digital platform. The implication of this provision is that non-resident big tech companies would now be required to pay direct taxes on income generated in India. In retaliation, the USA introduced immigration restrictions that adversely affect Indians resident in the USA.</p><p>Similarly, the French government last year proposed a digital tax where tech companies would be mandated to pay a 3% tax 'on the gross revenues derived from digital activities of which French \"users\" are deemed to play a major role in value creation'. The laws also introduced a threshold for annual revenue generated (EUR 750 million for taxable digital services supplied worldwide and EUR 25 million for taxable digital services supplied in France). These thresholds were seen as a move to capture big tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p>As expected, the proposed tax sparked threats of retaliatory tariffs on imported wines and cheeses from France in the USA. At the moment, the rivalry between France and the USA has seemingly been quelled through a quasi ceasefire agreement to suspend the digital tax in exchange for a postponement of the threatened retaliatory tariffs until the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) provides a harmonised position on digital taxes. The OECD is best placed to ensure that there is uniformity of digital taxes around the world, as it has done for other taxes in the past - VAT being one such example.</p><p>These trade wars have in the past caused global stock markets to stumble. A similar crippling effect to the digital economy is imminent if the two superpowers cannot find common ground on the subject of digital tax.</p><p>What is the OECD's take on digital taxes?</p><p>The OECD is an intergovernmental economic organisation mandated to foster world trade and economic progress. In the past few years, the OECD has been working on a model for taxation of the digital economy, set to be part of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). Primarily, the model proposes to allocate the primary right to tax to the country from which the digital revenue generates (where the transaction takes place) rather than the country in which the investment is made (where the platform is hosted).</p><p>Under BEPS, the first pillar is intended to focus on profit allocation rules among states, including necessary modifications to traditional transfer-pricing rules, nexus rules and the arm's length principle, to take into account the changes that digitisation has introduced to the world economy.</p><p>BEPS is also set to examine concepts of marketing intangibles, user contribution and significant economic presence, and how they can be used to address the resultant tax challenges of the digital economy.</p><p>Anticipated effects of the tax in Kenya</p><p>The new amendments introduced by the Act have been negatively received by digital platform operators and consumers in Kenya. The move has been viewed as tantamount to double taxation for digital platform operators and burdensome to consumers, particularly where VAT on supplies is concerned.</p><p>This is because without clear guidelines on how this tax will be applied, ascertaining who bears the cost of this new tax is largely speculative. In the event that the VAT provision intends to place incidence on the consumer, the new tax may inevitably end up stifling innovation by taking away the very incentive for digital marketplaces - which have for a long time, been regarded as a more cost-efficient means of conducting business compared with traditional brick and mortar businesses.</p><p>This particular point was raised during the public participation in the Finance Bill, where it was pointed out that a huge portion of the Kenyan youth population, because of lack of jobs and capital, have turned to innovation in the digital space to reduce operational costs of doing business. Members of the public were therefore concerned that this move would encourage flight from the sector and hamper growth of start-ups and small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs).</p><p>What is more worrying is that national digital taxes (without a corresponding international tax regime) could endanger cross-border trade and investment. This is because any investor attempting to do business across borders would face the risk of being taxed repeatedly on the same portion of income.</p><p>Carefully thought-out international tax agreements may be the key to minimising the risk of endangering cross-border trade. A huge challenge for the drafters of such agreements, however, is that digital creatures lack defined territorial boundaries and are always evolving faster than the law. This is the challenge that plagues any attempt to regulate cyberspace.</p><p>What next for Kenya?</p><p>The regulations for the new tax provisions will be key in understanding how the tax will be imposed on digital marketplaces in Kenya, its operational workings and its effect. Our view is that these regulations should align with the broader government policy on the digital economy, international best practice and data protection laws to ensure a smooth implementation.</p><p>Perhaps it would be prudent for industry players to lobby to ensure that a favourable environment for innovation is central to the efforts of the National Treasury in formulating these regulations, so that Kenya does not lose its position as an innovation and tech hub in Africa.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

STIROH, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*] STIROH: Good morning and welcome to the GARP Global Risk Forum. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been collaborating with GARP on this forum for a decade and it is always a pleasure to participate. This discussion provides real-time insight into critical issues at the center of the practice of risk management.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A quick scan of today's agenda highlights a number of topics of obvious importance-operational resilience, cyclical aspects of risk management, technology and big data. We are all thinking about these issues, and I look forward to your insights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'd like to briefly discuss two topics where I expect risk managers will increase their focus in coming years-climate change and the cultural aspects of digital transformation. Both issues reflect potentially transformative trends for the economy and the financial system, and I believe they will take an increasing share of your bandwidth over the next decade. In both cases, the relevant questions from a supervisors' perspective are: what new risks are introduced? How do firms manage them? And how do supervisors view them?</p><p>Before proceeding, I will emphasize that I am speaking for myself and these views do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.</p><p>Climate</p><p>The U.S. economy has experienced more than $500 billion in direct losses over the last five years due to climate and weather-related events. In addition, climate change has significant consequences for the U.S. economy and financial sector through slowing productivity growth, asset revaluations and sectoral reallocations of business activity.</p><p>For these climate-related risks, a new lexicon has emerged. Physical risk is the potential for losses as climate-related changes disrupt business operations, destroy capital and interrupt economic activity. Transition risk is the potential for losses resulting from a shift toward a lower-carbon economy as policy, consumer sentiment and technological innovations impact the value of certain assets and liabilities. These effects will be felt across business sectors and asset classes, and on the strategies, operations and balance sheets of financial firms.</p><p>Risk managers must be aware of these risks and develop the tools needed to identify, monitor and manage them appropriately. Physical and transition risks may manifest through traditional risk stripes such as credit, market, operational, legal and reputational risk, but today's tools are not necessarily well-suited for the unique challenges associated with climate change. Let me mention three of these challenges.</p><p>First, climate change is a long-term issue where actions today are likely to have an impact over many decades. This exceeds the typical life span of a bank exposure, as well as the typical control and planning horizon of a financial institution. Risk management tools, models and scenarios are not designed to capture the long-term nature of climate-related risks. Nonetheless, real impacts are already being felt and we must develop the tools to assess and manage them.</p><p>Second, climate change is complex-the impacts are uncertain, non-linear and hard-to-predict. Trusted credit models, for example, may prove less useful if the historical patterns of the frequency and severity of weather-related shocks become a poor guide to the distribution of future losses. Asset prices may move sharply, and unpredictably, as consensus views change and future impacts are priced today. Moreover, transition risks may stem from second-order, indirect effects like the impact on supply chains, sectoral shifts or worker productivity, which are inherently difficult to model and predict.</p><p>Third, we face significant data gaps. Climate change is a global phenomenon, but risks should be assessed locally, which requires new data such as asset-specific, geo-spatial data. Borrower-specific analysis requires data, for example, on asset utilization and climate effects for particular industries at particular locations. Such granular data is currently limited and requires significant resources to acquire and process, but greater transparency about the physical location of assets will allow institutions to better assess exposures to at-risk borrowers or to specific geographic risks.</p><p>As supervisors, we can consider climate-related risks in terms of both microprudential and macroprudential objectives. To be clear, in my view, supervisors should take a risk management perspective, not a social engineering one. It is beyond our mandate to advocate or provide incentives for a particular transition path. Rather, supervisors should focus on the risks that emerge along the path decided by the public at large and their elected governments. Supervisors can use our tools to ensure financial institutions are prepared for and resilient to all types of relevant risks, including climate-related events.</p><p>To do this, we must continue to invest in research to better understand the economic and financial impact of climate-related events. For example, on Friday, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco will host a conference on the economics of climate change. We can also continue to follow closely and learn from the approaches taken by other central banks, including the use of scenario analysis, stress testing and supervisory expectations to encourage institutions to factor climate risk into their risk management practices. Finally, we can seek to strengthen the data and modeling capabilities we need to assess climate-related risks as part of our forward-looking, data-driven supervision.</p><p>Given the far-reaching impact of climate risk on the structure of the economy and the financial sector, I am confident that risk managers will respond appropriately and firms will continue to build resilience to all risks. GARP, for example, is exploring this and has recently surveyed its members to better understand professional needs for \"sustainability, climate risk, and ESG integration.\" I am interested to hear from all of you about how your institutions are developing tools and practices to integrate climate risk into your risk management frameworks.</p><p>Innovation and Culture</p><p>It is no surprise to this audience that technological innovation, big data, and advanced analytics are transforming financial services. We can debate where we are on the maturity curve and what innovations are most likely to be transformative, but the direction of travel seems clear. I expect the afternoon session on \"Technology, Big Data, and the Practice of Risk Management\" will address core issues such as new approaches for model risk management in a world of widespread artificial intelligence; the inherent challenge of \"explainability\" and potential bias in algorithms; the strategic risks from new entrants; and the impact on human capital strategies.</p><p>I want to highlight a complementary, but different issue and focus on how firms manage these changes. More broadly, what type of corporate culture is needed to support a successful digital transformation?</p><p>Over the past five years, the New York Fed has emphasized the importance of a healthy culture to reduce misconduct risk. In addition, I think there is likely a link between a firm's culture and its ability to adapt to a changing environment, whether it is technological innovation, demographic change, new business models, or climate change. Firms need a culture that allows change and is resilient to these trends.</p><p>In discussions of the impact of technology on financial services, for example, one extreme view is that new fintech entrants-either smaller start-ups or big-tech firms-will leverage technology and a customer-centric approach to disrupt the industry and outcompete stagnant incumbents, fundamentally transforming the industrial organization of financial services. An alternative, equally extreme view, is that incumbent financial firms with established customer bases, scale, vast quantities of data, and experience working in a regulated environment will \"disrupt themselves\" and maintain their central position in finance. The most likely outcome, as is typically the case, is somewhere in the middle, but change seems inevitable.</p><p>If all firms face a strategic imperative to innovate and adapt, a relevant question is what types of firm-specific factors will determine success? Clearly, things like business model, technological expertise, and resources will matter. I think that firm culture will also matter. And by culture, I mean the values and shared norms within a group that influence individual behavior, collective decision-making and outcomes.</p><p>As firms innovate and transform how financial services are provided, I expect we'll see the value of leadership from senior managers and boards as they outline the strategic case for change and exhibit the critical behaviors that promote it. I expect we'll see the value of innovative environments where employees speak up, both raising new ideas and questioning assumptions. I expect we'll see the value of cognitive diversity as firms tackle complex problems like a digital transformation from multiple perspectives. I expect we'll see the value of agility that facilitates product innovation, reprioritization, constructive partnerships, or the successful integration of financial market specialists and technologists. Finally, I expect we'll see the value of well-crafted incentives where employees are rewarded based on both \"what\" they do and \"how\" they do it.</p><p>More broadly, I think firms with high levels of \"cultural capital\" will be more likely to successfully implement a digital transformation in a sustainable, prudent and responsible manner. This is a central question for risk managers and supervisors because the evidence suggests that most large-scale transformations fail. Just like firms, investors and supervisors consider execution risk when assessing bank mergers, I expect more attention will focus on culture and the change management risks associated with innovation and digital transformation.</p><p>In my view, the official sector can facilitate this transition. The 2018 guidance on responsible innovation related to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing is a good example. Supervisors can also press on the governance and change management framework to promote effective internal oversight. From our perspective, supervisors also need to be nimble and develop the necessary skills to assess innovation as firms transform.</p><p>While a firm's culture is not directly observable, I believe this will prove to be a critical part of any change initiative. Technological progress, innovation, and new models of competition are changing the financial industry and there will undoubtedly be winners and losers. Understanding all of the factors that drive successful transformations will be a critical insight for both risk managers and supervisors.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>The financial sector is large, complex and constantly evolving due to a wide range of technological, business, and macro factors. Your job, and ours, is to be vigilant and open-minded in our thinking, constantly questioning our traditional assumptions and scanning the horizon to understand how the risk landscape is changing.</p><p>The topics covered at today's conference are some of the most important risks that the industry faces. Climate change and digital transformation are two powerful trends with the potential to fundamentally change financial services. We all need to be forward-looking and proactive in order to promote our ultimate goal of a safe and sound financial system that supports the sustainable provision of financial services and economic growth.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SECWIR-9200004888</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SECWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:51H1-8S51-F06P-24BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367741</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1987\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Data Licensing, LLC.

I\u2019m writing to you from Los Angeles, where the weather is sunny and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/technology/electric-scooters-are-causing-havoc-this-man-is-shrugging-it-off.html\">electric scooters</url> are venture backed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I spent most of the week at the Code Conference, where the tech world\u2019s elite gathered to discuss the current state of the tech industry. It was a fascinating event, less in the sense of newsy product announcements (which there weren\u2019t many of) and more in the general finger-in-the-wind sense of how the tech industry is thinking about itself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Notable at this year\u2019s Code was that there seems to be a growing rift between the largest tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 and the rest of the industry.</p><p>The shadow of the big tech companies loomed large over the conference, even if their presence was minimal. No executives from Apple, Amazon or <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>spoke at Code, and when executives from Microsoft and Facebook did take the stage, they mostly talked about the past. (Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, offered some historical perspective on the company\u2019s antitrust woes from the late 1990s; Sheryl Sandberg and Mike Schroepfer from Facebook did yet another rote recitation of the company\u2019s post-Cambridge Analytica \u201cwe\u2019ll do better\u201d script.)</p><p>Instead, much of the stage time went to leaders of companies just outside the tech A-list \u2014 large, popular companies that in any other era would be considered enormous success stories, but that have spent years locked in a fight for survival against their bigger, more entrenched rivals.</p><p>From the perspective of the tech B-list, there are two huge fights to be won. First, you need to establish a foothold in a market, either by out-innovating old-line incumbents \u2014 taxis, hotels, music labels \u2014 or by creating a new market altogether. Then, once you\u2019re established and growing, a bigger worry emerges: What if one of the Big Five squashes you?</p><p>A good example of a tech B-lister is Spotify, which appears to be winning its battle with its biggest suppliers \u2014 the three labels that provide the vast majority of Spotify\u2019s music \u2014 but lives in perpetual danger of being steamrollered by a tech giant. Onstage at Code, Spotify\u2019s chief executive, <person><nameText>Daniel Ek, </nameText></person>fielded several questions about whether he worried about competitors like Apple, Amazon and <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>all of which have their own music streaming services and, more important, control the hardware platforms (iOS, Android, Alexa) on which people consume music.</p><p>Mr. Ek mostly deflected, saying that there are \u201cvery, very few opportunities that a billion-plus people around the world care about,\u201d and that the giants\u2019 interest in music streaming showed the attractiveness of the category.</p><p>But of course he\u2019s worried. The message of the past several years is clear: No matter how big and successful you are as a consumer-facing media, communications or advertising company, you\u2019ll eventually end up in the same boat, butting up against the shore of the island where <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook have constructed their impregnable fortresses. (Side note: If you like reading about those five companies, you\u2019ll probably be glad that my colleague Farhad Manjoo, who is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/technology/techs-frightful-five-theyve-got-us.html\">writing an entire book on them</url>, is returning from book leave next week.)</p><p>Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, sounded a similar note at the conference when asked about Facebook\u2019s habit of blatantly copying Snapchat\u2019s most distinctive product features. (Mr. Spiegel\u2019s sassy comeback \u2014 \u201cWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also\u201d \u2014 was the best line there.)</p><p>But perhaps the clearest articulation of the tech B-list worldview came from Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&amp;T. Mr. Stephenson has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/technology/att-time-warner-antitrust.html\">fighting to acquire Time Warner</url> since November 2016 in an attempt to cobble together some combination of content libraries, mobile networks and advertising tech that is big enough to survive a battle with the Googles and Amazons of the world.</p><p>Asked by Recode\u2019s Peter Kafka how he thought about this battle, Mr. Stephenson (using an acronym for Facebook, Apple, Netflix and <person><nameText>Google</nameText></person>) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/5/30/17397164/att-randall-stephenson-time-warner-transcript-code-2018\">answered</url>:</p><p>It\u2019s not unusual to see small firms complaining about the difficulty of breaking into established markets. It\u2019s more unusual to see those complaints coming from the leader of a $200 billion telecom giant.

On Tuesday, he and Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) introduced a bill to require that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's final report be made public. And in a recent interview with Variety, he says he wants to look into whether the White House has tried to interfere in any Justice Department review of major transactions, including the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He says it is \"not appropriate\" for Trump to be \"weighing in on particular transactions.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cicilline also talked about an area where there is bipartisan concern - the concentration of power among tech platforms. He talks of \"modernizing\" antitrust statutes, something that has already been debated in the Senate and in a series of Federal Trade Commission hearings, particularly with the growing strength of Google and Facebook in the marketplace. The FTC also announced the formation of a task force to monitor big tech.</p><p>\"People are really concerned about the tremendous concentration of economic power by chiefly the two largest technology platforms that really act as the gatekeeper into commerce, the gatekeeper into trustworthy, reliable news and information,\" Cicilline said. \"There aren't easy answers to this, but we have to recognize the challenge, take it on in a serious way, and be able to work together in a bipartisan way.\"</p><p>He also plans to reintroduce legislation meant to give news publishers more power as they negotiate with Google and Facebook. The ability of those platforms to dominate the local advertising landscape, he said, has contributed to the demise of local journalism. Cicilline is the former mayor of Providence, R.I., and even earned a Screen Actors Guild card for playing himself on the TV series \"Providence.\"</p><p>The antitrust subcommittee has oversight over regulatory agencies, but not authority to greenlight or reject major transactions. Still, it's likely that the committee will hold hearings on major mergers, including the proposed T-Mobile-Sprint transaction. See more from\u00a0Variety's interview with Cicilline below.</p><p>Do you see any kind of a shift in how lawmakers are talking about consolidation and concentration? Now we see Republicans talking about it, especially when it comes to tech platforms.I think there is growing recognition on the part of Democrats and Republicans that this is a very serious issue. People across the country are expressing their concerns to their member of Congress. And it ought to be bipartisan. I have had a number of Republican colleagues approach me about expressing a willingness to work with me on these issues.</p><p>President Trump has said publicly that the administration is looking into potential antitrust problems with Amazon, Google, and Facebook.Sadly, when the President speaks about it, it very often has to do with the identity of the owner of a company, or his perception that a platform has been unfavorable to him. It's never any intellectual understanding of antitrust and competition policy. ... The Department of Justice has almost quasi judicial responsibilities to do enforcement and antitrust, to bring enforcement actions or to approve or disapprove certain transactions. And it ought never be influenced by the President's view one way or the other, so it is just not appropriate for the president to do that.</p><p>How do you think the Justice Department handled the AT&amp;T-Time Warner transaction?The thing that I was particularly concerned about, regardless of the decision, was some reporting about some contacts between officials in the White House and the regulators... We really need to protect the integrity of the antitrust process and the enforcement process. We need to make sure that judgments are being made based on evidence and free from political interference by the White House, the President or anyone his staff. [Makan Delrahim, the chief of the Antitrust Division, said in a sworn affidavit that Trump's views did not play \"any role in my consideration of the transaction and any suggestions to the contrary are false.\"]</p><p>Will you try to get records from the Justice Department of their review of the transaction?I am interested to learn and assure myself and other members of the committee that there is no political interference in any of these mergers or any Department of Justice reviews of these transactions. The questions weren't completely answered. We didn't do oversight in the last Congress because Republicans really didn't let us, so we will have an opportunity to do some oversight as well.</p><p>So would that include going back to the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger?Yes. It's not time limited.</p><p>One proposal for updating antitrust statutes has been to establish a review of the impact of mergers that have already been approved.Determinations are made about a particular merger, and I think they are good faith judgments most of the time, and they are predictions about what is likely to happen. But then there is not really an opportunity to go back and, a year from the transaction, see what has actually happened in the marketplace, and were the projections that were made, correct. ... I do think having that kind of review makes sense. ... It creates some uncertainty in the market, so you have to be careful about it, but I do think that these are big transactions that don't often have a look again once the transaction is approved, and may not have worked out the way everyone expected them to. One perfect example of that is the Facebook acquisition of What's App and Instagram, and I think there is a real question as to whether that should have been permitted, and having some opportunity to look back on transactions.</p><p>Would that include the Comcast-NBCUniversal merger? There were some calls to look at that again after the expiration of the conditions that were placed on the transaction.I think all of these very large transactions that are resulting in tremendous concentrations in the marketplace need to be looked at in a very serious way. We need our antitrust enforcers to be very vigilant in protecting competition, and we need to be sure that Congress is giving them tools both statutorily and in the resources they need to do their work. We are seeing the greatest concentration of economic power in our lifetimes, and with that comes very often a tremendous concentration of political power. And that sometimes makes change more difficult. But this is an economy that is not working for lots and lots of people in this country. And when you look at income inequality in this country, and you see wealth gains at the very top and you see that wages have basically remained stagnant, that is not by accident. That is a direct result of policies and regulations, and tax policies and other policies, that were put into place and are resulting in this enormous concentration of economic power, and Congress has a responsibility to do something about it.</p><p>What do you think of the way the DOJ under Makan Delrahim has pursued antitrust policy? One of his priorities is to avoid approving transactions that include behavioral conditions, and instead require structural changes to a transaction.I look forward to having a very close working relationship with him. I think he has said and done a number of things that gives me confidence that he takes this seriously, and I think Congress has a responsibility to be a good partner, to be promoting pro-competition policies, and to make sure that we have an existing legislative architecture that makes the work of the Antitrust Division successful. In general, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has not been particularly strong for a long time. I think Congress hasn't done a lot to promote that and insist on it. I do think there is kind of a reawakening in the Congress, and a deeper understanding that one of the reasons the economy is not working is because of this tremendous concentration of economic power. This Congress is going to be an opportunity to really take a fresh look at our antitrust statutes, to really raise these issues in a serious way for the first time in a very long time, and then use that as an opportunity to modernize the statutes, to make sure that the agencies have the resources that they need.</p><p>You have also proposed newspaper competition legislation, which would allow publishers to ...Collude. Which seems kind of funny coming from a person who prides himself on being against economic collusion. This is an area that has particularly serious consequences for our democracy, and that is that the two large technology platforms are sort of taking all the revenue our online news publishers and newspapers, and literally putting newspapers out of business. And as a result of their huge power in the marketplace, they essentially dictate the terms to small news outlets and publishers. News outlets like the Providence Journal, they don't have the ability to negotiate with Google and Facebook. So they have to accept whatever terms they given them. And as a result of that, we have a system where a huge percentage of revenues are going to those two online platforms, and we are seeing significant decreases in ad revenue for newspapers. What my legislation will do, and I intend to reintroduce this, is it will allow those small publishers to come together for the purposes of negotiating with those large technology platforms. Not on price, just on attribution, placement, a series of other issues that relate to protecting the ability of these producers of the content to be able to negotiate and have some bargaining power for a limited period of time. ... If we don't, we are going to continue to lose reliable trustworthy local news sources. So this is about more than the production of widgets; this is about our access to news and information to make informed decisions in a democracy.</p><p>What concerns do you have about the proposed T-Mobile-Sprint merger? [A subcommittee hearing was delayed earlier this month and will be rescheduled.]I have concerns about the impact of this transaction on consumer choice, on innovation, on price, on jobs, on wages, so you know all of those things that you worry about when big transactions happen that can result in increased prices for consumers, loss of jobs, less innovation, less competition.</p><p>Do you envision having more hearings on specific transactions?Well, this is a big pending transaction, but what I expect the antitrust subcommittee to do is begin with a real review of the antitrust statutory architecture. Most of our statutes were written almost 100 years ago during the railroad monopolies. The first question is, \"Are they written in a way that is effective for what they are trying to accomplish in a 21st century economy, with a very different economy, with very different industries that are seeing tremendous concentrations of economic power?\" So kind of modernizing the antitrust statutes, looking at a kind of top to bottom review. \"Are they working?\"</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/michael-cohen-accuse-president-donald-trump-lying-criminal-conduct-1203149676/\">Michael Cohen to Accuse Trump of Lying and Potentially Criminal Conduct (Report)</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/music/news/clean-bandit-trump-mama-music-video-1203148747/\">Clean Bandit Portrays a Trump Meltdown in 'Mama' Video</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/donald-trump-takes-aim-at-spike-lee-over-oscars-speech-1203148398/\">President Trump Takes Aim at Spike Lee Over Oscars Speech</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VARETY-1203149010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VARTY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHF-V6R1-JC3V-64B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Variety</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26328\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Here are some thoughts on the numbers shared by other notable tech names during what has been a pretty strong earnings season to date.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis><br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The software giant's  suggest the enterprise/cloud-focused transformation strategy pushed by CEO Satya Nadella continues paying off. But <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft's  \u00a0</emphasis>fiscal second quarter\u00a0beat had a lot to do with its Windows and Office cash cows.</p><p>A stabilizing PC market helped Windows OEM revenue (comes from PC makers) and Windows commercial and cloud services revenue (comes mostly from businesses) each rose 5% annually last quarter, an improvement from the flat growth each business posted in the fiscal first quarter.</p><p>And the transition from traditional Office license sales to Office 365 subscriptions has once more made Office a growth business, particularly on the consumer side. Office consumer revenue rose 22% annually, with 365 subs growing by another 900,000 sequentially to 24.9 million. Office commercial revenue grew 5%, with 365 commercial seats rising 37% annually. Google is stepping up its efforts to win over enterprises with its G Suite (formerly Google Apps), but its impact on Microsoft remains limited for now.</p><p>Elsewhere, Azure revenue grew 93% -- a slowdown from the 116% growth seen in the first quarter, but still outpacing most cloud infrastructure rivals. That helped total server products and cloud services revenue grow 12% -- Oracle, IBM and many other enterprise software rivals can only wish they were seeing similar growth.</p><p>Some weak spots: Enterprise Services revenue (hurt by cloud adoption) fell 4%, and gaming revenue (hurt by the Xbox One's age and Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro launch) fell 3%. Surface revenue fell 2%, but it's worth keeping in mind Microsoft refreshed its Surface tablet line in late 2015. Growth should pick up in a couple of months if rumors of a March <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/surface-pro-5-release-date-news-and-rumors-1316294\">Surface Pro 5 launch</url> prove accurate. Phone revenue fell 81%, but with Microsoft unloading its feature phone business and Windows Phone officially an also-ran in the mobile OS wars, that's hardly a surprise.</p><p>Sales guidance was above consensus, but may have only been in-line if not for the impact of the LinkedIn deal, which closed in December and hadn't been factored into all analyst estimates. Regardless, Microsoft has a history of guiding conservatively and then beating the numbers it guided for without much trouble.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Seagate and Western Digital</emphasis><br/></p><p>Rumors of the hard drive's death are greatly exaggerated. With the help of a stabilizing PC market, a healthy pricing/margin environment (made possible by industry consolidation) and strong orders for high-capacity enterprise drives from cloud giants, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Seagate  </emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Western Digital</emphasis>\u00a0  trounced fiscal second-quarter\u00a0estimates and issued above-consensus third-quarter\u00a0guidance.</p><p>Western, which bought major NAND flash memory vendor SanDisk last May, is also benefiting from a strong NAND demand/pricing environment.</p><p>In addition to the top-line strength, it's hard to overlook the margin strength both Seagate and Western are seeing, as industry consolidation, job cuts and (following 2015 go-aheads from Chinese regulators) the integration of previously-acquired hard drive units all provide a boost. Seagate says it's now confident in its ability to keep gross margins at the high end of a 27% to 32% target range.</p><p>But a lot of the easy money may have already been made here. Hard drives might not be disappearing, but PC drive sales continue falling at a double-digit clip as consumers and businesses embrace solid-state drives (SSDs) thanks to their performance, size, power and reliability benefits.</p><p>In addition, both cloud infrastructure and flash storage adoption are weighing on sales of high-margin, mission-critical, enterprise drives. And with regards to Western, the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsinghua-plant-idUSKBN1532ED\">giant investments</url> being made by Intel and Chinese firms in ramping production of high-density 3D NAND flash chips will likely spell a tougher NAND pricing environment in time.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VMware</emphasis><br/></p><p>As is the case for the hard drive giants, investors are a lot more optimistic about <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VMware  </emphasis> than they were\u00a012 months ago, as buybacks and job cuts boost earnings and growth businesses offset declines elsewhere. License revenue growth (8% in the fourth quarter) is easily better than it was at the start of the year, as is bookings growth (13%).</p><p>The NSX networking virtualization software platform, a long-term threat to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco Systems  </emphasis> thanks to how it makes it easier to deploy commodity switches, has turned into a key growth driver. NSX's license bookings rose over 50% annually, and the business is now on a $1 billion annual bookings run rate. The vSAN storage virtualization platform saw license bookings rise over 150%, and the end-user computing business (covers PC virtualization and enterprise mobility software, competes with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citrix Systems  </emphasis>) posted mid-teens license bookings growth.</p><p>VMware's core vSphere server virtualization business, pressured by cloud adoption and competition from Microsoft and others, remains in a long-term decline. But the company is convincingly showing it can deliver moderate growth in spite of this decline.</p><p>Going forward, it's worth keeping an eye on the progress of VMware's  with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>\u00a0  to provide a managed service for running vSphere workloads both locally and on Amazon's cloud. If the service takes off, it could help offset the vSphere revenue loss that happens when workloads migrate to Amazon's standard EC2 cloud computing services.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lam Research and KLA-Tencor</emphasis><br/></p><p>Last week\u00a0provided quite a bit of good news for chip equipment makers. Intel set a 2017 capital spending budget of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, up from reported 2016 capex of $9.5 billion and better than expected. And <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lam Research  \u00a0</emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLA-Tencor  </emphasis>, two top-five chip equipment makers that were set to merge last year before regulators stepped in, each beat calendar fourth-quarter\u00a0estimates and provided above-consensus first-quarter\u00a0guidance.</p><p>KLA's orders jumped to $1.1 billion last quarter from $865 million a year earlier, with strong demand reported from DRAM makers, NAND flash makers and chip foundries. Lam's sales rose 33% last quarter, and the company reported its foundry and NAND shipments respectively rose 40% and 80% in 2016. It also talked up its potential to gain share in each segment as tech trends lead to greater demand for its etching and deposition tools.</p><p>3D NAND investments continue lifting the industry's growth, and it looks like DRAM makers are now willing to up their spending in response to healthier business conditions. And Intel, after years of keeping its capex down, is finally dialing up its spending as it tries to keep pace with the foundries. Gartner's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3569017\">recent forecast</url> for wafer fab equipment (WFE) sales to rise 5.7% in 2017 to $36 billion might end up being a little conservative.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Texas Instruments and Maxim Integrated</emphasis><br/></p><p>Analog/mixed-signal chipmakers are shaping up to be among the largest beneficiaries of the chip industry's rapid consolidation. Merging companies have reaped big cost synergies and better negotiating leverage with customers, and even those whose who haven't been party to a large deal, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Texas Instruments</emphasis>\u00a0  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maxim Integrated  </emphasis>, are benefiting from a better pricing/margin environment.</p><p>TI beat estimates while reporting 25% net income growth on 7% revenue growth. Maxim did so while reporting 43% adjusted net income growth on 8% revenue growth. Both firms also issued guidance that was above consensus at the midpoints, particularly for EPS.</p><p>Strong automotive and industrial/medical demand is also giving each company a boost, as products in both end-markets become smarter, more connected and more electrified\u00a0and power-efficient. The automotive market, in particular, is shaping up to be a big chip industry growth driver over the next five years. TI got 51% of its 2016 revenue from auto and industrial; Maxim got 44% of its December quarter revenue from those two markets.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAP</emphasis><br/></p><p>Like clockwork, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAP's  \u00a0</emphasis>top-line performance continues to outpace archrival <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oracle's  </emphasis>. The German software giant's cloud and traditional software revenue grew 7% annually (6% in constant currency) in the fourth quarter, nearly even with the third quarter's 8% clip and much better than the 2% growth Oracle (with the help of acquisitions) saw in its November quarter. It also reported 40% cloud bookings growth, and guided for cloud and software revenue to be up 6% to 8% in constant currency in 2017; dollar-based growth should be stronger, given a weak euro.</p><p>Strong cloud subscription and support revenue growth -- it was at 31% in the fourth quarter\u00a0-- is certainly giving SAP a lift. But it also helps that the company's traditional software license revenue remains (in spite of cloud cannibalization) stable for now, rising 1% during both the fourth quarter\u00a0and the whole of 2016. By contrast, Oracle's license revenue fell 20% in the November quarter.</p><p>The fact enterprises have been more hesitant to migrate their ERP software systems to the cloud than, say, their CRM and HR apps, has propped up SAP's license revenue, given the company's market-leading ERP position. So has strong uptake for its Hana in-memory database, and for a Hana-optimized version of its core business apps.</p><p>If efforts by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Workday  </emphasis> and others to get enterprises to move various ERP functions to the cloud see more uptake, SAP's on-premise software sales will feel the effects, and the company might be compelled to go acquisition-hunting again. But for now, its \"cloud transition\" is going swimmingly.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Logitech</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nvidia</emphasis>\u00a0  investors have to be pleased with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Logitech's  \u00a0</emphasis>latest report: The peripherals giant's blowout December quarter results had much to do with a 38% annual increase in gaming product sales. That's a lot better than the September quarter's 17% growth and -- much like  -- says a lot about how strong PC gaming hardware demand is right now.</p><p>And the slight-to-moderate growth reported for several other Logitech product segments tied to the PC market act as another sign that broader PC demand is stabilizing for the time being.

Here are some thoughts on the numbers shared by other notable tech names during what has been a pretty strong earnings season to date.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis><br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The software giant's  suggest the enterprise/cloud-focused transformation strategy pushed by CEO <person><nameText>Satya Nadella </nameText></person>continues paying off. But <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft's  \u00a0</emphasis>fiscal second quarter\u00a0beat had a lot to do with its Windows and Office cash cows.</p><p>A stabilizing PC market helped Windows OEM revenue (comes from PC makers) and Windows commercial and cloud services revenue (comes mostly from businesses) each rose 5% annually last quarter, an improvement from the flat growth each business posted in the fiscal first quarter.</p><p>And the transition from traditional Office license sales to Office 365 subscriptions has once more made Office a growth business, particularly on the consumer side. Office consumer revenue rose 22% annually, with 365 subs growing by another 900,000 sequentially to 24.9 million. Office commercial revenue grew 5%, with 365 commercial seats rising 37% annually. Googleis stepping up its efforts to win over enterprises with its G Suite (formerly GoogleApps), but its impact on Microsoftremains limited for now.</p><p>Elsewhere, Azure revenue grew 93% -- a slowdown from the 116% growth seen in the first quarter, but still outpacing most cloud infrastructure rivals. That helped total server products and cloud services revenue grow 12% -- Oracle, IBM and many other enterprise software rivals can only wish they were seeing similar growth.</p><p>Some weak spots: Enterprise Services revenue (hurt by cloud adoption) fell 4%, and gaming revenue (hurt by the Xbox One's age and Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro launch) fell 3%. Surface revenue fell 2%, but it's worth keeping in mind Microsoftrefreshed its Surface tablet line in late 2015. Growth should pick up in a couple of months if rumors of a March <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/surface-pro-5-release-date-news-and-rumors-1316294\">Surface Pro 5 launch</url> prove accurate. Phone revenue fell 81%, but with Microsoftunloading its feature phone business and Windows Phone officially an also-ran in the mobile OS wars, that's hardly a surprise.</p><p>Sales guidance was above consensus, but may have only been in-line if not for the impact of the LinkedIn deal, which closed in December and hadn't been factored into all analyst estimates. Regardless, Microsofthas a history of guiding conservatively and then beating the numbers it guided for without much trouble.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Seagate and Western Digital</emphasis><br/></p><p>Rumors of the hard drive's death are greatly exaggerated. With the help of a stabilizing PC market, a healthy pricing/margin environment (made possible by industry consolidation) and strong orders for high-capacity enterprise drives from cloud giants, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Seagate  </emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Western Digital</emphasis>\u00a0  trounced fiscal second-quarter\u00a0estimates and issued above-consensus third-quarter\u00a0guidance.</p><p>Western, which bought major NAND flash memory vendor SanDisk last May, is also benefiting from a strong NAND demand/pricing environment.</p><p>In addition to the top-line strength, it's hard to overlook the margin strength both Seagate and Western are seeing, as industry consolidation, job cuts and (following 2015 go-aheads from Chinese regulators) the integration of previously-acquired hard drive units all provide a boost. Seagate says it's now confident in its ability to keep gross margins at the high end of a 27% to 32% target range.</p><p>But a lot of the easy money may have already been made here. Hard drives might not be disappearing, but PC drive sales continue falling at a double-digit clip as consumers and businesses embrace solid-state drives (SSDs) thanks to their performance, size, power and reliability benefits.</p><p>In addition, both cloud infrastructure and flash storage adoption are weighing on sales of high-margin, mission-critical, enterprise drives. And with regards to Western, the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsinghua-plant-idUSKBN1532ED\">giant investments</url> being made by Intel and Chinese firms in ramping production of high-density 3D NAND flash chips will likely spell a tougher NAND pricing environment in time.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VMware</emphasis><br/></p><p>As is the case for the hard drive giants, investors are a lot more optimistic about <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VMware  </emphasis> than they were\u00a012 months ago, as buybacks and job cuts boost earnings and growth businesses offset declines elsewhere. License revenue growth (8% in the fourth quarter) is easily better than it was at the start of the year, as is bookings growth (13%).</p><p>The NSX networking virtualization software platform, a long-term threat to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco Systems  </emphasis> thanks to how it makes it easier to deploy commodity switches, has turned into a key growth driver. NSX's license bookings rose over 50% annually, and the business is now on a $1 billion annual bookings run rate. The vSAN storage virtualization platform saw license bookings rise over 150%, and the end-user computing business (covers PC virtualization and enterprise mobility software, competes with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citrix Systems  </emphasis>) posted mid-teens license bookings growth.</p><p>VMware's core vSphere server virtualization business, pressured by cloud adoption and competition from Microsoftand others, remains in a long-term decline. But the company is convincingly showing it can deliver moderate growth in spite of this decline.</p><p>Going forward, it's worth keeping an eye on the progress of VMware's  with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>\u00a0  to provide a managed service for running vSphere workloads both locally and on Amazon's cloud. If the service takes off, it could help offset the vSphere revenue loss that happens when workloads migrate to Amazon's standard EC2 cloud computing services.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lam Research and KLA-Tencor</emphasis><br/></p><p>Last week\u00a0provided quite a bit of good news for chip equipment makers. Intel set a 2017 capital spending budget of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, up from reported 2016 capex of $9.5 billion and better than expected. And <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lam Research  \u00a0</emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLA-Tencor  </emphasis>, two top-five chip equipment makers that were set to merge last year before regulators stepped in, each beat calendar fourth-quarter\u00a0estimates and provided above-consensus first-quarter\u00a0guidance.</p><p>KLA's orders jumped to $1.1 billion last quarter from $865 million a year earlier, with strong demand reported from DRAM makers, NAND flash makers and chip foundries. Lam's sales rose 33% last quarter, and the company reported its foundry and NAND shipments respectively rose 40% and 80% in 2016. It also talked up its potential to gain share in each segment as tech trends lead to greater demand for its etching and deposition tools.</p><p>3D NAND investments continue lifting the industry's growth, and it looks like DRAM makers are now willing to up their spending in response to healthier business conditions. And Intel, after years of keeping its capex down, is finally dialing up its spending as it tries to keep pace with the foundries. Gartner's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3569017\">recent forecast</url> for wafer fab equipment (WFE) sales to rise 5.7% in 2017 to $36 billion might end up being a little conservative.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Texas Instruments and Maxim Integrated</emphasis><br/></p><p>Analog/mixed-signal chipmakers are shaping up to be among the largest beneficiaries of the chip industry's rapid consolidation. Merging companies have reaped big cost synergies and better negotiating leverage with customers, and even those whose who haven't been party to a large deal, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Texas Instruments</emphasis>\u00a0  and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maxim Integrated  </emphasis>, are benefiting from a better pricing/margin environment.</p><p>TI beat estimates while reporting 25% net income growth on 7% revenue growth. Maxim did so while reporting 43% adjusted net income growth on 8% revenue growth. Both firms also issued guidance that was above consensus at the midpoints, particularly for EPS.</p><p>Strong automotive and industrial/medical demand is also giving each company a boost, as products in both end-markets become smarter, more connected and more electrified\u00a0and power-efficient. The automotive market, in particular, is shaping up to be a big chip industry growth driver over the next five years. TI got 51% of its 2016 revenue from auto and industrial; Maxim got 44% of its December quarter revenue from those two markets.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAP</emphasis><br/></p><p>Like clockwork, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAP's  \u00a0</emphasis>top-line performance continues to outpace archrival <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oracle's  </emphasis>. The German software giant's cloud and traditional software revenue grew 7% annually (6% in constant currency) in the fourth quarter, nearly even with the third quarter's 8% clip and much better than the 2% growth Oracle (with the help of acquisitions) saw in its November quarter. It also reported 40% cloud bookings growth, and guided for cloud and software revenue to be up 6% to 8% in constant currency in 2017; dollar-based growth should be stronger, given a weak euro.</p><p>Strong cloud subscription and support revenue growth -- it was at 31% in the fourth quarter\u00a0-- is certainly giving SAP a lift. But it also helps that the company's traditional software license revenue remains (in spite of cloud cannibalization) stable for now, rising 1% during both the fourth quarter\u00a0and the whole of 2016. By contrast, Oracle's license revenue fell 20% in the November quarter.</p><p>The fact enterprises have been more hesitant to migrate their ERP software systems to the cloud than, say, their CRM and HR apps, has propped up SAP's license revenue, given the company's market-leading ERP position. So has strong uptake for its Hana in-memory database, and for a Hana-optimized version of its core business apps.</p><p>If efforts by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Workday  </emphasis> and others to get enterprises to move various ERP functions to the cloud see more uptake, SAP's on-premise software sales will feel the effects, and the company might be compelled to go acquisition-hunting again. But for now, its \"cloud transition\" is going swimmingly.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Logitech</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nvidia</emphasis>\u00a0  investors have to be pleased with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Logitech's  \u00a0</emphasis>latest report: The peripherals giant's blowout December quarter results had much to do with a 38% annual increase in gaming product sales. That's a lot better than the September quarter's 17% growth and -- much like  -- says a lot about how strong PC gaming hardware demand is right now.</p><p>And the slight-to-moderate growth reported for several other Logitech product segments tied to the PC market act as another sign that broader PC demand is stabilizing for the time being. Logitech also got a boost from the 25% and 37% respective revenue increases it saw for mobile speaker and video collaboration sales, but those gains appear to have more to do with share gains than end-market demand. Weak tablet demand is still a headwind for the company: \"Tablet and other accessories\" revenue fell 29%.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-13972299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MSB-WV81-JCHV-V3K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1775\"/><timeReceived>9:30 AM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 TheStreet.com, Inc.

The interaction which lasted a massive five hours saw forty-four US senators from various states question the Facebook boss about the company's failure to guard user privacy following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Zuckerberg appeared calm as the line of questioning from most senators was mostly polite and deferential as they sought to understand how Facebook had inadvertently allowed the profiles of up to 87 million people to be collected by the political data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica.</p><p><br/><br/>Here are the most notable stories emerging from the Senate hearing:<br/><br/>Is Facebook a monopoly?<br/><br/>When Senator Lindsey Graham asked Zuckerberg to name his biggest competitor, Zuckerberg couldn't clearly name one. Zuckerberg responded by outlining three \"categories\" of companies, starting with one category that included big tech companies like \"Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.\" A frustrated Graham cut him off. \"If I'm upset with Facebook, what's the equivalent product I can go sign up for?\" he said. \"I'm talking about real competition you face  I'm not talking about categories.\"<br/><br/>The Facebook CEO danced around the question again, citing a statistic that \"the average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch.\" Graham got straight to the point and asked, \"You don't think you have a monopoly?\" The Facebook boss then sheepishly replied \"It certainly doesn't feel like that to me,\" to some laughter in the room. While lawmakers seem to understand that Facebook lacks any meaningful competition, but they seem to lack any coherent strategy to resolve this issue. Should Facebook be broken up? Should it be more closely regulated? Should it be forced to become more interoperable with other platforms? That is something which lawmakers are still unsure about.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg won't rule out a paid version of Facebook<br/><br/>Like most major platforms on the internet, Facebook has offered its services for free, instead, the company has made money (lots of it) by offering targeted ads on its platform. But with the issue of privacy where users are no longer comfortable being profiled for advertisers has led to questions whether Facebook would ever consider offering users a premium service, a paid ad-free version of Facebook. While we would hold our breath for this, Zuckerberg may not be opposed to the idea. Multiple senators asked Zuckerberg whether he might consider a paid, ad-free version of Facebook in the future. While responding to this question from Senator Orrin Hatch, Zuckerberg seemed to choose his words carefully, saying that there would always be a version of Facebook that will be free, suggesting a paid option might not be out of the question. Later, he told another senator that a paid version would be worth thinking about.<br/><br/>Senator Hatch, who recalled meeting Zuckerberg in 2010 as part of the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force. \"You said back then that Facebook would always be free,\" Hatch said to Zuckerberg. \"Is that still your objective?\" \"Senator, yes,\" Zuckerberg responded. \"There will always be a version of Facebook that is free. It is our mission to try to help connect everyone around the world and bring the world closer together,\" Zuckerberg continued. \"In order to do that, we believe we need to deliver a service that everyone can afford.\" By specifying a free version of Facebook, Zuckerberg seemed to leave room for the idea of a paid way to opt out of data collection and targeted advertising, as many have suggested.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg seems divided between AI and human moderation<br/><br/>'AI', the acronym got thrown around so many times at the hearing that users on Twitter decided to make a drinking game out of it (I pity their livers because spoiler alert, it was mentioned a lot). Whenever asked about how Facebook would improve its moderation tools, Zuckerberg invoked the promise of AI to help Facebook quickly sort through hate speech and other problematic posts. Fair enough. While AI still remains unproven when it comes to content moderation, Facebook has as good a chance as anyone to actually make it work.<br/><br/>So AI seems to be Facebook's ace in the hole in dealing with hateful content and fake news right? Well, Zuckerberg had a scatterbrain approach to this where he would periodically drop a line or two about how Facebook will have 20,000 people working on securing the platform from such content. He also mentioned getting on board local language moderators when pressed about how Facebook plans to deal with its platform being used to propagate violence in Myanmar.<br/><br/>It seems Zuckerberg want AI to be the magic solution to all of Facebook's problems but still doesn't completely trust its efficacy yet to completely forgo human moderators.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg carried a cheat sheet to help him answer questions<br/><br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg brought notes with him to the hearing. While he stepped out for a short break after the second round of questions Associated Press photojournalist Andy Harnik snapped a photo of these notes. Highlights from the notes include responses to possible questions on GDPR, Chinese threat, Ad market, Apple and also had an emergency go-to statement.<br/><br/>While Zuckerberg did talk about the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation rules, which go into effect next month, the notes instructed Zuckerberg not to suggest the company is covered. \"Don't say we already do what GDPR requires.\" On the question, if Facebook should be broken up his notes suggested using China as a red herring saying that, \"US tech companies key asset for America; break up strengthens Chinese companies.\"<br/><br/>On possible questions about Facebook's dominance of the online ad space, the notes suggested that Zuckerberg point out that, \"Advertisers have choices too - Advertising is a $650 billion market, we have 6%.\" The notes additionally contained references to Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook - presumably to be used in case senators ask about Cook's recent comments that presumably concerned Facebook. \"Lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,\" Zuckerberg's notes say.<br/><br/>There was also a go-to statement that Zuckerberg could use in the event of especially strong criticism of Facebook. \"If attacked: Respectfully, I reject that. Not who we are,\" the notes say. Just precious.<br/><br/>Kogan sold data to others like Cambridge Analytica<br/><br/>Zuckerberg answered a question from Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, about whether British psychologist Aleksandr Kogan sold the Facebook data he collected when he asked users to fill out a personality quiz to anyone other than Cambridge Analytica. Zuckerberg said he had. Baldwin asked for the names of the companies it was sold to. Zuckerberg mentioned the company Eunoia Technologies and said there were likely other companies that got the data.<br/><br/>This was a fresh revelation as it had been reported so far that Kogan had only worked with Cambridge Analytica. What is still unclear though is what did these other entities do with the data collected from Kogan. Are there other elections that were tampered and we don't know about it yet?<br/><br/>Zuckerberg does not know Facebook's exact data retention policy<br/><br/>Zuckerberg claimed that he was unaware of the exact time frame that Facebook retains a user's data after he/she has deleted his or her account from Facebook. It sounds preposterous that the CEO of the company is unaware of the time frame that Facebook retains a user's data after they have said goodbye to Facebook for good. If the CEO is so uninformed how does he expect the users to have a clear understanding of how their data is handled.<br/><br/>Lawmakers don't really understand how Facebook works<br/><br/>The general consensus around the Senate hearing was that while Zuckerberg was pressed on certain issues he largely emerged from the whole experience relatively scot-free. The problem was a lot of time was spent by lawmakers trying to understand the how Facebook and in some cases the internet works. We nearly got a \"the internet is a series of tubes\" discussion when Zuckerberg was pressed on Internet Service Providers. A lot of questions asked could have been answered with a basic Google search or Wikipedia lookup. The allowed Zuckerberg to field softball question and quash conspiracy theories about Facebook listening in on your conversations through your phone's mic.<br/><br/>The height of this was while speaking about possible regulations Zuckerberg told a senator that Facebook would be happy to write down what regulations it thinks that are appropriate. Facebook basically proposed to help draft a law that is meant to regulate its functioning. Let that sink in.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0039268874</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S30-24K1-DXMP-K2PW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1459\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The new year is also an election year in the U.S., and companies will be watching for signs of changes that might affect prospects for growth or the costs, or benefits, of M...But with stock prices high and cash available, companies have the resources to make acquisitions as they find opportunities.In this alert, we review some of the key developments arising from last year's M...ctivity, and consider how they might affect the level of M...nd how deals are done going forward. 1. Privacy Laws Expand in the U.S. and Globally M...ealmakers are scrambling to keep up with significant changes in privacy laws in the U.S. and other countries, both to assess the impact on potential deal value and to implement appropriate compliance measures. Although particularly important for transactions involving data-driven companies, these changes affect virtually all companies in some fashion. Prominent among these changes is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)[5]; which as of January 1, 2020 created landmark rights for California residents to request access to the personal information that companies maintain about them, request deletion of that information, and opt out of the 'sale' of their personal information. Moreover, CCPA allows California residents to file civil lawsuits for certain types of data security breaches. California's new IoT data security law[6] and new data broker law[7] also took effect in January 2020. Nevada modified its online privacy law to give individuals a right to opt out of the sale of their personal information (albeit relatively narrower than the right provided under the CCPA). Over a dozen other states are considering expansive new consumer privacy legislation. The expansion of state law initiatives has also led to more vocal proposals for a federal privacy law. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[8] generated record-breaking fines, including a \u20ac50M fine[9] against Google by the French data protection authority for alleged violations of GDPR's transparency, information, and consent requirements in deploying targeted advertisements. The forthcoming ePrivacy Regulation is likely to have an even greater impact on the use of cookies and similar technologies, interest-based advertising, and other collection of data from users' devices. Beyond the U.S. and EU, privacy laws are expanding globally as well. 2. The Blockchain Industry Consolidates and Matures The blockchain industry ripened as a vector for M...joint ventures, and other strategic transactions during 2019. Noteworthy transactions included the acquisitions of cryptocurrency derivatives trading facilities (such as Kraken's acquisition of Crypto Facilities), blockchain-enabled payment remittance companies, and custody services (such as Coinbase's acquisition of Xapo's institutional custody business). Investment also grew in supply chain management, healthcare, and other verticals. At the same time, established financial players seeking greater returns for their investors are continually deploying their own 'permissioned' blockchain-enabled solutions.Overall, dealmaking in 2019 exhibited a more calculated approach than in 2018, likely as a result of what is known as the 'Crypto Winter,' where the hyped valuations of several cryptocurrencies returned to normal levels or folded for lack of underlying substance.2019 also saw both governments and tech giants focusing on the implications of blockchain products. For example, the rise of cryptocurrencies and the interest of established players has put pressure on central governments to look into crafting their own digital asset platforms. The combination of regulation and consolidation will continue to drive activity in the blockchain space.'The rise of cryptocurrencies and the interest of established players has put pressure on central governments to look into crafting their own digital asset platforms.' 3. M...itigation Continues and Evolves The focus of M...itigation continued to change, though such litigation remains an integral piece of the public, and in some cases the private, M...andscape. Shareholder Litigation. 2019 saw the effects of the movement of shareholder M...itigation out of Delaware state courts, following those courts' determinations in the Trulia and Corwin cases. Shareholders still challenge a majority of public acquisitions, but the bulk of those challenges have shifted to federal court, with more focus on disclosure issues than on fiduciary issues, and to some other state courts. In support of potential challenges, shareholders have continued to seek (and litigate for) access to corporate books and records. Contract Construction. Delaware courts in 2019 reminded parties in emphatic fashion that they will enforce the terms of the parties' negotiated agreement. Some examples include: Strict Enforcement of a Termination Provision - In Vintage Rodeo Parent, LLC v. Rent-a-Center, Inc., a target company, immediately after the scheduled end date under a merger agreement, terminated the deal and demanded a $92.5M reverse termination fee, since the regulatory approval condition had not been satisfied. The buyer objected to the termination, noting, among other things, that the parties were continuing to seek regulatory approval. The Delaware Court of Chancery enforced a provision requiring the buyer to provide notice of extension of the end date, which the buyer had failed to provide.'Delaware courts in 2019 reminded parties in emphatic fashion that they will enforce the terms of the parties' negotiated agreement.' Ordering a Buyer to Close - Coming off the heels of the Delaware Supreme Court's 2018 Akorn decision finding - for the first time - that a material adverse effect had occurred,[4][10] the Delaware Court of Chancery, in Channel Medsystems, Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp., rejected a buyer's claim that a material adverse effect had occurred and ordered the buyer to close the acquisition. The court found that, while a number of the target's representations might have been inaccurate as of the date of the agreement, the buyer failed to prove that such inaccuracies reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect at the time of termination. The court also explained that the buyer 'will obtain the essence of what it bargained for by closing the transaction.' 4. Shareholder Activism Drives Divestitures and Other M#38;A During 2019, activist investors increasingly focused on M...with about 47% of all campaigns having an M...hesis, up from about 35% in prior years.[5][11] Activists continued to pursue a variety of M...elated objectives, including outright sales of targeted companies, divestitures and break-ups, and challenges to announced deals, either on the target side through traditional 'bumpitrage' demands for a higher price or on the buy side by opposing a proposed acquisition.2019 also saw: Convergence of Activism and Private Equity - Activist funds made numerous private equity-like investments, including by partnering with private equity funds on acquisitions. For example, Elliott Management proposed to acquire QEP Resources, and Elliott Management's private equity arm, Evergreen Coast Capital, partnered with Siris Capital Group to acquire Travelport Worldwide and with Francisco Partners to acquire LogMeIn. Institutional Investors Using Activist Strategies - Prominent institutional investors turned to activist strategies to oppose M...ransactions they perceived to be unfavorable. Notable examples include Wellington Management's public challenge to the Bristol-Myers Squibb acquisition of Celgene and T. Rowe Price's public disclosure that it would vote against Occidental Petroleum's directors in response to Occidental's restructuring of its acquisition of Anadarko to avoid a shareholder vote. Overseas Activity - The proportion of activism aimed at non-U.S. targets continued to increase. Japan was the busiest non-U.S. jurisdiction with campaigns including Elliott Management's criticism of Unizo's response to takeover offers and ValueAct's campaign against Olympus. SEC Rule-Making with Respect to Proxy Advisors - In August 2019, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed its position that proxy voting advice issued by proxy advisors generally constitutes a 'solicitation' and accordingly is subject to anti-fraud and other federal proxy rules.[6][12] The proxy advisory industry objected, and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) sued the SEC. In November 2019, the SEC proposed rules that would require proxy advisors, in order to avoid the proxy rules' filing requirements, to disclose conflicts of interest and to interact with issuers before sharing their advice with their clients.[7][13] 5. National Security Concerns and Trade Tensions Complicate Deals Heightened U.S. national security concerns and trade tensions resulted in new rules being pursued and effected that will impact M...rocesses and, moreover, the value of businesses. Expanded CFIUS Regulations - On January 13, 2020, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) published final regulations that expand the existing 'pilot program' to cover, more broadly, foreign investments in U.S. businesses performing critical infrastructure functions - which include more modern security concerns, such as internet protocol networks and exchange points, data centers, and core processing services for federal financial institutions - and collecting sensitive personal data pertaining to U.S. citizens.[8][14] These rules are substantially similar to the proposed rules issued in September 2019.[9][15] Under the final rule, the principal requirements of the pilot program will be subsumed in the new regulations, rather than remain a standalone regime.Under the regulations, a non-U.S. entity investing in a U.S. company (including a non-U.S. company with a U.S. business) will need to determine (i) whether the target company falls within the regulations' definition of a technology, infrastructure, and data (TID) U.S. business, and (ii) whether the transaction will afford the foreign investor certain key rights, such as access to 'material nonpublic technical information,' board membership or observer rights, or involvement in substantive decision-making regarding the target's TID assets, regardless of whether the investor otherwise obtains 'control' (as defined broadly by CFIUS). The regulations require mandatory filings in transactions where a foreign government has a 'substantial interest.' Reviewing Closed Deals and Punishing Violations - CFIUS actively reached out to companies involved in transactions potentially covered by CFIUS that were not notified. For example, CFIUS forced Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. Ltd. to divest its 2016 acquisition of the dating app company Grindr LLC, apparently based on concerns about the Chinese government's potential exploitation of sensitive data relating to U.S. citizens, and pressured a partially Russian-backed investment fund, Pamplona Capital Management, to divest its minority stake in a U.S. cybersecurity firm. CFIUS also imposed the first-ever civil penalty - $1 million - for repeated violations of a mitigation agreement. Emerging and Foundational Technologies - The Department of Commerce is working on regulations to identify 'emerging and foundational' technologies, following its November 2018 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comments on 14 categories of proposed emerging technologies.[10][16] Actions Against Specific Actors - The Department of Commerce added Huawei, SenseTime, Hikvison, and other companies to its 'Entity List,' thereby prohibiting these entities from obtaining any hardware, software or technology that is subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.[11][17] The Department of Defense (and other agencies) prohibited federal agencies from buying 'covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system' from designated Chinese entities, including Huawei and ZTE.[12][18]'It remains to be seen what impact the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China will have on the use of the administration's national security toolbox or whether new legislation may be proposed.' Supply Chain Actions - The Department of Commerce proposed regulations to address certain information and communications technology and services transactions that pose an undue risk to critical infrastructure or the digital economy in the U.S., or an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security or the safety of U.S. persons.[13][19] U.S.-China Trade Considerations -- It remains to be seen what impact the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China will have on the use of the administration's national security toolbox or whether new legislation may be proposed. The January 15, 2020 signing of a 'Phase 1' trade agreement with China may alleviate trade tensions and may result in a broader trade agreement. However, the national security concerns of the U.S. government pre-date the current trade war and likely will persist regardless of whether the broader bilateral relationship improves. 6. Focus in Asia Changes M...ctivity in Asia Pacific outside Japan decreased, with outbound and domestic/intra-regional M...alue down by 29.5% and 33.5%, respectively, and inbound M...alue up only 1.3% for Q1-Q3.[14][20] Japan saw overall M...eal value decline, with inbound and domestic activity increasing but outbound activity falling.[15][21]Several trends are likely to affect deals in 2020: Take Privates of U.S.-Listed China Businesses - As U.S.-China trade tensions and national security-related investment restrictions in the U.S. continue, U.S.-listed companies with most or all of their operations in China may seek a secondary listing outside of the U.S. The next step could be another wave of take privates as such companies withdraw from U.S. capital markets. Sales of China Businesses of U.S. and European Companies - Some U.S. and European companies, especially those that are consumer facing or that seek to sell technology to Chinese companies, may feel 'unwelcome' in the Chinese market, leading to the sale of controlling stakes in the China businesses of such companies to Chinese companies (for example, the sale of a majority stake in Carrefour's China business to Suning (a large, non-state-owned Chinese conglomerate) completed in September 2019). Consolidation in Healthcare and Education Sectors - The healthcare and education sectors in Asia have benefited from the growth of the middle class in Asia and encouragement by Asian governments of increased consumer spending. Both of these sectors have presented opportunities for consolidation. Sales of Non-Core Businesses - If the economy in Asia sours further in 2020, more companies may seek to sell non-core businesses as they try to raise funds and refocus their businesses. Increasing Activity in Japan - The volume of PE buyouts in Japan is expected to continue to increase in 2020 as a number of major funds (such as Bain and Carlyle) have indicated they are raising new or additional Japan-focused buyout funds and as the Japanese government continues to press listed conglomerates to spin off subsidiaries to improve corporate governance and reduce conflicts of interest.'The healthcare and education sectors in Asia have benefited from the growth of the middle class in Asia and encouragement by Asian governments of increased consumer spending.' 7. Brexit to Get Done The uncertainty of Brexit cast a long shadow over the UK political scene and domestic M...arket following the Brexit referendum in 2016. During that time M...ctivity and investment in relation to UK-based businesses was largely put on hold by many potential market participants, since it was unclear whether Brexit would take place and whether any Brexit would be with a withdrawal agreement between the UK and the rest of the EU or reliant on the WTO fall back position with the potential of material friction affecting exports and imports. That shadow - at least insofar as it is now clear that Brexit will indeed take place - was lifted by the UK general election in December 2019 and with that has come an upsurge of interest in UK businesses and M#38;A.The full details of the future relationship between the UK and the remaining members of the EU have yet to be agreed. Although that process may continue to provide a slight drag on UK domestic M...the main concern for cross-border European M...s the relative weakness of the main economies in the Eurozone.In addition, Europe does not have a technology ecosystem that is as well developed as the system in the U.S., especially the U.S. West Coast. This means that there is not a comparable pipeline of large emerging companies presenting investment and M...pportunities. Some European companies, including portfolio companies of private equity sponsors, have sought to expand through acquisitions of such companies in the U.S.'Europe continues to have a large number of strong strategics in a wide range of sectors who remain well placed to consolidate their market positions through M...More encouragingly, Europe continues to have a large number of strong strategics in a wide range of sectors who are well placed to consolidate their market positions through M...both in Europe and in other regions. Also, private equity sponsors participating in the European markets have similar cash fire power as private equity sponsors elsewhere. They continue to drive significant amounts of M...usiness in Europe and look set to continue to do so against a background of readily available debt. 8. Antitrust Populism ...rutiny of Technology Deals Likely to Intensify in 2020 Proponents of stricter antitrust enforcement are clamoring for antitrust agencies to include an assessment of whether a transaction is likely to harm jobs, employee wages, privacy rights, or the ability of smaller businesses and entrepreneurs to compete. The calls for more stringent standards and aggressive enforcement have focused particularly on 'Big Tech' and 'Big Pharma' companies, as well as firms in other industries, where patent-protected innovations, platform-based business models, and data-driven insights provide significant competitive advantages or may generate 'winner-take-all' network effects.U.S. and European enforcement agencies have taken notice of the policy debate. For example: New Technology Enforcement Division - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that it would establish a new Technology Enforcement Division to focus on potentially anticompetitive mergers or practices in 'markets for online advertising, social networking, mobile operating systems and apps, and platform businesses.' 'Killer Acquisitions' and 'Nascent' Competition - According to press reports, the FTC is investigating whether several of Facebook's long-ago consummated deals, such as Instagram (acquired in 2012) or WhatsApp (acquired in 2014), were so-called 'killer acquisitions' aimed at eliminating potential future rivals or 'nascent' competitors before they could become a threat. Similarly, concerns about preventing future potential competition were present in the FTC's challenge of Illumina's proposed $1.2 billion takeover of PacBio to prevent Illumina from 'extinguishing PacBio as a nascent competitive threat' even though their current market activities were largely in different markets. The FTC was also concerned that the transaction would reduce the combined firm's incentive to innovate and develop new products. Illumina and PacBio abandoned their transaction shortly after the FTC filed its complaint. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) recently challenged Sabre Corp.'s planned $360 million acquisition of airline booking company Farelogix Inc based on concerns that the transaction was designed 'to take out a disruptive competitor that has been an important source of competition and innovation.' Online Platforms - The DOJ announced that it would review whether market-leading online platforms, such as Google and other tech firms, have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers (for example, by using data gathered from customers to block rivals from competing).'The calls for more stringent standards and aggressive enforcement have focused particularly on 'Big Tech' and 'Big Pharma' companies.' Actions in Europe - The EC published Competition Policy for the Digital Era,[16][22] an advisory report on merger enforcement examining (i) the role that data accumulation plays in creating entry barriers and (ii) whether the EU should amend its notification thresholds to require filings to preserve the EC's ability to review 'killer acquisitions' of nascent competitors. The EC's Chief Competition Economist has advocated for reversing the burden of proof for these acquisitions to force merging parties to prove the efficiencies arising from their transaction. 9. Private Equity: More Money, More Competition, More Creativity 2019 saw roughly $450 billion of private equity deals, a modest decrease from 2018. In addition to traditional buyouts of public and more mature companies with relatively strong cash flows, private equity firms bought younger firms and engaged in growth equity, joint ventures and other majority or minority investments with greater frequency in 2019. Terms and interest rates remained favorable throughout 2019 for borrowers in leveraged deals, adding to the competitiveness to deploy capital, but creating opportunities for positive-return exits. Exits fell moderately, with secondary buyouts accounting for an increasing proportion of overall exits.In 2020, private equity firms will be armed with a record level of cash, as private equity firms at the end of 2019 held almost $1.5 trillion in unspent capital (or 'dry powder').[17][23] Combined with the current debt market, this provides massive investment potential.The biggest challenges in 2020 will be the geopolitical and macroeconomic factors affecting the overall M...arket described above, including potential economic downturns, the 2020 U.S. elections (in which some candidates have proposed legislation aimed directly at the private equity industry), and the U.S.-China trade dispute. Private equity funds must also continue to grapple with the enhanced competitiveness of the middle market, with the field of investors expanding to include sovereign wealth funds, venture capital firms, family offices and independent sponsors capable of writing bigger checks and pursuing direct control investments more often than ever before.Nevertheless, we expect private equity sponsors to remain active and to continue to look for opportunities to deploy their record-breaking capital in creative ways. This activity should continue, and build upon, trends seen in 2019, including an increased focus on portfolio company 'add-on' transactions, 'roll-up' strategies designed to create market-leading participants rather than acquiring existing, mature participants, and continued expansion of a sponsor's typical investment scope (with respect to both sector and geographic focus). Sponsors are also expected to engage in more opportunistic pursuit of exit transactions (particularly if concerns of a broader economic slowdown become more pronounced).

Like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Biden's own campaign staff[2], Harris has a long relationship with Silicon Valley that includes fundraisers and soliciting advice from tech leaders and employees.Her rise in political prominence in the San Francisco Bay Area coincides with the exponential growth of the tech industry and major companies that call California home \u2014 including Apple, Facebook, and Google. As attorney general of California and as a U.S. Senator for the state, Harris has played a role in determining what constitutes online crime, defining online privacy, hammering out parameters for the major app stores, and supporting the prosecution of revenge porn or online sexual harassment. She is someone who has both threatened legal action against tech companies and referred to them as 'family.' </p><p>While this isn't intended as a comprehensive list, we wanted to look back at some key moments in Kamala Harris' history with Silicon Valley.Kamala Harris runs for Attorney General of California against a former Facebook executiveAfter two terms as district attorney of San Francisco, Harris ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010. One of her main opponents in the Democratic primary was former Facebook chief privacy officer and top lawyer Chris Kelly. Kelly funded his campaign with millions from his personal fortune, and Harris publicly questioned whether electing the former Facebook executive would be like getting a fox to guard a henhouse[3].'If Kelly couldn't stand up to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on behalf of Facebook users, how on Earth can Californians trust Kelly to go to bat on their behalf as attorney general?' she asked.A hard-hitting Harris campaign ad said: 'His only experience is designing a Facebook privacy policy condemned across the country. Chris Kelly released your privacy information.' Kelly appeared to toughen his stance on Facebook privacy issues,[4] joining MoveOn in urging Facebook to only share information approved by users. But with days to go in the primary, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg may have helped tilt the scale in Harris'[5]favor, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, by indicating that he might attend an event to make calls for the Harris campaign. In the end, Harris won the election and Kelly came in second, according to Ballotpedia[6].Harris speaks at Google headquarters ahead of California Attorney General electionWeeks before the 2010 general election, Harris visited Google headquarters in Mountain View for an hour-long conversation with company employees led by then Google chief legal counsel David Drummond. She talked about having 'a certain bravado about being a California kid' and how the California attorney general should be a go-to person for anyone handling cases against tech companies in the country. She made it clear in her remarks that she didn't want to stand in the way of innovation.It's instructive to hear Harris share her thoughts on how tech can make government more efficient and to be reminded that antitrust competition law conversations were happening at Google a decade ago. 'This is what I meant earlier about my pride about being in California, where you know this is a short drive to come here. This is [my] backyard \u2014 we're family \u2014 so California AGs should be a leader on these issues,' she said. In that same meeting, she discussed her view of taking antitrust actions against the big companies. This was long before the U.S. Justice Department[7], Congress[8], and attorneys general from virtually every state in the U.S. filed antitrust investigations into Google[9], although European Union officials filed three antitrust cases against Google in November 2010. In the context of antitrust law, she talked about tech being essential to California's economy. It's worth noting that Harris was running while the state was in the midst of a major budgetary crisis. In order to address this economic crunch, she said, 'We're going to have to recognize we cannot stand in the way of business growth and development and that we don't have to accept false choices. That doesn't have to be to the exclusion of helping consumers. It doesn't have to be at the exclusion of going after bad businesses because bad business is not good for good business.'Harris issues predictive policing MOUDuring her first year as attorney general, Harris signed a memorandum of understanding[10] (MOU) giving the Los Angeles Police Department access to data for predictive policing. The use of data-driven approaches in decision-making is at the heart of Harris' focus in her book Smart on Crime. But since then, predictive policing systems deployed in cities like Los Angeles[11] and New Orleans[12] with help from companies like Palantir have been accused of demonstrating racial bias or use of racially biased data. While AI capabilities and the sheer volume of available data have grown dramatically since 2011, Harris' history as a prosecutor and on issues like predictive policing may return in the run-up to the election. Those issues could also be central to ongoing discussions around racial justice reform and calls to defund the police.Harris strikes privacy policy deal with major tech companiesIn a very different kind of deal, in 2012 Harris brokered an agreement between six of the largest tech companies with app stores at the time[13]: Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, Microsoft, and Research in Motion. Terms of the deal included companies designating an area for developers and businesses to share their privacy policies. The deal was reached in part to bring businesses in line with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, a law that required commercial businesses operating online to post a privacy policy. This agreement was reached at a time when several companies \u2014 including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter \u2014 were found to be hoovering up user information, like address book contacts, sometimes without permission[14]. 'Your personal privacy should not be the cost of using mobile apps, but all too often it is,' Harris said at the time. App marketplace regulation is still an issue today. Apple's App Store dominance was a central topic[15] of discussion in antitrust hearings in Congress last month[16] and made headlines last week when Epic Games filed a lawsuit[17] after being kicked out of Apple and Google's app stores for iOS and Android, respectively.Harris speaks at Facebook headquartersAbout a month after the launch of her U.S. Senate campaign, Harris spoke at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California alongside COO Sheryl Sandberg as part of the Safer Internet Day conference. Harris and Sandberg spoke with kids about online harassment[18] and ways to combat cyberbullying. The event itself wasn't a political earthquake, but it produced memorable visuals of Harris and Sandberg together in the days before Cambridge Analytica[19], election interference[20], and boycotts against the company's willingness to profit from hate[21].

Image Credit: John Green/Bay Area News Group via Getty ImagesAlso in February 2015, Harris held a meeting with victims of online harassment and representatives[22] from Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter to talk about curbing online harassment and abuse. Meeting transcripts were kept confidential, but a report[23] noted Harris' view that what some refer to as 'revenge porn' is a form of 'cyber exploitation' and that the lack of consent separates it from consensual pornography. Shortly after the meeting, many major platforms began taking steps to restrict the sharing of explicit content without consent, and Harris launched a public campaign and resource for cyber exploitation victims with input[24] on how to address instances of cyber exploitation on Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, and Twitter.Backpage.com prosecution and Section 230 of the Communications Decency ActWeeks before the 2016 general election, as Harris campaigned to represent California in the U.S. Senate, Harris filed charges[25] against Backpage founder Carl Ferrer for pimping, pimping a minor, and conspiracy to commit pimping. He was arrested in Houston, Texas and extradited to California to face charges. It was part of a continued effort by Harris to address how online platforms aid in human trafficking. Like many other businesses including big tech companies, Ferrer claimed protection from prosecution under Section 230[26] of the Communications Decency Act, which provides some liability protection to the creators of an interactive computer service. The case was thrown out shortly after the election. Ferrer was convicted of other charges in 2018, but calls for reform of Section 230 for major tech companies came long before Harris charged Backpage and are likely to persist in 2020 and beyond.Harris, Uber, and the gig economyShortly before leaving her position as attorney general, in December 2016 Harris ordered Uber to take its self-driving cars off the streets of San Francisco[27] over safety concerns and stated that she would seek a court order to force compliance if need be. Harris' brother-in-law Tony West is chief legal counsel at Uber[28] and served as a cochair of the Harris 2016 U.S. Senate transition team and as an advisor to Harris when she was district attorney. More recently, lawmakers have fielded demands for gig economy companies like Uber to treat workers as employees or contractors, which would confer labor protections and employee benefits. In 2019, California lawmakers offered supporters a preliminary victory in the form of Bill AB 5, which Harris supports.[29] This week, a California judge ordered Uber and Lyft to begin complying with AB 5[30], though the companies have challenged the measure. Proposition 22 will put the final decision to California voters in November.If Prop 22 passes, calls for similar legislation may grow in Washington, D.C.Harris questions Mark Zuckerberg about Cambridge AnalyticaIn the weeks after multiple news outlets reported that the data of 87 million Facebook users was misused by Cambridge Analytica[31], in 2018 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg came to Congress to discuss data privacy. As part of a hearing, Harris asked Zuckerberg why Facebook leadership chose not to tell its users when the news came to light in December 2015. 'In retrospect that was a mistake, and knowing what we know now we should've handled a lot of things differently,' Zuckerberg said.In addition to drawing attention for her questions for Zuckerberg, Harris also garnered a reputation for her direct questioning of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh.National AI strategy legislationAs a U.S. senator, in 2018 Harris cosponsored legislation[32] to spearhead the development of a national AI strategy. The AI in Government Act sought to provide a framework for bringing more AI expertise into government and urged federal agencies to actively remove barriers to incorporating AI. While the legislation didn't pass, members of Congress and the Pentagon have called the formation of a coherent national AI strategy imperative to maintaining economic and military dominance. While Harris supports the integration of AI in government, she has a history of opposing the algorithmic bias plaguing many AI systems today[33]. In 2018, she joined a group of U.S. Senators who questioned the FBI, FTC, and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) about use of facial recognition technology. Harris also joined colleagues in Congress in calling for a review offacial recognition use in federal housing in 2019.Big Tech antitrustIn numerous interviews during her bid for the presidential nomination, Harris hesitated to say that tech giants should be broken up. Speaking with the New York Times[34], she said her first priority if elected would be to ensure American consumers feel their privacy is not compromised. In an early 2019 interview with CNN's Jake Tapper[35], Harris said breaking up Facebook is something that should be carefully considered, and that the company had become in effect an unregulated utility. She did not choose to go as far as Elizabeth Warren, whose stance on breaking up tech giants became a cornerstone of her presidential campaign platform. Harris was also attorney general when Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014, respectively \u2014 acquisitions that have come up in the ongoing Congressional antitrust investigation[36].Final thoughtsA look at Kamala Harris' record demonstrates that long before she became a nationally prominent politician or vice presidential candidate, Harris played an influential role in shaping tech policy over the past decade. She may very well be one of the most tech-savvy candidates to grace a presidential ticket to date. If Biden and Harris are elected, the administration is likely to face a range of tech-related challenges \u2014 from the growth of 5G and tech nationalism[37] to the proliferation of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity[38]. Like the deal Joe Biden struck with Barack Obama[39] before agreeing to be his running mate, Biden recently said he wants Kamala Harris to be the last person in the room when there's a tough decision to make. If elected, when it comes to tough decisions related to tech, Kamala Harris could have a considerable amount of influence on a range of tech policy issues in the future.

As you know, the University which hosts us today was founded 150 years ago by Ezra Cornell, the inventor of the electric telegraph and founder of Western Union. His motto - which became the University's founding principle, \"an institution where anyone can find instruction in any study\" - has formed the basis for Cornell University's countless contributions across all fields of knowledge, prioritising public engagement to help improve quality of life worldwide. At this University, founded by such a revolutionary spirit, I have the opportunity to share my thoughts and exchange views with you on what economists have called a major catalyst in the \"fourth industrial revolution\", the FinTech industry, due to its significant transformative impact on financial services. And let me draw your attention to another parallel: the term FinTech first appeared in the public domain, introduced in the early 1990s by Citigroup, the main organiser of today's event!</p><p>My speech today will be structured as follows: After offering some introductory remarks to clarify technical jargon and some remarks on FinTech's current landscape, I will then move on to an overview of FinTech's current state-of-play in the European Union (EU), focusing on its potential impact on the established financial sector, as well as the risks and challenges ahead. Finally, I will take a look into the regulation gap as far as FinTech activities are concerned and possible ways to fill this gap.</p><p>2. The FinTech landscape today</p><p>2.1 What is Fintech?</p><p>Despite its widespread usage, FinTech does not have a broadly and formally accepted definition. In general terms, FinTech stands for Financial Technology and describes technologically enabled financial innovations that could result in new business models, applications, processes or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services.</p><p>A term associated with FinTech is RegTech, a commonly recognised term for technologies that can be used by market participants, to follow regulatory and compliance requirements more effectively and efficiently, and by competent authorities, for supervisory purposes. RegTech is not entirely new, but is rapidly developing (in line with other technological applications), fuelled by growing computing power, emerging technology's diminishing cost and the data explosion. In 2018, RegTech investment reached the amount of US $2 billion and is forecasted to exceed $ 76 billion by 2022. RegTech provides senior executives with an opportunity to introduce new capabilities that are designed to leverage existing systems and data to produce regulatory data and reporting in a cost-effective, flexible and timely manner without taking the risk of replacing / updating legacy systems. Having said this, my intention today is to focus on the regulatory challenges surrounding FinTech and how to close the regulatory gap I mentioned earlier.</p><p>2.2 FinTech landscape</p><p>The global FinTech landscape can be mapped across eight distinct categories: payments, insurance, financial planning, lending and crowdfunding, blockchain, trading and investment, data and analytics, and cybersecurity (see Chart 1).</p><p>Graph omitted (The document can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/Speeches/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=580&amp;List;_ID=b2e9402e-db05-4166-9f09-e1b26a1c6f1b\">https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/Speeches/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=580&amp;List;_ID=b2e9402e-db05-4166-9f09-e1b26a1c6f1b</url>)</p><p>In more detail, blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology or DLT, became widely known as the technology that underlies Bitcoin, which holds 60% of the cryptocurrency market. Of course, numerous potential applications of DLT to financial services other than digital currencies are lately becoming apparent such as robo-advice and peer-to-peer insurance.</p><p>Another category in the FinTech landscape is data &amp; analytics. As you know, advances in digital technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data have greatly increased the usability of advanced analytics in the financial services sector. This development can lead to better suited products and services, but it also poses the question whether a limit should be put on the profiling of individuals. In this respect, the expanded availability and broader use of consumer data raises issues relating to data ownership and data usage and their implications for consumer privacy. A small digression on AI may be in order here. It is said that the world's most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data and AI has the capability to unlock and leverage data, transforming our lives. I don't have to mention the list of world \"firsts\" AI has already achieved. AI ferryboats, AI hearing aids, aI toothbrush, AI ski instructor, financial reports, video games, etc. and in the near future autonomous driving which e.g. could reshape the trucking industry, resulting in fewer accidents, smart cities with less pollution and energy usage, smart farms with better quality products and so on.</p><p>A final category in the FinTech landscape is cybersecurity. While increased reliance on digital technology may heighten the risk of cybersecurity being compromised, digital technology also presents numerous opportunities to improve security of digital financial services. Data encryption to protect digitally stored data is improving with technological advances. Data analytics can be used to detect irregular patterns and fraud. DLT could increase the transparency of transactions, making them easier to track and control, improving Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.</p><p>3. A look into the rise of FinTech in the EU</p><p>Over the last couple of years, global FinTech investment activity has been recording robust growth. While in 2012 total investment in this sector was less than US $12 billion, in 2018 global investment in FinTech companies reached approximately US $112 billion (with 2,200 deals), more than double its 2017 level of around US $51 billion (as you can see in Chart 2). Moreover, 2018 was a year in which Fintech investment, including Venture Capitals (VC), Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) and Private Equities (PE), recorded a series of peaks. Emerging Fintech subsectors have seen the number of new startups rise rapidly, while highly mature sectors such as payments experienced a certain degree of consolidation.</p><p>Chart 2 Global investment and banks' activity in FinTech</p><p>Graph omitted (The document can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/Speeches/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=580&amp;List;_ID=b2e9402e-db05-4166-9f09-e1b26a1c6f1b\">https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/Speeches/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=580&amp;List;_ID=b2e9402e-db05-4166-9f09-e1b26a1c6f1b</url>)</p><p>The US and Silicon Valley remain the world's biggest hubs for FinTech companies and have the lion's share in terms of financing. In 2018, US FinTech investment reached US $55 billion across 1,245 deals. Europe's FinTech sector has been catching up with US FinTech investment growth, with investment following an upward path since 2008, having reached US $34 billion with 536 deals in 2018, driven by big mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) (see Chart 3). Venture Capital investment remains high in Europe and in 2018, it attracted the second largest amount ever of VC investment in FinTech.</p><p>Chart 3 Total investment activity (VC, PE and M&amp;A) in FinTech in Europe (2013-2018)</p><p>Graph omitted (The document can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/Speeches/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=580&amp;List;_ID=b2e9402e-db05-4166-9f09-e1b26a1c6f1b\">https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/Speeches/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=580&amp;List;_ID=b2e9402e-db05-4166-9f09-e1b26a1c6f1b</url>)</p><p>Despite concerns about Brexit, the UK remained a leader in FinTech in 2018 (see Chart 4 for the number of companies established in individual EU countries). The UK accounts for half of the region's top VC deals, with last year's total investment activity amounting to US $21 billion. Throughout 2018, the UK government continued to build FinTech bridges with other jurisdictions, so as to reduce regulatory barriers and support growth in a post-Brexit world. Ireland saw increasing interest from global FinTech companies and financial institutions, spurred by Brexit-related concerns. More precisely, 55 FinTech or financial services companies opted for establishment in Ireland last year, and their move is expected to bring more than 4,500 new jobs to the country (IDA, Ireland). Around 50 applications for authorization were submitted to the Central Bank of Ireland by year-end covering almost the entire spectrum of financial services including banking, insurance, asset management and payments. Multinational companies seem to be concerned about a no-deal Brexit and these moves in 2018 suggest their efforts to mitigate its impact.</p><p>Chart 4 Fintech sector development across European Union</p><p>Graph omitted (The document can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/Speeches/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=580&amp;List;_ID=b2e9402e-db05-4166-9f09-e1b26a1c6f1b\">https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/Speeches/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=580&amp;List;_ID=b2e9402e-db05-4166-9f09-e1b26a1c6f1b</url>)</p><p>This year, we are expecting more FinTech consolidation driven both by FinTech companies looking to buy in order to achieve greater scale and by conventional banks looking to buy FinTech in order to drive their own strategic objectives. Over the next few quarters, Fintech activity is expected to rise in terms of open banking, RegTech, the acquisition of FinTech by banks, insurance tech, and the creation of start-ups, given that Europe offers a start-up friendly regulatory environment that encourages young entrepreneurs to experiment with innovative FinTech services.</p><p>4. FinTech's impact upon and interaction with the conventional financial system and monetary policy transmission mechanism</p><p>But what is FinTech's estimated impact of and interaction with the conventional financial system? All the above developments of the financial technology infrastructure have non-negligible implications. Therefore, it is interesting to briefly discuss the main effects of FinTech revolutions on customers, competition among market players and, overall, the financial industry's operation and structure.</p><p>Currently, five main drivers appear to be shaping and are expected to bring changes to the established financial sector:</p><p>The first driver is reduction of information asymmetry. The ability of new technology to capture and process a high amount of data in real time is improving the price discovery mechanism in several areas of the financial system such as the credit gap between borrowers and lenders, to the extent that clients' information history becomes more transparent, improving borrower's behaviour through competition and resilience.</p><p>The second driver is improvement of Communication Efficacy and the third is supporting lending for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The fourth is supporting a sharing economy: Fintech facilitates sharing economy through digital platforms that enable the matching of buyers and sellers. Finally, the fifth driver is increasing financial inclusion. In other words, the sustainable provision of affordable financial services (mainly bank accounts) to more vulnerable people with limited economic means, as well as population groups living in underdeveloped areas and countries.</p><p>Last but not least, in terms of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy (this is the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy), FinTech has the potential to alter some of the transmission channels, thus affecting economic variables and inflation, mainly through two channels, firstly, the credit channel and secondly, the bank lending channel. On the one hand, an expansion of FinTech firms in the credit market could alter the functioning of the credit channel, mainly through softening information asymmetries in the credit market, when pricing borrower's risk. On the other hand, FinTech companies have the potential to affect the pass-through of monetary policy to bank lending rates. In 2018, in the US the overall loans originated via alternative lending platforms reached about 5% of the value of newly issued consumer credit. Worldwide, the total value of transactions through alternative lending platforms climbed to an amount of US $196 billion, expected to grow by an annual rate of 10.7% in the period between 2019-2023, resulting in a total amount of $363 billion (Statista, 2018). China, and, to a minor extent, the US and Europe, fuelled the expansion of alternative lending, accounting for around 93% of the total value of transactions in 2018. The increasing importance of FinTech firms could threaten the informational content of money aggregates and credit supply, lessening potentially the ability of central banks to gather reliable information for conducting monetary policy and also affecting the interest rate pass-through.</p><p>5. Regulating FinTech</p><p>5.1 Risks from a regulatory point of view</p><p>Regulators and supervisors need to follow market developments to understand how the emergence of new players, infrastructures, products and distribution channels is going to transform the financial system. In this regard, a significant proportion of EU FinTech companies is not subject to any regulatory regime (31%) or is only subject to a national authorisation or registration regime (14%). From a prudential and regulatory point of view, I will try to briefly summarise the associated risks by order of importance:</p><p>First, risks arise when automating customer and investment services as competition becomes stronger with the entrance of new firms into the financial sector. The challenge for regulation is to keep a level-playing field between existing and new companies which promotes innovation and fosters competition, and, at the same time, preserves financial stability. In this context, since January 2018, the application of PSD2 (1)  and the related set of guidelines and technical standards for the security of payment and investment services in the EU facilitate innovation, and efficiency preventing regulatory arbitrage and promoting equal competition. Furthermore, while a number of new propositions on automated investment recommendations have been launched in the recent years using extensively algorithms not many have been identified as offering automated investment advice in the context of MiFID/MiFID II.</p><p>Second, FinTech growth increases the financial system's susceptibility operational and cyber risks. Higher reliance on third-party provision of services - such as communications and cloud storing - could entail higher operational risks. As far as cyber risks are concerned, as the technological systems of financial institutions are more interconnected, there are more possible entry points for potential attacks with more significant consequences. Finally, information use and storage by FinTechs raises important data privacy and security issues.</p><p>Third, the issue of risk misallocation arises here, because micro-transactions provide a layer of diversification, credit risk from the borrower to the creditor still passes through under-regulated and under-controlled channels compared to conventional financial services. The first principle of risk management applies to all banks, but also to high-flying FinTech companies: \"if you owe 1 dollar to your lender, it's your debt, if you owe 1 million, then it's the lender's problem\"! For example, Ye'e Bao (translated as 'hidden treasure'), associated with the biggest Chinese online retailer, is in practice the largest money market fund in the world, whose assets under management are worth close to US $265 billion, but the regulations affecting dedicated money market funds are not entirely binding Ye'e Bao, as it is not owned by, and does not legally constitute, a financial institution.</p><p>Fourth, another major issue in the debate regarding FinTech revolves around the risks it entails in terms of increasing financial discrimination through the extensive use of algorithms based on consumers' demographic and personal information available online (collected by big tech companies) and, as a result, having the potential to give rise to greater income inequality. With the expansion of FinTech, it may become even harder for population groups of lower income, ethnic minority background, younger age, women or people with disabilities, etc. may be discriminated against in terms of consumer finance, so that only those financially better off, i.e. the richer ones, are chosen to have access to loans, investment products, etc.</p><p>Unlike regulated banks, FinTech companies are not subject to strict rules on consumer protection, e.g. to compensate consumers, offer deposit insurance and meet standards in order to prevent misleading vulnerable consumers into buying unsuitable or harmful financial products. We, therefore, need to pay particular attention to the risk that those who trust FinTech products lacking such a safety net are currently running, by relying on big FinTech providers to regulate themselves.</p><p>5.2 Existing regulatory framework in the US and the EU</p><p>Taking stock of the existing US and EU regulatory framework, it should be pointed out that there is no singular regulatory framework for FinTech companies. In the US, Fintech companies are generally regulated at the state level. For example, many states have enacted legislation governing the extension of credit and money transmission in their jurisdictions, combined with licensing requirements for such activities. Similarly, in the EU, Fintech companies operate under passportable licenses. In the EU, certain services provided by FinTech companies, such as retail banking, payment services and financial market services, are subject to the pan-European 'passporting' regime: a company licensed in one EU Member State (home state) may provide such services in another EU Member State (host state), e.g. via a local branch, using its home-state license as a sort of \"European passport\". Moreover, in both the United States and the EU, cybersecurity-related regulations and Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CFT) regulations apply to FinTech companies.</p><p>We may argue that the EU has expanded the scope of its rules to include services that EU FinTech companies offer to consumers. Moreover, the European Banking Authority (EBA) recognises the benefit in protecting consumers when they use financial services offered by firms outside the conventional financial services sector. It recommends defining consumers' rights in the FinTech space, creating effective procedures for processing consumer complaints, improving the quality of disclosures to consumers in a digital environment, and increasing consumer financial literacy. In light of the potentially inconsistent regulatory regimes to which EU FinTech companies are subject, the European Commission published last year an action plan for the implementation of an EU-wide framework dedicated to FinTech companies aimed at \"a more competitive and innovative European financial sector\". The Commission's Action Plan proposes 23 steps to enable innovative business models to scale up and support the uptake of new technologies, and to enhance cybersecurity and the integrity of the financial system, including an EU Fintech Laboratory where European and national authorities will engage with technology providers and an EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum, which will report on the challenges and opportunities of crypto-assets.</p><p>5.3 Filling in the regulatory gap</p><p>From the aforementioned regulatory frameworks, we all agree that risks related to regulation and compliance arise from FinTech's rapid growth and it is reasonable to expect that new or evolving risks will emerge for the system and for individual institutions.</p><p>It appears that the main challenge is to implement legislation governing FinTech companies in order to protect users and markets, while offering an environment favourable to growth. In the context of financial regulation, it is of utmost importance to strike a balance between the following three fundamental elements:</p><p>1. Manage the trade-off between efficiency gains associated with technological innovation and the protection of stakeholders in the financial industry. On the one hand, regulation must not be too stringent to the point it preempts the creation and development of new technologies that generate efficiency and savings in transaction costs; on the other hand, regulation must not be too lax, so as to make sure that investors and users of financial services are adequately protected and that regulatory frameworks are continuously adapting to technological advances, rather than falling behind the curve.</p><p>2. Ensure an adequate regulatory level playing field for banks and FinTechs, fundamental to achieve appropriate competition. First, activities involving the same risks in terms of financial stability, consumer protection and the integrity of the financial system should receive the same regulatory treatment (this is the number one principle or regulation). Therefore, any difference in regulation and supervision should be based on the risks posed by different products and services. Second, there should not be unnecessary barriers to competition in the market beyond those justified by risk considerations. In relation to this, authorities should further assess the implications of prudential regulation, which often leaves banks in a situation of competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other players, and work towards eliminating existing loopholes in regulatory frameworks.</p><p>3. Given the global dimension of most technological innovations and the increased interconnectedness of the financial system, regulatory frameworks need to be internationally co-ordinated and upgraded. The work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and other international standard-setting bodies (SSBs) will be crucial in this endeavour. However, as pointed out by the FSB, regulatory and supervisory approaches to FinTech are becoming increasingly fragmented, undermining the effectiveness of financial institutions' efforts to address the ensuing risks. We, first of all, need to determine the legitimate uses and purposes of FinTech innovations and then define guiding principles at global level that serve to avoid fragmentation across countries' regulatory approaches. In other words, we do not want to overregulate. We must first see whether there is a fundamental economic case for regulating specific products/functions (which, in some cases, might ultimately be proven useless) and then regulate in a coordinated manner.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>In closing, we are at the beginning of the \"fourth industrial revolution\", which is transforming the way we live, work and interact. As the FinTech sector grows, it is important that all parties involved not only pay close attention to technical, regulatory, policy, and legal considerations, but also monitor its growth and better understand its impact.</p><p>Regulatory trends become increasingly complex and regulators demand ever larger amounts of granular data from firms, as a result, there is substantial scope for big data analytics and machine learning to help both market participants follow regulatory and compliance requirements and supervisory authorities assess compliance and measure risk. One thing is for sure: no matter what, human intervention to provide a final arbitration will always be required!</p><p>One final comment, with my professorial hat: More generally and in more philosophical terms, as new technologies evolve and become more accessible, naturally more ethical issues will arise, but I believe the foundation on which everything must be built is quite simple: putting humans and their needs first. Plato the famous ancient Greek philosopher who lived in Athens 2,500 years ago said: the purpose of humanity is to obtain knowledge. In today's world this could be translated as follows: knowledge for innovation to improve the human condition. The symbiotic relationship between human creativity and computational creativity is still in its infancy. Ultimately, the question is not about what new technologies can create, but rather what humans can create with new technologies to empower the future of humanity.</p><p>Thank you for your attention!</p><p>Source: Bank of Greece</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INBNWS-0046890232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INBNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNW-XKX1-DXMP-K2G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4031\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Banking News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002275</classCode><className>CITIGROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009SYG</classCode><className>WESTERN UNION CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>CORNELL UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE &amp;

As he puts together mandate letters to define expectations for his ministers, here is our own letter-writing attempt with a few suggestions for the finance minister.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dear Minister,</p><p>Congratulations on becoming Canada's finance minister.</p><p>In our platform, we promised Canadians that we would bolster the middle class and help make lives more affordable. As minister of finance, you will be at the front and centre of those policies.</p><p>Implied in our platform is a commitment to maintain a fiscally responsible path that stabilizes the economy, encourages growth, ensures widespread prosperity and protects our most vulnerable - even as the global economy becomes more uncertain and influential.</p><p>Your top priority will be to ensure the disruption that is mounting all around us - in the global economy, in the domestic workforce and in our politics on Parliament Hill - works to the benefit of Canadians and is a source of opportunity, prosperity and confidence rather than anxiety and harm.</p><p>To that end, here are five areas to work on (in collaboration, of course, with the other political parties).</p><p>Stable finances</p><p>In the months leading up to the federal election campaign, our government made many new commitments for spending. We need to tally those promises up and immediately publish the state of the federal government's books, while also accounting for newly downgraded forecasts for economic growth.</p><p>Once the baseline is established, you need to determine a fiscal track that sets out clear parameters for spending and deficits and prepares Canada to deal with a downturn or even a recession brought on by trade wars and protectionism. Now that interest rates are at historic lows and the central bank has limited scope to confront a slump, the impetus will be on fiscal policy.</p><p>We should be ready with ideas to make sure any stimulus efforts go straight into the hands of people who will spend it on what the country needs. Our social programs provide some automatic support for the vulnerable, but should be reconsidered to reach more people more quickly. You should also put some serious thought into orienting stimulus spending toward dealing with climate change - be it disaster mitigation, home retrofitting or research and development.</p><p>Equalization</p><p>Alberta and Saskatchewan are struggling to deal with the fallout of low oil prices and a hampered ability to take their exports to market. They have asked for a rethink of equalization and specifically mentioned the fiscal stabilization fund - meant to supplement equalization payments by targeting sudden downturns in individual provinces. The cap on the fund should be lifted and the formula updated to reflect inflation, with an eye to backdating payments for Alberta and Saskatchewan. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has estimated the amount to be $1.7 billion for the 2015-17 slump in that province.</p><p>Changing the equalization formula itself, however, is something the federal government should consider only if all provinces are onside.</p><p>As finance minister, you should prioritize concrete action on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, negotiating a stake for First Nations business interests and moving to a full sale of the pipeline when market conditions are ripe.</p><p>Tax</p><p>Our election platform committed to cutting income taxes for everyone except the rich - a commitment that should be the first order of business, especially since Conservative support could help with easy passage through the House of Commons. The same could be said for other tax incentives and benefits that were promised - for clean tech, for new parents, for daycare, for students.</p><p>Quick action should also be taken on raising taxes in well-defined areas: luxury goods, real estate speculation and a new tax on Big Tech companies that make money here.</p><p>Our platform committed to closing corporate tax loopholes and we trust the finance minister to pursue these loopholes with courage and speed so that we have some extra money to offset the cost of tax cuts.</p><p>Climate</p><p>The carbon tax is here to stay and you must ensure that it remains close to revenue neutral.</p><p>To meet our climate commitments, much more needs to be done and the finance minister is perfectly placed to work with financial markets and large corporations to amplify their efforts in sustainable finance. You should develop incentives for companies to reduce their emissions and support efforts that market Canada's expertise in low-carbon financing and sustainable energy. We can develop a competitive advantage here.</p><p>You should work closely with regulators and the Bank of Canada to make sure corporations have completely disclosed their financial exposure to a warming climate, taking steps toward mandatory disclosure unless financial markets force the issue. The risk to the Canadian economy is hard to quantify and disclosure is a first step to grappling with it.</p><p>Economy of the future</p><p>Canada is not as competitive as it could be when it comes to using its intellectual property and technology to make money. We need to start work immediately on a strategy that pinpoints action on developing a savvy workforce, protecting intellectual property for the benefit of Canada First, and marketing our advantage to attract investment and generate sales.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Twitter: @hscoffield</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019111556332922</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH8-3Y21-DY91-K4HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

Duarte continued: With news of the Chinese government starting to ease regulations that would allow domestic money to flow out from China, it's a good idea to keep an eye on money flows into the Chinese market. FXI is a good way to do that. </p><p>And at this point, it shows no evidence of major money flows out from the Chinese stock market. That's not to say that it's not happening, though, as FXI is a good measure of foreign money. The Chinese market itself has been volatile of late, but has recovered from its March swoon. Duarte s conclusion: The FXI chart, though, suggests that the money flowing into China has to make a decision in the next few days to weeks, as the 115 area, where FXI closed on 5-17, is just about where the fund topped out in January, before starting a 20 plus percent decline. In other words, we could be looking at a major double top. The next question, then, is where will the money that flows out of China work its way? Is a big tech rally coming?

And big banks will never innovate fast enough to keep up with disruption in the marketplace, so they need fintech and big tech. Even so, these players are potential competition and they're collecting a lot of data on your customers - while also drawing more attention to their own platforms.</p><p>So what's your strategy? Are you going to try to be a competing platform? Are you going to participate in a platform that somebody else owns? If so, what toll are you going to have to pay for transactions? What will that do to your margins? And like the talent sphere, there's a host of regulatory issues around third-party vendors - how can you even make teaming work? Figuring out the answers here sooner rather than later is paramount.</p><p>Operating with a purpose</p><p>With the financial crisis in the rearview mirror, bad actors and bad headlines are no longer the dominant narrative surrounding the industry. Now banks are thinking more about what kind of role they will play in society.</p><p>It may be tough for the public to believe a bank would undergo this kind of soul-searching. But like many other companies today, financial institutions want to imbue their operations with purpose. This is about more than following regulations or profit. This entails a well-defined set of behavioral aspirations for both internal and external practices that give stakeholders - employees, customers and investors - a standard by which to measure their own actions and the actions of the organization.</p><p>Take financial inclusion and sustainability. A statement of purpose can guide an institution's services in a way that promotes wider access and avoids practices that may harm customers or society (think predatory lending). It can also embed sustainable practices into operational decisions and investments.</p><p>Just as important, a purpose-driven organization is where today's workers want to be. The idea that their work is contributing to the positive role a financial institution can play in society is a strong motivator in the current job market. In short, the more banks work to leave the image of soullessness behind, the better it will be for them all the way around.</p><p>Bob Contri is the global financial services leader for Deloitte.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USBANK-226794-3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USBANK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBF-81G1-F06X-W005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8066</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

It is unclear, for now, how much each will benefit.</p><p>Twitter is taking advantage of new rules to start its initial public offering (IPO) under the radar. But as with Facebook, the last big tech IPO, the tech establishment looks set to make a killing. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/31/facebook-shares-soar-advertising-revenue-mobile\">The Facebook share sale proved controversial and costly</url> as early investors cashed out, ahead of an embarrassing collapse in the share price. Twitter will no doubt be keen to avoid the same mistake.</p><p>If the sale goes smoothly, Twitter could come to market at the end of this year and be worth as much $15bn, according to PrivCo, which gathers information on private companies.</p><p>\"Twitter will learn from Facebook's flawed playbook and do the opposite,\" said PrivCo's chief executive, Sam Hamadeh. \"Unlike Facebook, which waited too long to IPO (until its growth rate decelerated), Twitter will IPO at just the right inflection point: while revenue grows in triple digits.\"</p><p>Twitter has told staff that it is sometimes profitable but it is likely that the company is still loss-making most of the time. The company is spending to drive growth. Earlier this week it paid a reported $300m for MoPub, a mobile ad technology firm, the eighth company it has acquired this year.</p><p>Going public will give Twitter another currency, its shares, with which to finance new deals. But how much money it will raise, and how much money it is making, remains a mystery. Twitter has filed for a confidential initial public offering under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. The act allows Twitter to consult privately with regulators ahead of the share sale, outside the glare of publicity the IPO would otherwise receive.</p><p>PrivCo believes the float will be \"conservatively priced\" at 20 to 30 times revenue. With 2013 revenues expected to exceed $500m, this would make Twitter worth between $10bn and $15bn.</p><p>Alan Patrick, founder of the Broadsight consultancy, said that at $14bn Twitter was valuing its users at about $58 each, about half the ratio Facebook had at its IPO. \"Yes it's hyped but it's not as stupidly hyped as Facebook was,\" he said.</p><p>Patrick added that there appeared to be plenty of room for growth at Twitter: \"I actually see Twitter as a communications system rather than a social network. I think there are other things that can be done with it. With 240m users there's more room to grow, whereas Facebook with one billion users had less room for growth.\"</p><p>Facebook has recovered from its disastrous IPO last May and its shares hit an all time high this week, driven up by positive signs for mobile revenues. This may be good news for Twitter, whose early forays into advertising have been a success, particularly on the increasingly important small screen of the smartphone. Twitter is expected to earn $582.8m in global ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer, before growing to nearly a billion in 2014. More than half of the company's ad revenues are expected to come from mobile ad revenue this year, both in the US and globally.</p><p>Patrick's one concern is management. Facebook put together a steely management team that has stood it in good stead as it fought back from its IPO pratfall. Twitter has, until recently, appeared somewhat less focused.</p><p>As the IPOs of Groupon, Zynga and Facebook have shown in recent years, hot tech companies do not necessarily make great share sales. It is too early to say whether Twitter's will be any different. But it will undoubtedly be one of the most closely watched IPO's for years - 140 characters at a time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-A417252219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59BN-DHV1-DYN2-3530-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies All Rights Reserved Registered in England and Wales.

When Facebook, Google, and Twitter testified before Congress last month, I told them that their anaemic response to the issue of online terror content is insulting.</p><p>\"They oversell the capabilities of artificial intelligence, they undersell the nature of the challenge, and they obscure the amount of resources they\"re devoting to fighting online terror content.\"</p><p>New York-based researcher Eric Feinberg has continually found copies of the clip on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram since the mosque massacres were streamed on Facebook Live on March 15 - and this morning located two further copies of raw Christchurch footage (one on Facebook and one on Instagram).</p><p>And while it says it will restrict people who have broken un-named \"certain rules\" from livestreaming, Facebook has resisted making blanket policy changes - such as Google-owned YouTube\"s move to restrict mobile livestreaming to people with 1000 followers or more (meaning someone who is banned from the service can\"t simply create a new account in a couple of minutes).</p><p>Congressman Rose says \"The Christchurch terrorist exploited the extraordinary power of social media to broadcast his message of violence and hate across the world.</p><p>\"As he brutally murdered 51 people and wounded 49 more in two mosques in New Zealand, his livestream on Facebook ran uninterrupted-and before it was ultimately pulled down from Facebook, it was quickly posted and shared millions of times across Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other platforms.</p><p>\"This is the new age of terrorism, defined by the rise of extremist communities online and terrorists who carry out real-life violence inspired by virtual content. And every time a successful terrorist attack is broadcasted online, it risks inspiring copycats attempting to unleash similar terror in their own communities.\"</p><p>The Jacinda Ardern-led Christchurch call conference in Paris saw big tech companies agree to collaborate on research to prevent and remove extremist content.</p><p>Facebook said it would collaborate with UC Berkeley and Cornell universities on a US7.5m project.</p><p>But that\"s a drop in the bucket for a company that made a $US22.1 billion net profit last year. And to return to Rose\"s lobbying point, the social network spent a reported US$4.1m on Washington lobbyists in the second quarter).</p><p>When grilled by Rose earlier this year, the big tech companies did point to a group that they created in 2017 to pool certain basic counterterrorism data that can be shared, called the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT).</p><p>\"The viral spread of the Christchurch video exposed the real limitations of GIFCT\"s skeletal consortium-a shoestring operation with no permanent staff, no shared location, and minimal technological and policy collaboration between the companies,\" Rose says.</p><p>\"This initial effort, unsurprisingly, has not lived up to its promise. It\"s time to start thinking about a newer model for more robust self-regulation and industry-wide cooperation to deal with the metastasising threat of terrorist content online.\"</p><p>This week, the big tech companies will be meeting in Silicon Valley to discuss the future of GIFCT.</p><p>\"Ahead of that much-needed conversation, and after what I have seen in my oversight role in Congress this year, I am urging that GIFCT be transformed,\" Rose says.</p><p>The New York Democrat wants GIFCT to get permanent staff who serve as dedicated points of contact for the companies and law enforcement.</p><p>He also wants GIFCT to move its operations into a shared physical location, \"as is done in the military and intelligence community, could help companies stay ahead of online terrorist activity.\"</p><p>In other words, he wants Facebook and its peers to transform GIFCT from a PR gimmick into a serious, real-life effort to counter hate content.</p><p>\"These are the wealthiest companies in the world. There\"s no reason they can\"t make serious investments in hiring more counterterrorism staff and build out an infrastructure for timely information sharing among the companies,\" Rose says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-12252201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMT-H401-DYTJ-62PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In an interview with CNN's 'Reliable Sources' on Sunday[1], Benioff ripped Facebook and again called for the social-network giant \u2014 which has been wracked by scandals in recent years \u2014 to be regulated or split up. </p><p>'They're certainly not exactly about truth in advertising,' he told CNN's Brian Stelter. 'Even they have said that. That's why we're really in squarely a crisis of trust, when the core vendor themselves cannot say that trust is our most important value. Look, we're at a moment in time where each one of us in every company has to ask a question: What is our highest value?' 'I expect a fundamental reconceptualization of what Facebook's role is in the world,' Benioff said. 'When you have an entity that large with that much potential impact, and not fundamentally doing good things to improve the state of the world, well, then I think everyone is going to have it in its crosshairs.' Read: Regulating Big Tech was mostly talk in 2019 \u2014 expect the same in 2020[2]  Benioff, a noted philanthropist and outspoken advocate of liberal causes, earlier this year urged fellow CEOs to become activists [3]to fix chronic problems such as income inequality, homelessness and climate change. Benioff said in Sunday's interview that he hopes Time magazine, which he bought in 2018, can be a 'a steward of trust' by fulfilling its journalistic duties.

That's what Facebook's  FB, +0.49%[1] co-founder and chief executive wrote in an op-ed published Sunday by The Financial Times[2]. Zuckerberg has previously called for more government regulation of internet companies, and reiterated his arguments in favor of laws covering four major areas: elections, harmful content, privacy and data portability. 'I don't think private companies should make so many decisions alone when they touch on fundamental democratic values,' he wrote, adding: 'We have to balance promoting innovation and research against protecting people's privacy and security.' </p><p>Zuckerberg warned that regulation could have 'unintended consequences, especially for small businesses that can't do sophisticated data analysis and marketing on their own.' 'If regulation makes it harder for them to share data and use these tools, that could disproportionately hurt them and inadvertently advantage larger companies that can,' he wrote. 'Still, rather than relying on individual companies to set their own standards, we'd benefit from a more democratic process.'  Zuckerberg is in Europe, where he spoke at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday and is scheduled to meet with the European Union's executive commission in Brussels on Monday. At his Munich appearance, Zuckerberg spoke about what type of regulation he envisioned: 'Right now there are two frameworks that I think people have for existing industries \u2014 there's like newspapers and existing media, and then there's the telco-type model, which is 'the data just flows through you', but you're not going to hold a telco responsible if someone says something harmful on a phone line. . . . I actually think where we should be is somewhere in between,' he said, according to Reuters[3]. Zuckerberg also said he would support plans for tech companies to pay more taxes [4]in Europe. 'We accept that may mean we have to pay more tax and pay it in different places under a new framework,' he said.The post Key Words: Mark Zuckerberg again calls for Big Tech to be regulated, even if it's bad for business[5] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[6].

That's what Facebook's  FB, +0.49%[1] co-founder and chief executive wrote in an op-ed published Sunday by The Financial Times[2]. Zuckerberg has previously called for more government regulation of internet companies, and reiterated his arguments in favor of laws covering four major areas: elections, harmful content, privacy and data portability. 'I don't think private companies should make so many decisions alone when they touch on fundamental democratic values,' he wrote, adding: 'We have to balance promoting innovation and research against protecting people's privacy and security.' </p><p>Zuckerberg warned that regulation could have 'unintended consequences, especially for small businesses that can't do sophisticated data analysis and marketing on their own.' 'If regulation makes it harder for them to share data and use these tools, that could disproportionately hurt them and inadvertently advantage larger companies that can,' he wrote. 'Still, rather than relying on individual companies to set their own standards, we'd benefit from a more democratic process.'  Zuckerberg is in Europe, where he spoke at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday and is scheduled to meet with the European Union's executive commission in Brussels on Monday. At his Munich appearance, Zuckerberg spoke about what type of regulation he envisioned: 'Right now there are two frameworks that I think people have for existing industries \u2014 there's like newspapers and existing media, and then there's the telco-type model, which is 'the data just flows through you', but you're not going to hold a telco responsible if someone says something harmful on a phone line. . . . I actually think where we should be is somewhere in between,' he said, according to Reuters[3]. Zuckerberg also said he would support plans for tech companies to pay more taxes [4]in Europe. 'We accept that may mean we have to pay more tax and pay it in different places under a new framework,' he said.The post Key Words: Mark Zuckerberg again calls for Big Tech to be regulated, even if it's bad for business[5] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[6].

'I think that they have been very abusive of the great opportunity that technology has given them,' she added. 'My thought about them is all they want is their tax cuts and no antitrust action against them, and they schmooze this administration in that regard, because so far that's what they have received.'  Pelosi also said the Silicon Valley company's executives 'have said very blatantly, very clearly that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people with money from God knows where.' Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Related: Congresswoman says Facebook's new 'deepfakes' policy is 'wholly inadequate'[2]  A raft of bills aimed at technology companies FDN, +1.04%[3] were introduced in Congress in 2019, addressing privacy, censorship, security, algorithms, children's issues, facial recognition and other matters.

And those grassroots Democratic activists last weekend rejected ...</p><p>THE BUZZ \u2014 BERNIE MOVEMENT REJECTS GAVIN: Bernie Sanders may not be the Democratic nominee, but his followers are flexing their muscle in California, where he handily won the March 3 primary. And those grassroots Democratic activists last weekend rejected Gavin Newsom when they voted to name who will lead them into this summer\u2019s Democratic National Convention.    Their choices: Rep. Ro Khanna of Silicon Valley, the most prominent and high profile backer of Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential run, along with Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland, an icon to the progressive crowd. And representing the more moderate wing of the party will be Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis, who served as secretary of labor during the Obama administration.      The grassroots decision to sidestep Newsom was a clear departure from tradition \u2014 and a signal that progressives who backed Sanders don\u2019t intend to be sidelined. Party insiders say Newsom \u2014 who endorsed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016, and Kamala Harris over Sanders in 2020 \u2014 wanted to lead the Democratic Party delegation of his state. But the California governor pulled out of the competition after groups like the California Nurses Association, still angered at what they saw as a backtrack on single-payer health care, and Sanders\u2019 own Our Revolution crowd made clear he wouldn\u2019t make the cut. After the vote, Newsom tweeted Sunday that \u201cCA Democrats have never been more energized, united and ready to elect our next President.\u201d    BERNIE BACKERS NOD FOR KHANNA AS MOVEMENT LEADER? The vote underscored Khanna\u2019s rise as a progressive wing leader to watch \u2014 and cements his role as the captain of the Bernie movement in California. The national co-chair of Sanders\u2019 campaign was a valued surrogate for the Vermont senator and helped deliver 46 of 52 districts for Sanders in the March 3 primary. He has galvanized progressive support with his active legislative record to curb the president\u2019s war powers and end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-lead war in Yemen, among other issues.    Khanna tells POLITICO that the support sends the message that \u201cCalifornia is leading the way\u201d on a score of issues that he\u2019s fought for, and which matter to progressive voters \u2014 including free public college, single payer, clean tech, rethinking military and police budgets, and criminal justice reform. \u201cThis is not a ceremonial role,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be pushing for a progressive agenda \u2026 and for a start to a new progressive era.\u201d    NOT YOUR FATHER\u2019S POLITICAL CONVENTION: Khanna acknowledges in the age of Covid-19, it is unlikely that any of the Democratic National Convention will be a traditional party get-together. And he\u2019s glad. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible what the GOP is doing,\u2019\u2019 holding a convection indoors with packed delegates and exposing them to coronavirus transmission, he said. \u201cPrudence and caution is what we need now.\u201d So he, Lee and Solis may miss that big TV moment of delivering California\u2019s delegates to Biden amid a big crowd and in front of the TV cameras. But \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cto do it on Zoom.\u201d    BUENOS D\u00cdAS, good Monday morning. Newsom\u2019s noon briefing today on Covid will likely cover his latest move \u2014 pushing for shutdowns of bars in a score of counties that are seeing alarming uptickes in coronavirus transmission.    QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cIf I was offered it? Of course I would .\u2026 But my focus is doing everything I can so that next January, we are relieved from going through what we\u2019ve been through in the last three and a half years.\u201d CA Rep. Karen Bass, asked by Fox 11\u2019s Elex Michaelson, if she would accept the VP slot should Joe Biden offer it.    TWEET OF THE DAY: USAF veteran @KimMangone, the Democrat running against House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u2014 \u201cHey @GOPLeader, your silence on Trump cozying up to Putin is an endorsement of Russia putting bounties on the lives of my brothers and sisters. And it\u2019s utterly indefensible.\u201d    WHERE\u2019S GAVIN? The governor will deliver his #NewsomAtNoon briefing with Covid-19 updates, streamed on Twitter @CAGovernor and Facebook California Governor websites.    CLOSING TIME \u2014 \u201cNewsom orders bars closed in Los Angeles and 6 other counties,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Kevin Yamamura and Carla Marinucci: \u201cSACRAMENTO \u2014 Gov.

OOPS! WRONG WILLIE: Reporter Joe Fitz Rodriguez of KQED reports that BET last night posted an in-memoriam \u201cfor the WRONG Willie Brown,\u2019\u2019 mistakenly suggesting former SF Mayor Willie L.

And those grassroots Democratic activists last weekend rejected ...</p><p>THE BUZZ \u2014 BERNIE MOVEMENT REJECTS GAVIN: Bernie Sanders may not be the Democratic nominee, but his followers are flexing their muscle in California, where he handily won the March 3 primary. And those grassroots Democratic activists last weekend rejected Gavin Newsom when they voted to name who will lead them into this summer\u2019s Democratic National Convention.   Their choices: Rep. Ro Khanna of Silicon Valley, the most prominent and high profile backer of Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential run, along with Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland, an icon to the progressive crowd. And representing the more moderate wing of the party will be Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis, who served as secretary of labor during the Obama administration.   The grassroots decision to sidestep Newsom was a clear departure from tradition \u2014 and a signal that progressives who backed Sanders don\u2019t intend to be sidelined. Party insiders say Newsom \u2014 who endorsed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016, and Kamala Harris over Sanders in 2020 \u2014 wanted to lead the Democratic Party delegation of his state. But the California governor pulled out of the competition after groups like the California Nurses Association, still angered at what they saw as a backtrack on single-payer health care, and Sanders\u2019 own Our Revolution crowd made clear he wouldn\u2019t make the cut. After the vote, Newsom tweeted Sunday that \u201cCA Democrats have never been more energized, united and ready to elect our next President.\u201d   BERNIE BACKERS NOD FOR KHANNA AS MOVEMENT LEADER? The vote underscored Khanna\u2019s rise as a progressive wing leader to watch \u2014 and cements his role as the captain of the Bernie movement in California. The national co-chair of Sanders\u2019 campaign was a valued surrogate for the Vermont senator and helped deliver 46 of 52 districts for Sanders in the March 3 primary. He has galvanized progressive support with his active legislative record to curb the president\u2019s war powers and end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-lead war in Yemen, among other issues.   Khanna tells POLITICO that the support sends the message that \u201cCalifornia is leading the way\u201d on a score of issues that he\u2019s fought for, and which matter to progressive voters \u2014 including free public college, single payer, clean tech, rethinking military and police budgets, and criminal justice reform. \u201cThis is not a ceremonial role,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be pushing for a progressive agenda ... and for a start to a new progressive era.\u201d   NOT YOUR FATHER\u2019S POLITICAL CONVENTION: Khanna acknowledges in the age of Covid-19, it is unlikely that any of the Democratic National Convention will be a traditional party get-together. And he\u2019s glad. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible what the GOP is doing,\u2019\u2019 holding a convection indoors with packed delegates and exposing them to coronavirus transmission, he said. \u201cPrudence and caution is what we need now.\u201d So he, Lee and Solis may miss that big TV moment of delivering California\u2019s delegates to Biden amid a big crowd and in front of the TV cameras. But \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cto do it on Zoom.\u201d   BUENOS D\u00cdAS, good Monday morning. Newsom\u2019s noon briefing today on Covid will likely cover his latest move \u2014 pushing for shutdowns of bars in a score of counties that are seeing alarming uptickes in coronavirus transmission.   QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cIf I was offered it? Of course I would .\u2026 But my focus is doing everything I can so that next January, we are relieved from going through what we\u2019ve been through in the last three and a half years.\u201d CA Rep. Karen Bass, asked by Fox 11\u2019s Elex Michaelson, if she would accept the VP slot should Joe Biden offer it.   TWEET OF THE DAY: USAF veteran @KimMangone, the Democrat running against House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u2014 \u201cHey @GOPLeader, your silence on Trump cozying up to Putin is an endorsement of Russia putting bounties on the lives of my brothers and sisters. And it\u2019s utterly indefensible.\u201d   WHERE\u2019S GAVIN? The governor will deliver his #NewsomAtNoon briefing with Covid-19 updates, streamed on Twitter @CAGovernor and Facebook California Governor websites.

That's a big mandate, but it's nothing compared to the innovative ride-sharing firm he's decided to take on. Three and a half million Londoners regularly use Uber. That is more than twice as many people who voted for Mr Khan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's this mistaken idea that democracy is simply ticking a box every four years. It's not.

Last year Uber was threatened with a new wait-time regulation: 200,000 people signed that petition.</p><p>At the time of writing, Uber's petition to stay in London is at over 230,000 signatures and increasing by 250 every couple of seconds.</p><p>Opinion surveys are another. Polling firms rake in millions from newspapers, political parties and businesses with the promise of finding out what the public thinks.</p><p>But the lesson of Brexit, Trump and Corbyn is that people often say one thing and do another. But, there is a better way to work out what voters really want: check their bank statements.</p><p>And if you check the monthly bank statement of the average Londoner, you'll see with over a million trips each week that they've cast their sterling votes for Uber and not black cabs.</p><p>And it's easy to see why. Uber offers a substantially cheaper service, payment by card and shorter waittimes.</p><p>TfL have censured Uber on the grounds of safety, in particular focusing on the reporting of sexual assaults. That's a serious issue, but TfL should listen to the women who will always opt for an Uber late at night. Shorter waiting times mean that long walks in search of a main road to hail a cab are no longer necessary, and with every trip logged and tracked by GPS female passengers feel safer.</p><p>Others like the GMB union attack Uber for supposedly exploiting its 40,000 strong force of drivers. They argue that Uber drivers are being denied basic workers' rights like sick pay, holiday leave, and the minimum wage. But, Uber drivers are free to work for other providers, they choose their own hours, and when they were polled last year 80pc said they wouldn't trade additional workers' rights for a reduction in flexibility.</p><p>Yet, the strongest evidence is that so many drivers stick with Uber, in the face of aggressive competition from rival apps and private-hire firms.</p><p>Political thinkers often worry that big tech firms such as Amazon, Google and Facebook have become more powerful than governments. They've got it backwards.</p><p>The reason that Facebook refuses the Government's attempts to decrypt WhatsApp messages isn't because Facebook is all powerful, but because, after the NSA leaks, consumers demand it. In this era, it's the consumer that is sovereign.</p><p>For many of Uber's 3.5m users, today will be a political awakening. Consumers have become used to a world where companies like Airbnb, Amazon and Uber are free to operate unencumbered by big government. Mr Khan's announcement has changed that.</p><p>After the EU referendum, <person><nameText>Sadiq Khan </nameText></person>has passionately argued for a modern, open London.

That proof of market demand, early cash and leap of faith, was enough for the company to develop the product, which its supporters will get, exactly as intended.\"</p><p>Rose, CEO of Gust Inc., suggests it's revisionist history for any Kickstarter funder to conflate their own donation with an investment. At best, it was a purchase: an Oculus Rift development kit in appreciation for the donation.</p><p>\"Do you expect to own a piece of Amazon just because you bought a book from them?\" Rose asked rhetorically. \"Or are you entitled to a percentage of an artist's lifetime earnings, just because you bought a painting from her when she was starving on a sidewalk?\"</p><p>However, the lack of logical or legal basis to complain doesn't mean funders won't think twice about donating in the future, said Michael Schwamm, a corporate lawyer who advises early-stage companies. He thinks future Kickstarter campaigns will be scrutinized more closely by would-be funders who suspect a project could get backing elsewhere, or suspect it might not be the passion project it purports to be.</p><p>\"I would never kickstart a Google project or a Facebook project, and that's effectively what happened in this case,\" said Schwamm, a partner at Duane Morris LLP in Times Square.</p><p>Then again, startups could never promise to not sell a company in the future, and they're prohibited by law to promise equity in exchange for dollars on Kickstarter.</p><p>\"It's going to be interesting how it plays out, but I really do think this is going to be a landscape changer for some companies,\" Schwamm told me.</p><p>The easy answer to all this could be the new SEC rules governing true crowdfunding - the&amp;nbsp; <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/02/28/crowdfunding-rule-comments-under-sec-review/\">long-stalled regulations</url> that will lay out a legal framework for actual equity-based investments at the level Kickstarter operates.&amp;nbsp;</p><p>\"While the expectations right now ARE set outright, meaning you get X for Y, I think it would be an even greater story if a bunch of folks that contributed to this idea would have been involved in the exit money,\" said Anthony Onesto, a Staten Island digital business advisor. \"It truly democratizes fund raising to the average person with a potential return greater than just obtaining the product.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?
