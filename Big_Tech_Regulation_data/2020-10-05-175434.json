The report looks at the investment landscape, clinical evidence, and regulatory environment for VHAs, and also explores end-user feedback and case studies looking at both the positives and negatives of VHAs. This report is a go-to resource to understand and build individuals knowledge of the burgeoning virtual health assistant space in healthcare. </p><p> Commercial models are still nascent, the technology (AI) is premature, clinical evidence is sparse, integration into existing EMRs/health records is incomplete, and data security concerns exist. Despite all of this we explore if AI assistants rise above being \"second-class concierge\".  In the virtual+ AI combination space, think of reduced admin burden for HCPs, think of reduced consultation time and outpatient clinic time, think of an informed and engaged patient in control of their health and disease, think of a hospital whose beds are not full, think of an insurance plan that you understand clearly.

As Facebook's plan for its Libra[1] 'stablecoin' faces scrutiny[2], a global body of regulators from the world's main financial centers said that Big Tech's growing tentacles raised questions for financial stability, competition and data privacy. </p><p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) called in a report released on Sunday for 'vigilant monitoring' of Big Tech's shift into financial services, which it said could crimp the ability of banks to generate capital through retained profits. While still only 'nascent' in most countries, Big Tech in countries like China has brought financial services within reach of underserved communities, the FSB, which is chaired by Federal Reserve Governor Randal Quarles, said in the report. The FSB said players including Microsoft, Amazon, eBay, Baidu, Apple, Facebook and Tencent, have massive databases, while some offer asset management, payments and lending. Many Big Tech firms like Amazon, Facebook, eBay, Alipay and Google have acquired payments-related licenses in European Union countries including Luxembourg, Ireland and Lithuania, although most have not yet built up any big volumes. Banks in Europe and elsewhere are already required to share customer data with third party 'fintech' companies that want to offer rival payments services, and this may need to be the case with Big Tech too, the FSB said. 'Big Tech firms' ability to leverage customer data raises the question of whether - and the degree to which - authorities could consider the potential to promote the mobility of data between the various actors that are involved in the provision of financial services,' the FSB said. 'Doing so may help encourage competition and help ensure a level playing field amongst market participants.' Regulators may also need to replicate their approach to insurers and asset managers by focusing on 'activities that have implications for financial stability' rather than a focus solely on the size of the firm, the FSB said.

biggest news agencies accusing <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Facebook of plundering news for free that is producing great cost by press publishers and news agencies statement from the CEO's of 20 news agencies which major suppliers of news photos and video say that Facebook had reported revenues of 40 billion dollars in 2017 whilst <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>which owns YouTube had sales of 100 and 10 billion dollars last year on Wednesday European politicians are due to vote on updating copyright laws in the EU although an earlier draft was rejected back in July the US tech firms though oppose the planned regulations well Let's talk about this next few minutes our Paris studio is withdrawn by Phil Chetwynd whose global editor in chief of the French news agency AFP from Strasbourg by the German MEP Julia better who represents the pirate party which calls for internet freedom and accessibility Thanks both of you for being here with this set filled you first of all why you are part of this push for a law change I think what we have to understand this push comes at a time the context of the last 10 years of just massive job losses in both European and American another media around the world they see the big technology companies have captured the global digital advertising market and there's really nothing left for everybody underneath the copyright legislation as it stands dates back 20 years and this is pre social media previous smartphone It's clear that our digital environment is as totally changed since then and therefore there's obviously need to modernise legislation that that really is out of date Julia memory for a handout from welcomes some issues in that film but just that they are Julia what is wrong with the approach Out by Phil I think the analysis is correct that indeed newspapers are suffering from the decline in advertising revenues because of the power of <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Facebook in that market I think where is wrong in is thinking that copyright can fix that because actually news articles are already protected by copyright and if the platform is using those articles without paying for it that's are any copyright infringement adding new layer of copyright protection is not going to change their basic facts what is actually heard the newspapers is the use of personal data by <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Facebook for targeted advertisements and that's what we should be regulating just it's just Julia you acknowledged you this is content or product like any other that somebody else's made so it is no different to say walking into shops saying got that looks popular and simply taking it that's how but that is what these big tech companies do you do if you are if they are doing that that's already illegal news articles are protected by copyright so if news publishers have difficulty with enforcing that copyright actually our alternative proposal to what is on the table would address that because it would allow publishers to in Forest the copyright of all journalists left published in the paper writes that is proposed already there but Lloris is simply unenforceable it will require us to go after every single thing every single photo years that have been used by the technology company of our content and studied individual legal process to try and get our money back we would die for the lawyer's fees before we go any further it's just not practical what we need is something that respects we need to value in the process sorry and the new Lada situation would be exactly the same it would Be enforced in front of support what is different about the new law is there would it would also protect very short parried of articles like a simple factual sentence Thatcher's threesome name needs Angela America and these kinds of factual statements should not be protected by copyright enforcement all these crazy that would be an interview let me talk about the conflict in Syria now we have a man working for us in Idlib city called Mohammed and scandal if the offensive against rebel parts of Syria's starts he starts the finest exclusive information will come in the form of one-line one-liner exclusive information that is important that has value and which behind there is a cost as the cost of his salary is because of our guru in Damascus as the cost of the editing process as well as a whole transmission facilities behind that so there's a real value even in one line of information in one single photo well if that one line is an</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

what was reminiscent of you know what this reminds many Europeans of it reminds them of the darkest days of Europe from 1930 and forces it reminds of fascism and thankfully of fascism in the ADIZ will never be equalled fascist and that is in common is any time a Regiment dictatorship that deprives seasons from freedom and uses violence is out of the state to see the whole of that interview here on BBC world news on hard talk this Wednesday starting at 8 30 GMT again at 14 30 and finally at 1930 that's a battle between old and new media with Europe's biggest news agencies accusing <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Facebook plundering news for free but produce great cost by press publishers news agencies statement from the CEO's 20 news agency said the tech giants

German MEP Julia read from the pirate party which calls for internet freedom and accessibility awful Chapman told me why they are pushing for a law change well I think what we have to understand this push comes at a time a context of the last 10 years of just massive job losses in both European and American another media around the world but the big technology companies have captured the global digital advertising market and there's really nothing left for everybody underneath the copyright legislation as it stands dates back 20 years and this is pre social media previous smartphone It's clear that our digital environment as has totally changed since then and therefore there's obviously need to modernise legislation the really is out of date just that they are Julia what is wrong with the approach just laid out by Phil where I think the analysis is correct that indeed News Are suffering from the decline in advertising revenues because of the power of <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Facebook in a market I think where is wrong in is thinking that copyright can fix that because actually news articles are already protected by copyright and for platform is using those articles without paying for it that's already a copyright infringement adding new layer of copyright protection is not going to change their basic facts what is actually hurt the newspaper it is the use of personal data by <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Facebook for targeted advertisements and that's where we should be regulating just Yeah it's just to underline Julia you acknowledged you this is content or product like any other that somebody else has made so it is no different to say walking into shops saying got that looks popular and simply taking it but that's how but that is what these big tech companies are doing it if they are doing that that's already illegal news articles are protected by copyright so if news publishers have difficulty with enforcing that copyright already there but Lloris is simply unenforceable it will require us to go after every single link away every single photo years that have been used by the technology company of our content and start an individual legal process to try and get our money back we would die for the lawyer's fees before we go any further it's just not practical what we need is something that respects really value in the process and the new Lada situation would be exactly the same it would have to be enforced in front of a court what is different about the new law is there would it would also protect very short paragraph articles like this simple factual sentence such as a threesome name needs Angela Macca and these kinds of factual statement should not be protected by copyright let me talk about the conflict in Syria now we have a man working for us in the Idlib city called Mohammed a scandal if the offensive Oust rebel parts of Syria's starts he starts the far less exclusive information will come in the form of a one-line one-liner exclusive information that is important that has value and which behind there is a cost as the cost of his salary as a cut above the in Damascus as the cost of the editing process as well as a whole transmission facilities behind that so there's a real value even in one line of information in one single photo well if that one line is an intellectual creation of the person who wrote it is already protected by copyright he felt like asking a different question his critics talk about that any increase censorship if the tech giants have to go and stop all of this do you think that's a possibility I think these sort of scared so you think to try and prevent any real discussion about the issues there I think it is not a is not censorship I think the analogy made about the bookshop is really interesting I think anybody thinks it's censorship if somebody walks into a bookshop and takes a book without paying</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's a business model built on mass surveillance, with personal data becoming the economy's most valuable commodity.</p><p>And as that data become ever more important to state-tostate relations, Mr. Keen says, we're only one major hacking event away from a digital world war.</p><p>\"We still haven't had an Exxon Valdez or a Chernobyl on data,\" he said in an interview, days before a U.S. federal grand jury indicted three Russian companies and 13 of their online operatives for a wide-ranging and well-funded online campaign to sow political discord during the 2016 election in support of Donald Trump. \"I think there will be some major hacking event in the not-too-distant future which may involve a foreign power that will wake people up to this.\"</p><p>Yet such a dystopian future is far from inevitable, he says.</p><p>The internet's early optimism, the belief that technology would save the world, was misguided. But so is today's digital determinism, which says that humans are powerless against algorithms, smart machines and cyberwarfare campaigns of hostile foreign governments.</p><p>To fix the future, Mr. Keen argues, we should look to the past. The social and economic upheaval caused by Industrial Revolution was tamed through a combination of labour strikes, government regulations that improved working conditions, the advent of a social safety net and the adoption of public schools. Mr. Keen believes the most damaging effects of today's digital revolution can be similarly managed through a combination of regulation, innovation, consumer and worker demands and education.</p><p>History lessons are particularly crucial for Silicon Valley's forward-looking tech titans. Mr. Keen points to the U.S. automotive industry, whose global dominance was undermined by safety and reliability issues until it eventually lost ground to innovative companies in Europe and Asia.</p><p>\"It's very important for Silicon Valley to wake up and recognize that there's no guarantee that they'll be dominant in 10 or 20 years,\" he said.</p><p>In Mr. Keen's vision of the war for the future, the villains are China and Russia, which are using online platforms to create surveillance states that undermine trust between citizens and their government.</p><p>The heroes are countries such as Estonia, which is creating a digital ID system for its citizens - one that alerts them each time a government agency accesses their data. The country also launched an \"e-residency\" program that gives foreign entrepreneurs access to the country's financial institutions.</p><p>In the Estonian model, he says, building online trust means replacing anonymity and privacy with a system of open and transparent state surveillance.</p><p>Regulation will become increasingly important to reining in big tech, he says. But the United States, with its chaotic political system and laws that shield social-media companies from liability for content posted on their platforms, is illequipped to lead the push for reform.</p><p>Canadian regulators have likewise taken a largely handsoff approach to social-media companies, although earlier this month, Bank of Canada deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins called for tougher regulation of tech firms, given their growing power and control over vast troves of personal data.</p><p>\"Access to and control of user data could make some firms virtually unassailable,\" she said.</p><p>Facebook also launched a \"Canadian Election Integrity\" project last year to head off concerns over how its platform could be used to undermine the 2019 Canadian federal election.</p><p>But Mr. Keen expects European regulators to carry the fight, particularly European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager. \"She's the only one willing to take on Apple and force them to pay their taxes,\" he says. \"She's the only one who is really looking critically [at] Google.\"</p><p>Just as the U.S. government's antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s loosened the company's stranglehold on desktop computing and paved the way for startups such as Google and Facebook, Mr. Keen believes the multibillion-dollar fines Ms. Vestager has slapped on Silicon Valley giants are intended to foster innovation by preventing the big tech companies from using their global dominance to squash smaller competitors.</p><p>The most significant reforms will come this May, when the European Union launches the General Data Protection Regulation. The aggressive internet-privacy reforms will, among other things, give users the \"right to be forgotten\" by allowing consumers to delete the personal data that private companies hold about them.</p><p>While critics, including Mr. Keen, say the rules unintentionally favour companies large enough to afford to comply, he still sees the regulations as a good start. \"The important thing is that they are beginning to pass some laws around data and the protection of consumer data,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20180221nwwosiliconfuture</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPG-GMM1-JCRP-C0NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1106\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Here's some of what they had to say:</p><p>Mark Shore: \"Political scientist Bjorn Lomborg has spent the last 20 years writing error-packed books and newspaper articles where, coincidentally, virtually every error, misquote or misunderstanding falls on the side of minimizing the costs, damages and risks of anthropogenic climate change and other human activities with environmental and ecological impacts.\"</p><p>Ed Zibitinov: \"Thanks to the G&amp;M for publishing this. Lomborg and Michael Shellenberger are eminently sensible when it comes to environmental alarmism. We need to start listening to them and dismiss the shrieking Malthusians such as David Suzuki and Greta Thunberg, who currently have sole possession of the global bullhorn.\"</p><p>Gern Blansten:\"The solution will be found in the same way mankind has always advanced - through invention, ingenuity and adaptation. Mankind is a wondrously adaptable species - we will find a way to survive and thrive, no matter what circumstance we are facing ... Panic-inducing headlines and political slogans about the world 'ending' in a dozen years are disingenuous at best and are completely unsupported by the science. The climate is changing, but it isn't changing so fast that we can't adapt.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Making waves</emphasis></p><p>Each week The Globe will profile a young person making a difference in Canada. This week we're highlighting the work of Keerat Dhami, whose local activism focuses on navigating climate change.</p><p>My name is Keerat Dhami and I reside in the Region of Peel. I organize communities around comprehensive climate action through the Community Climate Council and Peel Climate Caf\u00e9. The latter is a safe and supportive cyberspace for communities to congregate and chat about climate change and its connection to the human experience, as well as how to navigate the current climate crisis.</p><p>Additionally, I currently serve as a climate action catalyst team lead for Youth Challenge International's Innovate MY Future program. In this half-year program, I lead a local team to design and implement a project that addresses climate change complications facing the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.</p><p>Though combating climate change is a global issue that requires international agreements and accords, there is a lot that can be done at the local level and across our communities. In my opinion, the climate movement must think globally and act locally to combat climate change.</p><p>Come the fall, I will begin my final year of undergraduate studies as a specialist in environmental geography and a double minor in human geography and diaspora and transnational studies at the University of Toronto. After graduation, I aim to integrate my interests in geography and planning, as well as my enthusiasm for environmental sustainability and stewardship, to create communities resilient to climate change and environmental challenges and change.</p><p>Do you know an engaged young person?

Sluggish economic growth is set to continue and the jury is out on whether low interest rates and quantitative easing will be enough to keep global markets buoyant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If I were to sum up 2019 in a phrase, it would be 'Feds to the rescue',\" says Shane O'Brien, a senior investment director at Aviva. \"Last year ended with a period of market turmoil. The US Federal Reserve decided the market couldn't take a rate increase and moved aggressively in the other direction. That's been the main stimulus.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For many Irish investors, with typically balanced portfolios, the combination of a booming market in equities combined with rising bond values, driven by falling bond yields, made this a \"brilliant year\", according to O'Brien.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Derek Heffernan, senior portfolio manager at Appian Asset Management, was not surprised by the market's performance this year. \"You have to remember that the last quarter of 2018 was a bloodbath for equities, and the collapse was quite deep,\" he says.</p><p>Coming off such a low base there was only one way for the equity market to go, he says. \"Combine that with central banks becoming more accommodative and the end of monetary tightening, and the result was that investors came around to the idea that a major recession wasn't going to materialise.\"</p><p>Yet the fundamentals have not changed, says Jim Power, chief economist at Friends First. \"I would say that, geopolitically and economically, this has been the most challenging year in a decade. It's the most unusual financial and economic environment we've had in a century, and it is creating some strange stuff - one of which is the boom in equity markets.\"</p><p>He points to the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods and some EU products. There was also the continuing uncertainty over Brexit; a loss of thrust in the Chinese economy, partly because of the trade dispute; and declining momentum in the European economy, with both Germany and Italy on the brink of technical recession.</p><p>\"Brexit has had an impact on both Germany and the Netherlands, but there's a structural problem in Europe too. We have an ageing population with a lack of economic dynamism, a bit like Japan in the last few years,\" he says.</p><p>The result is that global growth, at about 3%, is the lowest it has been since 2007 and 2008.</p><p>For all this economic gloom, the boom in equities was clearly reflected in the performance of Irish funds, according to figures from Dublin market data firm Longboat Analytics. The top-performing fund, Zurich Life Green Resources, gained 48.5% with Standard Life UK Smaller Companies (up 45%) and Irish Life Techscope 2G (up 39.15%) rounding out the top three.</p><p>Overall, the tech sector enjoyed extraordinary growth. \"People are looking for growth stories in a world of very low growth,\" says Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life. \"We have a manufacturing recession in quite a few countries and several years of pretty muted economic activity. Against that backdrop, luxury, small cap and, very obviously, technology looked very attractive.\"</p><p>Milligan also sees issues in this sector - a view echoed by other market analysts. \"There's no such thing as technology. We need to start splitting the sector up. If we look at data centre demand, it's surging away. Enterprise software is doing well as companies try to raise productivity. But it was not a good year for 5G or smartphones, although it could be better next year.\"</p><p>He adds: \"Those parts of tech that were able to increase market share, users or profits were very well rewarded but they are expensive.\"</p><p>There are a series of difficult questions that need to be asked, says Milligan. \"Can Apple continue to monetise its user base? What will be the regulatory environment in the future? Our teams are highly selective in the types of tech stocks they're holding.\"</p><p>At Appian, Heffernan sounds a warning note on the tech sector, comparing it to the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. \"Over the past decade, tech stocks have gone from under-owned to the opposite, and as a result they've become reasonably expensive. If you include Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet [the holding company for Google], they account for 30% of the S&amp;P500. In the late 1990s [the big tech three] got to 35%. It's not a consensus view of the market but we think share prices will fall substantially.\"</p><p>Appian is also concerned about small companies, another sector that has performed strongly this year. \"About 20% of small caps in the US are zombie companies, meaning they can't cover their interest payments through earnings. If there's any dislocation in the credit market and they don't have access to credit, they can't leverage up or if interest rates were to increase at some stage, that sector would be a big concern,\" says Heffernan. He is bearish on America overall, believing that US equities are in a bubble and the dollar is set to weaken. \"The trade war and the forthcoming election are always concerns, but our view on the US is based more on fundamentals rather than politics,\" he says.</p><p>Aviva's O'Brien, also makes the point that what we have traditionally called the tech sector has changed substantially over the past few years. \"If you look at Facebook and Google, they're not necessarily tech companies, they're advertising companies. Combined, they account for more than 50% of digital ad spend in the US,\" he says. Because of this, both companies are more exposed to a downturn than people realise, he believes, since marketing spend is likely to be cut.</p><p>\"You need to drill down to find overpricing or good value. Look at US valuations of sectors. Companies can continue to do well but they will struggle in a downturn if they have a high valuation. Anything that's expensive can be more vulnerable, but I wouldn't necessarily be afraid of this sector.\"</p><p>At the other end of the scale, property and absolute return funds both underperformed.</p><p>MontLake Ronit Global Opportunities came bottom of the Longboat Analytics chart, losing 9.64%, reflecting the overall downturn for absolute return funds. Standard Life Aberdeen's Global Absolute Return Strategies (Gars) was once Europe's largest investment vehicle but its assets have shrunk from \u00a313.7bn ((EURO)15.86bn) to \u00a36.1bn in the past year. The company points to some growth this year and claims that continuing uncertainty will attract investors.</p><p>Milligan believes property funds were hit by worries about recession. \"The recession models are still flashing amber, although there is clear evidence that governments and central banks will try to delay one.</p><p>\"For investors looking at supply and demand in property, the mix doesn't look that favourable. The retail sector is really suffering in most countries and that's a sizeable part of any index. I'd be highly selective about what I'm buying.\"</p><p>Irish property investors have been used to getting really strong returns, says Aviva's O'Brien.</p><p>\"We're at about 5% now, which is not bad but looks worse when you put that against global equities at 25%-30%. I'd take comfort from the fact that returns from Irish property are stabilising and frame this as a good solid year.\"</p><p>Looking ahead, at least for the moment, much of the turbulence of this year has stabilised. America and China have reached a truce so that the December tariffs on Chinese goods will not go ahead, while the outcome of the British general election has brought, if not outright predictability to the course of Brexit, at least a level of certainty that has been lacking in the past 12 months.</p><p>Heffernan sees a clear upside for the UK now that the government there is working with a clear majority. \"We've had three years of capital outflows from the UK. It is still the fifth-biggest economy in the world. The fundamentals are still attractive, as are the valuations.

Sluggish economic growth is set to continue and the jury is out on whether low interest rates and quantitative easing will be enough to keep global markets buoyant. \"If I were to sum up 2019 in a phrase, it would be 'Feds to the rescue',\" says Shane O'Brien, a senior investment director at Aviva. \"Last year ended with a period of market turmoil. The US Federal Reserve decided the market couldn't take a rate increase and moved aggressively in the other direction. That's been the main stimulus.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For many Irish investors, with typically balanced portfolios, the combination of a booming market in equities combined with rising bond values, driven by falling bond yields, made this a \"brilliant year\", according to O'Brien.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Derek Heffernan, senior portfolio manager at Appian Asset Management, was not surprised by the market's performance this year. \"You have to remember that the last quarter of 2018 was a bloodbath for equities, and the collapse was quite deep,\" he says.</p><p>Coming off such a low base there was only one way for the equity market to go, he says. \"Combine that with central banks becoming more accommodative and the end of monetary tightening, and the result was that investors came around to the idea that a major recession wasn't going to materialise.\"</p><p>Yet the fundamentals have not changed, says Jim Power, chief economist at Friends First. \"I would say that, geopolitically and economically, this has been the most challenging year in a decade. It's the most unusual financial and economic environment we've had in a century, and it is creating some strange stuff - one of which is the boom in equity markets.\"</p><p>He points to the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods and some EU products. There was also the continuing uncertainty over Brexit; a loss of thrust in the Chinese economy, partly because of the trade dispute; and declining momentum in the European economy, with both Germany and Italy on the brink of technical recession.</p><p>\"Brexit has had an impact on both Germany and the Netherlands, but there's a structural problem in Europe too. We have an ageing population with a lack of economic dynamism, a bit like Japan in the last few years,\" he says.</p><p>The result is that global growth, at about 3%, is the lowest it has been since 2007 and 2008.</p><p>For all this economic gloom, the boom in equities was clearly reflected in the performance of Irish funds, according to figures from Dublin market data firm Longboat Analytics. The top-performing fund, Zurich Life Green Resources, gained 48.5% with Standard Life UK Smaller Companies (up 45%) and Irish Life Techscope 2G (up 39.15%) rounding out the top three.</p><p>Overall, the tech sector enjoyed extraordinary growth. \"People are looking for growth stories in a world of very low growth,\" says Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life. \"We have a manufacturing recession in quite a few countries and several years of pretty muted economic activity. Against that backdrop, luxury, small cap and, very obviously, technology looked very attractive.\"</p><p>Milligan also sees issues in this sector - a view echoed by other market analysts. \"There's no such thing as technology. We need to start splitting the sector up. If we look at data centre demand, it's surging away. Enterprise software is doing well as companies try to raise productivity. But it was not a good year for 5G or smartphones, although it could be better next year.\"</p><p>He adds: \"Those parts of tech that were able to increase market share, users or profits were very well rewarded but they are expensive.\"</p><p>There are a series of difficult questions that need to be asked, says Milligan. \"Can Apple continue to monetise its user base? What will be the regulatory environment in the future? Our teams are highly selective in the types of tech stocks they're holding.\"</p><p>At Appian, Heffernan sounds a warning note on the tech sector, comparing it to the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. \"Over the past decade, tech stocks have gone from under-owned to the opposite, and as a result they've become reasonably expensive. If you include Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet [the holding company for Google], they account for 30% of the S&amp;P500. In the late 1990s [the big tech three] got to 35%. It's not a consensus view of the market but we think share prices will fall substantially.\"</p><p>Appian is also concerned about small companies, another sector that has performed strongly this year. \"About 20% of small caps in the US are zombie companies, meaning they can't cover their interest payments through earnings. If there's any dislocation in the credit market and they don't have access to credit, they can't leverage up or if interest rates were to increase at some stage, that sector would be a big concern,\" says Heffernan. He is bearish on America overall, believing that US equities are in a bubble and the dollar is set to weaken. \"The trade war and the forthcoming election are always concerns, but our view on the US is based more on fundamentals rather than politics,\" he says. Aviva's O'Brien, also makes the point that what we have traditionally called the tech sector has changed substantially over the past few years. \"If you look at Facebook and Google, they're not necessarily tech companies, they're advertising companies. Combined, they account for more than 50% of digital ad spend in the US,\" he says. Because of this, both companies are more exposed to a downturn than people realise, he believes, since marketing spend is likely to be cut.</p><p>\"You need to drill down to find overpricing or good value. Look at US valuations of sectors. Companies can continue to do well but they will struggle in a downturn if they have a high valuation. Anything that's expensive can be more vulnerable, but I wouldn't necessarily be afraid of this sector.\"</p><p>At the other end of the scale, property and absolute return funds both underperformed.</p><p>MontLake Ronit Global Opportunities came bottom of the Longboat Analytics chart, losing 9.64%, reflecting the overall downturn for absolute return funds. Standard Life Aberdeen's Global Absolute Return Strategies (Gars) was once Europe's largest investment vehicle but its assets have shrunk from \u00a313.7bn ((EURO)15.86bn) to \u00a36.1bn in the past year. The company points to some growth this year and claims that continuing uncertainty will attract investors.</p><p>Milligan believes property funds were hit by worries about recession. \"The recession models are still flashing amber, although there is clear evidence that governments and central banks will try to delay one.</p><p>\"For investors looking at supply and demand in property, the mix doesn't look that favourable. The retail sector is really suffering in most countries and that's a sizeable part of any index. I'd be highly selective about what I'm buying.\"</p><p>Irish property investors have been used to getting really strong returns, says Aviva's O'Brien.</p><p>\"We're at about 5% now, which is not bad but looks worse when you put that against global equities at 25%-30%. I'd take comfort from the fact that returns from Irish property are stabilising and frame this as a good solid year.\"</p><p>Looking ahead, at least for the moment, much of the turbulence of this year has stabilised. America and China have reached a truce so that the December tariffs on Chinese goods will not go ahead, while the outcome of the British general election has brought, if not outright predictability to the course of Brexit, at least a level of certainty that has been lacking in the past 12 months.</p><p>Heffernan sees a clear upside for the UK now that the government there is working with a clear majority. \"We've had three years of capital outflows from the UK. It is still the fifth-biggest economy in the world. The fundamentals are still attractive, as are the valuations. So we think the UK looks attractive, that those capital outflows will reverse if people get more comfortable with the Brexit solution and negotiations go well.\"</p><p>Milligan also believes 2019 has ended well but foresees several thorny issues for 2020. \"If we don't get a big fiscal stimulus, we're looking at slow growth. The German manufacturing sector is not going to turn around too quickly. China will grow more slowly. What will happen with climate change regulations?\" There's also the 2020 presidential election in America. \"If Donald Trump does win, what will he do?\" adds Milligan. \"Could we be looking at a US-Europe trade war? If there is a wobble, it will be very difficult for central banks to respond with interest rates this low.\"</p><p>O'Brien, too, sounds a warning note.

The word both Republicans and Democrats used to describe their corporations was dominance, and as members unspooled the evidence they had collected in an investigation over the past year, it's easy to see why.</p><p>Almost any moment of the four-hour hearing offered a stunning illustration of the extent of the bad behaviour by these corporations.</p><p>Take Amazon, whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, often seemed off-balance and unaware of his corporation's own practices.</p><p>Congresswoman Lucy McBath played audio of a seller on Amazon tearfully describing how her business and livelihood was arbitrarily destroyed by Amazon restricting sales of their product, for no reason the seller could discern. Bezos acted surprised, as he often did.</p><p>Representative Jamie Raskin presented an email from Bezos saying about one acquisition that: \"We're buying market position not technology.\" Bezos then admitted Amazon buys companies purely because of their \"market position,\" demonstrating that many of hundreds of acquisitions these tech companies have made were probably illegal.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg had to confront his own emails in which he noted that Facebook's purchase of Instagram was done to buy out a competitor. His response was that he didn't remember, but that he imagined he was probably joking when he wrote that. One congresswoman on Joe Biden's vice-presidential shortlist, Val Demings, asked Zuckerberg why he restricted Facebook's tools for competitors like Pinterest, but not for non-competitors like Netflix. He had no answer. Cicilline asked about Facebook promoting incendiary speech and making money off advertising sold next to that speech. Zuckerberg pivoted to free-speech talking points, and Cicilline cut him off, \"This isn't a speech issue, it's about your business model.\"</p><p>Big Tech's dominance has serious consequences. America has lost thousands of media outlets because of the concentration of ad revenue in the hands of Google and Facebook; two-thirds of American counties now have no daily newspaper. The nation lost 100,000 independent businesses from 2000 to 2015, a drop of 40 per cent, many due to Amazon's exploitation of legal advantages from the avoidance of sales tax to its apparent violation of antitrust laws in underpricing rivals. Hundreds of thousands of merchants now depend on Amazon's platform to sell goods, and Amazon has systemically hiked fees on them. Just a few years ago these third-party merchants paid 19 per cent of their revenue to Amazon, now it's up to 30 per cent, which is, coincidentally, the amount Apple demands from hundreds of thousands of app-makers who have to reach iPhone users. It's no secret why small business formation has collapsed since the last financial crisis; these giant platforms tax innovation.</p><p>And then there's the fear.</p><p>I have reported on small and medium-sized businesses frightened to come forward with stories of how they are abused by counterfeiting or unfair fees by the goliaths. As one told me about his relationship to Amazon, \"I'm a hostage.\"</p><p>Fortunately, the voices of small businesspeople afraid of retaliation came through their elected leaders. \"I pay 20 per cent of my income to Uncle Sam in taxes, and 30 per cent to Apple,\" one member of Congress noted she heard from businesspeople. Representative Ken Buck, Republican from Colorado, talked about one of the few courageous businesspeople who testified openly months ago, the founder of PopSockets, who had been forced to pay US$2 million to Amazon just to get Amazon to stop allowing counterfeits of its items sold on the platform. Another Republican representative, Kelly Armstrong, went into the details of Google's use of tracking to disadvantage its competitors in advertising, joined by Democrat Pramila Jayapal, who asked Google's CEO why the corporation kept directing ad revenue to its own network of properties instead of sending ad traffic to the best available result.</p><p>Over and over, the CEOs had similar answers. I don't know. I'll get back to you. I'm not aware of that. Or long rambling attempts to deflect, followed by members of Congress cutting them off to get answers to crisp questions. I learned two things from the surprisingly wan responses of these powerful men. First, they had not had to deal with being asked for real answers about their business behaviour for years, if ever, and so they were not ready to respond. And two, antitrust enforcers for the last 15 years, stretching back to the Bush and Obama administrations, bear massive culpability for the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of these corporations. The emails and information that Congress dug up were available to these enforcers, who nonetheless approved merger after merger, and refused to bring complaints against anticompetitive behaviour.</p><p>It's rare to see Congress cover itself in glory, but believe it or not, that's what happened. While a few Republicans, like ranking member Jim Jordan, spent the hearing yelling about the supposed persecution of conservatives on social media, most of the subcommittee focused on genuine business problems. Even most Republicans focused on anti-conservative bias recognized that the ability to constrain conservative voices originated as a function of market power.</p><p>As Cicilline put it: \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\" And then he quoted Louis Brandeis, who said, \"We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\"</p><p>The Guardian Matt Stoller is the author of Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Cruise Chief Executive Officer Dan Ammann said the company would expand testing in San Francisco, and added in a blog post that Cruise was working with Honda Motor Co and General Motors Co to develop purpose-built autonomous vehicles. Ammann did not say when the company now expects to deploy a ride-hailing service using self-driving vehicles. It had earlier hoped to deploy such a service by the end of 2019, but in April, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra declined to repeat that goal. </p><p>Cruise has raised US$7.25 billion during the past year from investors including SoftBank, Honda Motor Co and investment firm T. Rowe Price. As GM and Cruise executives have done in the past, Ammann said Cruise would launch its commercial service when it was sure the vehicles would be safe. \"When you're working on the large scale deployment of mission critical safety systems, the mindset of 'move fast and break things' certainly doesn't cut it,\" Ammann wrote in a post on Medium on Wednesday. Ammann alluded in his post to broader concerns about the trustworthiness of \"Big Tech\" and said Cruise was in talks with regulators about how to measure when its technology \"will have a net positive impact on safety on our roads.\" Cruise's decision to formally postpone deployment of self-driving cars this year comes as rival autonomous vehicle companies and automakers acknowledge it will take more time and money than they had expected to make autonomous vehicles safe for unrestricted use on public roads. The capital and technology challenges of self-driving cars are pushing automakers to forge alliances to share the cost burdens. Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor Co earlier this month said they would partner to develop autonomous vehicles, and invest in self-driving technology company Argo AI. German automakers BMW AG and Daimler AG also have struck self-driving car partnerships. Alphabet Inc's Waymo robo-taxi unit has begun offering rides for hire in Arizona, but continues to operate its vehicles with human attendants ready to take the wheel. Ammann, who took over as Cruise's chief executive last November, told Reuters last year that developing self-driving cars capable of safely navigating urban traffic was \"the engineering challenge of our generation.\" Against what promises to be a long period of development and technology evolution, initial delays would not be that meaningful, he said. Cruise is working with GM and Honda engineers to develop a next-generation of electric, autonomous vehicles, Ammann said. \"This is not a concept car - hundreds of the best Honda, GM and Cruise engineers are working together on-site in Warren, Michigan, where they are deep into the vehicle development process. This new vehicle completely reimagines from the ground up what a car can be and we can't wait to share more in the near future,\" Ammann wrote. GM has sought clearance from federal safety regulators for self-driving cars that do not have conventional controls such as a steering wheel. The U.S. Department of Transportation has delayed action on GM's petition to test such vehicles for more than a year, and earlier this year said it would seek public comments on the proposal.

GM stock moved on the not-surprising announcement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A GM robotaxi service was planned by year-end via its self-driving Cruise unit. Now General Motors hopes to introduce robotaxis in 2020.</p><p>GM spent around $1 billion to acquire Cruise in early 2016 and has poured resources into the business. Cruise has gone from 40 employees, testing a self-driving system bolted atop Audi cars, to now having almost 1,500 employees. GM's then-president Dan Ammann claimed in 2017 that its technology would \"change the world.\"</p><p>But Ammann, now CEO of Cruise, conceded not everything has gone according to plan.</p><p>\"Any time you're working on something that's never been done before, the timeline is likely to move around a little bit,\" he said. The executive insisted good progress has been made on the technology, but argued having a \"positive first experience with this technology is going to be critically important.\"</p><p>The delay could cost Cruise cash. Japan's SoftBank last year pledged to invest $2.25 billion in Cruise. But $1.34 billion will only be paid out after commercial deployment.</p><p>On the positive side, Ammann said that GM's Cruise is expanding its electric-vehicle infrastructure \"in a very big way.\"</p><p>\"Cruise already owns nearly 40 percent of all EV fast chargers in San Francisco, and now we're building the largest EV fast charger station in the country right here,\" in San Francisco, he said in a .</p><p>While autonomous vehicles often strike up an image of futuristic-looking vehicles, the reality may be less exciting. GMCruise's technology is set to be first deployed in a car similar to the electric Chevrolet Bolt.</p><h>GM Stock Holds Steady</h><p>Shares rose 0.4% to close at 40.88 on the , a day after hitting a 52-week closing high. GM stock is driving toward a buy point of 41.60 from a 21-week consolidation, . It has an  of 70, and is up almost 21% so far in 2019.</p><p>Among other autonomous driving players, Google-parent\u00a0Alphabet, whose Waymo project has also faced delays, dipped 0.7% as the Justice Department begins a probe of Google and other Big Tech giants.\u00a0Tesla rose 1.8% ahead of its earnings.</p><p>Ford and Volkswagen, which recently expanded their alliance to include electric cars and autonomous vehicles, rose 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively.</p><h>Driverless Cars Stuck In Neutral</h><p>A raft of delays has hit autonomous driving efforts. Alphabet's Waymo is still seen by many as furthest along the path to commercial deployment. Waymo claimed in 2017 it would soon be offering customers autonomous-vehicle rides without anyone at the wheel, but its Phoenix-based commercial service still uses safety drivers. Waymo did recently get a California license to drive passengers in autonomous vehicles in that state.</p><p>Uber Technologies has long touted self-driving cars as a way to move to profitability. But the ride-hailing giant halted self-driving efforts for several months after one of its test cars fatally struck a pedestrian in March 2018.</p><p>The bottom line is that self-driving cars still face big technological hurdles to navigating city streets, let alone bad weather or unusual \"edge\" cases.</p><h>Tesla, Ford Push Ahead On Autonomous Vehicles</h><p>Earlier this year Tesla CEO Elon Musk outlined plans for a Tesla Network robotaxi ride-hailing service in the U.S. by mid-2020. Musk has remained highly optimistic about Tesla's Autopilot and other self-driving features. But Autopilot has been linked to at least three fatal crashes, while industry experts say Tesla is a long way from full self-driving capability.</p><p>Tesla reports second-quarter earnings late Wednesday. Self-driving timelines likely will come up in Musk's typically entertaining post-earnings conference call.</p><p>Ford has lagged GM and Waymo in autonomous vehicles, but that doesn't seem like such a negative.\u00a0The U.S. automaker and Germany's VW this month agreed to collaborate on self-driving cars and electric vehicles, pooling resources for the expensive efforts. Ford says a robotaxi service is still on track for 2021. Ford reports earnings late Wednesday.</p><p>Regulatory progress has also been slow for autonomous vehicles. A lobbying bid for a Senate bill to establish nationwide standards for self-driving cars failed last year. In addition the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has yet to rule on a GM request to allow public use of vehicles without manual controls like a steering wheel and brake pedals.</p><p>Despite the setbacks, firms have been pouring resources into the area. According to an AlixPartners report, . They're also spending $255 billion to develop electric vehicles over the next eight years. That's up from $25 billion over the past eight years, even though \"EV costs are still years away from being competitive.\"</p><p>The report also found car buyers say they are willing to pay $2,300 for autonomous-vehicle features. But current AV systems cost around $22,900 \u2014 nearly 10 times more.</p><p>This helps explain why automakers have placed their autonomous vehicle bets on shared, commercial services, known as robotaxis, rather than sales to individual consumers.</p><p>YOU WILL ALSO LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-4792765</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-PVP1-JCBB-K2DV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

Wow, what a story that was. Good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Tuesday, it is Tuesday, March 19th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast. Jobs in America, as one automaker makes cuts, another is adding jobs in the U.S. Ford Motor announcing it will create jobs in Kentucky. We have all the details this morning on this breaking news. President Trump, meanwhile is taking aim at General Motors again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A relentless commitment to safety, that is the message from Boeing CEO this morning as the company faces growing concern about its 737 Max 8 jet, following the second deadly crash involving the plane. Taking action against Twitter, Congressman Devin Nunes filed a $250-million lawsuit against Twitter, alleging it failed to take down defamatory tweets about him. He told me first about these claims and the case two weeks ago. Social media and your insurance premium, how what you post could affect what you pay. MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now from Los Angeles this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Markets this morning are looking up. Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading adding on to yesterday's big gains. Take a look, Futures indicating the Dow Industrials will be up 80 points at the start of trading. This would be the market up for four days in a row while the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are up two straight days. S&amp;P is up 7- 3/4 points, and the NASDAQ up 21 this morning. We're looking at a pretty good tone at the start of trading if things hold up.</p><p>This, as the American autoworker is getting some good news this morning, Ford motor is announcing in the past hour that it will add 550 new jobs at its Kentucky Factory. General Motors on the other hand is weathering criticism from President Trump over the company's closing down of its Lordstown, Ohio plant. Joining me right now is Foxnews.com Automotive Editor Gary Gastelu, and Tigress Financial Partners Chief Investment Officer Ivan Feinseth. Great to see you both. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>IVAN FEINSETH, CIO, TIGRESS FINANCIAL PARTNERS: Thank you.</p><p>GARY GASTELU, FOXNEWS.COM AUTOMOTIVE EDITOR: How you doing?</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Gary, kick us off here and assess the situation in terms of jobs in America, and what's happening? Why such a different outcome when you look at Ford and what they're trying to do versus G.M. shutting down that plant in Ohio?</p><p>GASTELU: Well, look, it's not as different as it sounds. Ford is adding some jobs at this plant. It's also moving jobs from another plant in the Louisville area as well. General Motors has jobs available, just not in Lordstown, Ohio. It wants to cut -- shut that plant completely, and that's really the issue here, and it's specific to Ohio right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ivan, tell me how you invest in all of this. What are you doing at Tigress in terms of allocating capital to the auto sector versus elsewhere?</p><p>FEINSETH: Well, I have a strong buy on G.M. I think it's an incredible value, and it has a great dividend. It's just going through a transition that people are buying less cars and more trucks. The driving consumer wants SUVs and crossovers, and in general, demand for pickup trucks vans and work vehicles is very strong. So, the Lordstown, Ohio plant makes a lot of just passenger cars when the demand is for SUVs that are made in other plants. So, G.M. just has to continue to realign and retool its manufacturing process to address the core of the vehicles that people want. And unfortunately, it cost of the plant makes the vehicles that people don't want.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ivan, how are you investing right now? Give us a broader sense. We got another rally underway this morning, Futures indicating a firmer tone. And of course, today, begins a two-day Federal Reserve meeting. How are you placing bets?</p><p>FEINSETH: Well, I've been very bullish. I think we are going to see new all-time highs in the market sometime late spring, early summer. So, I like the tech sector, I like companies that are sensitive to a benefit if we do get a mutually beneficial trade agreement with China, which I believe we will get. I do like companies like Boeing and Caterpillar. I like technology companies like Intel, Microsoft, and of course, Amazon, Facebook, and a lot of the other big tech companies. I do have a strong buy on General Motors. I think that's a great value. And their real value lies in their Cruise Autonomous vehicle division. There's a lot of money that's being focused on autonomous vehicle and electric vehicle technology. And Waymo from Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a great point, actually. Yes.</p><p>FEINSETH: So, it is going to be a growing technology. And also, Tesla does have incredible autonomous vehicle technology. Tesla as a car is a phenomenal car.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So, that's where the growth is, I guess. When you look out 10 years or five years, that's certainly where the growth is. What do you think about that, Gary? When do you expect that we will have the first autonomous vehicle on the road. Actually -- you know, I mean, is regulation there? Can this happen without any new regulations? What needs to be done to see that actually take place, Gary?</p><p>GASTELU: Well as far as you being able to go to a dealership and buy an autonomous car, and let it drive you home, that's a long ways away. I don't really expect to see that any time soon. Not just because of the regulations but also because the technology is not there. What we're going to see sooner, these more limited deployments of the technology in every services, in delivery services because you can sort of fence the vehicles in, map the area very well, and control it even from a central location if things go wrong. So, that's really what you're going to see in the first couple of years.</p><p>Now, if you talk to Tesla, they're going to be having autonomous cars a lot quicker than that. Haven't driven a Model 3 recently with its latest version of its semi-autonomous technology. I can't believe we're a year or two away from just being able to buy a car and have it take you home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, what about Mercedes-Benz, reportedly will be building its ultra-luxury Maybach SUV in Alabama. So, here we have the Mercedes-Benz bringing that production back to the U.S., Gary.</p><p>GASTELU: They're also going to be building electric cars in Alabama in a couple of years. As far as this Maybach is concerned, it's going to be a version of the GLS SUV that they already build there, so it's not a big surprise. But that's it, it's going to be the most expensive production car made in America. It's going to be made by Mercedes-Benz. It's not going to be made by Cadillac, not going to be made by Lincoln.</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump is going to be in Ohio tomorrow on the heels of the -- of his criticism of G.M. over the closure of the Lordstown plant. Ivan, what would you expect from the President in terms of his commentary today in Ohio? We know how he feels about G.M. closing that plant, he's been very vocal.</p><p>FEINSETH: Well, I don't know what could change. I assume at some level, the plant could be retooled to make other vehicles, but the problem is that G.M. has four Youngstown (ph) is they have capacity, they can increase in the factories that do make SUVs and trucks and other vehicles that they're more in more demand. Unfortunately, I mean, losing jobs is never good, but it's just an economic fact that you got to focus on what you have demand for and produce that at the most efficient cost possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's unfortunate. Even as we see the unemployment rate at really record numbers here. Gary, Ivan, good to see you both. Gentlemen, thank you. Gary Gastelu, Ivan Feinseth joining us there.</p><p>Meanwhile, we want to get to this story, one of the top stories this morning, the private Bezos texts. The National Enquirer reportedly paid a high price for those racy text messages that were unleashed between Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his then-secret girlfriend Lauren Sanchez. Dagen McDowell with more this morning. Dagen, wow, what a story.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Front page of the Wall Street Journal. See this guy in the middle, there's Jeff Bezos and David Pecker. Right there in the middle, that is the brother of Jeff Bezos' girlfriend, mistress, paramour, Lauren Sanchez, Michael Sanchez. So, the Wall Street Journal -- this is a very long story that goes into the back and forth within American Media, the publisher of the National Enquirer about the decision to publish this story about their affair.</p><p>And the Wall Street Journal leads with this, Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, and his allies have publicly speculated about how the National Enquirer acquired those racy text messages he sent to his girlfriend. They've even hinted that it was Saudi Arabia or the White House that might have been involved. In fact, it was Michael Sanchez, the brother of Lauren Sanchez, Mr. Bezos' lover, who sold the billionaire's secrets for $200,000 to The Enquirer's publisher. This is according to some real news breaking by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Michael Sanchez is a talent agent. He had managed T.V. pundits, reality show judges out west for many years, and had a long relationship with the National Enquirer and its top editor. Mr. Sanchez started conversations last fall with the National Enquirer about his sister's relationship with Jeff Bezos. The Enquirer by then had already started investigating whether Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez were having an affair. They had worked together on some projects, the affairs, relationship started last year, but that is the story.</p><p>You -- I encourage people to read it because it goes into the back and forth about concerns about getting sued by Jeff Bezos within the -- within the National Enquirer about their precarious financial position at the time, or difficult financial position. And also, the long-standing relationship that David Pecker has had with President Trump, and concerns about how this might look bad. But again, Michael Sanchez, brother of Lauren Sanchez, sold those text messages, $200,000 to the National Enquirer. It wasn't Saudi Arabia or the White House behind it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And you know, they were all those hints trying to make it look like it was political like President Trump had anything to do with his affair being outed. One thing I didn't get from the article, Dagen, was how she shared the information with her brother.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, you know, when she started to tell the brother that she was having this affair, that wasn't in there. I guess it's hard to pin that down, you know, when started sharing this information. And what was he doing, recording it? Oh, send me this picture. How did he have -- you know, she just sent him all this stuff to her brother?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't want to speculate, but I will -- I've had --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I'm just saying that wasn't --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, I've had conversation with friends of mine. If you have multiple Apple devices, if you -- if you have multiple Apple devices around a -- your home, other people might have access to them. I'll leave it at that. And by the way, there's still the back and forth about the extortion by Jeff Bezos, and that blog post, that's not settled.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a very good point. Dagen, thank you. We'll see you a little later.</p><p>Boeing CEO speaking out meanwhile this morning amid a crisis at that company. Cheryl Casone has those details this morning. And Cheryl, the company came out with a video over everything.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. We're going to play a bit of that for you, Maria. This is just a week, of course, after that second deadly crash of Boeing's top jet. CEO Dennis Muilenburg is defending now, his company's safety record. He also expressed sorrow for the hundreds of victims in two air disasters involving the 737 Max, while also saying that Boeing is cooperating in the investigations and taking action.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO, BOEING: As the facts from the accident become available and we understand the necessary next steps, we're taking action to fully reassure airlines and their passengers of the safety of the 737 Max. We regret the ongoing challenges the grounding has caused for our customers and the flying public.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, Muilenburg's appearance comes as Federal regulators and lawmakers are reportedly scrutinizing Boeing's design of the Max jet. Shares of Boeing lost almost two percent yesterday. Again, down in the pre-market a little more than a quarter percent right now.</p><p>Well now, to Hollywood, hit by another sex scandal, Warner Brothers Chairman and CEO Kevin Tsujihara stepping down after sexual misconduct allegations. Warner Media launched an investigation following a report that detailed text messages between Tsujihara and a British actress Charlotte Kirk. These messages suggested that their sexual relationship was contingent on promises that she'd be considered for roles in movies.</p><p>Then there is this, Starbucks is revamping its rewards program to help customers get free stuff faster. With this new program, rewards could be collected in as little as two to three visits. It's also allowing customers to exchange their points for packaged coffee and merchandise for the first time. Everybody loves those rewards at Starbucks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, they do. Thank you so much, Cheryl. In fact, tomorrow morning, we've got a First on Fox Interview with the CEO of Starbucks. Join us for a special interview tomorrow. Kevin Johnson will give us an update on what's happening at Starbucks on the day that he meets with investors. It's tomorrow morning 8:30 a.m. Eastern, right here.</p><p>But first, coming up next, filing lawsuit, Congressman Devin Nunes is going after Twitter this morning, suing the social media giant for defamation and negligence. We've got the details coming up right after this. And then, speaking of social media, how your high-risk online photos could potentially cost you your health insurance. We're live from Los Angeles this morning. Stay with us. We'll be back in two minutes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We got a big program this morning. Coming up right here, Ohio Congressman and House Financial Services Committee Member Warren Davidson is here on this, today that President Trump visiting Ohio this morning. A First on Fox Business Interview this morning with the CEO of Premier, Susan Devore, is with us talking healthcare. Retired four-star General and Fox Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keane joining us. And singer-songwriter and outspoken supporter of President Trump Joy Villa joins us as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We got a big three hours.</p><p>I want to kick it off with this, Twitter now this morning is facing a $250- million lawsuit from a member of the U.S. Congress, California Representative, ranking member of the Intel Committee, Devin Nunes, filed the lawsuit Monday, accusing Twitter of shadow banning conservatives, censoring opposing viewpoints, and ignoring complaints of abusive behavior. Here's what Devin Nunes told me about a week and a half ago on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you're saying you're going to deal with the misinformation out there. How do you deal with that? You've referred to them in the past as tech oligarchs to me.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA: Yes. So, there's two ways that they're doing it. So, the fake news media, they're putting out fake news stories. Sometimes it comes from the Democrats, right, in the dossier. They feed it to the media, the media runs the story. And then, the numerous tech companies out there that are really controlling what all Americans see, right? So, what these tech companies have become is they try to pretend that they're not, but they're content developers.</p><p>They're developing content, OK, through two ways: one, algorithms, so they're controlling what you and I see when we get on our device. So, for them to say that they're not developing content is nonsense. The other thing that they're doing is they're monetizing this. So, there's some people that will not get rewarded. Like if you're a conservative out there putting conservative videos together, you're not going to get money for that, right? People are not going to advertise on that. So all this is -- you know, it has got to be dealt with, I think, in the future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he's dealing with it this morning by suing Twitter for 250 million. Joining the conversation this morning is Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York, along with the Chairman of the Program in Business and Finance at King's College in Manhattan, Brian Brenberg. Interesting development here, and I understand, Dagen, my sources are telling me this is the first lawsuit of many that Devin Nunes is going to be suing other media companies in the coming weeks. Your reaction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Your viewers would know about this if they watched you regularly on this program and on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" because you have been ahead of this for a long period of time. Though, he's seeking $250 million in compensatory damages, $350,000 in punitive damages. Congressman Nunes against Twitter, the complaint also names specific Twitter accounts, not just the shadow banning that allegedly spread defamatory material about him.</p><p>One defendant published tweets that implied that Congressman Nunes colluded with prostitutes and cocaine addicts, that he did drugs. This is in the complaint. And that he was involved in Russian money laundering. And there's even a (INAUDIBLE) the account said that Nunes invested in a winery that allegedly used underage hookers to solicit investment. I think the issue is these lawsuits aim to stop this behavior and force Twitter to basically crack down on these kinds of accounts, and also kind of open the vault, if you will, to see what's really going on within these social media companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I totally agree. And one of the issues here -- and the -- and the accounts that you refer to, Dagen, one of them was called Devin Nunes' Mom, right? And so, Brian, you've got an account that was a fake account, and they're calling themselves Devin Nunes' Mom, and it just went on and on and on and on for a long time, and Twitter never took it down. Meanwhile, how quick has Twitter been to take down other accounts or other posts from conservatives that they say, we're just protecting people.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, CHAIRMAN OF THE PROGRAM IN BUSINESS &amp; FINANCE, KING'S COLLEGE: Well, you can see --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, they let this account by Devin Nunes' Mom that he's with prostitutes and cocaine and drugs and all those stuff like Dagen just reported, which was total B.S., it's just lies, and they let it go on, they never took it down.</p><p>BRENBERG: Well, you can see why Devin Nunes is so mad here. I mean, he's dealing -- and everybody knows this about Twitter. If you've been on Twitter for 10 minutes, you know, this is the kind of thing you see, and he's got a really legitimate complaint. The First Amendment question is going to be interesting here, you know what -- to what degree can you ask Twitter to do these things? Is it a platform? Is it a content provider? I think that's the really interesting part of Nunes' lawsuit here. He's saying, Twitter is not a platform, it's a content provider. It is creating messaging, it is using people's tweets to convey a message that it wants to convey. I think it's very important for the public to have that conversation, about what exactly Twitter is, and maybe Nunes' lawsuit will help to bring that to the surface.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I totally agree given the fact that now, an increasing number of people get their news from social media, right, Dagen? I mean, people are getting their news there, and we can't have these social media companies censoring content.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, absolutely. Really quickly, I want to just correct something, Jeff Bezos is -- he alleged extortion by American Media and the National Enquirer in that blog post. I wanted to be really clear about that. There's an investigation within that company by an outside law firm on that. But I wanted to be clear of -- it was Bezos alleging extortion against him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alleging.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we're going to have more on that because that's another incredible story this morning as you -- as you heard, everybody, that this issue that Lauren Sanchez's brother was the one who got paid to get those texts to the National Enquirer. All right. Quick break. Lyft is hitting a speed bump this morning. Details on the ridesharing company's court loss, coming up. And then, cow on the move, wait until you see this video that has gone viral. We've got a lot coming up. Police trying to wrangle a runway cow. More on the amazing video and where he ended up right here. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets look good this morning. We're expecting a higher opening for the broader averages. Take a look at Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 78 points on the Dow Industrials, S&amp;P 500 up eight, and the NASDAQ up 21-1/2 right now. It is a big week on Wall Street for investors. We are waiting on the Federal Reserve meeting, two-day meeting, which begins today. We're not expecting any moves in rates. But the U.S.-China trade deal also on the docket. We're waiting for any news there. No meeting so far has been scheduled between the President and Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago so far -- we're expecting that in the month of April. British Prime Minister Theresa May has a move on the U.K.'s exit from the E.U.</p><p>All this, as U.S. chipmakers are now expressing concern that a trade deal would force them to do business with Beijing, giving China more control over the semiconductor industry. Right now, U.S. really owns the chip business. Joining me right now to talk more about all of that is Churchill Management Group President Randy Conner. Randy, it's good to have you, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>RANDY CONNER, PRESIDENT, CHURCHILL MANAGEMENT GROUP: Thanks for having me. Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's driving markets from your standpoint? What are your clients and investors looking for in terms of unleashing more firepower?</p><p>CONNER: Well, we always tell our clients there's three kind of markets they're going to invest in. There's really easy, where you can be aggressive, 2017-type market. Really bad run for the hills, that was kind of 2008. We think we're kind of that in-between, where it can be good, but you might want to treat it with a little bit of caution. So, I think what they're looking for to get things off the ground more, whether we're going to have another sustainable leg, is for things that they're worried about, to be less of a worry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, like the economic slowdown. I mean, the Trump economy in focus today, because the President is going to Ohio today. And we've got this new recent CNN Poll. The CNN poll shows 71 percent of the people surveyed, believe the U.S. economy is in good shape. This is the best rating in President Trump's term so far, the highest number since February 2001. The very same poll finds that 51 percent of Americans approve of President Trump's handling of the economy. So, good news here, and certainly, another reminder that the backdrop is pretty good.</p><p>CONNER: Yes, the numbers have been good. I mean, you know, you go try to go to a restaurant, it's packed. If you -- if you still go on Facebook, you see somebody overseas. So, people are in a good mood as far as that goes, but they continue to worry about what's next, what's coming, is the slowdown coming? And I think that's their concern. While I think the economy may hold, you know, when they hear things like what's the Fed up to, what's going on in China? Those are the kind of things that make them worry? Hey, will it last?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, let me -- let me bring Dagen McDowell in New York because this Federal Reserve meeting right now is a two-day meeting. But, Dagen, you're not expecting much from the Fed, right? I mean, I think it's really interesting that you hear now people talking about will the Fed, at some point, cut rates. Yesterday, one of the Fed governor said, it's warranted to think about that right now of Fed rate cut.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Expect to get some guidance from the Fed that they are in no rush to move on interest rates at all. So, it -- again, we started the year with two interest rates -- interest rate increases. Likely now, it's nothing, if not, a cut potentially. Also, the Fed is expected to give guidance about when it's going to stop the wind down in the balance sheet. It's still close to $4 trillion. Maybe there's -- it's up for discussion, but maybe September is the time that they're going to -- they're going to stop the balance sheet unwind. That's going to be critical also. The dot plot dilemma, The Wall Street Journal writes about that today, the Central Bank produces this chart of 19 officials' individual projections for interest rates, but this dot plot we were talking about yesterday, has caused a lot of confusion. And so, all these Central Bank governors are concerned about that as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes, that's good info. And I just found that the report I was referring to, this is Kocherlakota. He said yesterday, a pre-emptive cut may be warranted. Really interesting stuff there. When you look at how to allocate capital right now, Randy, are there areas that you think are bigger growth stories than others? Where would you allocate capital?</p><p>CONNER: You know, it sounds strange because we still believe tech is a great area. I mean, it's been dominating our lives for so long. But when you look at it, you might even conclude it's just getting started. When we talk to our clients, it's always interesting to hear their business model. And story after story, it involves tech, including -- we have a client who's in cattle ranching in Texas.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CONNER: And when you hear the story of how they use tech to monitor the cows, they can tell are they eating, are they healthy, are they walking? And you start to realize, wow, even in that, tech is dominating. So, I think that's an area you'll want to play. Now, we prefer to play it in a broad way, maybe XLKs. You'll get a basket of stock --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Through an ETF.</p><p>CONNER: Through an ETF.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. OK. Randy, we'll leave it there. Great to have you.</p><p>CONNER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Randy Conner joining us there. We will take a short break. When we come back, the biggest threat to the United States, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, says, it is not the crisis at the border. Wait until you hear what she said. This story is next. And then, Sprint exposed, customers reportedly were able to see other users' personal data due to a glitch. We will bring it to you when we come back. More ahead right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, March 19th, your top stories right now, 6:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Investors are waiting on the Federal Reserve, we've got a two-day Fed meeting that has kicked off today, Futures indicating a higher opening at the broader -- for the broader averages for the markets to stay. Dow Industrials expected to be up about 80 points.</p><p>As you can see, the S&amp;P up 8 and the NASDAQ up 23, on top of pretty good gains yesterday, if the Dow finishes higher today, it would be the longest winning streak of the year. Yesterday, Dow Industrials were up 65, S&amp;P was up 10, and the NASDAQ up 26 points, at the close yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, let's take a look at the momentum there. European Indices higher across the board, FT-100 up 24 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 20 and the DAX Index in Germany up 87.</p><p>Data -- in Asia overnight, take a look, the markets were mostly lower, with the exception of Hong Kong, which was up a fraction, but here too, very much fractional moves across the board, the KOSPI the most -- the biggest mover up almost -- down almost two percent.</p><p>Data exposure concerns for Sprint, to tell you about, a new report says that some customers are seeing information online from other people's accounts, what you need to know, coming up.</p><p>A road block for Lyft, ahead of its IPO, the ride-sharing giant lost in initial legal battle to end the minimum wage for drivers in New York City. We've got the details on Lyft as it prepares that IPO.</p><p>Taking a walk on the wild side could cost you. Insurance companies may now use what you post on social media to help set premiums, important note there.</p><p>Plus, why did the cow cross the road, to eat more chicken, of course. This video has gone viral of a cow crossing the road to go to Chick-fil-A.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, but first, with the news this half an hour, with threats to National Security, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is speaking out on several issues, she spoke yesterday including touching on the border, watch this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, SECRETARY, HOMELAND SECURITY: The situation at our southern border has gone from a crisis to a national emergency, to a near system-wide meltdown. I say this with the upmost sincerity and urgency. The system is breaking.</p><p>On top of my list of threats that many of you can guess, the word, cyber, is circled, highlighted, and underlined.</p><p>But what worries me is not what these threat actors have done, but what they have the capability to do, stealing our most sensitive secrets, deceiving us about our own data, distracting us during a crisis, launching physical attacks on infrastructure with a few key strokes or planting false flags to embroil us in conflicts with other nations. The possibilities are limitless..</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nielsen is also warning that border crossings have reached their highest level in more than a decade. Joining me right now is FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst, Retired Four-Star General, Jack Keane. General, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pretty scary commentary from Kirstjen Nielsen there. Let's start with the cyber threat, some of the banks, I'm told, get 200 to 300,000 attempts to break into their system a day.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, there's absolutely no exaggeration about that. I was a director at a defense contractor and they get close to 1 billion attempted penetrations per month. It's absolutely staggering how prolific the Chinese are, who are the number one penetrators of our cyberspace, it's comprehensive.</p><p>They have literally hundreds of thousands of cyber hackers who are working every single day to get into our systems. They are the number one stealers of data in the world. Nobody even comes close to what they're attempting to do every single day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you know, the President knows this, the President has been pushing back on China for a number of -- for a number of months now and -- for a number of reasons, because it's not just the forced transfer of technology, not just the I.P. theft, not just espionage, but it's also this, this constant attempt to get into our systems, right? And they don't -- and they don't admit it.</p><p>KEANE: Absolutely not. Here is some of the problems we have. Number one, our defenses, obviously isn't as good as they should be, and there's attempt here, clearly to make them -- make them considerably better. It's much better -- it's much bigger problem than just having firewalls.</p><p>You have to have -- you have to be able to see what's coming and do something about it. The second thing is, we don't use our offensive cyber to the degree, I think, we should, because that could help build deterrence.</p><p>What am i talking about? Well, we have ways of determining who is attacking us and when we know that, we should use cyber, our offensive cyber, we're number one in the world at this, Maria, and attack back --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KEANE: -- and disrupt and destroy that source. If we impose that cost on the deliver of the attack, before they conducted that attack, they would have to consider the impact of that cost because we are going to return that offensive capability to them.</p><p>And this administration is taking steps to loosen up the rules and regulation to use offensive cyber, so that it can be delegated down to lower levels and it doesn't have to come to President (INAUDIBLE) very special and finally do it. Because these are things that have to be done, obviously, Maria, at network speed.</p><p>We have to be able to react quickly and it's not something that takes presidential approval in a matter of days or weeks, so that -- that's a good thing and I'm hoping that we clearly get more aggressive in the use of our offensive capability.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, just the fact that she's raising this issue, speaking publicly about it, tells you that maybe we are, in fact -- let me switch gears, General, ask you about the Mid-East, the Syrian troop withdrawal, just months after the President announced that U.S. troops in Syria will be coming home.</p><p>The U.S. is now planning to keep 1,000 troops in the country. That's more than 200 soldiers the administration was originally going to leave in the area, so now we're up to 1,000 troops in Syria, your reaction?</p><p>KEANE: Chairman Dunford, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the 1,000 is likely not accurate number, but it's large than the initial 400 that the administration said. Here is the reason why, there are -- there are three missions that were assigned to our troops. We are and have been assisting the 60,000 Syrian Democratic forces.</p><p>That is what the 2,200 U.S. troops and British troops and French troops are doing currently right now. That's being obviously reduced something under a thousand.</p><p>Mission one, will be to establish a safe zone between Turkey and Syria to protect the Syrian Kurds. Mission two, will be to counter ISIS so they do not re-emerge after we've taken all the territory away from them. And mission three is to operate a base in southern Syria called Al-Tanf which will block the Iranians' desire to have a land bridge in Southern Syria.</p><p>Those are the three missions, but as the first mission, that's a challenge, because the Brits and the French were already there, Maria. They don't want to participate in the safe zone. So, we have to either increase our numbers or find someone else to do that.</p><p>The Brits and French want to continue doing what they are doing and that is, keep their foot on the throat of ISIS. They don't want to be involved in a peace enforcement mission between Turkey and Syrian Kurds. So that is the issue --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KEANE: -- that the Pentagon is facing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And at the end of the day, you know, there's still ISIS and the potential for them to regroup and we fight Iran.</p><p>General, you just mentioned, before we go, you just mentioned General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I just want to point out that the other day, during a Senate hearing, he said, and this was in response to a question about Google, because we know that Google decided to walk away from a contract with the Pentagon because its employees protested.</p><p>They didn't want Google to be in business with the U.S. government. I don't even wanting to there but that's what they said. And you know what General Dunford -- you know what Chairman Dunford said the other day in a Senate hearing was that while Google is working in China, it is actually indirectly helping the Chinese military.</p><p>So here you have, one of the smartest top technology companies of our time, an American company that is able to do everything that it wants to go because of the freedoms and Democracy of this great country, America, they walk away from the Pentagon, they work in China, and they end up indirectly helping the Chinese military? Do they not understand the issues of the day?</p><p>KANE: Yes, it is a stunning revelation. And listen, they have a right to compete and not compete for defense contracts. What they were -- what they pulled away from was the Pentagon's desire to have a very sophisticated comprehensive cloud operation.</p><p>The second thing was there was some imaging of drone videos, so they pulled away from it. But here is what they said, the reason why we don't want to work on a contract with the Pentagon is because it's not in line with our values, their corporate values.</p><p>But it's America's values defended by the United States military that allows that organization to thrive and prosper. I mean, that is incredible and somewhat outrageous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's incredible. Can you imagine if American companies decided back in 1939, to say we're not going to work with the U.S. government because we want a real -- we want to get a foothold in imperial Japan. Give me a break. General, it's great to see you this morning, thank you so much.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: General Jack Keane there. Meanwhile, there's this, Sprint reportedly exposed customer personal data due to a glitch. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines, this just never ends, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: It is something else, Maria, good morning, again. TechCrunch is reporting that some Sprint customers were able to see other customers' information including their names and their phone numbers on their online accounts.</p><p>One user reported saying text messages and caller I.D. settings for other users. Not clear how widespread this is. Sprint has got more than 15 million subscribers.</p><p>Now to Lyft, the road to its IPO is in a pothole in Manhattan court. A judge has denied Lyft's request to block a new minimum wage for drivers. Lyft claims the pay raise implementation by the city's Taxi and Limo Commission hurts drivers because it increases the price for passengers.</p><p>The judge expected to issue a written ruling in the next 30 days. They filed for their IPO two weeks ago, could be 23 billion.</p><p>And then, there is this, guys, a cow on the loose in Indiana, may be able to get a job at Chick-fil-A. This cow is on the move near one of the chain's restaurants. Some people thought, Maria, this was a publicity stunt by Chick-fil-A, it really wasn't, the cow really just escaped.</p><p>No word if the cow is actually going to get some kind of advertising deal from Chick-fil-A. I had to get that to you, it's the best video in the morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's so funny. Will he eat more chicken? Thank you, Cheryl. We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headlines across America now: The Houston Chronicle reporting that the Deer Park Plant fire could last two more days. Authorities are monitoring air quality currently. The fire broke out on Sunday but health officials say that early air quality test showed no serious health risk to people nearby, that's because the plume is high enough that no pollutants are affecting the ground.</p><p>The Chicago Tribune this morning says that Dibs season is officially over in Chicago. Now, go pick up your junk. The Chicago Department of Streets and Transportation is asking people to remove chairs, cones or anything else that they've used to save a parking spot -- they've dug out of the snow. If the items are not moved, they will be picked up for trash collection.</p><p>And the L.A. Times this morning writes about the super bloom shutdown. Lake Elsinore shuts access after crowds descend on poppy fields. Southern California saw record rainfall over the winter, creating good conditions for the super bloom. Over the weekend, Lake Elsinore officials were forced to closed Walker Canyon, saying that the situation escalated beyond available resources.</p><p>All right, we will take a short break. When we come back, doing it for the gram could cost you; how your high-risk online photos could potentially cost you your health and your health insurance. That's next. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some of a few of my favorite Instagram photos. I've been real active on Instagram lately; my (INAUDIBLE) posts a shot right now, actually. And social media posts, though, could get you in trouble. They may increase your future insurance costs. Lauren Simonetti with details on this one. Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, based on the photos that I just saw before you came to me, I think you're going to get a cheaper life insurance policy. You look healthy, you look relax, you lead a healthy lifestyle. New York is actually the first state to provide guidance for how algorithms could be used to look through and comb through one social media. So, what you want to do, is you want to post pictures of you running, doing yoga, meditating, not pictures of you having, you know, drinks at the bar with your co-workers or going sky diving or doing risky things like that because that ups your, your liability for the insurance companies.</p><p>Also, you want to make sure that your friends do not tag you in photos of you doing any of those things. So, it's basically like the rule of thumb, just be careful what you and your friends post about you. This is very underdeveloped technology right now but it is a direction of where we're going with the industry and could also broaden for car insurance and property insurance and things like that. So, right now, when you get life insurance and you take that physical, they get your blood test, they get your urine. They basically have an assessment of how healthy of a lifestyle you live, how healthy of a person you are.</p><p>They could start to you use and they are starting to use the social media to add to that narrative. Is it fair? I've been sky diving, Maria, I don't sky dive -- I've done it. Does that mean I shouldn't post a picture of it because it means that one time, I did something negative I'm going to have a higher premium because of it. Or conversely, I did yoga, I do yoga, all of the time, but you can post a picture of you doing something healthy once, it doesn't mean that that's your lifestyle, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I agree with you. I love yoga. And you know, a lot of people do post stuff like that. You know, but the younger generations do not care what they put, they're just putting stuff out there not realizing that later it's -- it could come up to bite you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: In the wallet. So, again, it goes to the moral of the story as always: be careful what you post because it could make certain things more expensive and we might start to see other industries do this if they're not already. Oh, those are mine -- look, I'm a very healthy person minus the picture down on the right. We eat a lot of pizza.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like the pizza shot. Dagen, you're active on Instagram too. I'm loving Instagram. What have you posted lately, and are you thinking about this kind of stuff that Lauren is telling us?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm basically homebound most of the time in my apartment with my dog. So, it's a lot of Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Ramon and Charlie.</p><p>BARTIROMO: To life Charlie and Ramon, I know that. All right, we'll take a short break. Lauren, thank you. When we come back, Elon's cool sneakers; how you can score Musk's custom Tesla branded Jordans. Next hour, right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Back in a minute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

panels because I think they can be used up to a certain height is that right this is where it gets really really complicated over the weekend the government the chance of the Exchequer the finance Minister in the UK came out and said in fact these panels would have been banned in the UK if they had been used and that would follow regulation in the US the got similar regulation there and in parts of Europe where bands as well now has become slightly less clear Theresa may the <person><nameText>Prime Minister </nameText></person>asked specifically about this the house of Commons today and didn't seem to gave quite a definitive answer I think one thing that Gonen talk about now is these building regulations on whether this material was legal to put on the outside this building OK we might know more about that later on you greener about the talking to other people locally about what their fears aren't just isn't some people who can speak to to see that this is a new board of all if you the stuff that's done how many years less quiet this is costing them money that they need to shore up the need to swap the health and safety the this is the first priority so I do hope it gets done as soon as possible to still be there for all of us have seen my father was absolute tragedy for this team very different buildings people off buildings and 70s she was 3 years old to be a bit of a modern too far proved technology and I think the committee concerned about of about come for the club so it is good to happen with that the fight in them all I think what would happen we have been living here and and knowing me we're not safe yet no I am very disappointed I am basing should be checked before happen people we change that I think local resident talking about getting the block checks out before they move in fact we understand it was checked out with a local authority in that case and was passed again it comes back to this idea of regulation AHL are how blocks in the UK really safe enough people living at the moment that's what's he The him living his books I wonder and this should have been banned in other countries but we think it is used to quite widely internationally as well Jim Thank you very much indeed of now the plight of migrants and refugees fleeing war-torn countries seeking entering Europe will be discussed by EU leaders meeting in Brussels today the BBC's been told about a makeshift prison in Libya where hundreds of African migrants are being held for for ransom as go back to David joins us now from Brussels for a summit David Tim thanks very much indeed yes issues of asylum and what do migrants very much one of the issues on the agenda as the security full stop really and perhaps no surprise had the perfect prompted today as a Belgian police have arrested 4 people in connection with the attempted terror attack at the central station here in Brussels on Tuesday obvious ramifications there was a lot of talk about now with Julia part of the genie who is the security reporter for Politico Julia thanks for joining us It's almost daily fodder at the moment which is a terrible situation to be in do you get any sense apart from the visibility for example of a Belgian police on the streets that Belgium is better prepared now though for dealing with these sorts of incidents I would say that for sure response times have shortened incredibly the guy was like knocked down within minutes and in London response family's 8 minutes so this is getting better the real problem is prevention and this is not as easy as response times because how can you prevent someone from hiring a band are like buying a knife so this is I think a real challenge and also the so-called lone Wolves are very difficult to stop because they are not like a planned not like yourself as Spurs part of the prevention is to stop the improvements the gets these people one of the points on the agenda here is efforts to persuade Reinforce the likes of Facebook and other social media platforms to clamp down on incitement to violence it is any chance in this sort of environment that something significant could be achieved I wouldn't expect anything concrete there might be recommendations to like increase co-operation between big tech companies and governments However more then like taking down Twitter account I think the real challenges encryption because we know that nowadays like she had these communicate through telegram and to WhatsApp which are encrypted and therefore is very difficult to monitor their communication and I think it will be very difficult to have some companies like WhatsApp and telegram to agree to read these circles because that would basically brick give bring them out of business what what could the weight of 28 EU member states do then to think in terms of of influence persuasion for sure they could Mount public opinion pressure on them and make them feel like responsible make them feel like they have

right Let's get over to Arum with all the business News and how Amazon is splashing the cash special K it's still pretty money left right and centre and it is absolutely an amazing story this hour online retailing right where we are going freight I can sense the next hour later I Let's talk about the online retailing giant because it revealed another set of mind-boggling numbers sales numbers CEO Jeff base of his efforts to make one-day delivery for the the norm actually for Prime customers is paying off with accelerating sales growth shares have fallen though because investors they were disappointed with just how little profit am on is making on all of that business here are some of the details can make revenues all the money rating it made just over 63 billion $ on top 3 months the 3 months to the end of June that was up 20% on the same period last year but only around 2.6 billion of that will profit certainly there's a said less than what investors were hoping and it is forecasting proffered that could be lower in the current quarter of his current 3 month period were in vain spending big 800 million $ plus in the past 3 months alone just to try of one-day delivery on more products again Jeff base of is now available on 10 million items and that it certainly boosting sales is facing growing pressure over she's size and power it's phasing trust investigations in the US along with other tech giants and earlier this month the Or so began an investigation into whether Amazon's his blue using it wrong as a market place to provide a that it will just be live director of data and analytics at sea space and joins us just think make heavy weather and talk about this one-day delivery because people outside the US would be surprised if that's not a one-day delivery is not the law of now it's not a measure of Americans tuning delivery is normal that something that I am I'm paying years and years ago a it is but for now for 5 days of the new livery but here in the UK is something that we expect and so for businesses saying they want invest in more rate now a significant number of people had at its most concentrated new YorkLA the never talk about talking the difference between the UK and you rights bigger some spirit of logistics that challenge that huge is why Yes invest $ 100 million in order to make that work I think that you know the interesting thing is that girl they have consistently always focused on customers need more than anything else and Nina from recession 1000 St Piran's day if you focus on customer need to focus on meeting customer expectations that drives long-term profitability he never focus on for Kamprad not deaf we have and it is all much playing a rule in the sinking in the city of almost forcing them to invest have distribution across the us because what schools are everywhere Yeah and they are going more or online their online business is really growing was they just after a two-day shipping to art everyone not just the drivers so Yeah I think this is definitely competitors move but it is also looking ahead to what is a very dominant across the country but it does have a presence in the same with Emma's under Roy Emerson really has the mind share it in a way that one doesn't and so what business is really making a bet on is that by cutting out one are really focusing on this one day differentiated shipping he is only winning more hearts and minds we know what we know already winding Prime subscribers is that they spend more on Nick Pritchard my for There are more loyal so they had he had the custard out through it and he's making that investment just very briefly possible and the these investigations in Europe and the US on and on about its dominance but Hammers on that more than half of its sales come from other business merchant it allows on its platform for army and has provided the reason had the biggest hand yet a significant portion of sales went to small and medium business but really interesting there is out there is interest she will see how that plays out but the same time everyone is making a bet that by giving been a one-stop provider for all different Britain's possible it will gain customers trust again we know it has customers trust people think I am at one of the most trusted companies in the world of business continues to focus on that guilty about it I just feel like a pleasure Thank you very much a lovely weekend we will see you soon It's get blurred stay with the big tech firms in the global controversy over the power of course as saying market dominance because Australia has announced plans for the world's first government department place online platforms such as Facebook across it comes after an 18 month inquiry by the nation's competition watchdog our correspondent Hywel Griffith is in Sydney he's been following the story and explain what regulators may be able to do the ideas being put forward the recommendations of a triple see report the watchdog for consumers and competition maybe more practical steps that users would recognise as things like people having to agree to their data being used

arrive in Japan have to reckon with how it treats those who are already here Stephanie Hegarty BBC news in Japan You're watching GMT some discussion business she's man with got a lot to him as always Thank you very much Europe has made a name for itself in pursuing big fines against big tech companies when they break competition rules on now the US is set to join him according to reports in the wall Street Journal giants such as FacebookGoogle and Twitter may have to ready themselves for a big new investigation Let's talk now to Angus McCallum who is competition law expert at Lancaster University and thanks for joining us so explain to me first of all what exactly is this investigation what a report saying the the European investigations have been gone for a while but it has been much activity in the American side know it looks as if the American authorities after some comments by President are beginning to look into the behaviour of some of these big tech companies but there isn't a huge amount of detail that is exactly what we're looking at what Europe looking at then in the last few years a veritable investigations into Google and potentially also I was on on to some of the platforms and with the advantage they were all services against competitors in the platforms that the control was a big final against Google for Google shopping case at 2.4 billion a few years ago and is likely to be more cases coming out as well and what are the big tech companies saying in response to this the they're worried because essentially that the business model depends on these big successful part and particularly Europe if you've got a big successful platform is likely to be seen as a dominant on the market and that means that you're right for investigation because any of your behaviour on that platform could be seen as abuse might lead to a fine treat to see what sort of behaviour is the authorities are going to attack as being potentially abusive for difficulty you think a US investigation will face that if you like Europe doesn't The American who was slightly different in the sense that there there there are provisions against the concept of monopolisation rather this idea of abuse of dominance of there are some legal differences but the biggest one has been in practice the American authorities have tended to take the view that if you're successful company you should be rewarded viewers accept I am therefore they tend to lack of successful companies making big profits are left to receive was a profit that since been as encouragement for other people to come and compete Europe's always been more suspicious of big successful companies how they achieve that success they've always been more willing to investigate it looks as if the shift in America away from us of letting big companies do their own thing maybe changing slightly as the politics around the presidency get more and more nervous about the that profitability these big companies and the impact on weight and markets really interesting Angus colour Thank you very much indeed Let's take you through some of the day's other business News now shares the Danish jewellery company Pandora a surging

the pitch trying to make investors if something will have to see if they buy we are I just briefly can you think we're seeing an end to these Silicon Valley darling that can command these huge valuations I'm not going to predict the future the company went public last week milder act tonight in the real estate business and author dies its business the the meaning they price their shares relatively high it went public and the axis others shares declined by over 20% in their first day of training and that's something that are operating suggests has made investors even more worried Century investing in the week and any doubt like I gave him it wasn't just Thank you very much now a look at some other business stories making the News shares in General Motors have tumbled a minute strike for almost 50000 workers the shares closed down more than 4% amid reports the industrial action is costing the firm tens of millions of dollars a day Union officials say the two sides still need to agree on wages and health care benefits international air safety regulator is finalising a report that criticises the US approval process for Boeing 77 Max jets regulators also expected to call for a wide ranging reassessment of how complex automated systems should be certified on aircraft built in future US federal aviation administration is expected to come under fire for lack of clarity and transparency Apple and the Irish government doing battling court today on the issue of tax However unlike other big tech firms and governments they are on the same side both trying to overturn a European Commission ruling that ordered the tech giant to pay the Irish government more than 14 billion $ in back taxes so what prompted attacks but why doesn't the Irish government want that money which joining me now is Jonathan Turner a barrister who specialises in competition to run just explain what what the Commission ruling was based on why both the Irish government and Apple a challenging said the Irish government made a ruling in favour of Apple under which Apple paid very little tax on the profits of Apple subsidiaries that are incorporated in Ireland and some extent of rating Ireland's but they came to an agreement with Apple To be very complicated working out our tax how about we pay 10 15% or treat Ahram earnings in Ireland as 10 15% of the costs of operating in Ireland and the Irish tax man said yes fine let's call it a deal and Dem European Commission said well you've granted a special favour to Apple which distorts competition because you're not granting that special favour too many other businesses that operate in Ireland and them that's a concrete to rules in the in EU law which as say the term you mustn't distort competition by granting special benefits in which case how important is this case in terms of the precedent set for the tax arrangements between tech giants and and other countries with the EU Commission has done this before so this is not the first time Apple is of course a very big company so it term shows that the EU is going to take on big companies but again in other areas certainly they have taken on big companies before and EU officials that regard hitters there really one of the reasons why the EU exists is to have the clout to take on the big companies and term to take on the big powers in the world and that this is something they should be doing and will continue you so in one sense it's in important and raises particular issues as to how to deal with when people come to some kind of firm informal deal how far the Commission can investigate whether it's a valid but is not a case of if they close one tax loopholes and is like whack-a-mole the company</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

had Imperial brands saying great there is still significant growth in vaping products is expected to be about 50% this year but less than they had been forecasting they cannot rely on growth in the way they were in the past year indeed I will keep across that and thinking about and we get OK let's talk about President Macron's French government will be presenting the budget for Twenty20 to Parliament later today it will include more tax cuts for working people the government refocuses on boosting household incomes after wave of the yellow vest protests that swept the country though they France's economy minister Bruno Le Maire announced that taxes will be cut by more than 10 billion euros next year your dress what he called it as a social crisis the government claims that 95% of households will be better off the tax cuts come despite weaker economic growth in France in fact official forecast for France too slow to about 1.3% next year and he Macron administration pledged to reform the economy and balance the books by slashing public spending but widespread protests certainly D railed that plan anything as principal economist the euro for Europe at the economic intelligence unit enjoy it Thank you have you with us because it is so we know France is one of the biggest spenders in Europe in terms of what I put into with public spending public sector like many countries France spends more than it earns in taxes cannot afford a 10 billion EURO tax cut well I can certainly forward this interest rates are incredibly low at the moment so France can certainly finances its debt quite sustainably the problem of course is the size of the deficit and in particular the EU rules about the size of the deficit right the Matterhorn that the president had actually successfully brought the French deficit back within 3% of GDP ruled that the EU wants to try and pay is in 27 of course if it's just for the uninitiated the deficit Tip the difference between what they spend what they earn and there's a certain rules within the EU you have got to keep that to to limit it is very frustrating think when you look at France because you get so the Macron governor with her other was coming down yet get a ballot box will ballot box as soon as they make any attempt the French and then very good progess in the race they hit the streets and then that the government have got reverse they play how you ever balance France's box it It's a very difficult question as you say a very good at going out on strike and there's a saying that Francis perhaps unreformable anything when the conference came in there was a real sense that this time will be different there was a real public recognition of the fact that things had to change and certainly there was some change to begin with but with the with the yellow vest protest it really became unsustainable said this is a very people pleasing budget that he is now definitely tamping down that face it if I tell you what not pleasing certainly to the likes of the big tech companies end of the night Trump administration is a gap for tax Google I was on Facebook and Apple this this is a tax bill applied France is very controversial was it is indeed there has been a very hard the G7 in there It's the third with Trump between Trump and Macron they reach an agreement so macaw is imposing a 3% levy on what these big digital firms are earning in France and he had that he is also pushing for a big international package to be agreed the OECD level and if if that gets pushed through then Hill rollback that French tax but it is going ahead very briefly about 30 seconds and there's a survey of a pessimist countries and people are of the Brits the most pessimistic apparent because Brexit number two in the world if France French pessimistic there were 35 hours a week they get some of what I think it's part of the culture is an integral part of the culture that we appreciate is that they very much

The Company has received the support of a majority (65,77%1) of its lenders under the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility and of Bpifrance Participations, an institutional shareholder.</p><p>This Agreement in Principle, whose terms and conditions are described in more details below, provides a framework for long-term sustainability for the Company's businesses, employees, customers and suppliers, and offers its current shareholders an opportunity to participate in the Company's recovery. Based on the proposed new financing plan, gross debt2 is to decrease from the current position of Euro1,444 million to Euro1,102 million. The net debt to EBITDA target (post IFRS 16 adjustments) is around 3x at end of 2021, decreasing thereafter.</p><p>Furthermore, the Company announces the opening today of an accelerated financial safeguard procedure, in order to facilitate the implementation of the Agreement in Principle, by the Paris commercial Court.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Status of the restructuring process</p><p>In February 2020, Technicolor informed the market of its intention to launch a Euro300 million rights issue by June 30th 2020 at the latest, which was authorized by the general meeting of the Company's shareholders on March 23rd 2020. Since then, the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the business activities of the Group, and the uncertainty in global market conditions, have rendered it difficult to launch the initially contemplated rights issue within the contemplated timeline, and have increased the liquidity needs of the Group, which were originally intended to be covered by the rights issue.</p><p>In May, the Company launched a confidential process aiming at raising a new money facility replacing the rights issue in order to finance the group's operations and to repay the $110 million bridge loan due on July 31st.</p><p>Technicolor has received offers both from third parties and from existing creditors, including notably, as announced in the June 4th press release, an offer from a group of creditors representing 59% at that time of the Term Loan B and the Revolving Credit Facility, in the framework of the conciliation proceedings opened on June 2nd. This proposal addresses both the Group's liquidity requirements and the need to deleverage the Company's balance sheet, through a combination of a rights issue (fully backstopped by the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility lenders by way of set-off of their claims) and a capital increase reserved to the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility lenders (subscribed by way of set-off of their claims).</p><p>Upon the recommendation of the Comit\u00e9 Ad Hoc (appointed by the board in the context of the debt restructuring and composed of a majority of independent directors) and given the potential significant dilution implied by such capital increases, the Board of Directors decided on June 5th to appoint, on a voluntary basis, Finexsi (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:g.windsor@finexsi.com\">g.windsor@finexsi.com</email> / 01 43 18 42 42), as independent appraiser, in accordance with article 261-3 of the AMF General Regulation. Finexsi will, in particular, issue a fairness opinion on the proposed capital increases.</p><p>On June 11th, the Company announced the launching of a waiver consent solicitation of its existing lenders under its Credit Facilities, in order to allow the Company to have the option to request (i) the opening in France of a \"proc\u00e9dure de sauvegarde financi\u00e8re acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e\" (which is a form of pre-negotiated safeguard procedure with financial creditors only) (\"SFA\") on Technicolor SA and (ii) the recognition of the SFA in the US, in accordance with applicable regulations (the \"RecognitionProcedure\"), without such actions constituting an event of default under the Credit Facilities.</p><p>After having received waiver consents from the requisite majority of its lenders, the Company therefore decided on June 18th to file a request for the opening in France of an SFA, with the Recognition Procedure to be filed shortly after the SFA has been opened. The SFA was effectively opened today.</p><p>The SFA allows for the implementation of the transaction with only a 2/3 majority of impacted lenders under the Credit Facilities. As of today, lenders representing 65,77% of the principal amount of the Term Loan B and Revolving Credit Facility, as well as Bpifrance Participations, an institutional shareholder holding c. 7.5% of the share capital (the \"Ad Hoc Group\"), support the Agreement in Principle, setting out the terms and conditions of the debt restructuring of the Group, as further detailed below.</p><p>Technicolor intends to implement the debt restructuring provided for by the Agreement in Principle in the framework of an SFA plan which remains subject to conditions precedent as further detailed below, in particular to a favorable vote by an extraordinary shareholders' meeting of the Company (the \"EGM\") on certain aspects of the SFA plan, and to French court approval.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Key Transaction Principles</p><p>The Agreement in Principle sets forth the following key principles (the \"Restructuring\"):</p><p>* New money in an aggregate principal amount, net of Original Issue Discount (\"O.I.D.\") and underwriting fees, equal to Euro 420 million, to be made available, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, to Technicolor's Affiliates by (i) any lenders under the TLB and the RCF who wish to participate, in an amount of Euro400 million (fully underwritten by the Ad Hoc Group excluding Bpifrance Participations) and (ii) by Bpifrance Participations in an amount of Euro20 million (the \"New Money Lenders\"), as follows: \u00a0</p><p>* initial new money to be made available around \u00a0mid-July to Technicolor USA, Inc. (\"TCH US\") (the \"US New Money\"), subject to positive vote of the financial creditors committee, approval of the judge and other conditions, by way of a New York law term loan facility in order to repay in full in cash the $110 million bridge loan which was made available to TCH US on March 5th, 2020 and which is due to be repaid on July 31st 2020 (the \"Bridge Loan\");</p><p>* additional initial new money to be made available on the same date as the US New Money to Tech 6, a direct subsidiary of the Company incorporated in France, subject to positive vote of the financial creditors committee, approval of the judge and other conditions, by way of a New York law notes issue (the\u00a0\"Initial FR New Money\" and, together with the US New Money, the \"Initial New Money\");</p><p>* remaining new money to be made available by the end of August 2020 to Tech 6, subject to among, other conditions, approval of the SFA plan by the Court (the\u00a0\"Balance FR New Money\" and, together with the Initial New Money, the \"New Money\");</p><p>* New Money to be secured by \"fiducies-s\u00fbret\u00e9s\" (equivalent of a trust under French law) in respect of the shares of sub-holding companies, holding quasi all (after some corporate reorganization) of the members of the Group (the \"Fiducies\"), it being specified that the implementation of the Fiducie for the Balance FR New Money will be submitted to a consultative vote of the EGM, in accordance with the AMF recommendation n\u00b02015-05 on transfer of assets. The New Money shall also be secured by certain other security interests, including by security over the assets currently securing the Bridge Loan (for the US New Money only), the TLB and the RCF.</p><p>* The existing indebtedness of the Group (together, the \"Credit Facilities\") will be restructured, as follows: \u00a0</p><p>* Bridge Loan would be repaid using the proceeds of the injection of the US New Money;</p><p>* $125 million asset-based loan made available to TCH US on November 6th 2017 and certain other US members of the Group (the \"ABL Facility\") to be amended, in particular to extend the final maturity date of the loan to December 2023, and to allow the implementation of all of the transactions contemplated herein in order to achieve the Restructuring;</p><p>* Euro725 million plus $290 million term loan facility dated December 6th 2016 (the \"Term LoanB\" or \"TLB\") made available to the Company to be partially equitized as described below and, in respect of the reinstated debt, amended as to extend the maturity to December 2024 with a bullet repayment;</p><p>* Euro250 million revolving credit facility dated December 21st 2016 (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\" or the \"RCF\") made available to the Company (fully drawn to date) to be partially equitized as described below and, in respect of the reinstated debt, amended as to extend the maturity to December 2024 with a bullet repayment.</p><p>* The partial equitization of the debt (up to Euro 660 million) will be structured as follows, subject in particular to (i) the positive vote of the EGM on all resolutions relating to the Restructuring (such resolutions being linked to each other, it being specified that Bpifrance Participations committed to vote in favor of such resolutions, subject to legal or regulatory constraints preventing him from voting, as the case may be) and (ii) approval by the AMF of a prospectus relating to: \u00a0</p><p>* a rights issue of the Company, with shareholders' preferential subscription rights, for a total amount of Euro330 million, at a subscription price of Euro2.98 per share, fully backstopped by the TLB and RCF lenders by way of set-off of their claims at par under the Credit Facilities; Bpifrance Participations will subscribe to the rights issue in cash pro rata its current shareholding (c. 7.5%) on a non-reductible basis (souscription \u00e0 titre irr\u00e9ductible) for an aggregate amount up to Euro25.5 million; any cash proceeds of the rights issue will be used in full to repay the TLB and RCF lenders, at par value;</p><p>* a reserved capital increase of the Company, for a total amount of Euro330 million, at a subscription price of Euro3.58 per share, reserved to the TLB and RCF lenders and which will be fully subscribed by way of set-off against their claims at par under the Credit Facilities;</p><p>* free warrants to be allocated to the New Money lenders (\"New Money Warrants\"), with a 3-month maturity, with an exercise price of Euro0.01, equal to the par value of the shares, and giving access to 7.5% of the share capital of the Company (after the rights issue, the reserved capital increase and the exercise of New Money Warrants, but before exercise of the free warrants by the shareholders);</p><p>* free warrants to be allocated to existing shareholders at the time of the launching of the rights issue, with a 4-year maturity and a strike price equal to the reserved capital increase price (i.e. Euro3.58 per share); the free warrants will give access to 5% of the share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis (i.e., after the rights issue, the reserved capital increase, the exercise of New Money Warrants and the exercise of the free shareholders' warrants). Each existing share will give right to 1 warrant, which will give right to circa 0.8 new share at a price of 3.58 per share.</p><p>* It should be noted that, should the EGM that will be convened on July 20th 2020 decide to vote against one of the resolutions linked to the Restructuring, the SFA plan cannot be approved by the Court and, in this case, the Company will: \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>* petition the court to terminate the SFA proceedings, considering the fact that no SFA plan can be approved; and</p><p>* file for rehabilitation proceedings (redressement judiciaire) in order to implement the debt reorganization as part of a court-approved rehabilitation plan (plan de continuation), failing which quasi all of the Company's assets could be attributed or sold to the New Money Lenders, with the aim to permit continuation of the activities conducted by the Group and trading with clients and suppliers. In this latter case, (i) all employment contracts entered into by the Company will be maintained, (ii) as will the Balance FR New Money and (iii) the liabilities of the Company benefitting from senior legal privileges repaid.</p><p>The Agreement in Principle has received the support of the Board of Directors of the Company. It remains subject to the finalization of the negotiations of its terms as well as negotiations of the necessary documents and agreements.</p><p>Implementation of the Agreement in Principle remains subject also to the usual conditions precedent,which include obtaining the favorable support of impacted lenders under the Credit Facilities as well as judicial authorizations and approvals, evidenced at each of the steps of the proceedings. In essence:</p><p>* Concerning the new money made available to the Group: \u00a0</p><p>* the US New Money and the Initial FR New Money, which shall be made available around mid-July 2020, i.e. during the SFA proceedings, remain notably subject to the authorization of the judge supervising the SFA and to the favorable vote of Technicolor's financial creditors; and \u00a0</p><p>* the Balance FR New Money shall be funded, among other usual conditions precedent, after the favourable vote of the EGM convened on July 20th\u00a02020 and subject to the court's approval of the SFA plan. \u00a0</p><p>* The Restructuring of the Term Loan B and the RCF remains notably subject to (i) the favorable vote of the EGM on the Restructuring, (ii) the court's approval of the SFA plan and (iii) the approval by the AMF of a prospectus relating to the Restructuring. The reinstatement of a portion of those two credit facilities, and the equitization of the balance, shall occur upon settlement and delivery of the rights issue and the reserved capital increase.</p><p>The information contained in this press release and its appendices and annexes is designed to re-establish, in all material respects and where necessary, equal access for the various shareholders and investors to the information relating to the Group.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Next steps : based on legal timetable (indicative calendar)</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">June    22nd    Opening            of             the            SFA           <br/><br/> June    29th    Publication of  the  EGM  meeting  notice  (SFA  rules  allow a<br/>                 shorter     publication      timeline      than      usual)    <br/><br/> July    3rd     Financial Creditors  Committee  votes  on the SFA plan (minimum<br/>                 majority:           2/3           in           value)          <br/><br/>                 Approval of  the  prospectus by the AMF and availability of the<br/> July    10th    independent          expert           report                   <br/><br/>                 Publication     of     the     EGM     convening     notice    <br/><br/>                 First drawdown  of  the  New Money facility for an amount of c.<br/>                 Euro240 million  to  repay  the  Bridge Loan and address the short<br/> Around Mid July term liquidity  needs  of the Group (subject to a positive vote<br/>                 of the financial creditors committee, approval of the judge and<br/>                 other                        conditions)                       <br/><br/>                 Extraordinary shareholders'  meeting  to  vote  on  the capital<br/> July    20th    increases and  the  Fiducie  implemented for the Balance FR New<br/>                 Money                                                          <br/><br/>                 Court approval of the SFA plan (subject to financial creditors'<br/> End  of   July  committee favourable  vote  at a 2/3 majority and favorable EGM<br/>                 vote)                                                          <br/><br/>                 Second drawdown  of  the  New Money facility for the remainder,<br/>                 i.e. c  Euro  180  million  (subject  to,  among other conditions,<br/>                 approval of  the  SFA  plan or continuation plan by the Court )<br/><br/> End of  August  Alternatively, if  no  SFA  Plan  (or continuation plan) can be<br/>                 approved by  the Court before end of August, the Balance FR New<br/>                 Money should be made available to Tech 6 in September, provided<br/>                 quasi all  the  Group's  assets have been attributed or sold to<br/>                 the benefit  of  the  lenders  as  part  of  a  rehabilitation <br/>                 proceedings.                                                   <br/><br/> September       If Court approval on the SFA plan is received, launching of the<br/>                 capital    increase     and     allocation    of    warrants   <br/><br/></pre></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Key business trends</p><p>2022022 Reforecast</p><p>* Early in the second quarter of 2020, the Group established a 3 step process to develop a new 2022022 Business Plan which included:</p><p>* A revised forecast for 2020 including an extension of its Panorama transformation plans;</p><p>* Two scenarios, a Base Case and a High Case Business Plan, to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 crisis recovery. \u00a0</p><p>* Some contingencies were included in the Base Case to reflect this uncertainty, which mainly related to recovery of the Production Services and DVD services new release activities.

High case): (10%) to (9%);</p><p>* The DVD Services division will be negatively impacted given the delay in new theatre releases, mitigated by catalogue sales in the US and Europe which are showing signs of resilience;</p><p>* Broadly normal market conditions expected thereafter, but still negatively impacted by changed consumer behavior (increased streaming, etc.) and continued structural market decline;</p><p>* EBITDA margin to recover on the back of accelerated cost savings initiatives and contract renewals that include volume-based pricing principles.</p><p>* Production Services:</p><p>* Revenues CAGR 19-22 (Base to High case): +3% to +10%;</p><p>* Film &amp; Episodic VFX revenues largely impacted by the cessation of all live-action shoots, pushed back to third / fourth quarter 2020 and 2021; visual effects cannot be produced until live shoots are completed:</p><p>* Volume of movies under production in 2023 expected to be similar to what was originally planned for in 2022, with more weight toward episodic vs. tentpole movies;</p><p>* Animation &amp; Games not as severely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis as it is less dependent on live action;</p><p>* Advertising expects more resilience to the COVID-19 as it is less reliant on large crewed, on-location live shoots, and has a customer base that includes Big Tech companies;</p><p>* Post-Production impacted for similar reasons as Film &amp; Episodic VFX:</p><p>* Still handles a larger number of smaller and quicker turnaround projects and can take on work from clients with whom Film &amp; Episodic VFX does not typically work at the beginning of live shooting. This along with Film &amp; Episodic VFX growth should allow a faster recovery in the second half.</p><p>18-month liquidity forecasts to December 2021</p><p>* The proposed Euro420 million new financing has been designed to cover the Group's needs in the short / medium term.

He is slumming it, of course. The real tech masters of the universe - the billionaires - have moved inland where they can be properly private and properly rich. The Stanford boss has to make do with the minor Silicon Valley royalty - the lawyers, accountants and publicists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But hey, it's still very nice. Second homes stretch as far as the eye can see up and down the dunes; castles in the sand. In fact - who says these guys lack humour? - one is actually designed like a castle, complete with turrets. These are the men and women who have made a killing from our obsession with tech.</p><p>And now that they are in their forties and fifties and own several homes and have paid off their first husbands and wives as well as the Stanford debt, what do they want? The question is fundamental to the modern world. These are not soap powder magnates, or shipbuilders, or indeed carmakers with dodgy emissions data; they created the entire edifice of modern life. They have a pivotal role in the world - a role acknowledged this month by the boss of MI5 who wants them to offer more help to the security services. Not to mention the Chinese and US presidents who have their own beefs with Silicon Valley.</p><p><person><nameText>Xi Jinping </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>have been fighting a battle through the tech companies. Obama recently urged them to improve cyber security and, on the first day of his state visit to the US this week, the Chinese president met the no-tie brigade: the big beasts of American technology such as the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and the Apple CEO Tim Cook.</p><p>Everyone is courting tech. But what they want, these global titans, these Palo Alto-based dataminers, is less clear. Are they patriots? Are they megalomaniacs? Are they money driven? Do they care about bringing people together - as their company vibes suggest - or are they geeks who wouldn't know a friend from a general counsel? This is what MI5, and <person><nameText>Xi Jinping, </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Barack Obama, </nameText></person>and every other mover and shaker, needs to know. What makes the Valley tick? The Grateful Dead is one answer. LSD. Free love. The communes that San Francisco spawned in the 1960s are, according to the pre-eminent historian of the dotcom revolution, the real begetters of the modern cyberworld. In his modest office at Stanford University, Fred Turner is asking some uncomfortable questions. He sees the American technology industry as unique in the annals of capitalism. The counterculture ethos that played such a big part in its original, mould-breaking thinking is now, he believes, in danger of bringing it all crashing down.</p><p>The industry contains all the hubris of the original hippy communes, including \"a turning toward the self as the basis of political change, of social action. I think that's something you see all through the Valley ... You see that rhetoric leveraged when Google and other firms say: \"Don't regulate us. We need to be creative. We need to be free to pursue our satisfaction because that's ultimately what will provide a satisfying society.\"</p><p>As one of the counterculture gurus put it back in the day: \"Building a good society is not primarily a social but a psychic task.\" Put simply, hippies - and their well-to-do descendants - do not believe in politics. But their sense of themselves as being bigger and better than the society they spring from is not driven by greed and money. It is about something deeper: they see themselves as gods, and cannot grasp why any reasonable person would get in their way. As a famous article in Wired magazine put it back in 1997: \"We're facing 25 years of prosperity, freedom, and a better environment for the whole world. You got a problem with that?\" They throw out the same challenge today to the Chinese, to MI5, and to the US government - which, according to Fred Turner, is completely at sea in the techdominated world: \"The American state does not understand what is going on ... Facebook, Google and the others are just going through the world and even with its extensive surveillance apparatus, the state is mostly just trying to catch up.\"</p><p>The power of Silicon Valley is a challenge to all governments and all peoples. And it comes down to a single, simple, question which they are asking in London, Washington, and Beijing: who's really in charge?</p><p>MI5 believes social media must do more to help the spooks</p><p>Big Tech has all the hubris of the original Californian hippies</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The 1960s counterculture helped create the Californian tech boom</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-104326459</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H0T-C481-DY9P-N1JJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>September 25, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>STANFORD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Scotland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TRZ</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ERP</classCode><className>UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000CEE9</classCode><className>CORPORATE COUNSEL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp;

The Stanford boss has to make do with the minor Silicon Valley royalty - the lawyers, accountants and publicists. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But hey, it's still very nice. Second homes stretch as far as the eye can see up and down the dunes; castles in the sand. In fact - who says these guys lack humour? - one is actually designed like a castle, complete with turrets. These are the men and women who have made a killing from our obsession with tech. </p><p>And now that they are in their forties and fifties and own several homes and have paid off their first husbands and wives as well as the Stanford debt, what do they want? </p><p>The question is fundamental to the modern world. These are not soap powder magnates, or shipbuilders, or indeed carmakers with dodgy emissions data; they created the entire edifice of modern life. They have a pivotal role in the world - a role acknowledged this month by the boss of MI5 who wants them to offer more help to the security services. Not to mention the Chinese and US presidents who have their own beefs with Silicon Valley. </p><p><person><nameText>Xi Jinping </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>have been fighting a battle through the tech companies. Obama recently urged them to improve cyber security and, on the first day of his state visit to the US this week, the Chinese president met the no-tie brigade: the big beasts of American technology such as the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and the Apple CEO Tim Cook. </p><p>Everyone is courting tech. </p><p>But what they want, these global titans, these Palo Alto-based data-miners, is less clear. Are they patriots? Are they megalomaniacs? Are they money driven? Do they care about bringing people together - as their company vibes suggest - or are they geeks who wouldn't know a friend from a general counsel? </p><p>This is what MI5, and <person><nameText>Xi Jinping, </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Barack Obama, </nameText></person>and every other mover and shaker, needs to know. What makes the Valley tick? </p><p>The Grateful Dead is one answer. LSD. Free love. The communes that San Francisco spawned in the 1960s are, according to the pre-eminent historian of the dotcom revolution, the real begetters of the modern cyberworld. In his modest office at Stanford University, Fred Turner is asking some uncomfortable questions. He sees the American technology industry as unique in the annals of capitalism. The counterculture ethos that played such a big part in its original, mould-breaking thinking is now, he believes, in danger of bringing it all crashing down. </p><p>The industry contains all the hubris of the original hippy communes, including \"a turning toward the self as the basis of political change, of social action. I think that's something you see all through the Valley . . . You see that rhetoric leveraged when Google and other firms say: \"Don't regulate us. We need to be creative. We need to be free to pursue our satisfaction because that's ultimately what will provide a satisfying society.\"</p><p>As one of the counterculture gurus put it back in the day: \"Building a good society is not primarily a social but a psychic task.\" Put simply, hippies - and their well-to-do descendants - do not believe in politics. But their sense of themselves as being bigger and better than the society they spring from is not driven by greed and money. It is about something deeper: they see themselves as gods, and cannot grasp why any reasonable person would get in their way. As a famous article in Wired magazine put it back in 1997: \"We're facing 25 years of prosperity, freedom, and a better environment for the whole world. You got a problem with that?\"</p><p>They throw out the same challenge today to the Chinese, to MI5, and to the US government - which, according to Fred Turner, is completely at sea in the tech- dominated world: \"The American state does not understand what is going on . . . Facebook, Google and the others are just going through the world and even with its extensive surveillance apparatus, the state is mostly just trying to catch up.\"</p><p>The power of Silicon Valley is a challenge to all governments and all peoples. And it comes down to a single, simple, question which they are asking in London, Washington, and Beijing: who's really in charge? </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-23120319</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H0T-5GB1-JCJY-G49W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"735\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>September 25, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The dress code demanded white shirts, khaki trousers and black helmets. \"Look good,\" organisers of the Unite the Right march told them. \"Dress in a way that's flattering, not in a way that makes you look like a clown... If your appearance is seriously lacking (morbidly obese, disfigured etc) please do not go to the rally.\" Masks, Ku Klux Klan hats and Nazi symbols were out; shields were preferred to knives as they signified defence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The far right, Julia Ebner explains in this riveting and often deeply disturbing book, is obsessed with image. The brand they tirelessly promote, though, is \"we versus them\". Women in the movement no longer conform to old-fashioned gender stereotypes: now it is all mini-skirts, hoodies, exercise regimens and Instagram accounts. Fashion and lifestyle are gateways to their nefarious views, helping modern extremist movements draw in younger supporters. This isn't exclusive to the far right, either. \"Isis,\" Ebner writes, \"has modelled itself as a cool counter-culture... brand that resists mainstream thinking while still adhering to the latest cultural touchstones.\"</p><p>The author is a counter-extremism expert who works at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London. She spends her days briefing national intelligence units and directing social-media sites on the removal of white supremacist material. This book explores her extracurricular activities, going undercover and adopting five different online identities to investigate jihadis, white nationalists, conspiracy theorists, radical misogynists and Christian fundamentalists. \"During my working hours I was the cat,\" she notes, \"but in my spare time I joined the mice.\"</p><p>Technology has put a rocket under these movements again. Extremist leaders create hidden online communities to stoke antisocial behaviour in the wider world. They use technology to amplify their message, such as the terrorist in New Zealand last year who live-streamed his murderous mosque rampages. They use it as a weapon: in 2018, Hamas created a fake dating app to target Israel Defense Forces soldiers with malicious software hiding behind women's profiles. And they use it to spread misinformation: hardline Brexit campaigns were aided by QAnon, a conspiracy-theory site.</p><p>Ebner ventures into these virtual dystopias of hate storms and trolling armies, into messenger groups of jihadi brides and onto white supremacist dating sites. The parts she seems most disturbed by, though, are the forums where women are brainwashed into being submissive \"trad wives\". Their proponents claim all women have a \"sexual market value\" determined by health, age, femininity and chastity - personality be damned. In this warped world view, women are supposed to surrender, to take the blame when they are verbally abused. Heartbreakingly, Ebner writes, most \"trad wives\" are radicalised by the search for love.</p><p>Her investigation crosses into the physical world, too: she visits a neo-Nazi rock festival in Ostritz, Germany, and an Airbnb in Brixton, London, where Generation Identity, a European far right group aimed at the young, is hosting an event for new recruits. Her aim is to expose the way extremist groups manipulate their members in the hope that this will prevent others from being radicalised by them. Her book is a call, too, for policy-makers to rethink their response to extremism, arguing for a holistic approach that focuses on individuals, rather than simply on laws and regulations.</p><p>Neo-Nazi groups especially have developed a canny digital strategy. In their forums and chat rooms, there are insider jokes and taboo-breaking humour to draw in a young audience seeking a sense of belonging. The far right appropriates and weaponises pop culture, from Taylor Swift to Japanese anime. The Matrix science fiction trilogy is a particular gold mine, with its premise that humanity is trapped inside a simulated reality; the far right argues that we are all similarly being misled about the world, and we need to take their \"red pill\" to see it. Red pills are lies presented as truths by the far right: their ultimate red pill is that the Holocaust never happened.</p><p>As Ebner sets out, the far right's aim is to enter the mainstream. White supremacist chat rooms might trumpet the words \"race war now\", but they pass themselves off as champions of free speech. Their bid to shift the Overton window, the range of ideas deemed acceptable, appears to be working. </p><p>                   Men Among the Ruins                   </p><p>, a work by the Italian philosopher Julius Evola that they draw upon, was cited by Donald Trump's former political adviser Steve Bannon. At Charlottesville, where the civil-rights activist Heather Heyer was killed,the president later claimed there were \"very fine people on both sides\".</p><p>Ebner isn't quite despairing about all this. At the end, she offers 10 solutions that straddle big tech, politics and civil society to address extremism, including the creation of internet \"elves\" to combat the trolls. What she never fully sets out is how big these movements are: are they niche elements, or sprouting up next door? Yet this book still feels like a punch to the stomach: these pernicious creeds are lurking in the darkest recesses of the internet, waiting to come out into the light.</p><p>                   Going Dark: The Secret Social Lives of Extremists by Julia Ebner                   Bloomsbury \u00a316.99 pp348                   Looking for something to read?

He's talking about going from managing director of global technology and operations at Deutsche Bank to founding The Source, a digital lifestyle business that satisfies the emerging affluents' every need - from food, wine, travel and childcare to art, home interiors and fitness. The Source's app acts as portal to a range of high-end brands and providers, with suppliers including wine company Honest Grapes, jeweller Boodles and Original Traveller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Having watched friends and colleagues struggle over the years to balance work and life, Crabb is determined to build a business that revolutionises how we access products and services. The firm's target user is someone earning around \u00a3150,000, but Crabb is quick to stress that it's not about exclusivity. Concierge, he says, sounds stuffy and elitist, but he has created a tailored service, where client and business are personally introduced and interact in a virtual community - think of it as a pocket PA.</p><p>CHANGING LANES Crabb spent 20 years in the City. Deutsche Bank was a \"fantastic place to work\" - he had a new role every 18 months and sat on its UK board - but over the last few years, his days got \"more repetitive as risk was curtailed\". The City has changed, he says. \"I saw it go from being an innovative environment to a circumspect one. It had to figure out its place in society and, charged with undoing past deeds, how the regulatory framework was going to work.\" He still loved it, but for Crabb, risk-taking and variety are vital: \"every day needs to look different.\" Of course, this new life is a different world in many ways - \"our office sofa is a velour number from my partner's student days\" - but working for himself has been a dream since childhood. Having spent the first half of 2014 juggling The Source and working at the bank parttime, he became a full-time entrepreneur in the summer. Does he wish he'd jumped sooner? \"Maybe marginally - perhaps two or three years. But the City is the next best thing to owning your own business.\"</p><p>THE RIGHT APPROACH And it's clear from Crabb's advice to other entrepreneurs that his career to date stands him in good stead for growing a business. He's keen to hammer home, for example, the importance of knowing where your strengths lie. His tech specialist co-founder, Akshay Rangnekar, \"decelerates [Crabb's] 1,000mph. I'm extraordinarily impatient; he counters that. You must figure out what you're good at, and don't spend time on things you're not.\"</p><p>But Crabb owes the City more than just business acumen: \"you learn about people, and how to solve problems.\" The internet, he says, has \"made our lives easier, but has also done the opposite\" - switching off is near impossible, but with technology at our finger tips, there are plenty of ways to capitalise on a consumer-driven economy.</p><p>The Source team believes that most of us just want to speak to a real person - \"people want to get back to that basic interaction\". They're also aware that many luxury and boutique services don't usually develop their own digital channels - there's reciprocal value to be had in helping them to reach their target market, \"making them relevant in the digital age\".</p><p>A GLOBAL VISION London was the ideal place to launch - five months in, and the business has a target of 5,000 members by March 2015, which it's set to meet. Crabb says the best response has actually been from non-Londoners in the City, because \"we're turning an outsider into an insider,\" which can be priceless.</p><p>Six months in, and Crabb and Rangnekar are ready to go further afield. Next on the list is New York. The Source's first round of external fundraising was completed in the summer, raising \u00a3500,000 in a matter of days, at a valuation of \u00a35m. The next round, with a target of \u00a32.5m at a \u00a325m valuation, has just kicked off. By the third quarter of 2015, they plan to have added a third city - Hong Kong or Dubai.</p><p>\"The way big tech is thinking, ondemand is the future,\" says Crabb. Rather than having to trawl the internet yourself, getting what you need and want \"will just be about asking\".</p><p>JAMES CRABB CV Company name: Source - lifestyle at your fingertips Founded: October 2013 Number of staff: 14 Job title: Founder and chief executive Age: 43 Born: Portsmouth Lives: Chiswick Studied: Accounting and Finance, Southbank University Drinking: Big New World red wine Eating: Most things Currently reading: To my children (aged seven and 10) Favourite business book: The Lean Startup, by Eric Ries Talents: My wife would say I'm tenacious (perhaps to the point of being aggravating), and that I'm good at communicating and reading people Heroes: My wife - she keeps me grounded First ambition: To run my own business Motto: \"Fortune favours the bold\" Most likely to say: \"Can I get that sooner?\" Least likely to say: \"Take as long as you like\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>James Crabb's City career has helped him catalyse his business's growth</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-93758100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DV7-TM91-JBVM-Y1TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 City A.M.

Amazon, Apple, General Motors and Volkswagen are among the 169 multinational firms that have joined RE100, a global initiative to reach the goal of 100 percent renewable electricity. And now the global players are starting to aim even higher and encouraging their suppliers to go carbon-free. </p><p>Samsung Electronics, a key supplier to Apple, became the first Korean tech giant in June of last year to make a commitment to rely 100 percent on renewable energy to power every one of its factories and office buildings in the US, Europe and China. But that did not mean Samsung was joining RE100. Its commitment excluded Korea. Samsung said it 'can't join RE100' because of the lack of infrastructure here. Indeed, no Korean firm has joined the initiative to date no matter how strong its global presence. In Samsung's plants in the US, Europe and China, the firm plans to source renewable energy from private power companies in the host nations.Here, the firm has instead vowed to build its own solar panels at its headquarters in Suwon -- but those panels couldn't possibly cover all Samsung's domestic energy needs. This is because it is impossible to purchase renewable power from private firms in Korea. The state-run Korea Electric Power Corporation is the nation's only energy provider, and it does not specify where its power comes from -- renewable sources, coal, liquefied natural gas or nuclear energy. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acOf course, inability to purchase renewable energy is not an issue only for Samsung Electronics. Apple, BMW and Volkswagen have all begun to pressure their Korean suppliers -- including SK Hynix, LG Chem and Samsung SDI -- to expand their use of renewable energy. Those calls are expected to grow, and to affect more and more Korean suppliers working with different global clients. Chun Young-whan, a professor at Hongik University, said Korean companies may have to 'relocate their factories overseas' when RE100 becomes a reality. Although that may have been hyperbole, it's true that going green is no longer a matter of morality for many companies -- it's a matter of economics. In November of last year, 11 large Korean companies, including Samsung, SK hynix, Shinhan Financial Group and AB InBev, called for the creation of a system where they can purchase renewable energy in order to satisfy their global clients. The Korean government is now mulling the adoption of a green pricing system as a stopgap measure.Green pricing involves providing an optional service where customers agree to pay a premium on their electric bills to use renewable energy. It is already in place in the US, Europe and Australia. 'Although it may be a stopgap measure, this appears to be a realistic measure for now because the adoption of green pricing is much easier than bringing private companies to the energy market,' said Lee Jong-oh, director of the Korea Sustainability Investing Forum, a local civic group.A green pricing system can be implemented simply by revising Kepco's regulations and would not require the enactment of new legislation. The Energy Ministry is reportedly considering setting renewable energy rates around 10 percent higher than current energy rates, but companies argue that a premium of 2 to 3 percent is more appropriate. Green pricing may be a step forward for Korea, where the use of renewable energy is lower than in other OECD nations, industry watchers say. But the nation should move toward the opening of the energy market, they say, to provide companies with dependable supplies of renewable energy at more affordable prices. 'Green pricing may be an option, but that will not be a good solution because it does not give much incentive to companies, which have to pay higher prices. To better achieve the nation's renewable goal, Korea should open its energy market and boost investment in renewable energy,' said Zi Sheng Neoh, a managing consultant with Wood Mackenzie, which specializes in consulting businesses on power and renewables.Many energy experts, including Neoh, and environmental groups call for the adoption of corporate power purchase agreements as a way of opening the energy market. Corporate PPAs allow companies to purchase renewable energy directly from private energy generators at fixed prices over a number of years.Globally, tech giants including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon have already signed long-term PPAs with large wind and photovoltaic parks. In 2017, Apple signed a deal to run its Nevada data center with solar power for about 3 cents per kilowatt hour -- possibly the cheapest contracted starting price for solar power in the US. In contrast, Korea's industrial power prices are normally more than 60 won (5 cents) per kilowatt hour. In Korea, Rep. Kim Sung-whan of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea is preparing to 'propose a bill related to corporate PPAs in the first half of this year' with the aim of expanding renewable energy. Lee Jin-sun, a campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia in Seoul, said her organization would make continued efforts to persuade the National Assembly and the government to adopt corporate PPAs, calling them 'the most effective system to purchase renewable energy and to increase new renewable facilities to reduce carbon emissions.'If Korea's top 20 biggest energy-consuming companies decide to source renewable energy for 100 percent of their energy needs, 43.25 gigawatt solar power generators will be installed and the nation can reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by around 25 million tons, predicted Kim Seung-wan, a professor at Chungnam National University.

Amazon, Apple, General Motors and Volkswagen are among the 169 multinational firms that have joined RE100, a global initiative to reach the goal of 100 percent renewable electricity. And now the global players are starting to aim even higher and encouraging their suppliers to go carbon-free. </p><p>Samsung Electronics, a key supplier to Apple, became the first Korean tech giant in June of last year to make a commitment to rely 100 percent on renewable energy to power every one of its factories and office buildings in the US, Europe and China. But that did not mean Samsung was joining RE100. Its commitment excluded Korea. Samsung said it 'can't join RE100' because of the lack of infrastructure here. Indeed, no Korean firm has joined the initiative to date no matter how strong its global presence. In Samsung's plants in the US, Europe and China, the firm plans to source renewable energy from private power companies in the host nations.Here, the firm has instead vowed to build its own solar panels at its headquarters in Suwon -- but those panels couldn't possibly cover all Samsung's domestic energy needs. It is impossible to fill the gap by purchasing renewable power from private firms in Korea. The state-run Korea Electric Power Corporation is the nation's only energy provider, and it does not specify where its power comes from -- renewable sources, coal, liquefied natural gas or nuclear energy. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acOf course, inability to purchase renewable energy is not an issue only for Samsung Electronics. Apple, BMW and Volkswagen have all begun to pressure their Korean suppliers -- including SK Hynix, LG Chem and Samsung SDI -- to expand their use of renewable energy. Those calls are expected to grow, and to affect more and more Korean suppliers working with different global clients. Chun Young-whan, a professor at Hongik University, said Korean companies may have to 'relocate their factories overseas' when RE100 becomes a reality. Although that may have been hyperbole, it's true that going green is no longer a matter of morality for many companies -- it's a matter of economics. In November of last year, 11 large Korean companies, including Samsung, SK hynix, Shinhan Financial Group and Oriental Brewery, called for the creation of a system where they can purchase renewable energy in order to satisfy their global clients. The Korean government is now mulling the adoption of a green pricing system as a stopgap measure.Green pricing involves providing an optional service where customers agree to pay a premium on their electric bills to use renewable energy. It is already in place in the US, Europe and Australia. 'Although it may be a stopgap measure, this appears to be a realistic measure for now because the adoption of green pricing is much easier than bringing private companies to the energy market,' said Lee Jong-oh, director of the Korea Sustainability Investing Forum, a local civic group.A green pricing system can be implemented simply by revising Kepco's regulations and would not require the enactment of new legislation. The Energy Ministry is reportedly considering setting renewable energy rates around 10 percent higher than current energy rates, but companies argue that a premium of 2 to 3 percent is more appropriate. Green pricing may be a step forward for Korea, where the use of renewable energy is lower than in other OECD nations, industry watchers say. But the nation should move toward the opening of the energy market, they say, to provide companies with dependable supplies of renewable energy at more affordable prices. 'Green pricing may be an option, but that will not be a good solution because it does not give much incentive to companies, which have to pay higher prices. To better achieve the nation's renewable goal, Korea should open its energy market and boost investment in renewable energy,' said Zi Sheng Neoh, a managing consultant with Wood Mackenzie, which specializes in consulting businesses on power and renewables.Many energy experts, including Neoh, and environmental groups call for the adoption of corporate power purchase agreements as a way of opening the energy market. Corporate PPAs allow companies to purchase renewable energy directly from private energy generators at fixed prices over a number of years.Globally, tech giants including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon have already signed long-term PPAs with large wind and photovoltaic parks. In 2017, Apple signed a deal to run its Nevada data center with solar power for about 3 cents per kilowatt hour -- possibly the cheapest contracted starting price for solar power in the US. In contrast, Korea's industrial power prices are normally more than 60 won (5 cents) per kilowatt hour. In Korea, Rep. Kim Sung-whan of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea is preparing to 'propose a bill related to corporate PPAs in the first half of this year' with the aim of expanding renewable energy. Lee Jin-sun, a campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia in Seoul, said her organization would make continued efforts to persuade the National Assembly and the government to adopt corporate PPAs, calling them 'the most effective system to purchase renewable energy and to increase new renewable facilities to reduce carbon emissions.'If Korea's top 20 biggest energy-consuming companies decide to source renewable energy for 100 percent of their energy needs, 43.25 gigawatt solar power generators will be installed and the nation can reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by around 25 million tons, predicted Kim Seung-wan, a professor at Chungnam National University.

Amazon, Apple, General Motors and Volkswagen are among the 169 multinational firms that have joined RE100, a global initiative to reach the goal of 100 percent renewable electricity. And now the global players are starting to aim even higher and encouraging their suppliers to go carbon-free. </p><p>Samsung Electronics, a key supplier to Apple, became the first Korean tech giant in June of last year to make a commitment to rely 100 percent on renewable energy to power every one of its factories and office buildings in the US, Europe and China. But that did not mean Samsung was joining RE100. Its commitment excluded Korea. Samsung said it 'can't join RE100' because of the lack of infrastructure here. Indeed, no Korean firm has joined the initiative to date no matter how strong its global presence. In Samsung's plants in the US, Europe and China, the firm plans to source renewable energy from private power companies in the host nations.Here, the firm has instead vowed to build its own solar panels at its headquarters in Suwon -- but those panels couldn't possibly cover all Samsung's domestic energy needs. This is because it is impossible to purchase renewable power from private firms in Korea. The state-run Korea Electric Power Corporation is the nation's only energy provider, and it does not specify where its power comes from -- renewable sources, coal, liquefied natural gas or nuclear energy. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acOf course, inability to purchase renewable energy is not an issue only for Samsung Electronics. Apple, BMW and Volkswagen have all begun to pressure their Korean suppliers -- including SK Hynix, LG Chem and Samsung SDI -- to expand their use of renewable energy. Those calls are expected to grow, and to affect more and more Korean suppliers working with different global clients. Chun Young-whan, a professor at Hongik University, said Korean companies may have to 'relocate their factories overseas' when RE100 becomes a reality. Although that may have been hyperbole, it's true that going green is no longer a matter of morality for many companies -- it's a matter of economics. In November of last year, 11 large Korean companies, including Samsung, SK hynix, Shinhan Financial Group and AB InBev, called for the creation of a system where they can purchase renewable energy in order to satisfy their global clients. The Korean government is now mulling the adoption of a green pricing system as a stopgap measure.Green pricing involves providing an optional service where customers agree to pay a premium on their electric bills to use renewable energy. It is already in place in the US, Europe and Australia. 'Although it may be a stopgap measure, this appears to be a realistic measure for now because the adoption of green pricing is much easier than bringing private companies to the energy market,' said Lee Jong-oh, director of the Korea Sustainability Investing Forum, a local civic group. A green pricing system can be implemented simply by revising Kepco's regulations and would not require the enactment of new legislation. The Energy Ministry is reportedly considering setting renewable energy rates around 10 percent higher than current energy rates, but companies argue that a premium of 2 to 3 percent is more appropriate. Green pricing may be a step forward for Korea, where the use of renewable energy is lower than in other OECD nations, industry watchers say. But the nation should move toward the opening of the energy market, they say, to provide companies with dependable supplies of renewable energy at more affordable prices. 'Green pricing may be an option, but that will not be a good solution because it does not give much incentive to companies, which have to pay higher prices. To better achieve the nation's renewable goal, Korea should open its energy market and boost investment in renewable energy,' said Zi Sheng Neoh, a managing consultant with Wood Mackenzie, which specializes in consulting businesses on power and renewables.Many energy experts, including Neoh, and environmental groups call for the adoption of corporate power purchase agreements as a way of opening the energy market. Corporate PPAs allow companies to purchase renewable energy directly from private energy generators at fixed prices over a number of years.Globally, tech giants including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon have already signed long-term PPAs with large wind and photovoltaic parks. In 2017, Apple signed a deal to run its Nevada data center with solar power for about 3 cents per kilowatt hour -- possibly the cheapest contracted starting price for solar power in the US. In contrast, Korea's industrial power prices are normally more than 60 won (5 cents) per kilowatt hour. In Korea, Rep. Kim Sung-whan of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea is preparing to 'propose a bill related to corporate PPAs in the first half of this year' with the aim of expanding renewable energy. Lee Jin-sun, a campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia in Seoul, said her organization would make continued efforts to persuade the National Assembly and the government to adopt corporate PPAs, calling them 'the most effective system to purchase renewable energy and to increase new renewable facilities to reduce carbon emissions.'If Korea's top 20 biggest energy-consuming companies decide to source renewable energy for 100 percent of their energy needs, 43.25 gigawatt solar power generators will be installed and the nation can reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by around 25 million tons, predicted Kim Seung-wan, a professor at Chungnam National University.

Amazon, Apple, General Motors and BMW are among the 169 multinational firms that have joined RE100, a global initiative to reach the goal of 100 percent renewable electricity. And now the global players are starting to aim even higher and encouraging their suppliers to go carbon-free. </p><p>Samsung Electronics, a key supplier to Apple, became the first Korean tech giant in June of last year to make a commitment to rely 100 percent on renewable energy to power every one of its factories and office buildings in the US, Europe and China. But that did not mean Samsung was joining RE100. Its commitment excluded Korea. Samsung said it 'can't join RE100' because of the lack of infrastructure here. Indeed, no Korean firm has joined the initiative to date no matter how strong its global presence. In Samsung's plants in the US, Europe and China, the firm plans to source renewable energy from private power companies in the host nations.Here, the firm has instead vowed to build its own solar panels at its headquarters in Suwon -- but those panels couldn't possibly cover all Samsung's domestic energy needs. It is impossible to fill the gap by purchasing renewable power from private firms in Korea. The state-run Korea Electric Power Corporation is the nation's only energy provider, and it does not specify where its power comes from -- renewable sources, coal, liquefied natural gas or nuclear energy. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acOf course, inability to purchase renewable energy is not an issue only for Samsung Electronics. Apple, BMW and Volkswagen have all begun to pressure their Korean suppliers -- including SK Hynix, LG Chem and Samsung SDI -- to expand their use of renewable energy. Those calls are expected to grow, and to affect more and more Korean suppliers working with different global clients. Chun Young-whan, a professor at Hongik University, said Korean companies may have to 'relocate their factories overseas' when RE100 becomes a reality. Although that may have been hyperbole, it's true that going green is no longer a matter of morality for many companies -- it's a matter of economics. In November of last year, 11 large Korean companies, including Samsung, SK hynix, Shinhan Financial Group and Oriental Brewery, called for the creation of a system where they can purchase renewable energy in order to satisfy their global clients. The Korean government is now mulling the adoption of a green pricing system as a stopgap measure.Green pricing involves providing an optional service where customers agree to pay a premium on their electric bills to use renewable energy. It is already in place in the US, Europe and Australia. 'Although it may be a stopgap measure, this appears to be a realistic measure for now because the adoption of green pricing is much easier than bringing private companies to the energy market,' said Lee Jong-oh, director of the Korea Sustainability Investing Forum, a local civic group.A green pricing system can be implemented simply by revising Kepco's regulations and would not require the enactment of new legislation. The Energy Ministry is reportedly considering setting renewable energy rates around 10 percent higher than current energy rates, but companies argue that a premium of 2 to 3 percent is more appropriate. Green pricing may be a step forward for Korea, where the use of renewable energy is lower than in other OECD nations, industry watchers say. But the nation should move toward the opening of the energy market, they say, to provide companies with dependable supplies of renewable energy at more affordable prices. 'Green pricing may be an option, but that will not be a good solution because it does not give much incentive to companies, which have to pay higher prices. To better achieve the nation's renewable goal, Korea should open its energy market and boost investment in renewable energy,' said Zi Sheng Neoh, a managing consultant with Wood Mackenzie, which specializes in consulting businesses on power and renewables.Many energy experts, including Neoh, and environmental groups call for the adoption of corporate power purchase agreements as a way of opening the energy market. Corporate PPAs allow companies to purchase renewable energy directly from private energy generators at fixed prices over a number of years.Globally, tech giants including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon have already signed long-term PPAs with large wind and photovoltaic parks. In 2017, Apple signed a deal to run its Nevada data center with solar power for about 3 cents per kilowatt hour -- possibly the cheapest contracted starting price for solar power in the US. In contrast, Korea's industrial power prices are normally more than 60 won (5 cents) per kilowatt hour. In Korea, Rep. Kim Sung-whan of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea is preparing to 'propose a bill related to corporate PPAs in the first half of this year' with the aim of expanding renewable energy. Lee Jin-sun, a campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia in Seoul, said her organization would make continued efforts to persuade the National Assembly and the government to adopt corporate PPAs, calling them 'the most effective system to purchase renewable energy and to increase new renewable facilities to reduce carbon emissions.'If Korea's top 20 biggest energy-consuming companies decide to source renewable energy for 100 percent of their energy needs, 43.25 gigawatt solar power generators will be installed and the nation can reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by around 25 million tons, predicted Kim Seung-wan, a professor at Chungnam National University.

The Amsterdambased execs attended a local GAA club match and visited the ruins of Kells Priory, a 12th-century Augustinian abbey outside the medieval city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They saw, eh, cows and stuff,\" says Clune, a whippet-thin entrepreneur who talks in staccato sentences. \"A lot of city people don't get to see things like that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bankers also saw the head office of TransferMate, an international payments company that was co-founded by Clune and Fitzmaurice in 2010 and now has 300 staff. They must have liked what they saw: at the end of July, TransferMate announced a (EURO)21m investment from ING.</p><p>ING will give its business customers access to the TransferMate payments service, mirroring a (EURO)30m investment and partnership deal signed by TransferMate with AIB last year. TransferMate has been valued at (EURO)350m following the combined (EURO)51m series A funding deal, catapulting it into the ranks of Ireland's most valuable technology companies and making it the country's brightest fintech prospect.</p><p>Clune, the TransferMate chief executive and founder of the Taxback group, owns almost 70% of TransferMate either directly or through Taxback. Fitzmaurice, the chief financial officer, owns about 15%. AIB has a 10% stake - a rare equity investment - and ING has 6%.</p><p>Eating salad from plastic bowls in the boardroom of the company's Dublin office on St Stephen's Green, Clune and Fitzmaurice seem unfazed by their progress and paper wealth. Somewhat reticently, they concede a big-number stock-market listing would be \"a natural progression\" for TransferMate.</p><p>\"We are not a brand new start-up. We have been at this a long time,\" says Clune. Fitzmaurice adds: \"The investment gives us opportunities. We have a huge runway in front of us and a lot of work to do.\"</p><p>Clune declines to give any insight into TransferMate's finances, except to say the company has processed more than (EURO)10bn in payments and is profitable. Business-to-business payments make up 90% of the $138 trillion ((EURO)119 trillion) of currencies traded annually cross-border, he notes more than once.</p><p>Clune gives the example of a company making payments to 80 countries at the end of a month. That process would typically take a finance department about eight hours and cost (EURO)2,500 to (EURO)3,000, he says. TransferMate can do it instantly and for half the cost, he says.</p><p>\"We have a very exciting business in one of the biggest markets in the world. We are doing this properly.\"</p><p>Clune, 46, and Fitzmaurice, 43, could hardly be further removed from hipster start-up stereotypes. For starters, both live in Kilkenny and are committed to building TransferMate into a global business from southeast Ireland, far from the big tech and financial centres.</p><p>\"Having four kids keeps me grounded,\" says Fitzmaurice. Clune pipes up: \"Five in my case.\"</p><p>Clune's Taxback story is well told.</p><p>While still a student at Trinity College Dublin, he started processing tax refunds for students who had worked abroad. The Taxback group now includes the original tax refund business, plus the fast-growing payroll tech company Immedis; VAT reclaimer TBI; and a sales promotions company that handles customer rebates for big consumer brands. All told, it has 1,400 staff worldwide.</p><p>Clune also owns the Erin School of English in Dublin and set up Connect Ireland, which landed a government jobcreation programme. It ended last year, amid a dispute with IDA Ireland.</p><p>\"What else is there?\" Clune asks himself, in case he has forgotten something he owns.</p><p>Wexford-born Fitzmaurice qualified as a chartered accountant and worked at PwC for a decade in Kilkenny and Jersey, giving her exposure to international business. In 2005, she moved back to Ireland and landed a job as chief financial officer at Taxback. It had about 100 staff at the time and \"looked like a very vibrant company with big potential\", she says.</p><p>TransferMate emerged from Taxback's experience of making payments to people around the world. A typical transaction could involve paying a US tax refund to a Brazilian student who was back home, says Clune.</p><p>\"We would send cheques in the post but they would very often go missing,\" he adds. \"We started doing bank transfers but international payments are expensive and take a long time.\"</p><p>To streamline the process, Taxback set up bank accounts around the world and started to get financial services licensing in its main markets. At its most basic, it could lodge a US refund cheque in its own American account and then pay the Brazilian student from its account in the South American country. \"We saw the need to cut out the relay chain of banks in the middle of making an international payment,\" says Fitzmaurice. \"When we did, it brought a significant amount of savings.\"</p><p>TransferMate was licensed by the Central Bank of Ireland for payments services in 2011, allowing it to offer services across all EU countries. In an early win, it landed deals to handle global payments for Irish third-level institutions. It is now used by every Irish university, as well as Oxford and Cambridge universities in England, and others worldwide. Top-tier football clubs use TransferMate to make payments for players.</p><p>In tandem with licensing, Transfer-Mate also built the technology to integrate its system into the big accountancy software packages. That process is now complete with \"20 of the top 20\" financial software groups, says Clune.</p><p>The licensing and tech development was funded by Clune and the company, with no external investment until last year. He will not disclose the cost but refers to \"sweat equity\" and laughs.</p><p>\"We could have taken in private equity straight away. We had lots of offers.\"</p><p>The company recorded a gross profit of (EURO)8.8m in 2016, up from (EURO)7.9m the previous year, but had administrative expenses of (EURO)9.1m and made a small loss.</p><p>\"We run this at breakeven,\" says Clune. \"Every penny earned has been invested back into the business.\"</p><p>TransferMate had a seminal moment in May last year when it got regulatory approval in New York, completing the full set of licensing in all 50 US states. Fewer than 10 entities in the world are regulated in all US states, says Fitzmaurice, giving the company a significant advantage.</p><p>\"People ask why other companies don't copy us, but licensing takes four or five years in some cases,\" she says.</p><p>TransferMate is also regulated in India, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Jersey. It is pursuing licences in Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and elsewhere.</p><p>Shortly after the New York approval, TransferMate's original chief executive and co-founder Barry Dowling left the company, selling his stake back to Clune and Taxback. Clune does not comment on the exit but it is understood there were differences about a shift to partnering with banks rather than targeting corporate customers directly.</p><p>With the full set of US licences, the company was ready to talk to funders. Clune's companies had banked with AIB for some time; the local AIB has its business banking centre in Clune House, in the IDA business park in Kilkenny.</p><p>\"They watched us execute from the infancy of the business,\" he says. \"They know the business and the strategy.\"</p><p>Sources said ING was willing to invest (EURO)60m for a 20% stake in the company, but AIB moved faster. It landed a 10% stake for (EURO)30m last December.</p><p>\"AIB did everything they said they would do,\" says Clune, name-checking Colin Hunt, head of wholesale, institutional and corporate banking at AIB. Hunt describes TransferMate as \"innovative and progressive\".</p><p>Company filings from the time refer to clauses that are triggered in the event of a public offering at three times the value of the AIB deal, hinting at the company's future ambition.</p><p>Talks with ING continued and it invested (EURO)21m for a 6% stake, bringing the valuation up to (EURO)350m. On paper, AIB is up (EURO)5m on its investment.</p><p>\"A bank investing is worth so much more to us than any other investor,\" says Clune. \"It's a huge vote of confidence when other banks, partners and customers are looking at us.\"</p><p>The founders are clearly not champagne types. Fitzmaurice recalls delaying a business call to sign the funding deal.

I don't mean this as a criticism, just a statement of fact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the great things about America is that politics - never mind political philosophy - isn't a big part of most people's lives. Associating a body of ideas with the institutions (political parties) that are directly charged with putting ideas into action is a pragmatic way to cut to the chase. Paying attention to what the eggheads and theorists of the left and right want the parties to do is only worthwhile if you're especially interested in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The challenge for conservatives these days is that the Republican Party really doesn't know what it's for, beyond defending President Trump and opposing Democrats and socialism. While the fight over impeachment sucks up all of the oxygen in public, there's a robust battle behind the scenes about what it means to be a conservative.</p><p>Some of it has spilled out into public view, usually centering on nationalism - what it means, what it requires in terms of policy, how it differs from traditional conservatism or whether it differs at all. Sens. Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, for example, have offered thoughtful versions of \"economic nationalism,\" pitting it against libertarianism (both real and imagined).</p><p>There are many different schools of thought here, but a common theme is the idea that government should be more interventionist in the economy: Policymakers should be more willing to overrule the marketplace on everything from big tech to child care to trade.</p><p>Republicans were outraged by the way the Obama administration \"picked winners and losers\" in the economy. Some were appalled when Obama bailed out automakers with a massive handout. Trump has now given more aid to farmers than Obama ever gave Detroit, and if an elected Republican has complained about it, I missed it. In fairness, the farmer bailouts were necessitated by the president's trade wars. But that just demonstrates Republicans' willingness to substitute their judgment for the market's.</p><p>There's a cultural version of the nationalist project as well. Some conservative intellectuals - mostly, but not exclusively, Catholic - believe the state has a role in imposing its judgment in the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>I have strong views about all of this, but I thought it might be helpful to offer a few humble suggestions about how to think about such things as these debates heat up.</p><p>First, the root of conservatism is conservation. The great conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, who died earlier this month, said, \"Conservatism starts from a sentiment that all mature people can readily share: the sentiment that good things are easily destroyed, but not easily created.\" This sentiment is at the heart of traditional conservatism, but it's not constrained by ideology or partisanship. Many liberals (and even some socialists) have displayed this temperament.</p><p>Second, with the great divide in conservative theory, there are those who are anti-left and those who are anti-state. For a crude illustration, some people are opposed to public schools because they don't think education is a proper task for the state. (Milton Friedman called them \"government schools.\") Others on the right think public schools are fine; they just object to how progressives operate them, filling kids' heads with objectionable ideas.</p><p>Obviously, most libertarian purists are in the anti-state camp, but for most conservatives it's a balancing act. A consistent conservative can be libertarian on nearly all policy questions and still favor heavily regulating or even banning pornography.</p><p>Another fault line revolves around the question, \"Which state are we talking about?\"</p><p>If I may show my cards a bit, outside of foreign policy, I'm very libertarian at the national level, mostly libertarian at the state level and pretty communitarian at the local level. Letting people live the way they want to live where they actually live, so long as basic civil rights are respected, has always struck me as the best way to maximize happiness and democratic accountability.</p><p>This raises a final question: Can the state actually do what you want it to do?</p><p>At the core of the conservative critique of the left has always been a basic skepticism that top-down planning from Washington can work. It used to be that the champions of such planning were mostly on the left. That's not true any longer. And it remains to be seen whether top-down planning from the right works any better than it does from the left.</p><p>Jonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief of The Dispatch and the host of The Remnant podcast.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TORSUN-406199463TSWO</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TORSUN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2J-N5K1-DYG6-041V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">432005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Sun All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Toronto Sun</publicationName><edition>Web Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 25, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>jonah,goldberg,americans,conservatism,basically,means !@PERMALINK=</className><className><url normalizedValue=\"https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldberg-conservative-divide-pits-anti-left-against-anti-state\">https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldberg-conservative-divide-pits-anti-left-against-anti-state</url></className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000157</classCode><className>BAILOUTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

This compared with smaller gaps of $97,000, 20 per cent of costs, in Melbourne and only $10,000, 2 per cent of costs, in Brisbane.</p><p>The report concluded that the gap between the supply cost and the delivery to market cost was sustained by planning restrictions and planning risk.

But it was certainly a doozy.</p><p>Asked about the impact of technology on the banking industry, Dimon took a moment to reflect on the industry's good fortunes of late.</p><p>\"You guys thought I was kidding when a few years ago I said, you can have a golden age of banking,\" said Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan. \"I mean, you're going to have a golden age of banking. You have a golden age of banking.\"</p><p>Dimon pointed to regulatory issues, \"some of which are disappearing,\" he said. Presumably he was referencing the recent rollback in Washington of crisis-era rules. He also pointed to the fact that satisfaction scores are up across the industry.</p><p>He also pointed to the industry's increasing financial returns. During the crisis, JPMorgan's return on tangible common equity - a key measure of profitability - stood at around 7%, according to Dimon. Last year, that metric stood at just under 14%.</p><p>\"Look at JPMorgan's financial results alone - they're extraordinary and consistent, year after year after year after year after year and after year,\" Dimon said. \"And it's not just us, OK?\"</p><p>There's no question that the industry's fortunes have changed over the past two years. Regulators are scaling back rules. Taxes are lower. Rates are on the rise, after nearly a decade of historic lows.</p><p>But for whom is it really the golden age?</p><p>Ask small-bank CEOs how they are doing at keeping pace asbig banks invest billions in new technology. Even large regionals - the group that won big under the recent Dodd-Frank rollbacks - are struggling to compete, at least when it comes to attracting consumer deposits.</p><p>During the first quarter, megabanks such as JPMorgan and Bank of Americavastly outpaced their smaller rivalsin attracting deposits, a trend that some have attributed to their digital product offerings.</p><p>Asked Friday about the dominance of big banks in deposits, Dimon said a \"nationalization of the banking business\" is taking place. It started years ago, he said, with the removal of interstate banking restrictions and other \"anachronistic\" laws, and is culminating in the ability of big banks to attract new customers with nice apps and cool branding.</p><p>\"It doesn't mean that other small banks can't compete - they can,\" Dimon said. \"They can do things the big banks aren't going to do.\"</p><p>Perhaps more important, however, is the question of how long banking's good times will last.</p><p>While asset quality has been pristine in recent years, there are signs that deterioration is just around the corner. Just this week, theCEOs of major credit card issuerssaid they are starting to tighten their credit standards in preparation for an eventual downturn.</p><p>There's also the matter of competition. Asked about theAmazon's banking ambitions, Dimon declined to comment, other than to say that it is his \"operating assumption\" that big tech companies will have a major role to play in banking in the years to come, and may even offer a \"full spectrum\" of services.</p><p>At various points during his appearance, Dimon also referenced the growing competitive threat from Chinese financial institutions.</p><p>International and Commercial Bank of China \"makes a lot more money than JPMorgan Chase does,\" Dimon said. He also called out the Bank of China and the e-commerce giant Alibaba.</p><p>\"ICBC or Bank of China can buy what they need to buy,\" Dimon said. \"They have a huge home market. They are coming.\"</p><p>In other words, the golden age could disappear soon.</p><p>Bankshot is American Banker's column for real-time analysis of today's news.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000163-bc58-d806-a7f7-ffdd989c0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SFW-6WJ1-JCRW-53M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia, Inc.

But it was certainly a doozy.</p><p>Asked about the impact of technology on the banking industry, Dimon took a moment to reflect on the industry's good fortunes of late.</p><p>\"You guys thought I was kidding when a few years ago I said, you can have a golden age of banking,\" said Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan. \"I mean, you're going to have a golden age of banking. You have a golden age of banking.\"</p><p>Dimon pointed to regulatory issues, \"some of which are disappearing,\" he said. Presumably he was referencing the recent rollback in Washington of crisis-era rules. He also pointed to the fact that satisfaction scores are up across the industry.</p><p>He also pointed to the industry's increasing financial returns. During the crisis, JPMorgan's return on tangible common equity - a key measure of profitability - stood at around 7%, according to Dimon. Last year, that metric stood at just under 14%.</p><p>\"Look at JPMorgan's financial results alone - they're extraordinary and consistent, year after year after year after year after year and after year,\" Dimon said. \"And it's not just us, OK?\"</p><p>There's no question that the industry's fortunes have changed over the past two years. Regulators are scaling back rules. Taxes are lower. Rates are on the rise, after nearly a decade of historic lows.</p><p>But for whom is it really the golden age?</p><p>Ask small-bank CEOs how they are doing at keeping pace asbig banks invest billions in new technology. Even large regionals - the group that won big under the recent Dodd-Frank rollbacks - are struggling to compete, at least when it comes to attracting consumer deposits.</p><p>During the first quarter, megabanks such as JPMorgan and Bank of Americavastly outpaced their smaller rivalsin attracting deposits, a trend that some have attributed to their digital product offerings.</p><p>Asked Friday about the dominance of big banks in deposits, Dimon said a \"nationalization of the banking business\" is taking place. It started years ago, he said, with the removal of interstate banking restrictions and other \"anachronistic\" laws, and is culminating in the ability of big banks to attract new customers with nice apps and cool branding.</p><p>\"It doesn't mean that other small banks can't compete - they can,\" Dimon said. \"They can do things the big banks aren't going to do.\"</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, however, is the question of how long banking's good times will last.</p><p>While asset quality has been pristine in recent years, there are signs that deterioration is just around the corner. Just this week, theCEOs of major credit card issuerssaid they are starting to tighten their credit standards in preparation for an eventual downturn.</p><p>There's also the matter of competition. Asked about theAmazon's banking ambitions, Dimon declined to comment, other than to say that it is his \"operating assumption\" that big tech companies will have a major role to play in banking in the years to come, and may even offer a \"full spectrum\" of services.</p><p>At various points during his appearance, Dimon also referenced the growing competitive threat from Chinese financial institutions.</p><p>International and Commercial Bank of China \"makes a lot more money than JPMorgan Chase does,\" Dimon said. He also called out the Bank of China and the e-commerce giant Alibaba.</p><p>\"ICBC or Bank of China can buy what they need to buy,\" Dimon said. \"They have a huge home market. They are coming.\"</p><p>In other words, the golden age could disappear soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000163-bc1b-d1a6-abf7-be5f4fca0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SFW-6WJ1-JCRW-53KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

It was one of those rather tiresome Sixties nostalgia affairs at which everyone squeezes into the bell-bottomed trousers, Mary Quant miniskirts, and the psychedelic shirts of the fifty-year-old counterculture. But the slightly built, bespectacled Birch, with his long blond flowing hair, already resembled a hippy, with or without the tight purple shirt and matching headband he was wearing for the party.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Hey brother,\" I asked, trying, without much success, to capture the party's vibe. \"What's goin' on?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What was going on with <person><nameText>Michael Birch </nameText></person>was The Battery. As we stood together in the warm Californian evening, he pitched me his vision for the unclub. He explained how he wanted to bring a diverse community together. \"Different thinking people,\" is how Birch, in the oddly detached language of a web programmer, put it.</p><p>He spoke dispassionately about his \"social project\" which, he told me, would build community and understanding in San Francisco.</p><p>\"How do you become a member?\" I asked. \"We want diversity. Anyone original will be welcome,\" he explained in a mid-Atlantic drawl. \"Especially people who think outside their traditional silos.\"</p><p>\"Sounds like the internet,\" I said. \"Or a village pub.\"</p><p>\"Exactly,\" he said, without smiling.</p><p>\"So could I join?\"</p><p>The social engineer peered at me suspiciously, unconvinced, I suspect, by my ability to think outside any silo. \"You have to be nominated by a member,\" he mumbled.</p><p>He did, however, invite me to visit The Battery. \"Thanks,\" I replied. \"I'll come for lunch.\" \"Cool,\" he said.</p><p>But cool, once the aesthetic of genuine rebellion, is no longer cool. The rebellious, disruptive culture of \"cool\" has instead become the orthodoxy of our networked age. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman describes the social forces of global upheaval, the so-called \"new Davos Men\", as the \"Square People\" - but the real square people of our networked age are those who see themselves as uniquely disruptive.</p><p>\"If you need to inform the world that you are original,\" notes the Financial Times' Edward Luce dryly, \"chances are you are not.\"</p><p>Beware \"Silicon Valley's cool capitalism\" thus warns The Observer's Nick Cohen about alien overlords such as Birch, Instagram chief executive officer <person><nameText>Kevin Systrom </nameText></person>and Napster co-founder <person><nameText>Sean Parker, </nameText></person>who've become the slickly marketed icons of what Cohen calls networked capitalism's \"borderless future\". This libertarian worship of the unregulated network and disdain for government, destroys jobs \"without creating new ones\", Cohen explains, and it compounds \"the already dizzying chasm between the rich and the rest\".</p><p>The origins of this infinitely disruptive libertarianism, of the only rule being the absence of rules, can be traced back to the 1960s. According to the Stanford University historian Fred Turner, the internet's borderless idealism - its ahistorical disdain for hierarchy and authority, especially the traditional role of government - were inherited from the countercultural ideas of internet pioneers like the WELL founder Stewart Brand and the \"Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\" author John Perry Barlow.</p><p>Silicon Valley, Turner says, has become a Sixties nostalgia fantasy hosted by space cadets like Birch who appear to have seceded from both time and space. To borrow some of Apple's most familiar marketing language, everybody now is supposed to \"think different\". Unorthodoxy is the new orthodoxy in a world where the supposedly most different kind of thinkers - those that have escaped their traditional silo - are branded as the new rock stars. The only convention is to be unconventional and work for uncompanies, join unclubs or attend unconferences.</p><p>But today's technology hipsters aren't quite as cool as they imagine. Steve Jobs, the founding father of Silicon Valley's \"reality distortion field\" and the original tech hipster, who idolised Bob Dylan and spent a summer in an ashram, also outsourced the manufacturing of Apple products in Foxconn's notorious 430,000 person Shenzhen factory.</p><p>And Jobs ran an astonishingly profitable company that, according to the United States Senator Carl Levin, has been cleverly avoiding paying the American government a million dollars of tax revenue per hour.</p><p>Just as there are many questions about today's networked society, so everyone - from activists to writers to entrepreneurs to academics to governments - has their own answer to the internet's failure to realise most of its much trumpeted promise: to democratise the good and disrupt the bad, to create a more open and egalitarian world.</p><p>Some of these answers are more coherent and viable than others. But they all are understandable responses to the wrenching economic and social dislocation of network society.</p><p>For the outraged, the knee-jerk answer is smashing the windows of Google buses and calling for the \"dismantling of techno-industrial society\". For the more contemplative, the answer is switching off the network through \"digital detoxes\", technology Sabbaths or joining the \"slow web\" movement.</p><p>For idealistic web pioneers like Tim Berners-Lee, the answer is an online \"Magna Carta\" that protects the web's neutrality and openness against both governments and internet corporations.</p><p>For other publicly spirited technologists, the answer is developing anti-Google or anti-Facebook products like the \"no tracking\" search engine DuckDuckGo, the open source and non-profit social network Diaspora and even an ambitiously decentralised project called Bitcloud that aims to create a new internet.</p><p>For Germany, the answer is in Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2014 proposal to build a European network where data wouldn't pass through the United States.</p><p>For political critics like the technology scholar Tim Wu and the Financial Times columnist John Gapper, the answer lies in internet entrepreneurs growing out of their \"obsessive adolescence\" and taking adult responsibility for disruptions like Bitcoin.</p><p>For internet sceptics like Talking Heads founder and lyricist David Byrne, the answer is that there isn't an answer. \"What will life be like after the internet?\" Byrne asks, with his characteristic dark humour. \"I mean nothing lasts forever, right?\"</p><p>And yet if there just one answer, a single solution, to the internet's epic failure, it is more memory - of the human rather than the computer kind.</p><p>\"I recently took my 16-year-old daughter Adele to see a section of the Berlin Wall that has been preserved as part of a museum devoted to the division of the city, Germany and Europe. It was a bright Berlin morning,\" writes the New York Times columnist Roger Cohen about revisiting the divided Berlin of the Stasi.</p><p>\"Adele, born in 1997, with just a toehold in the last century, wandered around. She examined these curious relics. Every now and again she checked her Facebook page on her device. 'This just seems so ancient,' she said, leaning back against the wall.</p><p>\"'I mean, it feels like it comes from the 19th century'.\"</p><p>At least Adele Cohen has a sense of the past, even if she misidentifies it by 100 years. But for many of her generation of internet natives, the only time is the perpetual present. As the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland explains, today's networked generation, in their preoccupation with \"trading Instagrams and Vines\", have created an intimate, always-on culture that will - like a disappearing Snapchat photograph - vanish forever and leave nothing to posterity.</p><p>\"The point is that a fundamental aspect of human life - memory - is being altered by the digital revolution,\" Freedland warns.</p><p>The savage irony is that the more accurately the internet remembers everything, the more our memories atrophy. The result is an amnesia about everything except the immediate, the instant, the now and the me. It's the end of history as a shared communal memory, the end of our collective engagement with the past and the future.</p><p>\"Once we had a nostalgia for the future,\" warns Mark Lilla. \"Today we have an amnesia for the present.\"</p><p>\"I had been looking forward to the 21st century,\" American media theorist Dougls Rushkoff begins his 2014 book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now. But \"looking forward\", Rushkoff confesses, has gone out of fashion in our networked age of real-time technology. Twentieth century futurism, he says, has been replaced with a chaotic 21st century \"now-ist\" culture.</p><p>Rather than futurists, Rushkoff observes, we are all now \"presentists\" locked into a mesmerising loop of tweets, updates, email and instant-messages.</p><p>The past makes the present legible and it's particularly through the lens of 19th and 20th century history that we can best make sense of the impact of the internet on 21st century society.</p><p>In his Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, Barlow wrote: \"Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of mind.\"</p><p>And this fantasy of imagining the internet magically floating outside time and space, as an unplace, away from the authority of traditional laws, has become the standard justification for Silicon Valley disruption.</p><p>No wonder the cult book among multi billionaire libertarian entrepreneurs like <person><nameText>Sean Parker </nameText></person>and tech entrepreneur and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel is Tolkien's fantasy Lord of the Rings. Thiel named his $US9 billion data-mining start-up Palantir, \"the creepiest start-up ever\" according to one British technology journalist, after the seeing stones in Tolkien's fantasy.</p><p>And Parker spent $US10 million in June 2013 on a shamelessly meretricious Lord of the Rings style wedding in the California forest featuring fake medieval stone castles, gates, bridges and columns.</p><p>\"For the first time in history, anyone can produce, say or buy anything,\" one of the young engineers I met at FailCon promised, articulating a faith in the internet so magically redemptive that it might have been authored by Tolkien himself. He was, however, wrong. Not for the first (or last) time in history, believers are using dramatic language like \"for the first time in history\" to tout a revolution that isn't really new.</p><p>Yes, the decentralised network accidently created by Cold War scientists like Paul Baran and Robert Kahn, is original. Yes, today's data factory economy is, in many ways, different from the factories of the industrial age. Yes, internet technology is fundamentally changing how we communicate and do business with each other.</p><p>But while all this technology might be novel, it hasn't transformed the role of either power or wealth in the world. Indeed, when it comes to the importance of money and influence, Silicon Valley is about as traditional as those 3000 bottles of vintage wine in the Battery's illustrious cellar.</p><p>Today's digital upheaval represents what MIT's Eric Brynjolffson and Andrew McAfee call the \"second industrial revolution\". Internet monopolists like Google and Amazon increasingly resemble the bloated multinationals of the industrial epoch. The struggle of the 18th century Yorkshire cloth workers are little different from the today's resistance of organised labour to Amazon, Uber and Airbnb.</p><p>While Paul Baran, Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee consciously designed the internet to be without a centre, that distributed architecture hasn't been extended to the all-important realms of money or power.</p><p>In May 2014, I spoke alongside Alec Ross, the former senior advisor for innovation to Hillary Clinton and a particularly smooth talking internet evangelist, at the European Parliament in Brussels. In this influential political chamber, where some of the most innovative internet legislation is being enacted such as the EU's \"right to be forgotten\" law, Ross laid out a binary vision of 21st century networked society.</p><p>Rather than the old difference between left and right ideologies, he predicted, the key distinction in what he called \"the shift in power from hierarchies to networks of citizens\" would be between the good \"open\" society and the bad \"closed\" society.</p><p>But the error these evangelists make is to assume that the internet's open, decentered technology naturally translates into a less hierarchical or unequal society. Instead, an unregulated network society is breaking the old centre, compounding economic and cultural inequality, and creating a digital generation of masters of the universe, a tiny handful of companies and individuals.</p><p>\"In Darwinian terms these new corporate giants are the just latest stage in the evolution of the public corporation,\" warns the internet historian and journalist John Naughton about \"open\" internet companies like Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon and Google. \"They exist to create wealth - vast quantities of it - for their founders and shareholders. Their imperative is to grow and achieve dominance in their chosen markets - as well as in others which they now deem to be within their reach.</p><p>\"They are as hostile to trade unions, taxation, and regulation as John D Rockefeller, JP Morgan and Andrew Carnegie ever were in their day. The only difference is that the new titans employ far fewer people, enjoy higher margins and are less harassed by governments than their predecessors.\"</p><p>In their infatuation with an \"open\" and \"permissionless\" future, internet evangelists like Ross and Ohanian have failed to learn from the past.</p><p>The first industrial revolution was, for the most part, a success because it blended openness with new laws to regulate its excesses. What Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz describes as the \"golden age\" of labour was secured through progressive government regulation on labour law, taxation, working conditions, competition and, above all, antitrust issues.</p><p>Robber barons like John D Rockefeller and industrial monopolists like Standard Oil didn't just go away. They were legislated out of existence.</p><p>And that's why, according to the distinguished New York University and London School of Economics sociologist Richard Sennett, \"it's time to break up Google\". The \"problem is simple,\" he says. \"The company is just too powerful, as are Apple and many other big tech groups.\"</p><p>\"Imagine that it's 1913 and the post office, the phone company, the public library, printing houses, the US Geological Survey mapping operations, movie houses, and all atlases are largely controlled by a secretive corporation unaccountable to the public,\" Rebecca Solnit notes about Google's new monopolistic power. \"Jump a century and see that in the online world that's more or less where we are.\"</p><p>The most important solution to the internet's epic fail lies in the work of political bodies like the European Parliament or the American Congress which, with our permission, controls \"secretive\" monopolistic corporations like Google. As Mathias Dophner, the head of Europe's largest newspaper company, Germany's Axel Springer publishing house, and an outspoken critic of Google's attempt to create what he calls a \"digital superstate\", said in April 2014, \"institutions in Brussels have never been as important as they are now\".</p><p>The answer is shaping what GigaOm columnist Mathew Ingram calls the internet's \"quasi-monopolies\" before they shape us. The answer is in what Richard Sennett's \"bold politicians\" able to confront companies like Google whose senior executives such as Eric Schmidt have become, according to the Washington Post, \"masters of Washington influence\".</p><p>The answer lies in a bold political response to other internet giants, like Jeff Bezos's Amazon. And we should applaud the efforts of small publishers like Melville House's Dennis Loy Johnson to challenge the increasingly monopolistic power of Amazon in the book business.</p><p>\"How is this not extortion?\" Johnson asked about Amazon's 2014 decision to delay shipments of books from Hachette and the German publisher Bonnier after they failed to agree business arrangement in which Amazon demanded broader discounts and extra marketing fees. \"You know, the thing that is illegal when the Mafia does it.\"</p><p>External controls don't always need to originate from government. One of the most effective strategies for fighting online piracy has stemmed from voluntary, market-led solutions uniting private companies across the internet economy - from content creators and ISPs to payment processors payment processors and even search providers.</p><p>Beginning in June 2011, American Express, Discover, Mastercard, PayPal, Visa worked with the City of London Police on a set of best practices for withdrawing payment to websites that distribute stolen content. And in July 2013, AOL, Conde Nast, Microsoft, Yahoo and Google were among signatories of an Interactive Advertising Bureau plan designed to cut off the flow of advertising revenue to websites profiting from illegal content.</p><p>As the US Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, Victoria Espinel, noted about the 2013 Interactive Advertising Bureau plan, it would actually \"further encourage the innovation made possible by an open internet\".</p><p>Libertarian disruptors like John Perry Barlow and Alex Ohanian would, no doubt, disagree with Espinel, arguing that any kind of external controls on the internet would undermine innovation.</p><p>But this is wrong too. As the AOL founder Steve Case has argued, the \"coming internet revolutions in areas such education and healthcare\" will require partnering with government.</p><p>And as Sussex University economist Mariana Mazzucato showed in her important 2013 book The Entrepreneurial State, the most significant innovations - such as Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the Worldwide Web at CERN in 1989 - have come out of the public sector. Even Google and Apple, Mazzucato notes, were originally funded by public money - Apple by a $US500,000 government loan before it went public and Google by Sergei Brin's National Science Foundation grant to fund his graduate school studies at Stanford.</p><p>A couple of weeks after meeting <person><nameText>Michael Birch, </nameText></person>I had lunch with a friend at the Battery. The service, the wine and the organic food produced by local, sustainable farms were all impeccable. We were treated like lords by the club's obsequious domestic staff - which wasn't surprising, since the Battery had been designed by Ken Fulk, the high society event planner who organised <person><nameText>Sean Parker's </nameText></person>$US10 million Lords of the Rings fantasy wedding and who is a big fan of television dramas like Downton Abbey that glorify two-tier societies.</p><p>The Battery might have been a gigantic Instagram photo. Hello this is us, it was saying about a Silicon Valley that has seceded from time and space.</p><p>Chrystia Freeland, the author of Plutocrats and an authority on the rise of new global super rich and the fall of everyone else, has a compelling explanation of why fantasists like Fulk finds nostalgic dramas like Downtown Abbey so seductive.</p><p>It's a contemporaneous show, she argues, because there is a \"profound similarity between the vast economic, social, and political changes that drive the action in Downton Abbey and our own time.\"</p><p>But there is one important difference between Downton Abbey and Silicon Valley, Chrystia Freeland reminds us.</p><p>\"With their lavish lifestyles, the aristocrats of Downton Abbey may seem like a 20th-century version of our own plutocrats, but they are not,\" she says, because today's \"aristocracy of talent\" have \"all the perks and few of the traditional values\" of the old Downton Abbey aristocracy\".</p><p>We have Downton Abbey reinvented as the Battery. We have secession fantasies and $US130 million yachts as long as football fields and billionaire uber-libertarians with staffs of black-clad blondes and white-coated butlers.</p><p>We have massively meretricious wealth with minimal social responsibility. We have a new nobility without any noblesse oblige.</p><p>\"Move fast and break things\" was the old hacker ethic; \"you break it, you own it\" should be the new one.</p><p>On my way out of the club, I passed by some words inscribed on a black marble slab.

It was one of those rather tiresome Sixties nostalgia affairs at which everyone squeezes into the bell-bottomed trousers, Mary Quant miniskirts, and the psychedelic shirts of the fifty-year-old counterculture. But the slightly built, bespectacled Birch, with his long blond flowing hair, already resembled a hippy, with or without the tight purple shirt and matching headband he was wearing for the party.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Hey brother,\" I asked, trying, without much success, to capture the party's vibe. \"What's goin' on?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What was going on with <person><nameText>Michael Birch </nameText></person>was The Battery. As we stood together in the warm Californian evening, he pitched me his vision for the unclub. He explained how he wanted to bring a diverse community together. \"Different thinking people,\" is how Birch, in the oddly detached language of a web programmer, put it.</p><p>He spoke dispassionately about his \"social project\" which, he told me, would build community and understanding in San Francisco.</p><p>\"How do you become a member?\" I asked. \"We want diversity. Anyone original will be welcome,\" he explained in a mid-Atlantic drawl. \"Especially people who think outside their traditional silos.\"</p><p>\"Sounds like the internet,\" I said. \"Or a village pub.\"</p><p>\"Exactly,\" he said, without smiling.</p><p>\"So could I join?\"</p><p>The social engineer peered at me suspiciously, unconvinced, I suspect, by my ability to think outside any silo. \"You have to be nominated by a member,\" he mumbled.</p><p>He did, however, invite me to visit The Battery. \"Thanks,\" I replied. \"I'll come for lunch.\" \"Cool,\" he said.</p><p>But cool, once the aesthetic of genuine rebellion, is no longer cool. The rebellious, disruptive culture of \"cool\" has instead become the orthodoxy of our networked age. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman describes the social forces of global upheaval, the so-called \"new Davos Men\", as the \"Square People\" - but the real square people of our networked age are those who see themselves as uniquely disruptive.</p><p>\"If you need to inform the world that you are original,\" notes the Financial Times' Edward Luce dryly, \"chances are you are not.\"</p><p>Beware \"Silicon Valley's cool capitalism\" thus warns The Observer's Nick Cohen about alien overlords such as Birch, Instagram chief executive officer <person><nameText>Kevin Systrom </nameText></person>and Napster co-founder <person><nameText>Sean Parker, </nameText></person>who've become the slickly marketed icons of what Cohen calls networked capitalism's \"borderless future\". This libertarian worship of the unregulated network and disdain for government, destroys jobs \"without creating new ones\", Cohen explains, and it compounds \"the already dizzying chasm between the rich and the rest\".</p><p>The origins of this infinitely disruptive libertarianism, of the only rule being the absence of rules, can be traced back to the 1960s. According to the Stanford University historian Fred Turner, the internet's borderless idealism - its ahistorical disdain for hierarchy and authority, especially the traditional role of government - were inherited from the countercultural ideas of internet pioneers like the WELL founder Stewart Brand and the \"Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\" author John Perry Barlow.</p><p>Silicon Valley, Turner says, has become a Sixties nostalgia fantasy hosted by space cadets like Birch who appear to have seceded from both time and space. To borrow some of Apple's most familiar marketing language, everybody now is supposed to \"think different\". Unorthodoxy is the new orthodoxy in a world where the supposedly most different kind of thinkers - those that have escaped their traditional silo - are branded as the new rock stars. The only convention is to be unconventional and work for uncompanies, join unclubs or attend unconferences.</p><p>But today's technology hipsters aren't quite as cool as they imagine. Steve Jobs, the founding father of Silicon Valley's \"reality distortion field\" and the original tech hipster, who idolised Bob Dylan and spent a summer in an ashram, also outsourced the manufacturing of Apple products in Foxconn's notorious 430,000 person Shenzhen factory.</p><p>And Jobs ran an astonishingly profitable company that, according to the United States Senator Carl Levin, has been cleverly avoiding paying the American government a million dollars of tax revenue per hour.</p><p>Just as there are many questions about today's networked society, so everyone - from activists to writers to entrepreneurs to academics to governments - has their own answer to the internet's failure to realise most of its much trumpeted promise: to democratise the good and disrupt the bad, to create a more open and egalitarian world.</p><p>Some of these answers are more coherent and viable than others. But they all are understandable responses to the wrenching economic and social dislocation of network society.</p><p>For the outraged, the knee-jerk answer is smashing the windows of Google buses and calling for the \"dismantling of techno-industrial society\". For the more contemplative, the answer is switching off the network through \"digital detoxes\", technology Sabbaths or joining the \"slow web\" movement.</p><p>For idealistic web pioneers like Tim Berners-Lee, the answer is an online \"Magna Carta\" that protects the web's neutrality and openness against both governments and internet corporations.</p><p>For other publicly spirited technologists, the answer is developing anti-Google or anti-Facebook products like the \"no tracking\" search engine DuckDuckGo, the open source and non-profit social network Diaspora and even an ambitiously decentralised project called Bitcloud that aims to create a new internet.</p><p>For Germany, the answer is in Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2014 proposal to build a European network where data wouldn't pass through the United States.</p><p>For political critics like the technology scholar Tim Wu and the Financial Times columnist John Gapper, the answer lies in internet entrepreneurs growing out of their \"obsessive adolescence\" and taking adult responsibility for disruptions like Bitcoin.</p><p>For internet sceptics like Talking Heads founder and lyricist David Byrne, the answer is that there isn't an answer. \"What will life be like after the internet?\" Byrne asks, with his characteristic dark humour. \"I mean nothing lasts forever, right?\"</p><p>And yet if there just one answer, a single solution, to the internet's epic failure, it is more memory - of the human rather than the computer kind.</p><p>\"I recently took my 16-year-old daughter Adele to see a section of the Berlin Wall that has been preserved as part of a museum devoted to the division of the city, Germany and Europe. It was a bright Berlin morning,\" writes the New York Times columnist Roger Cohen about revisiting the divided Berlin of the Stasi.</p><p>\"Adele, born in 1997, with just a toehold in the last century, wandered around. She examined these curious relics. Every now and again she checked her Facebook page on her device. 'This just seems so ancient,' she said, leaning back against the wall.</p><p>\"'I mean, it feels like it comes from the 19th century'.\"</p><p>At least Adele Cohen has a sense of the past, even if she misidentifies it by 100 years. But for many of her generation of internet natives, the only time is the perpetual present. As the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland explains, today's networked generation, in their preoccupation with \"trading Instagrams and Vines\", have created an intimate, always-on culture that will - like a disappearing Snapchat photograph - vanish forever and leave nothing to posterity.</p><p>\"The point is that a fundamental aspect of human life - memory - is being altered by the digital revolution,\" Freedland warns.</p><p>The savage irony is that the more accurately the internet remembers everything, the more our memories atrophy. The result is an amnesia about everything except the immediate, the instant, the now and the me. It's the end of history as a shared communal memory, the end of our collective engagement with the past and the future.</p><p>\"Once we had a nostalgia for the future,\" warns Mark Lilla. \"Today we have an amnesia for the present.\"</p><p>\"I had been looking forward to the 21st century,\" American media theorist Dougls Rushkoff begins his 2014 book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now. But \"looking forward\", Rushkoff confesses, has gone out of fashion in our networked age of real-time technology. Twentieth century futurism, he says, has been replaced with a chaotic 21st century \"now-ist\" culture.</p><p>Rather than futurists, Rushkoff observes, we are all now \"presentists\" locked into a mesmerising loop of tweets, updates, email and instant-messages.</p><p>The past makes the present legible and it's particularly through the lens of 19th and 20th century history that we can best make sense of the impact of the internet on 21st century society.</p><p>In his Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, Barlow wrote: \"Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of mind.\"</p><p>And this fantasy of imagining the internet magically floating outside time and space, as an unplace, away from the authority of traditional laws, has become the standard justification for Silicon Valley disruption.</p><p>No wonder the cult book among multi billionaire libertarian entrepreneurs like <person><nameText>Sean Parker </nameText></person>and tech entrepreneur and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel is Tolkien's fantasy Lord of the Rings. Thiel named his $US9 billion data-mining start-up Palantir, \"the creepiest start-up ever\" according to one British technology journalist, after the seeing stones in Tolkien's fantasy.</p><p>And Parker spent $US10 million in June 2013 on a shamelessly meretricious Lord of the Rings style wedding in the California forest featuring fake medieval stone castles, gates, bridges and columns.</p><p>\"For the first time in history, anyone can produce, say or buy anything,\" one of the young engineers I met at FailCon promised, articulating a faith in the internet so magically redemptive that it might have been authored by Tolkien himself. He was, however, wrong. Not for the first (or last) time in history, believers are using dramatic language like \"for the first time in history\" to tout a revolution that isn't really new.</p><p>Yes, the decentralised network accidently created by Cold War scientists like Paul Baran and Robert Kahn, is original. Yes, today's data factory economy is, in many ways, different from the factories of the industrial age. Yes, internet technology is fundamentally changing how we communicate and do business with each other.</p><p>But while all this technology might be novel, it hasn't transformed the role of either power or wealth in the world. Indeed, when it comes to the importance of money and influence, Silicon Valley is about as traditional as those 3000 bottles of vintage wine in the Battery's illustrious cellar.</p><p>Today's digital upheaval represents what MIT's Eric Brynjolffson and Andrew McAfee call the \"second industrial revolution\". Internet monopolists like Google and Amazon increasingly resemble the bloated multinationals of the industrial epoch. The struggle of the 18th century Yorkshire cloth workers are little different from the today's resistance of organised labour to Amazon, Uber and Airbnb.</p><p>While Paul Baran, Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee consciously designed the internet to be without a centre, that distributed architecture hasn't been extended to the all-important realms of money or power.</p><p>In May 2014, I spoke alongside Alec Ross, the former senior advisor for innovation to Hillary Clinton and a particularly smooth talking internet evangelist, at the European Parliament in Brussels. In this influential political chamber, where some of the most innovative internet legislation is being enacted such as the EU's \"right to be forgotten\" law, Ross laid out a binary vision of 21st century networked society.</p><p>Rather than the old difference between left and right ideologies, he predicted, the key distinction in what he called \"the shift in power from hierarchies to networks of citizens\" would be between the good \"open\" society and the bad \"closed\" society.</p><p>But the error these evangelists make is to assume that the internet's open, decentered technology naturally translates into a less hierarchical or unequal society. Instead, an unregulated network society is breaking the old centre, compounding economic and cultural inequality, and creating a digital generation of masters of the universe, a tiny handful of companies and individuals.</p><p>\"In Darwinian terms these new corporate giants are the just latest stage in the evolution of the public corporation,\" warns the internet historian and journalist John Naughton about \"open\" internet companies like Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon and Google. \"They exist to create wealth - vast quantities of it - for their founders and shareholders. Their imperative is to grow and achieve dominance in their chosen markets - as well as in others which they now deem to be within their reach.</p><p>\"They are as hostile to trade unions, taxation, and regulation as John D Rockefeller, JP Morgan and Andrew Carnegie ever were in their day. The only difference is that the new titans employ far fewer people, enjoy higher margins and are less harassed by governments than their predecessors.\"</p><p>In their infatuation with an \"open\" and \"permissionless\" future, internet evangelists like Ross and Ohanian have failed to learn from the past.</p><p>The first industrial revolution was, for the most part, a success because it blended openness with new laws to regulate its excesses. What Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz describes as the \"golden age\" of labour was secured through progressive government regulation on labour law, taxation, working conditions, competition and, above all, antitrust issues.</p><p>Robber barons like John D Rockefeller and industrial monopolists like Standard Oil didn't just go away. They were legislated out of existence.</p><p>And that's why, according to the distinguished New York University and London School of Economics sociologist Richard Sennett, \"it's time to break up Google\". The \"problem is simple,\" he says. \"The company is just too powerful, as are Apple and many other big tech groups.\"</p><p>\"Imagine that it's 1913 and the post office, the phone company, the public library, printing houses, the US Geological Survey mapping operations, movie houses, and all atlases are largely controlled by a secretive corporation unaccountable to the public,\" Rebecca Solnit notes about Google's new monopolistic power. \"Jump a century and see that in the online world that's more or less where we are.\"</p><p>The most important solution to the internet's epic fail lies in the work of political bodies like the European Parliament or the American Congress which, with our permission, controls \"secretive\" monopolistic corporations like Google. As Mathias Dophner, the head of Europe's largest newspaper company, Germany's Axel Springer publishing house, and an outspoken critic of Google's attempt to create what he calls a \"digital superstate\", said in April 2014, \"institutions in Brussels have never been as important as they are now\".</p><p>The answer is shaping what GigaOm columnist Mathew Ingram calls the internet's \"quasi-monopolies\" before they shape us. The answer is in what Richard Sennett's \"bold politicians\" able to confront companies like Google whose senior executives such as Eric Schmidt have become, according to the Washington Post, \"masters of Washington influence\".</p><p>The answer lies in a bold political response to other internet giants, like Jeff Bezos's Amazon. And we should applaud the efforts of small publishers like Melville House's Dennis Loy Johnson to challenge the increasingly monopolistic power of Amazon in the book business.</p><p>\"How is this not extortion?\" Johnson asked about Amazon's 2014 decision to delay shipments of books from Hachette and the German publisher Bonnier after they failed to agree business arrangement in which Amazon demanded broader discounts and extra marketing fees. \"You know, the thing that is illegal when the Mafia does it.\"</p><p>External controls don't always need to originate from government. One of the most effective strategies for fighting online piracy has stemmed from voluntary, market-led solutions uniting private companies across the internet economy - from content creators and ISPs to payment processors payment processors and even search providers.</p><p>Beginning in June 2011, American Express, Discover, Mastercard, PayPal, Visa worked with the City of London Police on a set of best practices for withdrawing payment to websites that distribute stolen content. And in July 2013, AOL, Conde Nast, Microsoft, Yahoo and Google were among signatories of an Interactive Advertising Bureau plan designed to cut off the flow of advertising revenue to websites profiting from illegal content.</p><p>As the US Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, Victoria Espinel, noted about the 2013 Interactive Advertising Bureau plan, it would actually \"further encourage the innovation made possible by an open internet\".</p><p>Libertarian disruptors like John Perry Barlow and Alex Ohanian would, no doubt, disagree with Espinel, arguing that any kind of external controls on the internet would undermine innovation.</p><p>But this is wrong too. As the AOL founder Steve Case has argued, the \"coming internet revolutions in areas such education and healthcare\" will require partnering with government.</p><p>And as Sussex University economist Mariana Mazzucato showed in her important 2013 book The Entrepreneurial State, the most significant innovations - such as Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the Worldwide Web at CERN in 1989 - have come out of the public sector. Even Google and Apple, Mazzucato notes, were originally funded by public money - Apple by a $US500,000 government loan before it went public and Google by Sergei Brin's National Science Foundation grant to fund his graduate school studies at Stanford.</p><p>A couple of weeks after meeting <person><nameText>Michael Birch, </nameText></person>I had lunch with a friend at the Battery. The service, the wine and the organic food produced by local, sustainable farms were all impeccable. We were treated like lords by the club's obsequious domestic staff - which wasn't surprising, since the Battery had been designed by Ken Fulk, the high society event planner who organised <person><nameText>Sean Parker's </nameText></person>$US10 million Lords of the Rings fantasy wedding and who is a big fan of television dramas like Downton Abbey that glorify two-tier societies.</p><p>The Battery might have been a gigantic Instagram photo. Hello this is us, it was saying about a Silicon Valley that has seceded from time and space.</p><p>Chrystia Freeland, the author of Plutocrats and an authority on the rise of new global super rich and the fall of everyone else, has a compelling explanation of why fantasists like Fulk finds nostalgic dramas like Downtown Abbey so seductive.</p><p>It's a contemporaneous show, she argues, because there is a \"profound similarity between the vast economic, social, and political changes that drive the action in Downton Abbey and our own time.\"</p><p>But there is one important difference between Downton Abbey and Silicon Valley, Chrystia Freeland reminds us.</p><p>\"With their lavish lifestyles, the aristocrats of Downton Abbey may seem like a 20th-century version of our own plutocrats, but they are not,\" she says, because today's \"aristocracy of talent\" have \"all the perks and few of the traditional values\" of the old Downton Abbey aristocracy\".</p><p>We have Downton Abbey reinvented as the Battery. We have secession fantasies and $US130 million yachts as long as football fields and billionaire uber-libertarians with staffs of black-clad blondes and white-coated butlers.</p><p>We have massively meretricious wealth with minimal social responsibility. We have a new nobility without any noblesse oblige.</p><p>\"Move fast and break things\" was the old hacker ethic; \"you break it, you own it\" should be the new one.</p><p>On my way out of the club, I passed by some words inscribed on a black marble slab.

It was one of those rather tiresome Sixties nostalgia affairs at which everyone squeezes into the bell-bottomed trousers, Mary Quant miniskirts, and the psychedelic shirts of the fifty-year-old counterculture. But the slightly built, bespectacled Birch, with his long blond flowing hair, already resembled a hippy, with or without the tight purple shirt and matching headband he was wearing for the party.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Hey brother,\" I asked, trying, without much success, to capture the party's vibe. \"What's goin' on?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What was going on with <person><nameText>Michael Birch </nameText></person>was The Battery. As we stood together in the warm Californian evening, he pitched me his vision for the unclub. He explained how he wanted to bring a diverse community together. \"Different thinking people,\" is how Birch, in the oddly detached language of a web programmer, put it.</p><p>He spoke dispassionately about his \"social project\" which, he told me, would build community and understanding in San Francisco.</p><p>\"How do you become a member?\" I asked. \"We want diversity. Anyone original will be welcome,\" he explained in a mid-Atlantic drawl. \"Especially people who think outside their traditional silos.\"</p><p>\"Sounds like the internet,\" I said. \"Or a village pub.\"</p><p>\"Exactly,\" he said, without smiling.</p><p>\"So could I join?\"</p><p>The social engineer peered at me suspiciously, unconvinced, I suspect, by my ability to think outside any silo. \"You have to be nominated by a member,\" he mumbled.</p><p>He did, however, invite me to visit The Battery. \"Thanks,\" I replied. \"I'll come for lunch.\" \"Cool,\" he said.</p><p>But cool, once the aesthetic of genuine rebellion, is no longer cool. The rebellious, disruptive culture of \"cool\" has instead become the orthodoxy of our networked age. New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman describes the social forces of global upheaval, the so-called \"new Davos Men\", as the \"Square People\" - but the real square people of our networked age are those who see themselves as uniquely disruptive.</p><p>\"If you need to inform the world that you are original,\" notes the Financial Times' Edward Luce dryly, \"chances are you are not.\"</p><p>Beware \"Silicon Valley's cool capitalism\" thus warns The Observer's Nick Cohen about alien overlords such as Birch, Instagram chief executive officer <person><nameText>Kevin Systrom </nameText></person>and Napster co-founder <person><nameText>Sean Parker, </nameText></person>who've become the slickly marketed icons of what Cohen calls networked capitalism's \"borderless future\". This libertarian worship of the unregulated network and disdain for government, destroys jobs \"without creating new ones\", Cohen explains, and it compounds \"the already dizzying chasm between the rich and the rest\".</p><p>The origins of this infinitely disruptive libertarianism, of the only rule being the absence of rules, can be traced back to the 1960s. According to the Stanford University historian Fred Turner, the internet's borderless idealism - its ahistorical disdain for hierarchy and authority, especially the traditional role of government - were inherited from the countercultural ideas of internet pioneers like the WELL founder Stewart Brand and the \"Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\" author John Perry Barlow.</p><p>Silicon Valley, Turner says, has become a Sixties nostalgia fantasy hosted by space cadets like Birch who appear to have seceded from both time and space. To borrow some of Apple's most familiar marketing language, everybody now is supposed to \"think different\". Unorthodoxy is the new orthodoxy in a world where the supposedly most different kind of thinkers - those that have escaped their traditional silo - are branded as the new rock stars. The only convention is to be unconventional and work for uncompanies, join unclubs or attend unconferences.</p><p>But today's technology hipsters aren't quite as cool as they imagine. Steve Jobs, the founding father of Silicon Valley's \"reality distortion field\" and the original tech hipster, who idolised Bob Dylan and spent a summer in an ashram, also outsourced the manufacturing of Apple products in Foxconn's notorious 430,000 person Shenzhen factory.</p><p>And Jobs ran an astonishingly profitable company that, according to the United States Senator Carl Levin, has been cleverly avoiding paying the American government a million dollars of tax revenue per hour.</p><p>Just as there are many questions about today's networked society, so everyone - from activists to writers to entrepreneurs to academics to governments - has their own answer to the internet's failure to realise most of its much trumpeted promise: to democratise the good and disrupt the bad, to create a more open and egalitarian world.</p><p>Some of these answers are more coherent and viable than others. But they all are understandable responses to the wrenching economic and social dislocation of network society.</p><p>For the outraged, the knee-jerk answer is smashing the windows of Google buses and calling for the \"dismantling of techno-industrial society\". For the more contemplative, the answer is switching off the network through \"digital detoxes\", technology Sabbaths or joining the \"slow web\" movement.</p><p>For idealistic web pioneers like Tim Berners-Lee, the answer is an online \"Magna Carta\" that protects the web's neutrality and openness against both governments and internet corporations.</p><p>For other publicly spirited technologists, the answer is developing anti-Google or anti-Facebook products like the \"no tracking\" search engine DuckDuckGo, the open source and non-profit social network Diaspora and even an ambitiously decentralised project called Bitcloud that aims to create a new internet.</p><p>For Germany, the answer is in Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2014 proposal to build a European network where data wouldn't pass through the United States.</p><p>For political critics like the technology scholar Tim Wu and the Financial Times columnist John Gapper, the answer lies in internet entrepreneurs growing out of their \"obsessive adolescence\" and taking adult responsibility for disruptions like Bitcoin.</p><p>For internet sceptics like Talking Heads founder and lyricist David Byrne, the answer is that there isn't an answer. \"What will life be like after the internet?\" Byrne asks, with his characteristic dark humour. \"I mean nothing lasts forever, right?\"</p><p>And yet if there just one answer, a single solution, to the internet's epic failure, it is more memory - of the human rather than the computer kind.</p><p>\"I recently took my 16-year-old daughter Adele to see a section of the Berlin Wall that has been preserved as part of a museum devoted to the division of the city, Germany and Europe. It was a bright Berlin morning,\" writes the New York Times columnist Roger Cohen about revisiting the divided Berlin of the Stasi.</p><p>\"Adele, born in 1997, with just a toehold in the last century, wandered around. She examined these curious relics. Every now and again she checked her Facebook page on her device. 'This just seems so ancient,' she said, leaning back against the wall.</p><p>\"'I mean, it feels like it comes from the 19th century'.\"</p><p>At least Adele Cohen has a sense of the past, even if she misidentifies it by 100 years. But for many of her generation of internet natives, the only time is the perpetual present. As the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland explains, today's networked generation, in their preoccupation with \"trading Instagrams and Vines\", have created an intimate, always-on culture that will - like a disappearing Snapchat photograph - vanish forever and leave nothing to posterity.</p><p>\"The point is that a fundamental aspect of human life - memory - is being altered by the digital revolution,\" Freedland warns.</p><p>The savage irony is that the more accurately the internet remembers everything, the more our memories atrophy. The result is an amnesia about everything except the immediate, the instant, the now and the me. It's the end of history as a shared communal memory, the end of our collective engagement with the past and the future.</p><p>\"Once we had a nostalgia for the future,\" warns Mark Lilla. \"Today we have an amnesia for the present.\"</p><p>\"I had been looking forward to the 21st century,\" American media theorist Dougls Rushkoff begins his 2014 book Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now. But \"looking forward\", Rushkoff confesses, has gone out of fashion in our networked age of real-time technology. Twentieth century futurism, he says, has been replaced with a chaotic 21st century \"now-ist\" culture.</p><p>Rather than futurists, Rushkoff observes, we are all now \"presentists\" locked into a mesmerising loop of tweets, updates, email and instant-messages.</p><p>The past makes the present legible and it's particularly through the lens of 19th and 20th century history that we can best make sense of the impact of the internet on 21st century society.</p><p>In his Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, Barlow wrote: \"Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of mind.\"</p><p>And this fantasy of imagining the internet magically floating outside time and space, as an unplace, away from the authority of traditional laws, has become the standard justification for Silicon Valley disruption.</p><p>No wonder the cult book among multi billionaire libertarian entrepreneurs like <person><nameText>Sean Parker </nameText></person>and tech entrepreneur and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel is Tolkien's fantasy Lord of the Rings. Thiel named his $US9 billion data-mining start-up Palantir, \"the creepiest start-up ever\" according to one British technology journalist, after the seeing stones in Tolkien's fantasy.</p><p>And Parker spent $US10 million in June 2013 on a shamelessly meretricious Lord of the Rings style wedding in the California forest featuring fake medieval stone castles, gates, bridges and columns.</p><p>\"For the first time in history, anyone can produce, say or buy anything,\" one of the young engineers I met at FailCon promised, articulating a faith in the internet so magically redemptive that it might have been authored by Tolkien himself. He was, however, wrong. Not for the first (or last) time in history, believers are using dramatic language like \"for the first time in history\" to tout a revolution that isn't really new.</p><p>Yes, the decentralised network accidently created by Cold War scientists like Paul Baran and Robert Kahn, is original. Yes, today's data factory economy is, in many ways, different from the factories of the industrial age. Yes, internet technology is fundamentally changing how we communicate and do business with each other.</p><p>But while all this technology might be novel, it hasn't transformed the role of either power or wealth in the world. Indeed, when it comes to the importance of money and influence, Silicon Valley is about as traditional as those 3000 bottles of vintage wine in the Battery's illustrious cellar.</p><p>Today's digital upheaval represents what MIT's Eric Brynjolffson and Andrew McAfee call the \"second industrial revolution\". Internet monopolists like Google and Amazon increasingly resemble the bloated multinationals of the industrial epoch. The struggle of the 18th century Yorkshire cloth workers are little different from the today's resistance of organised labour to Amazon, Uber and Airbnb.</p><p>While Paul Baran, Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee consciously designed the internet to be without a centre, that distributed architecture hasn't been extended to the all-important realms of money or power.</p><p>In May 2014, I spoke alongside Alec Ross, the former senior advisor for innovation to Hillary Clinton and a particularly smooth talking internet evangelist, at the European Parliament in Brussels. In this influential political chamber, where some of the most innovative internet legislation is being enacted such as the EU's \"right to be forgotten\" law, Ross laid out a binary vision of 21st century networked society.</p><p>Rather than the old difference between left and right ideologies, he predicted, the key distinction in what he called \"the shift in power from hierarchies to networks of citizens\" would be between the good \"open\" society and the bad \"closed\" society.</p><p>But the error these evangelists make is to assume that the internet's open, decentered technology naturally translates into a less hierarchical or unequal society. Instead, an unregulated network society is breaking the old centre, compounding economic and cultural inequality, and creating a digital generation of masters of the universe, a tiny handful of companies and individuals.</p><p>\"In Darwinian terms these new corporate giants are the just latest stage in the evolution of the public corporation,\" warns the internet historian and journalist John Naughton about \"open\" internet companies like Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon and Google. \"They exist to create wealth - vast quantities of it - for their founders and shareholders. Their imperative is to grow and achieve dominance in their chosen markets - as well as in others which they now deem to be within their reach.</p><p>\"They are as hostile to trade unions, taxation, and regulation as John D Rockefeller, JP Morgan and Andrew Carnegie ever were in their day. The only difference is that the new titans employ far fewer people, enjoy higher margins and are less harassed by governments than their predecessors.\"</p><p>In their infatuation with an \"open\" and \"permissionless\" future, internet evangelists like Ross and Ohanian have failed to learn from the past.</p><p>The first industrial revolution was, for the most part, a success because it blended openness with new laws to regulate its excesses. What Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz describes as the \"golden age\" of labour was secured through progressive government regulation on labour law, taxation, working conditions, competition and, above all, antitrust issues.</p><p>Robber barons like John D Rockefeller and industrial monopolists like Standard Oil didn't just go away. They were legislated out of existence.</p><p>And that's why, according to the distinguished New York University and London School of Economics sociologist Richard Sennett, \"it's time to break up Google\". The \"problem is simple,\" he says. \"The company is just too powerful, as are Apple and many other big tech groups.\"</p><p>\"Imagine that it's 1913 and the post office, the phone company, the public library, printing houses, the US Geological Survey mapping operations, movie houses, and all atlases are largely controlled by a secretive corporation unaccountable to the public,\" Rebecca Solnit notes about Google's new monopolistic power. \"Jump a century and see that in the online world that's more or less where we are.\"</p><p>The most important solution to the internet's epic fail lies in the work of political bodies like the European Parliament or the American Congress which, with our permission, controls \"secretive\" monopolistic corporations like Google. As Mathias Dophner, the head of Europe's largest newspaper company, Germany's Axel Springer publishing house, and an outspoken critic of Google's attempt to create what he calls a \"digital superstate\", said in April 2014, \"institutions in Brussels have never been as important as they are now\".</p><p>The answer is shaping what GigaOm columnist Mathew Ingram calls the internet's \"quasi-monopolies\" before they shape us. The answer is in what Richard Sennett's \"bold politicians\" able to confront companies like Google whose senior executives such as Eric Schmidt have become, according to the Washington Post, \"masters of Washington influence\".</p><p>The answer lies in a bold political response to other internet giants, like Jeff Bezos's Amazon. And we should applaud the efforts of small publishers like Melville House's Dennis Loy Johnson to challenge the increasingly monopolistic power of Amazon in the book business.</p><p>\"How is this not extortion?\" Johnson asked about Amazon's 2014 decision to delay shipments of books from Hachette and the German publisher Bonnier after they failed to agree business arrangement in which Amazon demanded broader discounts and extra marketing fees. \"You know, the thing that is illegal when the Mafia does it.\"</p><p>External controls don't always need to originate from government. One of the most effective strategies for fighting online piracy has stemmed from voluntary, market-led solutions uniting private companies across the internet economy - from content creators and ISPs to payment processors payment processors and even search providers.</p><p>Beginning in June 2011, American Express, Discover, Mastercard, PayPal, Visa worked with the City of London Police on a set of best practices for withdrawing payment to websites that distribute stolen content. And in July 2013, AOL, Conde Nast, Microsoft, Yahoo and Google were among signatories of an Interactive Advertising Bureau plan designed to cut off the flow of advertising revenue to websites profiting from illegal content.</p><p>As the US Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, Victoria Espinel, noted about the 2013 Interactive Advertising Bureau plan, it would actually \"further encourage the innovation made possible by an open internet\".</p><p>Libertarian disruptors like John Perry Barlow and Alex Ohanian would, no doubt, disagree with Espinel, arguing that any kind of external controls on the internet would undermine innovation.</p><p>But this is wrong too. As the AOL founder Steve Case has argued, the \"coming internet revolutions in areas such education and healthcare\" will require partnering with government.</p><p>And as Sussex University economist Mariana Mazzucato showed in her important 2013 book The Entrepreneurial State, the most significant innovations - such as Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the Worldwide Web at CERN in 1989 - have come out of the public sector. Even Google and Apple, Mazzucato notes, were originally funded by public money - Apple by a $US500,000 government loan before it went public and Google by Sergei Brin's National Science Foundation grant to fund his graduate school studies at Stanford.</p><p>A couple of weeks after meeting <person><nameText>Michael Birch, </nameText></person>I had lunch with a friend at the Battery. The service, the wine and the organic food produced by local, sustainable farms were all impeccable. We were treated like lords by the club's obsequious domestic staff - which wasn't surprising, since the Battery had been designed by Ken Fulk, the high society event planner who organised <person><nameText>Sean Parker's </nameText></person>$US10 million Lords of the Rings fantasy wedding and who is a big fan of television dramas like Downton Abbey that glorify two-tier societies.</p><p>The Battery might have been a gigantic Instagram photo. Hello this is us, it was saying about a Silicon Valley that has seceded from time and space.</p><p>Chrystia Freeland, the author of Plutocrats and an authority on the rise of new global super rich and the fall of everyone else, has a compelling explanation of why fantasists like Fulk finds nostalgic dramas like Downtown Abbey so seductive.</p><p>It's a contemporaneous show, she argues, because there is a \"profound similarity between the vast economic, social, and political changes that drive the action in Downton Abbey and our own time.\"</p><p>But there is one important difference between Downton Abbey and Silicon Valley, Chrystia Freeland reminds us.</p><p>\"With their lavish lifestyles, the aristocrats of Downton Abbey may seem like a 20th-century version of our own plutocrats, but they are not,\" she says, because today's \"aristocracy of talent\" have \"all the perks and few of the traditional values\" of the old Downton Abbey aristocracy\".</p><p>We have Downton Abbey reinvented as the Battery. We have secession fantasies and $US130 million yachts as long as football fields and billionaire uber-libertarians with staffs of black-clad blondes and white-coated butlers.</p><p>We have massively meretricious wealth with minimal social responsibility. We have a new nobility without any noblesse oblige.</p><p>\"Move fast and break things\" was the old hacker ethic; \"you break it, you own it\" should be the new one.</p><p>On my way out of the club, I passed by some words inscribed on a black marble slab.

They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California StateTeachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future. All of these factors, and others beside, say the stayand-fighters, mean that California is not a lost cause, that it can be saved from total collapse and destruction.

They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future. All of these factors, and others beside, say the stayand-fighters, mean that California is not a lost cause, that it can be saved from total collapse and destruction.

They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future. All of these factors, and others beside, say the stayand-fighters, mean that California is not a lost cause, that it can be saved from total collapse and destruction. All of America should hope and pray they are right, and give them every encouragement and assistance possible in their heroic effort.</p><p>The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, and more.</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending.

They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California StateTeachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future.

They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California StateTeachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future. All of these factors, and others beside, say the stayand-fighters, mean that California is not a lost cause, that it can be saved from total collapse and destruction.

They were sisters, and like most Americans of my parents' generation had been acquainted with hardship during the Great Depression years. That's when their family had headed to California. After their father lost their family dairy farm in Minnesota, the chatty sisters explained, he decided their best option was to join the great migration to \"the Golden State.\" So, they piled all their belongings onto their old farm truck and it was \"Westward Ho!\"</p><p>\"To us, California really was the golden state,\" one of the sisters recounted, her face aglow at the memory. \"We didn't have much when we got there. We lived in a tent for quite a while, but we didn't mind. Everything was so new, exciting and magical: palm trees, the ocean, citrus groves - and lots of warm sunshine, not like the blizzards and hard winters we left behind in Minnesota.\" \"Everybody called us 'Okies,'\" the other sister chimed in, \"but we had never even been to Oklahoma; that's just what they called all of us homeless folks back then.\" The whole family worked, picking oranges and other produce, and doing whatever odd jobs they could. It was a challenging time, but still a very happy one, they recalled. Their affectionate reminiscences of California in the 1930s, albeit as seen through the eyes of young girls, and evoked fondly in memories softened by age, belie the relentlessly grim images we associate with the Grapes of Wrath era. Their father, utilizing his farm machinery-repair skills, eventually landed a steady job as a mechanic. Within a few years, he had his own prosperous auto-mechanic shop in Orange County, and the family soon bought a modest home in a nice middleclass neighborhood. And, said the ladies, most of the other folks they knew in like circumstances also pulled through in similar fashion. That was, indeed, a golden time, they said. In more recent years, however, that glow and shine has begun to fade, to the point where now, they opined, the state might be tarnished beyond repair and headed toward collapse.</p><p>Why did these 20th-century California \"pioneers\" hold such a bleak outlook toward the future of their adopted state? The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, increasing racial animosity, and more. In virtually all of these areas, conditions have worsened in the dozen years or so since that conversation. These afflictions are not unique to California, but the state does magnify and concentrate these ills to such a degree that millions of Americans, including millions of Californians (and ex-Californians), share this pessimistic assessment of the state's future.</p><p>Are they wrong to hold such a dismal view of prospects for the once-golden state? Absolutely, says California's Jerry Brown cheering section. Governor \"Moonbeam\" Brown, now finishing his second double term as the state's executive, never misses an opportunity to denounce President Donald Trump, defy federal law, and flaunt California's size and economic muscle. Over the past year, he has roamed the world stage as a United Nations \"special envoy\" on global warming and other environmental issues dear to the hearts of greenies. \"The truth of the matter is that California, with its strong renewable energy, its very far-reaching greenhouse gas reduction set of policies - our economy grows faster than the national average,\" Brown stated at a UN climate conference last November in Bonn, Germany. \"So, I think that is very good proof that green energy, wind, solar, new electricity grid, battery storage, electric cars, hydrogen cars - all of these create new jobs, the jobs of the future.\"</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a radical activist appointed by Governor Brown, told a press conference on March 11, 2018: \"When President Trump comes to California, he'll see a state that's No. 1 in manufacturing, agriculture, high-tech, in graduating young people from college.\" The Brown PR squad makes things appear quite rosy on Planet California, right?</p><p>But let's unpack some facts to see if the Democrat narrative is kosher.</p><p>As to the first claim - that California's economy grows faster than the national average, largely because of California's strict renewable energy mandates - the facts themselves almost cringe because they are being abused so badly.</p><p>First of all, there are some ugly facts about this legend of a \"miracle\" concerning California's much-hyped booming economy that are conveniently spiked by the Brown gang and its media allies. Nevertheless, the truth seeps out.</p><p>California is suffering deleterious effects of debilitating taxes and regulations, which have been masked by the huge economic rebound of the tech industries and the stock market since the 2008-2009 financial meltdown. But California's tech boom is mainly a one-trick pony that is not replicated in other industries in that state, and it's a show pony that doesn't provide the jobs and income for the masses to be well off.</p><p>\"The tech boom of the last decade has obscured the decline of California's basic industries, such as energy and manufacturing,\" notes Joel Kotkin in the City Journal. \"California's above-average job performance since 2010 is almost entirely a combination of high-income employment growth in the Bay Area and the swelling ranks of low-wage service workers who serve them.\"</p><p>In fact, California's rich-poor divide has been growing, creating a bifurcated society of plutocrats and serfs. A favorite theme of the Left is that under our capitalist system \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest. A 2016 report by the liberal-globalist Brookings Institution entitled \"City and metropolitan inequality on the rise, driven by declining incomes\" features San Francisco and Los Angeles among the top 10 metro areas in the nation with the highest household income inequality between the top five percent and the bottom 20 percent. All of the other regressing city metro areas included among the Brookings top 10 - New York, Boston, Bridgeport (Conn.), Houston, Miami, New Orleans, New Haven (Conn.), and McAllen (Texas) - are, with the exception of Miami, ruled by \"progressive\" Democrats. The economic \"boom\" in California has been a very uneven and unsustainable one, fueled by investments largely induced by political favoritism and cronyism, not by free-market capitalism. The boom has been very good for the top one to five percent, especially the Silicon Valley tech giants, but not so much for everybody else. As the liberal website Politifact noted, California has \"the highest poverty rate in the nation\" when comparing states and considering the cost of living.</p><p>Two of the big untold parts of the income inequality story as it relates to California concern the impacts of massive investments from China and the enormous influence of imported \"coolie labor\" in the form of H-1B visa employees, largely from India. Both of these factors have helped to boost the bottom lines of California-based corporations, as well as lift the statistics on \"jobs created,\" but they have not been particularly helpful to California's American work force.</p><p>\"Chinese investment in the US economy was negligible until 2010, when it skyrocketed to $5 billion. By 2016, annual flows reached more than $46 billion,\" according to Chinese Direct Investment in California: 2017 Update, a report by the Asia Society and the Rhodium Group. \"California became the number one recipient of Chinese FDI [foreign direct investment] in recent years, with more than S16 billion in 2016 alone,\" the report continues. \"Much of the investment has gone into two important areas - real estate and technology.\"</p><p>\"California leads nationally not only in cumulative Chinese investment dollars, but also in the number of Chinese-owned companies,\" the Asia Society/Rhodium Group report states. \"At the end of 2016, the Golden State was home to 585 Chinese-owned operations, triple the amount at the end of 2011.... California has more Chinese businesses than any other state and accounts for more than 18% of all Chinese-owned companies nationwide.\"</p><p>California has also \"benefited\" from massive Chinese investments in the residential real estate market, if one considers driving the market to unaffordable heights a benefit. Chinese buyers spent $22 billion on California houses in the first quarter of 2014, according to a July 9, 2014 report in Bloomberg.</p><p>According to Breaking Ground: Chinese Investment in U.S. Real Estate, another report from the Asia Society, the average home price for Chinese buyers in 2015 was $831,800, up from $590,800 in 2014. It was also considerably more than the $499,600 average home price for all international buyers in 2015. Thirty-five percent of Chinese house purchases in the United States in 2015 were in California, followed by eight percent in Washington, and seven percent in New York.</p><p>As should be expected, this enormous infusion of cash has had inflationary consequences on real estate and housing. An average Chinese-buyer home price of $831,800? Puts a bit of pressure on prospective American home buyers competing for housing in the same market, no? This China cash invasion has made it difficult-to-impossible for working families even to rent, let alone buy, houses in many California communities.</p><p>Not to mention that there are additional troubling aspects of this story that are rarely heard, but which should be obvious. In China's opaque economy, which is tightly controlled by the Communist Party, private businesses and private investors, as well as official State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are under the thumb of the totalitarian state. As such, they are agents (or potential agents) of the communist state, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has multiple options for inducing them to operate in its interests and against the interests of the United States. This brings up many national security concerns, especially in the area of Beijing's strategic investments in our high-tech industries.</p><p>Additionally, there are human-rights issues to which Governor Brown - \"the Great Moralizer\" - and his \"social justice\" activists appear to be oblivious. Like many other politicians - both Republican and Democrat - Brown has made the trek to Communist China, bowing and begging for more of the almighty Chinese yuan. Although he doesn't hesitate to strike a pugilistic pose and hurl invective at President Trump and his \"troglodyte\" supporters, \"Brown the Pugnacious\" becomes \"Brown the Obsequious\" when he stands before dictator Xi Jinping. Suddenly he becomes Jerry Jello-legs: No mention of torture, political prisoners, religious persecution, executions, forced abortions, Internet surveillance, censorship, or slave labor. His message is: Just give us the money, we'll look the other way.</p><p>As mentioned above, the H-1 \u0412 foreign worker visa has also been a largely unreported factor that has allowed the oligarchs of Silicon Valley, Brown's prime constituency, to flourish by gaming the immigration system - at the expense of American workers. Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis, has been fighting for the past two decades to expose this threat to America's technological leadership. He has been a relentless critic of Google, Oracle, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and other tech giants that have been the chief lobbyists for flooding the American IT workforce with lower-wage H-1 \u0412 employees, primarily from India and China. This not only drives down wages and salaries for qualified American workers in computer and technology sciences, but also discourages American students from pursuing careers in these fields that are vital to our viability as a nation. It also allows the foreign workers to be unfairly exploited. The Big Tech companies not only lobby for increases in H-1 \u0412 visas (now set at 60,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for workers with a master's degree or higher), but also sponsor the workers. This sponsorship, says Dr. Matloff, \"renders the workers de facto indentured servants; though they have the right to move to another employer, they do not dare do so, as it would mean starting the lengthy green card process all over again.\" They are trapped, and the corporate CEOs and politicians who support this process - including both \"progressive\" Democrats and \"conservative\" Republicans - have no problem with the hardship they cause to the workers involved, whether American or foreign.</p><p>Government-pension Madness</p><p>Adding to California's fiscal woes is the fact that it is being held hostage by militant public-employee unions that are demanding - and getting - ever-larger payouts in wages, benefits, and pensions from the state's already-overburdened taxpayers. For more than a decade, crit- ics of government pension programs have warned that the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Cal PERS) is a looming mega-disaster that will \"eat\" California. However, that is \"old news,\" we are told by liberal media commentators, who prove their commitments to recycling by regurgitating Governor Brown's press releases on the \"miracle\" of California's economy. But the claims that Brown and his Democrat-controlled state legislature have balanced the books are based on \"fiscal fraud\" and \"budget legerdemain,\" according to the editors of Investor 's Business Daily (IBD). \"There is no economic miracle,\" the IBD editorial charged, \"Just a mirage.\"</p><p>This confirmed what many had suspected: The massive pension gap has not been fixed, but is merely being covered up with accounting trickery. \"Unfunded pension liabilities continue to represent a colossal fiscal burden for both the state government and local governments within California,\" noted Stanford University's Joshua D. Rauh in a January 25, 2018 article for the Hoover Institution entitled \"Can California Save Itself From a Pension Disaster?\" These unfunded liabilities are, says Rauh, \"the reason that taxes are higher than ever, crowding out the services that the state and cities deliver. And it's getting worse.\"</p><p>CalPERS is California's - and the nation's - largest pension fund (managing nearly $350 billion), but it is not the only one in trouble. The California StateTeachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which manages $222.5 billion, reported on May 10 of this year that it faces an unfunded actuarial obligation of $ 107.3 billion. And that's calculated upon an unrealistically high expectation of seven-percent return on investments, which is ridiculous, to put it mildly.</p><p>\"Combining all the pension funds in California and recalculating their liabilities based on the principles of finance, as opposed to governmental accounting magic,\" Rauh says, \"I find that the collective debts that California taxpayers owe public pension funds is $769 billion - over $60,000 per California household.\"</p><p>Dan Walters, often called the \"dean of California journalists,\" is no conservative and has frequently been an advocate of big government and more taxes. However, he has been pointing out the unsustainability of the public-employee pension system for years now. \"From one end of California to the other,\" he wrote in an article for CALmatters on February 7, 2018, \"hundreds of cities are facing a tsunami of pension costs that officials say is forcing them to reduce vital services and could drive some - perhaps many - into functional insolvency or even bankruptcy. The system that manages pension plans for the state government and thousands of local governments lost a staggering $ 100 billion or so in the Great Recession a decade ago and has not recovered.\"</p><p>The \"C\" word, \"crisis,\" is showing up more and more to describe the pending financial dilemma. Some of the more radical unionists actually welcome the reference. Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the 35,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA), described the union's militant vision in a speech to 800 activists at the UTLA Leadership Conference on July 29, 2016. \"The next year-and-a-half must be founded upon building our capacity to strike, and our capacity to create a state crisis, in early 2075,\" CaputoPearl declared. (Emphasis added.) \"There simply may be no other way to protect our health benefits and to shock the system into investing in the civic institution of public education,\" he said. UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association (\u0421\u0422\u0410), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers/AFL-CIO. While the teachers unions have become one of the most powerful forces in California politics (see our companion article on page 21), they receive much assistance in the push for ever bigger and more costly government from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the police and firefighters unions.</p><p>According to the government watchdog group Transparent California, almost 53,000 retired California government employees got annual pensions worth at least $100,000 in 2016. These unsustainable retirement benefits are in addition to enormous payouts of wages and salaries for \"public servants.\" A 2016 investigation by OpenTheBooks.com found that 218,667 government employees were taking home six-figure paychecks, costing California taxpayers $35 billion.</p><p>Crumbling Infrastructure</p><p>And California's list of bad economic news isn't over yet. Because it has overextended itself with payments to remediate its social-engineering schemes, such as unhindered immigration of poor and unskilled labor, it hasn't been keeping up on necessary infrastructure work. In its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card on California, the American Society of Civil Engineers cataloged the daunting challenges that the state faces in trying to catch up on a huge backlog of neglected maintenance and service. Among its key findings:</p><p>* 1,388 (5.5 percent) of California's 25,431 bridges are \"structurally deficient\";</p><p>* 678 dams are rated as \"high hazard\";</p><p>* Drinking water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years will require an investment of $44.5 billion;</p><p>* Wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years amount to $26.2 billion;</p><p>* Of the state's 195,834 miles of public roads, 50 percent are in \"poor condition\";</p><p>* Driving on roads in need of repair in California costs each driver $844 per year;</p><p>* The state's schools have an estimated capital expenditure gap of $3.2 billion.</p><p>While these and many other essential infrastructure projects - levees, the power grid, seaports, canals, and airports - languish, Governor Jerry Brown has been mono-maniacally fixated on his pet \"Bullet Train\" construction project that is years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>\"The California High Speed Rail, dubbed by opponents as the 'Train to Nowhere,' has become notorious across the nation for the project's wishful thinking and immense cost overruns,\" says the California-based Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation. \"What began as a $43 billion project meant to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco has skyrocketed to an overwhelming $77 billion and pushed back to 2033, and they've only just begun the first section of track ... in rural Kern County.\" Some of the cost estimates now reach $100 billion.</p><p>In 2017, Governor Brown signed SB 1 into law, supposedly aimed at solving the infrastructure dilemma by adding a tax hike of 12 cents per gallon on gasoline and 20 cents per gallon on diesel, making California's tax of 53.5 cents per gallon the second highest in the nation (lower only than Pennsylvania's). California's taxes on diesel now amount to 83.47 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In addition, vehicle registration fees have increased $25-$ 175 depending on the age of the automobile. Even electric-car owners will be hit with a $100 fee - but not until 2020. Brown promises that this time the fuel-tax funds will be spent on infrastructure, unlike in the past, when they were spent on a vast array of political buyoff programs. However, the fuel tax/registration fee hikes have caused Trump-sized anger among many state voters, inspiring recall efforts and a ballot proposal to repeal SB 1, which stands a good chance of being passed by voters in November.</p><p>Energy Madness</p><p>Quite to the contrary of Governor Brown's claims, the state's doubling and tripling down on so-called renewable energy is doing neither the state's poorer residents, nor its environment, nor its bottom line any good. On May 9, 2018, California became the first state to mandate residential solarenergy systems. Beginning on January 1, 2020, all new homes built in the state must come with solar systems installed. The mandate's proponents estimate this will add $ 10,000 to the cost of each newly constructed unit. Critics say the cost is likely to be (at least) double that, making California's already-skyrocketing housing costs even more unaffordable. Not surprisingly, \"subsidy entrepreneurs\" such as First Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Tesla Inc., and other solar producers lined up in support of the government mandates, which will force consumers and taxpayers to buy their \"green\" products.</p><p>This new solar residential mandate is the latest move in the \"clean power\" campaign of Governor Brown and his fellow Earth saviors in the state legislature to \"decarbonize.\" In 2015, California's Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350), authored by state Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n, codified Brown's goals requiring 50 percent of the state's electricity to be generated from \"renewables\" (mostly wind and solar) by 2030. De Le\u00f3n and a coalition of enviro-extremists and subsidy-hunting \"renewables\" producers are now pushing for passage of SB 100, which would require that 100 percent of electricity in the state be produced from renewable resources by the end of 2045. This is hypocritical - and expensive - green virtue-signaling that will bring disastrous consequences. \"California imports about 29 percent of its total electricity from out of state, getting it from the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Phoenix, coal-fired generators in the Four Corners area, and hydroelectric dams in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest,\" notes Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor to the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. \"Another 50% of its electricity is generated using natural gas that is also brought in from sources outside California, while the state blockades its own enormous gas potential. Its gas is imported via pipelines from Canada, the Rockies and the American Southwest, to power its gas-fired turbines. Those turbines and out-of-state sources also back up its numerous unreliable, bird-killing wind turbines.\"</p><p>However, rather than moving to decrease its dependency on imported energy, California is making war on its two most dependable clean-energy sources that don't produce C02: nuclear power and hydroelectric power.</p><p>Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress and co-founder of the Breakthrough Institute, says a twoyear investigation by Environmental Progress has concluded that \"no American politician has killed more clean energy than Governor Jerry Brown - and in ways that often benefited his own family financially.\" Shellenberger's expos\u00e9, entitled \"Jerry Brown's Secret War on Clean Energy,\" was published by Environmental Progress on January 11, 2018, which, he notes, was \"on the day the Brown-controlled California Public Utilities Commission has voted to kill Diablo Canyon, California's largest single source of clean energy, and the state's last nuclear plant.\"</p><p>The Diablo Canyon plant, which provides about nine percent of California's total electricity, has performed well for 34 years and could be expected to provide safe, reliable power 24/7 for another 25 years. It was built in the 1970s with the blessings of the Sierra Club and many other conservation and environmental groups, oefore most of the greens turned sour on nuclear. Jerry Brown and his allies were also saccessful in killing the Rancho Secc plant near Sacramento and the San Onofre plant near San Diego, as well as nixing the plans for construction of the SunDesert nuclear p.ant near San Diego. Nuclear, the most concentrated source of energy, has a relatively minuscule footprint, requiring oily 12.71 acres per megawatt produced, as a 2017 study, The Footprint of Energy, by S:rata Policy pointed out. By comparison, solar requires 43.50 acres per megawatt, and wind requires 70.64 acres per megawatt. Attaining de Le\u00f3n's 100-percent \"renewables\" goal would mean covering :he Golden State's landscape (and viewscane) - already cluttered with solar and w:nd farms - with a huge additional footprint ?'windmills and solar panels, not exactly an eco-friendly proposition. (Of course, this assumes solar and wind power are feasible irdustrial power options - they're not. Electricity is used at the moment it is created, and it is created in the amount that is needed - too much or too little could cause the electric grid to shut down. Since solar and wind are intermittent and fluctuating power sources, standard power plants always have to be running, ready to back up the \"renewables\" in case they slow down or stop - called \"spinning reserves.\" So, in essence, the power needed by Californians is being produced by two separate electrical-generating systems at the same time, but only one is used at a time to provide electricity - hardly environmentally advantageous or cost effective.)</p><p>Shellenberger, a leading pro-nuclear environmentalist, points out that Governor Brown and his family have financial incentives (in addition to whatever ideological proclivities may influence them) for their anti-nuclear bigotry. Brown's father, I Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown, Sr., who served f as California governor from 1959-1967, &lt; developed close ties with Indonesia's military dictatorship and helped the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina raise \"an astonishing $ 13 billion (S100 billion in 2017 dollars) mostly from U.S. banks.\" As a reward, notes Shellenberger, Pertamina \"gave him exclusive and highly valuable rights to sell Indonesian oil in California,\" as well as \"half-ownership of its office in Hong Kong.\" When Jerry Brown ran for governor in 1974, Pertamina executives gave him $70,000, the equivalent of $350,000 in 2017 dollars. As governor, Jerry Brown and his appointees not only favored imported Indonesian oil over nuclear power, but over American oil as well.</p><p>In 2016, Governor Brown signed an agreement cooked up by the Obama administration and its enviro-extremist allies to tear down four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, part of an ongoing campaign to remove all dams. This will not only heighten California's energy dilemma, but also greatly aggravate the state's perennial water woes. (And inadequate water will surely mean woes for many of the state's farmers - though agriculture is another so-called bright spot that Democrats point to as a sign of their success.) Nuclear and hydro power sources have always been on hand to provide the power grid's \"spinning reserves\" needed to cover for the energy spikes that are inherent with intermittent sources such as wind and solar. Democrats are ending that scenario. To make matters worse, on May 31,2018, Governor Brown signed into law two water bills, Senate Bill 606 and Assembly Bill 1668, that set statewide mandatory water rationing rules even during non-drought years. Among other things, the new laws set strict water budgets allowing for 55 gallons per person per day for indoor water use, dropping to 50 gallons by 2030. Cities, counties, and water districts that go over budget could face fines of $ 1,000-$ 10,000 per day.</p><p>Floundering Schools</p><p>Even as the Democrats damage California's environment, raise the cost of living, and overspend on entitlements, they are also failing to provide a proper education for California's kids, though the provision of public schooling has always been one of the activities that Democrats are most proud of. (And one that California's radical leftist attorney general, Xavier Becerra, bragged about, saying California was number one in graduating young people from college.)</p><p>By virtually every significant assessment of academic achievement, California's public schools are failing California's children - and California's taxpayers. California's 6.2 million K-12 public-school students comprise nearly one-eighth of the United States' public-school population. The latest bi-annual National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) - known as The Nation's Report Card - which came out in 2017, is but one of many indicators that the state's government schools are flunking out. True, much the same can be said about nearly our entire public-school system nationally. However, one area where California's schools excel above others nationally is in intellectually crippling their charges, usually proving it by posting scores among the bottom 10 states. The NAEP assesses a relatively large sampling of fourth- and eighth-grade students every other year, and periodically assesses academic achievement of 12th graders as well. Among the many dismal findings of the 2017 Report Card was that nationally, a meager 37 percent of public-school fourth-grade students surveyed performed at or above the NAEP's Proficient level in reading. California proved it could beat this by going lower still, with only 31 percent of its students reading proficiently. In fourth-grade mathematics, 40 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, but California students were nine points lower, at 31 percent.</p><p>In eighth-grade mathematics, 33 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient, while only 29 percent of California's eighth-graders were at or above the proficiency level. In eighth-grade reading, 35 percent of public-school students nationally were at or above Proficient; in California it was 32 percent. These abysmal trends continue through high school, with the result that, of those students who don't drop out, the vast majority who graduate may have a diploma, but they don't have the proficiency in requisite academic skills to take on college or a challenging, well-paying job. Thus, remedial education is a major affair at most colleges and universities.</p><p>According to Overview of Remedial Education at the State's Public Higher Education Segments, a March 1, 2017 report to the California Senate Education Committee by the Legislative Analyst's Office, three-quarters of first-time California Community College students (more than 150,000) are each fall term deemed unprepared. It also found that more than 40 percent of first-time California State University students (about 25,000 students) and 23 percent of first-time University of California students (about 8,000 students) are each fall term deemed unprepared.</p><p>Clearly, California's schools are not teaching basic academic skills, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. That's a big problem. But there is an even bigger problem with what they are teaching. Many parents are up in arms over the new perversion propaganda invading the classrooms under the state-mandated sex-education provisions of the California Healthy Youth Act. Parents are being told that they have no recourse, that their children may not \"opt out\" of classroom discussions and lessons regarding \"sex toys,\" homosexual practices, transgender issues, and the like. In a March 29, 2018 memo citing the above-mentioned law, the legal counsel for the Orange County Department of Education stated that parents \"may not excuse their children from this instruction.\" \"However,\" the legal memo continues, \"parents are free to advise their children that they disagree with some or all of the information presented in the instructional program and express their views on these subjects to their children.\" How very decent of the state to give parents permission to disagree with the school program and to permit them to discuss this with their own children!</p><p>That is not the only area where parental rights and parental choice are under assault. On June 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law SB 277, the nation's most stringent mandatory vaccine regimen. All children attending public K-12 schools and public day care must be vaccinated, and all previous exemptions based on the religious, moral, or other personal beliefs of parents are overridden.</p><p>All of these factors have caused many families to flee the government school system for private schools and homeschooling options. However, those options are under constant assault also, with legislation regularly proposed to limit, harass, or curtail these parental choices in education.</p><p>State of the State: A Closer Look</p><p>Democrats claim that the nation should follow its lead both culturally and financially, but California is on life support - both financially as well as culturally - and it is becoming more and more apparent to anyone who really cares to look. And the blame surely goes to \"progressive policies.\"</p><p>Copying California in the hopes of improving America generally, either socially, environmentally, or economically, would be like hoping to improve one's health by bathing in tuberculosis bacteria.</p><p>Many Californians offer a sobering view of on-the-ground reality over at that place critics refer to as the Left Coast. \"California has one of the worst failing education systems in the country, the highest income taxes, highest gas tax, highest poverty in the nation, a billion dollar budget deficit, the state pension system is underfunded by $ 1 trillion, and violent crime is on the rise,\" says Katie Grimes, a veteran investigative reporter, author, columnist - and native Californian. \"But we now have transgender bathrooms, and a new law that allows knowingly transmitting HIV to a partner will no longer be a felony offense.\"</p><p>On April 17, 2018, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Foundation released its critique of the state's finances, entitled Follow the Money. \"For a state that is said to have one of the highest-ranked economies in the world, as well as some of the highest taxes in the nation, it seems as if California's policymakers never have enough funding to provide adequate services to the state's citizens,\" the foundation report states. \"Just this year,\" it continues, \"Governor Jerry Brown proposed a SI90.3 billion spending plan, with a record-breaking $132 billion general fund budget.\"</p><p>Follow the Money provides well-documented details to back up the sweeping condemnation of California's spendthrift government in the report's introduction. That condemnation charges:</p><p>Even with some of the highest taxes in the nation, and the highest state personal income tax by far, California seemingly never has enough money for what matters. California ranks last in quality of life, with outrageous housing prices and more than a quarter of the nation's homeless population; our children are not receiving the education they need with one of the worst K-12 education systems in the country, ranking in the bottom ten; and our roads are ranked 49th out of 50, with the only roads judged worse than ours being Rhode Island's. In a state that ranks as having the fourth highest taxes in the nation, how can it be that states without state income taxes rank higher in quality of life, public education and roads?</p><p>Yet despite its financial shortfalls, California's Democrats still welcome with open arms all the illegal aliens who arrive there, even though they're costly. According to the liberal Public Policy Institute of California, the state is home to between 2.35 and 2.6 million illegal aliens. By these figures, illegals account for more than six percent of the state's population and nearly one-quarter of the entire illegal-alien population of the United States. However, the actual totals of illegal aliens - both in the state and the nation - are almost certainly much larger than the standard academic and official estimates. California's liberalleft politicians court and exploit this population as an important political base to be mobilized for further expansion of government spending and government programs to redraw and transform society. This huge population is a major contributing factor to the growing poverty crisis in the state. A recent United Way study found that \"1 in 3 households in California, over 3.2 million families - including those with income well above the Federal Poverty Level - struggle every month to meet basic needs.\"</p><p>The so-called sanctuary city movement, which was until recently a rogue operation of a relatively few far-left mayors and city councils, received a huge boost in October 2017 when Governor Jerry Brown signed into law legislation making California a \"sanctuary state.\" The state's leading politicians have openly announced their defiance of federal law on immigration matters and basically support all efforts to break down our borders and allow open migration.</p><p>Since so many California residents (legal and illegal) cannot read or speak English, the state spends millions of dollars on translating signs, instruction manuals, election ballots, textbooks, classroom materials, and government documents into multiple languages. California announced in 2014 that eight new languages would be added to its online voter registration, noting that in addition to English and Spanish, Californians will now be able to choose between Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. The California Department of Motor Vehicles now provides driver tests in Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Persian/Farsi, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog/Filipino, Thai, Tongan, Turkish, and Vietnamese.</p><p>Then there's the crime. \"The County and City of Los Angeles are the 'gang capital' of the nation,\" according to the website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It goes on to note: \"There are more than 450 active gangs in the City of Los Angeles. Many of these gangs have been in existence for over 50 years. These gangs have a combined membership of over 45,000 individuals.\" That's just in the greater Los Angeles area. Most other California cities, as well as even small rural towns, have gang violence and gang crime problems as well. The gang \"culture\" is one of the other major exports of California to the rest of the nation. The Bloods, Crips, MS-13, Mexican Mafia, Sure\u00f1os, Norte\u00f1os, Hells Angels, Devils Disciples, Nuestra Familia, and dozens of other violent gangs call California home - while extending their tentacles into virtually every other state, as well.</p><p>And don't count on carrying a gun for self-protection. In July 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed five new laws severely restricting civilian ownership of firearms and ammunition. Second Amendment defenders referred to this all-out assault on the right to keep and bear arms in apocalyptic terms, calling it a \"Gunmageddon.\" Over the past several decades, California's Democratic politicians, who control the legislature (and often the governorship as well), have steadily added new laws that make it increasingly difficult for Californians to legally defend themselves and even to own and operate firearms. This one issue alone has been responsible for a sizable exodus of Californians to other states more hospitable to gun rights.</p><p>Fight or Flight?</p><p>California is the cornerstone in the Left Coast's \"Blue Wall\" - California, Oregon, and Washington - the wealthy, coastal metro areas controlled by \"progressive\" Democrats. From Los Angeles to San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, to Portland and Seattle, America's Pacific littoral is deep-blue occupied territory typified by one-party rule enforced by bureaucratic oppression, media beat-downs, and, increasingly, the mob violence of identity politics. The leftward agenda in this crucial region is driven by funding from both private and public sources. From the private side, politicians and their militant \"community organizer\" allies can rely on huge contributions from billionaire hightech oligarchs, hedge-fund titans, and, of course, the Hollywood glitterati. On the public side, there are numerous spigots that spew grants and contracts (read: \"activist cash\") to the ever-burgeoning welter of social-justice warriors who provide constant pressure for ever more government spending and control. Because of California's horrific political policies, for years, many of California's best and brightest have been exiting the state. Their reasons: economics, politics, social ills, family safety, and personal liberty. \"Despite claims that people leaving California are old and poor,\" writes Joel Kotkin, \"the two most recent years' data from the IRS shows larger net losses of people in the 35 to 54 age group. Losses were particularly marked among those making between $100,000 and $200,000 annually.\" Thousands of businesses have also fled.</p><p>However, many are staying to fight what others see as a hopeless battle. The stay-and-fighters point to widespread dissatisfaction and anger with the craziness and oppression of the state's current Democratic order, and the galvanizing impact that President Trump's victory has had on formerly dispirited conservatives in the state. They point also to popular outcries over the state fuel tax, sanctuary cities, and other issues that cut across party lines. Then, too, there are the deep divisions and bitter in-fighting among the Left, far-Left, and far-far-Left factions over who will lead the Democratic Party into the future. All of these factors, and others beside, say the stayand-fighters, mean that California is not a lost cause, that it can be saved from total collapse and destruction. All of America should hope and pray they are right, and give them every encouragement and assistance possible in their heroic effort.</p><p>The catalog of ills the ladies rattled off was not surprising: out-of-control state government spending, high taxes, drugs, crime, gangs, failing schools, massive illegal immigration, decaying roads and infrastructure, rampant homosexuality and immorality, total erosion of manners and civility, and more.</p><p>Brown and his fellow Democrats who run California regularly point out that their state is the world's sixth-largest economy, surpassed only by the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Their solution to the growing income inequality in our society is bigger government, more government programs, and more government spending. Yet it is in these deep-blue progressive havens where we see the rich-poor gap at its starkest.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAMR-2071530585</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAMR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVF-96T1-JBHT-D39F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7268\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New American Jul 9, 2018</copyright><publicationName>New American, The</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 08856540</issn><volume>Vol 34</volume><issueNumber>No. 13</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 9, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;
