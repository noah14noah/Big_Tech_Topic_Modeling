But the bigger concern, and it's hard to think what would be a bigger concern than the rate, but I'll tell you, there is one, and it's this - you lose the connection to the employer. </p><p>The reason Labor argued for a wage subsidy is because we want people to keep their connections to the employer during the crisis. </p><p>Not only because it is better for them now, but it also means on the other side that then, the Australian economy will be able to kick back into gear more quickly, and those people who have been on a wage subsidy, the relationships that are there with the employer and they can get straight back to work. </p><p>In previous downturns, many people when they've lost a relationship with the employer, many people never return to work again. We don't want that to happen. And that's why we've welcomed the government establishing a wage subsidy.

That's a definition that sits inside the Fair Work Act already, that's known to the industrial law.

But the fundamental principle is that you get it if you're a casual, if you've had connections to your employer for that period of time. </p><p>Now that doesn't put any limit on how many hours you worked or whether you had shifts that were different from week to week.

That is because a code of conduct, which would have forced Airbnb and other short-term let operators to inform their apartment building they were operating there, has been shelved for the time being. It was due to be released on 10 April. Acting immigration minister Alan Tudge is on ABC News and was asked what is happening with people who are overseas and were applying for a partner visa, will they be allowed to come back to Australia? There isn't a blanket rule, he says. Some people apply from Australia and may, indeed, be applying for a partner visa. Others will be still overseas applying for a partner visa. Obviously - and I appreciate it's very difficult for those couples if they are separated and we have our borders which are closed, and so it does become difficult for them - but the borders are closed for a reason, we're only taking people in who - well, obviously if they're Australian or permanent residents, they can come in and self-isolate, and a select group of other people, on a case-by-case basis. But there isn't a general rule that people who are trying to get their partner in on a partner visa will automatically be able to come into the country. That's just an unfortunate by-product of the circumstances that we're in at the moment. Scott Morrison has made a tweak to ministerial responsibilities to allow Greg Hunt, the health minister, to focus tackling the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement issued just now, the prime minister said responsibility for public service matters - including the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) - has been temporarily transferred from Hunt to the WA MP Ben Morton. \"This will allow minister Hunt to concentrate wholly on the coronavirus response in his health portfolio,\" he said. The APSC, he said, was currently managing the redeployment of public servants \"to support the critical and continued delivery of government services\". Victoria police minister Lisa Neville says she doesn't want people to be finding loopholes in what people are allowed to do right now. It's hard for everyone, she says. \"If you follow those four exemptions only, and you minimise non-essential travel you protect yourself and you protect the Victorian community.\" Despite all the less travel, Neville says the road toll is only 3 behind the number this time last year and police will be out in force over the long weekend. Victoria police deputy commissioner Shane Patton says Victoria Police will continue to issue fines where it is \"deliberate, obvious and blatant\" that people are disobeying the direction of the chief health officer. He says to date, the police have issued 96 warnings for people who were going against the rules. He says he is only aware of the one incident of a learner driver being given a fine. He says the incident gives absolute clarity that you should only be going out for one of the exemptions provided. People can travel to their holiday home over Easter, but he reiterates people should be travelling as little as possible and staying home when they can. Via my colleague, Paul Karp, this is the response on parliament sitting from Greens leader Adam Bandt: Given the significant amounts of money being spent on the pandemic response, the likelihood of people falling through the cracks, and the potential for legislative overreach, it's vital that our country's elected representatives have the opportunity to independently scrutinise the government's approach. The Greens want parliament to keep sitting and we'll work with other Senators and MPs to make it happen. Independent senator Jacqui Lambie has said she \"totally agrees\" with fellow senator Rex Patrick's proposal that the default should be that parliament sits sooner than 11 August. Lambie told Guardian Australia: We should set down some dates and times - this idea the government has of calling us in on a whim, whenever they feel they need, it's not the most functional. The other point I'd make is: it's the 21st century. We can't take a vote from home? We can't have a speech from home? Why can't that be done?...They're spending billions of dollars, so it's time to apply a bit of scrutiny. We've been very nice to the government, we've played very nice. But with no parliament - is that a sustainable way for a democracy to go? No, it's not. Lambie said her preference is to return to Canberra \"as soon as possible\" and \"as soon as safe to do so\", but given the end date of Covid-19 restrictions is unclear, consideration needs to be given to a virtual parliament now. Lambie is also in favour of a Senate select committee on the government's Covid-19 response. There was a bit of confusion in Victoria because the chief health officer Brett Sutton snapped a photo of his weekend hike, after a Victorian learner driver resident was fined for driving and getting her hours up. Sutton has clarified that the hike was next door to him and he walked there, and you are allowed to drive to a place to exercise if required. Is the AHPPC looking at the clusters in hospitals? Yes, Kelly says, they are. And that's the end of the press conference. Will we see a peak in deaths in the next few days? Hard to know, Kelly says. We seem to have successfully flattened the curve at the moment, so whether we indeed will get a peak is hard to know. Maybe we are there already. I don't believe so. But we will continue to get cases over the next period. In terms of deaths, yes, there is a delay between cases and deaths. Unfortunately, people tend to get sicker in their second week, the ones that had a very severe disease. So there is a very small delay related to that. When will restrictions be eased? Kelly says this is a process of national cabinet. He says each restriction will need to be reviewed in relation to what impact it would have on the curve and what the impact on society would be. The other component is a vaccine, which we don't know when will be available. Kelly says we are not in the same situation as the US because the measures we have brought in have been effective. He says some deaths in Australia may have been missed, but those being hospitalised for severe pneumonia are being tested. The deputy chief health officer Paul Kelly is providing an update. He says 96 people across Australia are in intensive care and 35 are on ventilators. He says a proportion of these people are relatively young. 795 cases of coronavirus (or 8% in total) are from community transmission, he says. Our low mortality rate and our low percentage positive in our testing shows me that we are actually finding people early in this disease, isolating them and breaking those chains of transmission that spread through the whole population. So these are very encouraging signs indeed. The national cabinet will meet tomorrow, after which the government will release the modelling it has been using to create these measures. In the meantime, I will log off for the day, and leave you in the very capable hands of Josh Taylor. The deputy chief medical officer is coming up at 3.30pm, to give the national update. Until tomorrow - take care of you. And on the issue of Year 12 students being forced to repeat the year, Mark McGowan is in the 'no' camp: That will be debilitating for that year. Education ministers are working on options. It might mean exams are moved sideways, it might mean a range of measures, but I think repeating will be an absolute last resort. Asked about comments the police commissioner made on Jenna Clarke's WA podcast this morning, where he opined that police were prepared for social unrest from citizens after a month of quarantine, Mark McGowan says he shared those concerns: Yes, I do. Yes, I do. A lot of people will go stir crazy, but I just urge people to understand and reflect on the consequences of doing the wrong thing, which is more people can die. This is a difficult situation, we are only a few weeks in and feels like months I urge everyone settle in, be patient, make sure you buy some books or get Netflix, learn your exercise routines, do all of those things to get through the months ahead. On a Victorian man, who allegedly tried to skip out of his WA quarantine, Mark McGowan says: He has done the wrong thing. He [allegedly] jimmied opened a door and was going in and out to visit his girlfriend somewhere allegedly. He has done the wrong thing, he has been caught, he has been charged, he has been in custody and custody is far worse than staying in a hotel. He has already suffered a consequence. He can now suffer a penalty of up to $50,000 and further incarceration. He has done the wrong thing, he has been caught. I expect the law will deal with him fairly harshly. WA is reporting it has 162 people who have recovered from Covid-19. A man in his 80s has passed away in WA. He became the state's fourth death. Health minister Roger Cook says: The Department of Health is reporting that we have just seven new cases of Covid-19 today. That takes the state total to 460. All of today's cases are related to cruise ships or overseas travel. So we have still seen no hard evidence of sustained community transmission. The department is still working through the contact tracing details of the new cases, but this is what we know at the moment. Seven new cases overnight are aged between 41 and 79 years. Of the Western Australian cases, six are from the metropolitan area and one is from the Kimberley. One case is related to overseas travel and six are related to cruise ships. One case is a health worker from the Kimberley. We have 13 cases from the Kimberley, seven of which are healthcare workers. I am pleased to report that today's case in the Kimberley is a healthcare worker who had returned from overseas travel and had not been in the workplace. Obviously that person is currently self-isolating. As with all cases, contact tracing is under way to ensure all close contacts have been notified and a self isolating. Mark McGowan is rounding out the state leaders. he is standing in front of thousands of boxes which represent $5.5m in medical protection equipment. He says the new border measures are working well: I am advised our interstate border, a temporary border, has been implemented very smoothly. There are now police at the airport, ensuring that the border arrangements operate properly. And police on checkpoints on the border between Australia and the Northern Territory and WA, on both of those crossings, ensuring that our border arrangements work properly. This is a unique situation, never done before, but it is designed to close off our state as best we can from the eastern states, to protect our people from infection being spread from the east. As we know, the infections are largely people who come in from overseas, and largely people from cruise ships, but there is some spread from people from the eastern states, so we're doing all we can to protect Western Australia from the spread of illness from the east, and from overseas. It is a temporary measure. I am not sure how long it will last, maybe months, maybe many months, but we need to do this to ensure we protect our state as best we can, with the obvious exemptions that we have announced before. Melbourne radio 3AW reported on this today - a Victorian mother and son, who were fined for driving practice, where the only people they would come into contact with, were each other. It is very, very important though, that you only get tested if you have symptoms. Mikakos continues: As a result of the declining number of returned travellers, we are now broadening our testing criteria to get a clearer picture of the extent of community transmission. So from today, from this morning, in fact, any person who has the clinical criteria, that is a fever or acute respiratory symptoms, and is 65 years or older or is part of an occupational group that has close contact with the public, and this also includes now childcare workers, school teachers, primary and secondary teachers, firefighters who are engaged in an emergency medical responders are also eligible to be tested for Covid-19 as a priority group, and this is regardless of whether those individuals have a history of overseas travel. So as a result of the declining number of overseas travellers, the changing demographic we think now is the right time to be broadening out the types of groups in the community that will be tested for Covid-19, and I need to stress that they need to have the relevant clinical symptoms before they would be eligible for testing. Jenny Mikakos, the Victorian health minister, is giving Victoria's update: A man in his 50s who has died in hospital and a woman in her 80s who has died at home. This brings the total of Victorians who have died as a result of Covid-19 to a total of 10 to date and my thoughts are with both of these individuals families. There are 88 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Victoria that are believed to be related to community transmission and this is an increase of 13 since yesterday. To date we have had more than 57,000 tests conducted. We currently have 45 people in hospital, including 11 who are in intensive care. On a positive note, we have 620 Victorians who have recovered from Covid-19. As part of its re-skilling program, Tafe NSW is offering free courses. You can find details on that here. The Australians trapped in Peru may have a glimmer of hope they will soon be home (Peru closed its borders earlier than a lot of countries, leaving tourists with very limited time to get out). Paul Kelly, the deputy chief medical officer, will give an update at 3.30pm. That will be a picture of where the nation is at. Also, the government is still working on the modelling it will be releasing to the public, most likely tomorrow. Steven Marshall is delivering South Australia's update: He says the state is increasing its hospital bed capacity for high-care patients and upskilling 80 additional nurses to staff those beds. Annastacia Palaszczuk says the Easter holidays are cancelled: If I could just reiterate that people should be staying in their region and staying in their village. Now is not the time to be a tourist. Now is not the time to hop in the car and go to the beach. The time for going to the beach will be once we get through this because we want people to stay in their suburbs. It's going to be much easier for us to identify community transmission into the future, and what we don't want to see is people moving, mass movements of people to other parts of our state. So very clearly everyone is doing a great job. 99% of the people in their state are doing a great job. We now want to make it 100%. And from what I can see, people are out walking in their local communities, which is wonderful. But it's not the time to pack up and take your family to the beach for a holiday. There is no holiday this year. Enjoy the time, spend it with your family at home. Have a lovely Easter break at home. How many times do we not have enough time to spend with our family during these times? We're always leading such busy lives. It's actually a nice opportunity to be with loved ones during this time. The Queensland Police Commissioner, Katarina Carroll said Queensland police have turned away 532 vehicles at the border (from 23,000 cars). Police have also fined 139 people for breaking the social distancing rules, including 19 people who attended a car rally on the weekend. On the weekend, we have fined people for blatantly just being out and about for going for a ride or a drive. Which was clearly not essential travel. And I think that we have been patient. We have communicated with people. We have been very, very compassionate. But time and time again, even when we pull people over and explain this to them, and it's happened again and again, unfortunately it has for those people. They've been given an enforcement notice. We've seen people blatantly drive around our barricades. So now we are putting out concrete barricades to make sure that people can't drive on footpaths and get around them. So can I please ask - as we go into what is normal an incredibly busy weekend, that we really listen to the rules and comply with them. Because it has had an extraordinarily positive impact so far. The government's announcement about charities with a 15% decline in turnover qualifying for jobkeeper payments has raised hopes this will mean many universities now qualify. Higher education export, Andrew Norton, certainly saw it that way: Universities Australia seems to agree, its chief executive Catriona Jackson told Guardian Australia: Access to the jobkeeper payment on the amended terms for charities as outlined by the treasurer over the weekend is very important for universities. Some commonwealth government support is crucial if we are to ensure pathways are open for the next generation of students to receive a world-class education. Queensland will also be extending its testing regime. Chief health officer Jeanette Young says the 32 cases where community transmission seems to be to blame - on the Gold Coast, Brisbane and Cairns - are a concern: It wasn't from someone who had been overseas, it wasn't from a confirmed case. So therefore, today, I'm going to be asking healthcare workers to increase the people they are testing, even if they don't have any travel history. And I've asked for that to be done in the Gold Coast, in Brisbane and in Cairns. Because that's where we've seen those cases. So it doesn't make any difference to anyone who is out there, but it just means that when people present to their GP or present to a fever clinic, that they'll also be tested for Covid-19 if they have any respiratory symptoms. So that's cough, sore throat or shortness of breath. So we'll be doing that additional testing to just get a picture of whether we think that there is any community spread happening through one of our communities. So those places are the Gold Coast, Brisbane and Cairns. Queensland's health minister, Steven Miles, is updating on that state's Covid-19 situation with just 14 new cases since yesterday (less tests are being carried out on weekends): That 14 positive figure overnight is another great result for Queensland and underlines how effective we are all being at keeping our distance and keeping ourselves and our communities safe. Of the 921 cases so far, we consider 743 of those to be active, meaning that 173 are confirmed to have recovered. 43 remain in hospital. Of those, 12 are in intensive care and ten ventilated. It was tragic to hear the news that we lost another Queenslander to Covid-19 yesterday afternoon. Of the five Queenslanders who have died from this disease, four have come from cruise ships, as did the 78-year-old gentleman [who passed yesterday]. But the positive figures and the ongoing reduction in the average number of positive figures demonstrates just how what we are doing is working. We are slowing the spread, and all Queenslanders need to keep it up. This extra death reminds us that what we are doing is to save lives, to save the lives of other Queenslanders. Four more deaths have been reported, bringing the national total to 39. WA's hard border has been put in place - no one can enter without a police exemption. The Ekka (the Brisbane show) has been cancelled. The Gold Coast has closed three of its main beaches - the Spit, Coolangatta and Surfers Paradise - after visitors ignored social distancing rules. The government has ruled out including any more casuals in its wage subsidy plan. As the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke has just reiterated - although the prospect of a Senate select committee on the government's Covid-19 response is likely, Labor's position is that this is no substitute for parliament sitting. This had me wondering, given the government doesn't have a majority in the Senate, why doesn't Labor and the crossbench team up to schedule sittings there? Centre Alliance Senator Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia he has raised this issue with Labor, and it is under consideration. When parliament adjourned last time, it adjourned until 11 August, unless the government and opposition agreed otherwise. The plan is to flip the motion on Wednesday and have the Senate agree to come back sooner unless the government and opposition vacate the sitting dates on public health grounds. Patrick said: That way, the default is to sit - unless there is good reason not to. Special procedures could be adopted to accommodate social distancing... Such an arrangement should be adopted by both houses. Treasury is consolidating its factsheets on the measures the government has announced as part of its Covid-19 response. You will find them all here. Again, there were less tests done over the weekend. The ACT is now expanding its testing regime to anyone with symptoms, in a bid to judge community transmission. Goodstart Early Learning has emerged as one of the big winners from the government's change to the eligibility for the wage subsidy scheme. The group, which is the country's largest childcare provider with 665 centres, was originally going to face the higher bar of proving a 50% drop in turnover to access the jobkeeper payments. While most businesses and not-for-profit organisations have to prove a 30% drop in turnover, Goodstart faced a tougher test because it has more than $1bn of annual turnover. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, announced late last night that the threshold would be lowered to 15% for any charities registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission. Goodstart Early Learning said it was \"very relieved\" to learn that it was now eligible to apply for the $1,500 per fortnight subsidy for its staff. \"Access to the jobkeeper payments is vital as it will ensure that we can trade through this very difficult time,\" the chief executive, Julia Davison, said in a statement issued just now. Dan Tehan spoke to Neil Mitchell on Melbourne radio 3AW about some of the options being considered for this year's Year 12s this morning: Well, there's a lot of options. So, we've been talking to the universities, for instance, and they'd be happy to look at a mix of what's happened during the student's assessments in Year 11, and then look at what's happened in Year 12, and look at a mixture then of both. And, then they might look at some assessments themselves. So, there's that possibility. There's also the ability, of course, to be able to - and they do this for areas, for instance, which have been impacted by bushfires, or if the students have been ill - to be able to lift ATAR's to ensure that we get the right median right across the nation. And, look, there are other things as well. There is the possibility that you could push back when exams are. So, instead of them normally being in November, back into December. These will be all the things that we'll be looking at and working through tomorrow. Tony Burke, on Christian Porter's comments that basically, the government had \"better things to do\" than sit in parliament, had this to say about why it is necessary: To be the principal parliamentarian for the nation, to then ridicule the importance of their own job, that's what Christian Porter did today. He ridiculed the importance of his own job. Have a look at what question time was like when the parliament last met? Two things happened in terms of our questions. I don't think anyone can argue that they were [politically] targeted. The questions that we asked and indeed even the Dixons that came from the government. They weren't 'tell us how good you are' though they weren't sledges from us. They were questions of detail that the Australian people wanted answers for. And in fairness to the government ministers, the answers they gave were unusually good. They weren't slamming Labor. In fact, they managed to not once in an entire question time tell us how much they hate us. It was what question time should be. At the moment you've got parliament behaving at its best. And the government's response is they'd rather not have the parliament we showed last time. We can meet and observe a whole lot of social distancing and public health demands that are really important for people who then returned to all the corners of the country. Members of parliament, some of them had to isolate when they returned and had no hesitation in putting themselves forward again saying but they'd still come back this time. People want to do their jobs. And as members of parliament, our first job was to be a member of the parliament. We need the parliament to be meeting to be updated legislation. The national death toll has risen to 39, after Victoria reported two more deaths, which brings that state's toll to 10. NSW also reported two more deaths today. Negotiations are continuing for a Senate select committee, which would oversee the government's response to Covid-19. Labor's Katy Gallagher and Penny Wong are leading those negotiations, and the committee looks like it's being set up. But Tony Burke says there is still a need for parliament to sit. But Tony Burke says he can not see any circumstance that would prevent Labor from voting for the legislation. He says the opposition is just doing what it can to improve the bill: Nothing that I can imagine. Absolutely nothing that I can imagine. Let's not forget the order of this. We called for a wage subsidy. They said that they didn't want one. We kept demanding it. Eventually they said - OK, there will be a wage subsidy and we have welcomed that. The discussion since then is simply - how can we make it as effective as possible....Of course, we're not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. But we're not going to also, in the public argument and the debate between now and when this goes through, stop advocating for one million people who the government wants to leave behind. We want them included as well. We're arguing for that. We're advocating for that. Yesterday, the government gave them some hope. This morning, the government, for reasons I don't understand, has done an about-face. They really should be looking at this situation for casuals who are relying on this income. On Christian Porter's claim that the fair work commission would take too long to change things (which is why the government wants to change the fair work act in the parliament to pass the changes) Tony Burke says: The commission is showing at the moment that they can move at lightning speed. And you know, for a whole lot of... For most awards, this is a really simple and fast change. The only reason we've been arguing that the commission needs to have a role is because every award and employment arrangement is different. And as a result of that, there is a high chance that a legislative change will have unintended consequences. So that's what I've argued the whole way through this. Tony Burke is holding his press conference in Sydney. Asked why Labor is pushing for more casuals to be in included in the wage subsidy, given the Centrelink payment has doubled (which is $400 less than the wage subsidy) Burke says: There are two things that change. One - the amount is a different rate. But the bigger concern, and it's hard to think what would be a bigger concern than the rate, but I'll tell you, there is one, and it's this - you lose the connection to the employer. The reason Labor argued for a wage subsidy is because we want people to keep their connections to the employer during the crisis. Not only because it is better for them now, but it also means on the other side that then, the Australian economy will be able to kick back into gear more quickly, and those people who have been on a wage subsidy, the relationships that are there with the employer and they can get straight back to work. In previous downturns, many people when they've lost a relationship with the employer, many people never return to work again. We don't want that to happen. And that's why we've welcomed the government establishing a wage subsidy. But for people who are truly reliant on it, it should be there. There are flow on effects to the Year 12 exam issue. The university sector is already very, very nervous about what next year will look like, given a lack of international students. Take away new enrolments from this year's Year 12 and 2021 looks very, very difficult for the sector to navigate. I know there are a lot of Year 12 students who are in limbo over their final exams. It is a top agenda item on the national cabinet with many options being canvassed - which includes postponing the exams until April. From AAP: Education ministers are looking at every trick in the book to ensure year 12 students finish school this year despite the mayhem caused by coronavirus. Concerns have been raised about how the disruption caused by Covid-19 could damage year 12 results. State and federal ministers will meet on Tuesday to canvass options including extending the academic year or postponing final exams. They will also discuss boosting overall scores and changing university application procedures. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has floated the possibility of extending year 12 into next year, but his federal counterpart is not keen. \"All options will be considered tomorrow when we meet - that is an outlier option - that is in a very worst-case scenario,\" federal education minister Dan Tehan told Seven on Monday. \"The hope is that we will be able to get everyone through this year.\" State and territory curriculum and assessment authorities will present all available options to the meeting. Mr Tehan said it was likely responses to the pandemic would vary between jurisdictions. \"But there is a collective will amongst all education ministers for us to be able to ensure that all those Year 12 students will be able to complete their studies this year,\" he said. \"And then go on to university, vocational education or employment next year.\" Universities themselves are keeping a close eye on how the virus and disruptions are playing out for their potential graduates. But the sector's peak body says it's still too early to know what concessions might have to be given. \"This unprecedented situation is changing so rapidly that the impacts on both universities and schools six, nine and 12 months from now just aren't possible to predict,\" Universities Australia chief executive Catriona Jackson told AAP. \"However, universities are nonetheless aware of the potential impact of Covid-19 on school examinations and are developing contingency plans. These will be updated as circumstances change.\" The Royal Easter Show was expected. As was the August Brisbane Exhibition Show - it has just been made official I am pretty sure that the Victorian parliament is doing this too. NSW Health has released its official update for 6 April (remember there are fewer tests done on weekends). As at 8pm, Sunday, 5 April 2020, an additional 57 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed, since 8pm 4 April, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in NSW to 2,637. There are 249 people with COVID-19 being treated by NSW Health. This includes 40 people in Intensive Care Units, and 22 of these require ventilators. More than half the remaining cases are being treated through Hospital in the Home services. Sadly, NSW Health confirms the death of 2 people from COVID-19, bringing the state's total deaths to 18. An 86-year-old man confirmed to have COVID-19 has died in Liverpool Hospital. He was a resident of the Opal Care Bankstown aged care facility. There are now 5 cases associated with Opal Care Bankstown: 2 residents and 3 staff. An 85-year-old-man confirmed to have COVID-19 has died, also in Liverpool Hospital. He was a close contact of another confirmed case. NSW Health extends our condolences to the men's families. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians is asking the Australian public to stop unnecessarily wearing masks, with fears it could be taking necessary equipment from health workers: Dr Beata Byok, President of the Australasian Faculty of Occupational and Environmental Medicine and RACP spokesperson said \"Improper use or reuse of masks has the potential to increase your risk of infection. Personal protective equipment is critical for those at most risk; our frontline health and emergency service workers. \"For everyone else, please follow the official Government advice when it comes to protecting your health. \"The best ways for the public to protect themselves and others are to not go out when symptomatic, particuarly with a fever or cough, maintain social distance of 1.5 metres from others, wash hands frequently, cover your cough and sneeze and clean surfaces in common use. \"Wearing a face mask may make people think they are protected and neglect these other, vitally important, measures. Professor John Wilson, a Respiratory Physician and President-elect of the RACP says \"We know that there is a shortage of vital personal protective equipment for health workers, who are putting themselves at risk to serve the community through this pandemic. \"Masks need to be available to essential workers at greatest risk of exposure - so Australians need to do their bit and not inappropriately use much needed medical equipment including masks produced for medical use. \"If you are unwell you should be staying at home. A mask is only necessary if this is recommended by your doctor or nurse. \"We understand that during these unprecedented times, people are feeling anxious. There are many other highly effective actions people should be taking to protect themselves and others from the virus. Social distancing and hand-washing are the most effective means of stopping the spread of infection.\" The wage subsidy legislation the government is taking to the parliament on Wednesday is still being drafted. The international aid agency Plan International Australia has thanked the government for lowering the lost revenue threshold to 15% for charities to access the scheme, but also wants the government to remove government grants from the eligibility criteria Plan International Australia CEO Susanne Legena said even with the new provision in the legislation, announced by Minister Josh Frydenberg yesterday, it remains likely many INGOs will remain ineligible due to their highly complicated funding structures. \"The Australian aid agencies on the front line of containing COVID19 in the Pacific and developing nations are being hard-hit by the economic downturn and may struggle to survive the coming months,\" Ms Legena said. \"Aid agencies have very complicated funding structures, so even with yesterday's generous announcement that the Government will lower the threshold to a 15% downturn for charities, the reality is it may not help charities like us. \"Why? For two reasons, firstly, because we receive government grants to deliver the work that do not necessarily extend to staff wages and secondly, as donations dry up, we are suffering a slower, rather than an immediate downturn, but even so the effects will be just as disastrous. \"That is why it's absolutely crucial this new legislation, which will go to the Parliament on Wednesday, needs to exclude government grants in annual turnover, and the test for charities must be based on a projected deadline in revenue over the next 12 months.\" Andrew Giles, the shadow minister for multicultural affairs, has called on the government to provide meaningful support to temporary visa holders, saying, \"We should look after our mates, so they can look after us.\" He said international travel restrictions and a massive reduction in international flights meant many temporary migrants were now stuck in Australia with no way home - often in desperate circumstances that bore no relationship to the purpose for which they came here. \"Without a network of family or friends and without access to a government safety net, people are at risk of becoming homeless and reliant on over-stretched charity organisations.\" Giles argued that some temporary migrants would likely fall through the cracks of the programs - including jobkeeper - announced so far. \"Social distancing won't work if there's no safety net for people like Sourabh Sanam, a 27-year-old intern chef, at a Sydney restaurant. \"Sourabh lost his job, can't return home and his visa conditions mean he is currently not able to apply for another job. He's not the only temporary migrant in Australia that is in a difficult situation through no fault of their own.\" Asked how he knows it is visitors, and not Gold Coasters, who are disobeying the rules, Tom Tate says: When I speak to [the police] chief superintendent there are a lot of cars we pull over and ask whether it is essential travel and they are going to the beach. It's not essential travel. Plus a lot of locals and news crews, were at The Spit and the majority of questions when asked where are you from? From Brisbane. So, quantitatively or not, the congregating is happening. And I put it straight on to the fact that the congregations are happening around The Spit and the northern part. You go further south and where locals go, that's not happening. So, my summation then is out of towners are congregating and not respecting what we Gold Coasters are doing. Queensland's premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has asked Queenslanders to stay in their suburbs. Tate says if the rules keep being disobeyed, the Gold Coast will close and barricade more of its beaches. The Gold Coast mayor, Tom Tate, says he has been forced to close some of the region's most famous beaches after visitors failed to obey social distancing rules: Gold Coasters should fight Covid-19 with community, and the out of towners should do the same as the Gold Coasters. Unfortunately, over the weekend, out of towners are descending on the Gold Coast in mass numbers. And I fear that this number will increase over the Easter weekend. Therefore, as of midnight Tuesday, tomorrow night, the Spit, Surfers Paradise and Coolangatta beaches will be closed. To Brisbane and Logan, we love you but we don't want you visiting now. The [other] beaches are open for our locals so they can walk and continue to exercise. We are working through the finer details to have parking officers redeployed to monitor illegal parking. I didn't want to do this but over the weekend, it shows me, especially people visiting from Brisbane are not listening to us. Tony Burke has been very quick off the mark responding to Christian Porter this morning: Up to 1.1 million casual workers will miss out on a wage subsidy - and potentially be forced into the unemployment queue - because of the Morrison Government's refusal to compromise. Yesterday, Christian Porter signalled he was listening to Labor and union concerns, and was considering changes to the JobKeeper program that would extend it to more casuals who will otherwise miss out. The Government even briefed possible changes to the newspapers. But this morning Porter - clearly overruled by his own colleagues - has ruled out any such change. Porter must now explain why he thinks forcing up to 1.1 million casuals into the Centrelink line is good for those workers or for the Australian economy. Instead he is trying to distract from this terrible decision by making the ridiculous claim that Labor intends to block the JobKeeper legislation. This is hysterical and dishonest nonsense. It was Labor that pushed for a wage subsidy for weeks when the Government was stubbornly ruling it out. Labor facilitated the return of Parliament this week because we want this legislation to pass as soon as possible. It would certainly help if the Government provided us with the Fair Work Act amendments rather than blank pages. Labor has also argued Parliament should continue to sit regularly throughout this crisis so we can fix any problems that arise and provide more support for people. It is the Government that has put the Parliament into \"hibernation\". Since the Government announced JobKeeper we have only made constructive suggestions on how to improve it so it can reach as many people as possible and isn't subject to rorting. We have never once suggested we would hold up the passage of this wage subsidy. The ACCC has released a warning over scammers attempting to have Australians access their super early, through a third party, which is charging a fee: Scammers are now trying to exploit Australians financially impacted by the COVID-19 crisis with new superannuation scams being reported to Scamwatch in recent weeks. Scammers are already trying to take advantage of the Government's recent announcement that people suffering financial hardship can have partial access to their superannuation from mid-April. \"Scammers are cold-calling people claiming to be from organisations that can help you get early access to your super,\" ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said. \"For most people, outside of their home, superannuation is their greatest asset and you can't be too careful about protecting it.\" \"The Australian Taxation Office is coordinating the early release of super through myGov and there is no need to involve a third party or pay a fee to get access under this scheme.\" You also DO NOT have to access your super to pay your rent if you are in financial difficulty. Asic has warned real estate agents in each state about giving what amounts to unlawful financial advice, after letters emerged from real estate agents to tenants, telling them accessing their superannuation was an option to pay their rent: ASIC's concerns We are concerned that the conduct by real estate agents referred to above may:  constitute unlicensed financial advice in contravention of section 911A of the Corporations Act; or  not be in the best interests of individuals in contravention of section 961B of the Corporations Act. Financial advice must only be provided by qualified and licensed financial advisers, or financial counsellors, not by real estate agents who neither hold the requisite licence, nor are an authorised representative of an Australian Financial Services Licensee. Christian Porter also went with a semi-Star Wars reference to explain the \"controlled hibernation\" of Australia's economy: We don't want to put an economy into complete carbon freeze. There is work for casuals in some sectors, it's growing and we have seen that. Obviously in many sectors it has tapered off and [employment is] down. But there has to be a line drawn. Carbonite seemed to work out for Han though. You have probably heard of NRL Island - a proposal to house all the NRL players together on an island, to keep the league playing during the coronacrisis, while obeying travel restrictions. (If not, you can read about it here.) AAP reports the AFL is looking at something similar: The AFL, which reduced its regular season to 17 rounds on the eve of the opening clash, has joined the growing trend of sports across the globe to consider extreme measures in uncertain times. The competition is suspended at least until May 31 due to the coronavirus pandemic. AFL football operations general manager Steve Hocking says the league is determined to play all remaining 16 rounds. One option being mulled by the AFL is having all players quarantined away from their families in order to complete the match schedule when they are given the green light to resume playing. Christian Porter is asked about this story from the ABC: Australian Federal Police (AFP) recruits are under investigation for throwing a party at their residential college in Canberra in apparent breach of the strict coronavirus regulations their senior colleagues are now enforcing. The AFP confirmed it was aware of an \"internal recruit gathering\" at its training college in the Canberra suburb of Barton late on Friday. \"ACT Police can confirm it attended a gathering at the AFP College on Friday evening and spoke with those involved,\" an AFP spokesperson told the ABC. \"The matter has been handed to the AFP to investigate further and take any action deemed necessary. The matter is currently being investigated.\" Look, I haven't seen the video. It is another matter I am dealing with but it doesn't sound very good and it sounds like it should definitely be a matter of disciplinary proceedings for the commissioner with his recruits which I am sure he will engage in with a robust fashion, but I haven't seen the video. Why hasn't Labor seen the draft of the laws to change the Fair Work Act? (It was sent a blank page). Christian Porter: We undertook to get a draft which is complicated, that draft went, in the meantime we transmitted drafting to the ACTU, I am working through that this morning. Then, when there is a final draft of the fair work side, it gets married up to the Treasury side. I understand we discuss it with Labor tonight as a whole. That is as good as we can do and be consultative through the union movement who have been very helpful with this process but that is as good as we can do in the timing we have. Some people would like more time. I'm one of them, but that's as good as we can do in the circumstances. Christian Porter, who has just spent another 10 minutes saying why the only way the government can make the changes it needs to make to legislate the jobkeeper subsidy is to change the Fair Work Act, now says he can't change the definition of a \"casual worker\" to ensure those who have worked less than 12 months for one employer can access the scheme, because that would require changing the Fair Work Act: Q: Will you make any changes to extend it to allow casuals who have been with their employer or employers for less than 12 months to be eligible? A yes or no? Any changes? Porter: I will confirm this for the seventh time in the course of two days but the definition is systemic and regular definition with the same employer for 12 months. Q: No bending? Porter: That's the definition. He is a fan of his \"Dunkirk\" analogy and uses it again: I've described it as a $130bn worth of lifeboats going out. This is parliament's Dunkirk moment. We get the lifeboats out, and we save jobs. And we do it in the simplest, clearest, guaranteed formula that parliament can devise.\" (Anyone who has studied Operation Dynamo knows it wasn't a smooth process, and there was quite a bit of luck involved in its success, which maybe doesn't make it the greatest analogy here.) Christian Porter is explaining the government's position on changes to the Fair Work Act. He says the government believes it is \"not plausible\" to make the changes any other way. The structural problem the legislation needs to deal with, simply put, if a business on the edge of viability, can only afford to pay a worker the $1,500 jobkeeper amount, unless we change the Fair Work Act, we cannot guarantee that a worker can lawfully work the right amount of hours for the $1,500 payment. Now, Labor suggested, I think in the words of Tony Burke, their view is that that should be done by the commissioner, the Fair Work Commission. Now, the difficulty with that is that would require changes to 121 modern awards, an unknown, but high percentage of 11,000 enterprise agreements. And 4 million Australians who are under agreements, some tied to awards, some not tied to awards. That process, if it could be done, would take weeks, if not months, it complete. The only sure way we can guarantee a person works the right amount of hours for a $1,500 payment if that is all the business can afford because its viability is threatened is to change the Fair Work Act. It is as simple as that. Mark McGowan says he is \"100% sure\" that closing WA's borders was the right action to take. The west has taken the hard border shutdown approach - as of midnight, anyone seeking entry to WA must: Anyone seeking an exemption must complete the following Exemption Application form prior to travel and submit it by emailing the form to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:WAEntryRequest@police.wa.gov.au\">WAEntryRequest@police.wa.gov.au</email> Exemptions must be granted by WA Police prior to travel. You must carry your exemption form and proof of its submission when travelling. You may be asked to produce this documentation at a check point or by WA Police patrolling the area. If your exemption category requires further documentation or proof you must produce this on request. Failure to produce this documentation may result in penalties including imprisonment or a fine of up to $50,000 for individuals or $250,000 for organisations. Queensland police have created a social distancing chart for that state: Covid-19 has also changed Australia's scientific expeditions. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, says there needs to be changes to how Australia's researchers approach Antarctic expeditions: The COVID-19 crisis has meant that for one of the few times in our rich Antarctic history, Australia will be forced to limit scientific research at its stations next summer and send only the most essential expeditioners to maintain stations and services. Careful management and screening to date has made our stations on the Antarctic continent and sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island COVID-19 free. However, the ongoing pandemic has led to substantial changes in operations including: decreased operational capacity disrupted supply chains delays in major projects including the RSV Nuyina the inability to assemble and train teams for next season Instead of sending 500 expeditioners to the region next summer season (October 2020-March 2021) the Australian Antarctic Division will send only around 150. The focus will be on essential tasks including the resupply of stations, the change-over of teams, and automated research and data collection. Labor still wants parliament to sit during the Covid-19 crisis, to ensure there is accountability and a sense of normalcy around Australia's democracy. Christian Porter told the ABC this morning that would be a \"waste of time\": Parliament's a very flexible organ of government, right? The power exists to recall parliament any time it's needed, which is exactly what we're doing on Wednesday and we're doing it in a flexible way. But why would we set down a regular sitting schedule over the coming weeks and months, in the most irregular time Australia has ever known? What is the point of that? I mean again, why we are being dragged into these bizarre procedural debate, if people want to sit out there during the greatest economic crisis Australia's experienced and read practice and procedure of the House of Representatives, good luck to them. But we've got better things to do. Other than emergency sittings, parliament is not scheduled to sit, as normal, until at least August. Police in Victoria have fined 108 people for breaching quarantine and social distancing laws in the past 24 hours. They have also conducted 983 checks on \"homes, businesses, and non-essential services\", a statement said. Since these laws came into force on 21 March, police in Victoria have conducted 14,275 spot checks. Christian Porter is holding a press conference at 10.30. He has ruled out changing the jobkeeper scheme to include casuals who have been employed for less than 12 months. Here he is speaking to Fran Kelly this morning, on ABC radio: Well, I mean, we've got to refine our definition but it's not going to be changed in its essential principle. And what we said from the outset was that casuals who will be eligible for jobkeeper are those that have been employed on a regular and a systemic basis for about 12 months, for a 12-month period. Now that's a definition of casual that's meant to show a pattern of employment over a period of time. That's a definition that sits inside the Fair Work Act already, that's known to the industrial law. You have to have some kind of guiding limits on the outer edges, even of a scheme that represents expenditure of this extraordinary amount. So the fundamental principle is not going to change, I mean, how we finally work the drafting of that, we are still working through at the moment. But the fundamental principle is that you get it if you're a casual, if you've had connections to your employer for that period of time. Now that doesn't put any limit on how many hours you worked or whether you had shifts that were different from week to week. So you will find that some people in those categories worked for only a few hours and will find themselves being lifted up very quickly to that $1,500 payment. This may be news to people (like me) who have seen repeated \"no connection\" screens, or buffering, but the ACCC boss, Rod Sims, says NBN speeds are holding up well, according to the measuring broadband Australia tests the consumer watchdog has put in place: It is clear that NBN Co's temporary boost in network capacity which allows RSPs to increase their capacity on the network by up to 40% at no extra cost for three months is underpinning these encouraging results. Despite serious issues when there was a massive increase in calls to some government numbers, mobile networks are handling the increase in volume quite well. Retailers are increasing plan allowances or reducing excess charges to help their customers adjust, and they should be applauded for this. Brendan O'Connor was asked about employers asking staff to run down their leave entitlements at the same time as accepting the government's proposed wage subsidy, when talking to Laura Jayes on Sky News this morning: I don't think it's fair that the taxpayer of Australia subsidises an employer to pay for what are effectively entitlements already owed to employees. A wage subsidy has never been used in a way to subsidise ongoing entitlements. It's about prospective wages so that employers are relieved of the burden of paying those wages or a large part of those wages and also ensuring that there is no sort of rorting going on. Now I think most employers of course want to do the right thing. They always do, as do employees, so I think it's fair to say the taxpayers of Australia shouldn't be finding a way to subsidise entitlements owed to employees that already exist because of accumulated leave. I think it's also fair to say that some employees and employers will arrange employees taking leave. That's OK, but we just have to watch out for any gaming of this arrangement. The Liberal senator Zed Seselja was asked on Sky why giant entities like the Catholic church can access the government's jobkeeper scheme when it has billions in assets, especially given that companies like Virgin will most likely be denied a bailout, because it is mostly foreign-owned: Well, we're certainly not in the business as a general rule of bailouts. But what we have said in our response, is that we will scale up our support that it will be targeted, that it will ensure that it gets support fundamentally to keeping people in work. That has been the fundamental of economic responses as we've dealt with the health crisis. We have designed a package which provides a larger safety net a much larger safety net for those who find themselves out of work, but for those who can remain in work, who can remain attached to their employer. And I think Australians would expect nothing less, whether they're employed by a foreign employer or by an Australian employer. It is a job for that person. It is a job for that family. And there's a way that I can look after themselves. We want to keep them attached to those businesses, so that when the economy rebounds, they will be much better placed, they will be still part of the workforce and, and hopefully, and we hope and expect that those jobs will grow and the ability of those businesses to fund those jobs will grow as revenue comes back. This is another change put through in response to mass job losses in rural, regional and community media: The government has lowered the bar for charities to access the jobkeeper wage subsidy but some not-for-profits say more changes are needed. On Monday Josh Frydenberg announced changes that meant charities could now access the package, which provides $1,500 per fortnight per employee, by demonstrating a 15% hit to revenue as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The bar for small and medium-sized businesses is 30%, while companies with a turnover above $1bn must show a 50% decrease in revenue. Anglicare Australia's executive director, Kasy Chambers, said: Charities are run differently from businesses. Our budgets are not just about simple profits and losses. Grants that are used to carry out one aspect of our work can't be used to fund another aspect of our work. That means that if we're seeing major losses in our childcare services or from our op shops, we can't prop them up with funding from other grants. These losses mean that some charities will have to stand down a huge number of workers - but still won't be eligible for the jobkeeper payment. The government has now recognised that charities are different from businesses, and that's a great start. Now we need to see changes in how this scheme will work. That means that the jobkeeper scheme should exclude grants where the funding is tied. Charities simply don't have the freedom to use that funding to prop up other workers. Parliament will consider the jobkeeper package on Wednesday. This is the argument Labor is having with the government. It wants to know what the changes to the Fair Work Act are. Christian Porter says those have been provided to Labor. This is what Labor received: NSW Health authorities are also extending testing facilities in areas where there have been clusters identified: Dr Jeremy Mcanulty: We are extending testing and encouraging doctors and patients who have got symptoms, so people with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, so cough, shortness of death, sore throat or fever in the areas where we've seen some evidence of local transmission to talk to their GP or go to a testing clinic for testing. So these areas are Broken Hill, Lake Macquarie, Manning Valley, Waverley, Woollahra, Ryde, Macquarie Park, Dee Why, Manly, Nowra and south Nowra, Byron Bay and Port Macquarie. As an added precaution we want to make sure we have access to testing those areas where there may be some local transmission so we can find people early and make sure they are in isolation and cared for and make sure that their contacts, who may be also at risk of getting infection are aware and also placed in isolation to avoid any ongoing transmission. Peter Gutwein also gave a special message for those in the north-west community, after a cluster in the hospital: I want to say a few words to our north-west community. It is important you understand this is serious. I cannot stress just how serious this is in terms of ensuring that you abide by the rules. An investigation is under way, which will obviously include the identification of contacts both in the community and within the hospital. It will look at the risk to staff, patients and visitors to the hospital. We are throwing additional resources at this. The CIB and members of police will be assisting the public health effort as we look to work through this and get to the bottom of this situation. I want to, very clearly, say that we will aggressively track and trace contacts and in terms of the incident management teams that have been established they will do everything they possibly can to get to the bottom of this. I want to say to people that whilst it is concerning, this will not be the last time that we will see this type of outbreak at a hospital in Tasmania. I want to be clear about that. I don't want to normalise it because it is something we have to deal with and treat as very serious. But importantly, for those people that live on the north-west coast, the message could not be stronger, nor firmer, than rights now to ensure that you abide by the rules, that you take into account the rules relating to social distancing, that's you stay at home unless you are travelling to work or to volunteer, unless you are going out for essential services or medical supplies, unless you are going to school or study if that can't be done at home and importantly if you're going out to exercise. Tasmania's premier, Peter Gutwein, is at the podium for his daily update. There have been four more cases overnight, bringing the state's total to 86. I can confirm two of the cases related to cruise travel and one another to the contact of a previously known case with both being in quarantine. The others relate to the north-west regional hospital cluster, in fact, to the north-west outbreak we are seeing at the moment. We have a health worker and patient both tested as positive. The national cabinet is still trying to decide what to do about year 12 exams as well. There is no answer on that as yet but there are suggestions it will be pushed to next year. That's because there is so sign of Australian life returning to anything even resembling normal, until at least October. Christian Porter and the government are pushing back against calls to have the jobkeeper wage subsidy (the $1,500 one) extended to a wider group of casuals. The subsidy is available to casuals who have worked in the same job for at least a year. The government has been asked to extend the program to include casuals but Porter has given that a firm no. AAP also has a report on an upcoming test, looking at people's immunity to Covid-19. Australian scientists have made a test to check who is likely to develop coronavirus. Researchers at Monash University and Alfred Health have developed a rapid test to determine a person's immunity to Covid-19. The test will indicate who remains infectious and the severity of Covid-19 if a person was to get it. Cell samples will begin arriving from the three coronavirus hotspots - Italy, China and New York - as well as sufferers from Melbourne, from next week. The test will also look for differences in the blood of patients with a mild disease compared to those with a severe infection to find biomarkers to predict who needs early medical treatment. Experts repurposed influenza and allergy testing technology to create the rapid test, which will involve a blood test. \"This and other tests like it will provide us with a more nuanced approach to managing the disease,\" lead researcher Associate Professor Menno van Zelm, from Monash University's Central Clinical School, said on Monday. The test, similar to that for influenza, looks at memory B lymphocytes which are immune system cells that make antibodies to fight pathogens such as viruses. The cells remember the same pathogens for a faster fight in the future, and are formed after vaccination. If there is evidence of a large population of the cells specific to a pathogen, it is likely a person has been infected in the past. The test is expected to be ready in the coming months. A tiger has tested positive for coronavirus in the US. The Bronx zoo resident is expected to make a recovery. The government is expected to release the modelling it has been using to make its decisions after the Tuesday meeting of the national cabinet with all the state and territory leaders. Scott Morrison made the commitment on Friday: That modelling work looks at different scenarios. So we can be confident to an acceptable level that the potential course of the virus in Australia will run at a pace in which our health systems will be able to support the Australian population. The early news on some of this early modelling is that at the current rate, if we keep doing what we're doing and we keep doing the work to upgrade our ICU capacity and secure the extra ventilators and all of the things we're doing right now, then right now that trajectory is promising. It's encouraging, but there are no guarantees I want to stress, this virus writes its own rules and we have to seek to try and understand them as best we can and respond as best we can to the pressures that we face. Now, that modelling will have further work done over the course of the next few days. It will be reviewed again by the national cabinet when it next meets next Tuesday morning. And then following that, the chief medical officer and I will be conducting a briefing on that information and sharing that with the nation. The good news, though, is that on the scenario planning we have at the moment, we are tracking well, but we can take none of that for granted. AAP has this report on businesses needing loans to survive: Small and medium businesses have borrowed more than $150m from the Commonwealth Bank as they battle the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The loans are part of the federal government's Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme, which became available on 23 March. The government guarantees 50% of the loan amount. Commonwealth Bank says more than 1,850 traders have taken loans and nearly 70% of the businesses are from NSW. Hospitality operators accounted for 15% of the businesses receiving loans followed by construction (13%), professional services (12%) and retail (11%t). The hospitality sector has been among the hardest hit by restrictions on public gatherings to slow the spread of the virus. Most banks last month announced a host of measures, such as the scrapping of fees and postponing repayments, to help businesses and individuals. There are some wobbles on the bipartisanship over the $130bn six-month wage subsidy legislation. Here was Christian Porter on the ABC this morning: This is our Dunkirk moment. What we cannot be doing is what people like Tony Burke and the Labor party are doing and say wait, that we should wait for changes to award systems or 11,000 enterprise agreements or millions of Australians who are on individual contracts. That is crazy stuff. This is happening in 48 hours. The lifeboats have been pushed out in 48 hours - $130bn worth of them and people need to decide whether or not they are going to help us push those lifeboats out. Tony Burke responded on Twitter: The Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, who was instrumental in leading NSW out of the summer bushfire crisis, finishes up in that role in a month - and takes on a new role, as NSW's resilience commissioner. The premier said the new agency was necessary: A new agency that will ensure now and into the future New South Wales is prepared but also is able to respond and recover through major crises be it Covid, be it cybersecurity be it a with whole range of things we could not foreshadow. Who would have thought in 2020 NSW would be facing a pandemic. We don't know the challenges of the future but what I do know is that NSW through Resilience NSW will be able to focus on preparing and recovering from anything that comes our way now and into the future. It is really important for us to have a whole-of-government approach and I really want to thank Commissioner Fitzsimmons for accepting this new role within the public service, which he will commence in a month. The NSW Health executive director Dr Jeremy McAnulty is giving the update from his department. There are now 2,637 cases in NSW. There was an increase of 57 to 8pm last night, but the doctor says people also need to keep in mind that there were less tests performed at the weekend. McAnulty also said there were two deaths in NSW yesterday: an 86-year-old man an 85-year-old man He didn't give any more information than that. Mick Fuller says 97 international flights have arrived into Sydney with 4,500 people in quarantine in Sydney hotels. Wednesday will be the end of the quarantine for the first group, with 200 people allowed home. The only ship still in NSW waters is the Ruby Princess. It is due to dock very soon. Fuller: Between New South Wales Health, the New South Wales police and the emergency management team a plan has been developed that will be around isolation on the ship and then from that, from that 10-day period of isolation we can then continue to work with Carnival in relation to repatriation of the individuals on the ship. There are some 1,040 crew members on the ship from 50 different countries but nevertheless we will continue to work with them closely. Obviously the health and wellbeing of the crew members is essential. Another two crew members were taken off the ship yesterday requiring additional medical assistance. We will continue to do that. The ship itself will dock at Port Kembla shortly. The reason we need to dock it is because of the regular supplies that need to go on the ship. Taking sick crew/passengers off at sea is a complex and dangerous task. Gladys Berejiklian is holding her daily press conference. She says NSW will continue to review the restrictions in place but there are \"early positive signs\" and the state is looking towards recovery: It has been about a week now and we know we are making a difference and we want to keep this up because every four weeks, every day, we are able to review how New South Wales is going and there is a chance down the track where we can lift the restrictions in some ways or else what we don't want to have to do is go harder and that is certainly something I don't want to do. I'm also pleased to say we have already started focusing on recovery, on what we can do as we emerge out of this difficult time. We know the next six months are going to be difficult and what we have done today is announce that through Tafe there are 21 free courses you can do from home to upgrade your skills or to acquire new skills and this is good news. It means people can start preparing for when these difficult times are over and through Tafe NSW if you pop on to their website you can actually acquire how you can do one of these courses from home and get qualified over a short period of time. Rather than just if you haven't got a job or not working from home, it is an opportunity for you to upgrade your skills or acquire new skills so you can enter or re-enter the workforce when you finish this difficult time. In case you haven't seen it, the Queen sent a message to Australians overnight: At a time when people across the Commonwealth are experiencing a profound and rapid change to their lives, the pain of lost loved ones, and an understandable concern about the future, my thoughts are with all Australians. Whilst it can be difficult to remain hopeful in such challenging times, especially following the summer's devastating bushfires and recent flooding, I am confident that the stoic and resilient nature of the Australian people will rise to the challenge. I extend my sincere admiration to the many Australians who work tirelessly to help those affected, provide essential services for their fellow citizens, and continue to care for the most vulnerable. You will remain in my prayers in the coming months, with the resolute knowledge that with hard work, faith and unity, we will rise to the challenges ahead and ensure the health and vitality of all Australia's communities. I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all. Elizabeth R The ACT will begin testing for community transmission of Covid-19 today by allowing for random tests. While someone must still have symptoms of Covid-19, they don't need any of the other indicators - such as travel overseas, or contact with someone who has been a confirmed case, to be tested. There are thought to be about 200 crew members displaying Covid-19 symptoms on the Ruby Princess. It is one of the reasons they won't be allowed to disembark. All eyes on Port Kembla, near Wollongong, where the cruise liner the Ruby Princess is due to dock. NSW ports say they have been directed to provide berth and port facilities for a period of 10 days. No crew will be allowed off the ship except those who require hospitalisation. Instead, Border Force officials and health workers will board the ship to test crew members for the coronavirus. The operation will be overseen by NSW Health and police. In a press conference yesterday afternoon the police commissioner, Mike Fuller, said he now required the ship to stay in Australian waters while a criminal investigation into its handling when it docked in Sydney on 19 March is conducted. Authorities want to know whether or not Carnival Cruises, which owns the ship, was as forthcoming as it needed to be about Covid-19 cases on board. At least 600 of Australia's cases and 11 deaths have been linked to the ship. MPs are preparing for parliament to return on Wednesday, where the $130bn six-month wage subsidy plan will be legislated. There are still some kinks to work out with the Fair Work Act but it is being done in the shadow of a 20-point turnaround in Scott Morrison's personal Newspoll popularity over his handling over Covid-19. You have the entire Guardian Australia brains trust at your disposal as we cover that and everything else that happens today.

We have just 4 per cent of the world\u2019s population, but 25 per cent of the world\u2019s Covid cases,\u201d Mr Clinton said in a blistering attack at a virtual convention to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ded4bfa-6ad5-4583-9247-bcb18b6e777c\"> formally nominate</url> Joe Biden as the party\u2019s presidential candidate for November\u2019s election. </p><p>Elsewhere, the pandemic is already claiming political casualties. Bill Morneau resigned as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db79d415-ddc3-4238-a9f4-d12f9817870d\"> Canadian finance minister</url> after a spat with prime minister Justin Trudeau over Ottawa\u2019s fiscal response to the crisis. Deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland will succeed him.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Japan</emphasis>, rivals have begun manoeuvring for power after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/788136c4-b499-4cd1-b2e4-0c71f336364d\"> Shinzo Abe paid a surprise visit</url> to Keio University Hospital on Monday. Officials insisted the prime minister was undergoing a routine medical check-up but the visit has added to concerns about his passive response to the country\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak.</p><p>In the UK, health secretary Matt Hancock has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d703c18c-d4f7-4c77-b414-b5717d68097f\"> scrapped Public Health England</url>, making it the scapegoat for sluggish testing. But, as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/740381f8-39d8-44da-8f89-bf3edaccf873\"> FT View argues</url>, \u201cthe middle of the worst global pandemic for decades is a strange moment to launch a major restructuring\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. If the revamp causes delays and mishaps before the winter, the public will once again be the losers.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, England\u2019s largest coronavirus infection survey will <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09ea77e1-16ae-4827-b18d-790d297fefd1\"> expand more than fivefold</url> in the next two months to test 150,000 people every fortnight.</p><p>Amid fears over another surge in cases in coming months, the wearing of face masks is still under debate. Sweden, renowned for its lighter-touch approach to Covid-19 regulations, is one of the few European countries <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3148de6c-3b33-42d3-8cf6-d0e4263cea82\"> not to recommend using masks </url>after neighbouring Norway, Denmark and Finland all changed their positions in the past week.</p><p>Markets</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">US equities</emphasis> edged just above the record high recorded on Tuesday in a day of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6101ea04-191b-44ca-9d3d-7512823e2eb4\"> muted activity for global bourses</url>. Germany drew record demand for a sale of 30-year bonds, suggesting that a global decline in fixed income a week ago may have run out of steam. </p><p>The five largest stocks in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500</emphasis> together account for a quarter of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a44614e5-c193-4beb-b2c5-4dc75c70f030\"> pandemic-defying rally</url> since the crescendo of selling in late March. Brad Neuman, director of market strategy for Alger, a New York fund manager, said the new market peak reflects a \u201crecord divergence between winners and losers\u201d benefiting big tech groups that dominate the digital economy in areas such as cloud computing and online shopping.</p><p>Investors\u2019 ravenous <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aef7be8f-3c81-4f9e-971c-e4a4b738f738\"> appetite for higher-yielding assets</url> is boosting some of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">riskiest classes</emphasis> of bonds that have so far trailed a broad rally in corporate debt. \u201cThe higher-quality companies are simply\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5b6138b-df18-497f-bed1-57a0f75bfc1f\"> not providing the yield</url>,\u201d said Tom Ross, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.</p><p>Business</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook </emphasis>is failing to curb the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f33f7d61-a8df-40b9-82a8-75f2a41210bc\"> rampant spread of medical disinformation</url> on its platform, with misleading content generating an estimated 3.8bn views over the past year, according to a damning new report into the social media company. The most popular \u201csuper spreader\u201d sites received four times the clicks of bodies such as the US Center For Disease Control and World Health Organization. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maersk</emphasis>, the world\u2019s largest container shipping line, has warned it faces a \u201cmassive problem\u201d from crew being stranded on its vessels because of closed borders and a lack of commercial flights, even as it defied a slump in global trade to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e1745c5-a4be-4c38-ad24-f6f3b4b353b2\"> report higher quarterly profits</url>. A mix of cost cuts, higher freight rates and lower oil prices helped lift second-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 25 per cent to $1.7bn from the same period a year ago.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target</emphasis>, the retailer with 1,900 stores across the US, has reported <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/494045e1-080f-41f4-a1c0-9319385b8553\"> the biggest quarterly sales surge</url> in its 58-year history, driven by ecommerce and strong growth in stores that it was able to keep open during lockdown because of the variety of goods offered. Sales of electronics rose more than 70 per cent, home categories such as kitchenware 30 per cent and food, beverage and other essentials 20 per cent.</p><p>Global economy</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Europe </emphasis>will only fully recover from the economic impact of coronavirus if governments use their vastly increased <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55fc7bb7-0721-46c8-8dfa-9605f15b3422\"> debt to invest in young people</url>, innovation and research, Mario Draghi has said in his first speech since leaving the European Central Bank last year. \u201cThe debt created by the pandemic is unprecedented and will have to be repaid mainly by those who are young today,\u201d he said.</p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">US Congress</emphasis> should authorise an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5814bf8-ee55-447e-b25b-4475e88a69c2\"> economic stimulus programme</url> now, and set direct cash payments in stone as a permanent policy triggered whenever unemployment rises quickly, argues Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder. Such \u201cautomatic stabilisers\u201d have been shown to ease poverty and will avoid future delays in payouts.</p><p>A nascent recovery in petrol and clothing prices drove up <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UK inflation</emphasis> more than expected in July, with the opening up of global economies after coronavirus lockdowns continuing to place upward pressure on the price of holidays. The consumer prices index <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad39edd3-b9d4-4c58-b50e-7783d6038baf\"> rose 1 per cent year on year</url> from a 0.6 per cent rise in June.</p><p>Get in touch</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How is your workplace dealing with the pandemic?

One survey showed that 24m Americans have provided financial support to their adult children since the start of the pandemic.</p><p>The crisis has led to a sharp rise in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">addiction</emphasis>, as isolation, anxiety, joblessness \u2014 and stimulus cash \u2014 have led to increased drug for many, writes Patti Waldmeir.

The way it looks like it might work, is $1,200 per adult up to $75,000 in yearly income, a smaller amount for those who make up the $99,000, and $500 per child.</p><p>In the daily coronavirus briefing this morning, the president optimistic that some treatments may be available soon, one of them from Gilead Pharmaceuticals called remdesivir, another an existing anti-malarial drug called hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>The president saying, if either one of those becomes available, it could really change the whole computation here. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine works, or any of the other things that they're looking at that are not quite as far out, but if they work, your numbers are going to come down very rapidly. So we will see what happens.</p><p>But there's a real chance that they might -- they might work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Now, of course, yesterday, the president signing the Defense Production Act, which would allow him to guide companies into ramping up quickly inventories of much needed medical supplies.</p><p>But the president holding off on that for now, despite calls from the Democratic leadership that he needs to put that into action right now. I asked the president about that this morning. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: You enabled, I guess, is probably the best way to put it, the Defense production Act yesterday, but you didn't pull the trigger on it.</p><p>TRUMP: No, because we hope we're not going to need that.</p><p>Governors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work, and they are doing a lot of this work. And they are doing a lot of this work.</p><p>The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. We're not a shipping clerk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: And we keep ticking down on the president's 15-day guidelines to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but indications from the surgeon general, Jerome Adams, today that 15 days may not be enough.</p><p>What does the president think? Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I hope very soon. We will see. This is uncharted territory, as you know. We think we have ideas. It doesn't help to say what the idea is.</p><p>I would hope very soon. We're -- we pull together as a nation. People are, for the most part, doing what they're supposed to be doing. The social distancing is very interesting, a whole new term that has become a hot -- it's become somewhat of a hot term, but people are listening, and they're - - and they're really doing a great job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: So, will, at the end of the 15 days, the president's guidelines have to be renewed for another 15 days? No one really knows. And when asked about it, the president said, I will tell you that when we get to day 14 -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's incredible, because this was a real market mover, John. Markets were down early on today, but then they picked up as the president talked about this fast-tracking of some drugs.</p><p>Fox Business' Susan Li is keeping track of that. And she's on that angle -- Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Maria, a small recovery from the three-year lows that we saw on the stock market. And there is hope of a big economic stimulus plan and packets from the government, also the Federal Reserve injecting a trillion dollars or more overnight.</p><p>So are other global central banks over in Europe as well. So we had big tech today leading the way back, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft seeing some sizable gains, getting some bids today, and Amazon higher, despite reporting a first warehouse worker testing positive for COVID-19.</p><p>So, the coronavirus, yes, depressing stock market, but, really, it's the one two combo of a collapse in prices combined with a spread and a pandemic of coronavirus.</p><p>Today, though, take a look at this. We saw the biggest one-day jump in oil prices in history. And this is after President Trump said that the U.S. might be intervening, with Russia and Saudi Arabia cutting prices, and still pumping a lot of oil. Oil is still down over 60 percent on the year.</p><p>And, meantime, you heard President Trump saying that he will make chloroquine, a malaria drug, available for COVID-19 treatment. Well, generic drugmakers rallied on the back of this news, Teva, Mylan up in the session.</p><p>Gilead Sciences will produce results of its possible coronavirus vaccine called remdesivir next month. And as you see, we're seeing gains for Gilead Sciences.</p><p>Now, as for the broader U.S. economy, most investment banks are predicting a sharp decline in the U.S. economy contracting. J.P. Morgan says it'll shrink 14 percent from March to June. Bank of America, Maria, is looking for a 12 percent contraction, job losses of a million a month, and the jobless rate doubling.</p><p>And they say, in fact, Maria that the recession is already here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And these numbers are so stark, 14 percent contraction.</p><p>You have got all hands on deck trying to reverse this trend that we are hearing so much about. Susan, thank you so much.</p><p>It is not just some potential new drugs. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also putting all hands on deck, including stimulus. He spoke with me this morning on \"Mornings With Maria\" over on FOX Business. And he said they are working hard to get hundreds of billions of dollars into the hands of the American people, who have been hit hard by this crisis.</p><p>He's looking for that in a matter of weeks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: A second component -- and I refer to this as checks in the mail, but that's -- it's really money direct- deposited. Most people, we have all their information.</p><p>And the plan is $500 billion in two tranches. The first one would be $1,000 per person, $500 per child. So, for a family of four, that's a $3,000 payment. As soon as Congress passes this, we'd get this out in three weeks.</p><p>And then, six weeks later, if the president still has a national emergency, we will deliver another $3,000. So that's a lot of money to hardworking Americans who are at home, no fault of theirs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of money, but will it be enough to get Americans back on their feet?</p><p>Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott, who is self-isolating right now because of this virus, he joins me right now by telephone.</p><p>And, Senator, it's good to see you. Thank you very much.</p><p>First off, how are you doing? Are you showing any symptoms?</p><p>SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): No.</p><p>Maria, I'm self-quarantined because I was around somebody with the president of Brazil that tested positive. So, to make sure I'm safe for everybody that I come in contact with, I self-quarantined last week. And I will finish next -- this coming Monday.</p><p>I take my temperature all the time. It's the first indication. And I have not a temperature the whole time.</p><p>So, what I have been doing since then...</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's...</p><p>SCOTT: ... is talking to mayors and state officials and police chiefs and sheriffs and hospitals.</p><p>I mean, I'm doing everything I can to move this process along. I think, Maria, you -- and I think you have talked a little bit, the biggest thing we can do, the biggest stimulus we can do, we got to figure out -- figure this out, keep people safe, get them a vaccine.</p><p>And so that's why we got these testing sites up now. We have got to self- quarantine and slow this down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCOTT: And then we got to do everything we can to rebuild this economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right, Senator. Yes, thank you for your leadership, to be doing all that you're doing at home, while you also self-isolate.</p><p>We're seeing really an incredible effort by government officials. And I know that the nation thanks you and all the leaders for doing that.</p><p>What do you make of the president's plan here? Secretary Mnuchin just talking with me earlier this morning, and we ran that sound bite, talking about the money that will go to people directly. He's talking about three weeks.</p><p>There's some debate about needing that money in three weeks, or should small business in particular get some relief now?</p><p>SCOTT: Here's I believe.</p><p>I believe, one, focus on the people that have been impacted, the hourly workers, the tip workers that right now have gotten impacted. So how do we help them? And how do we help our small businesses?</p><p>The first thing that we can do is get them a moratorium on their rent, their mortgage, the utilities, their taxes. That will put money -- that will keep money in their pocket, rather than something they have to spend right now, do it for our small businesses, do it for people making less than $75,000 a year.</p><p>And then focus on our existing unemployment system that all of our companies have paid into. Florida has $4 billion in the bank. How do we use that existing system to help all these individuals? Maybe we have to change the rule to say, if you got your hours cut a little bit, you still get it, or if your wages got cut some.</p><p>So what we want is, we want our businesses, all of our businesses that we can to stay in business as long as possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>But you said yesterday that the federal government cannot solve every problem. And this is a sentiment that many people agree with you on, because you really need to see the American people not rely so much on government.</p><p>For example, Larry Kudlow had an idea that, if government is going to be using this money for bailouts to be sending out, then maybe the government should be taking stakes in certain companies.</p><p>What do you say to that?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, first off, if we're going to -- if the government's going to do a bailout, they clearly ought to get a return on it.</p><p>This is taxpayer money. But reality is exactly what you just said. We have got to help each other. Each family member has got to help other family members.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SCOTT: Their churches have to help each other.</p><p>Our -- all of our community, our local community, that's where everything gets done in this world. We have got to all step up and say, who's hurting? How do we help them? And how did -- the federal government can pay for things...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>SCOTT: ... but that's not the key to this.</p><p>The key is helping each other.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator, it's good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us this morning -- this afternoon. Thank you.</p><p>SCOTT: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will talk with you soon, Senator Rick Scott.</p><p>It is certainly quiet on the streets of New York today and all week. Quite so on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Come Monday, it will be a ghost town down on Wall Street, the NYSE shutting down floor operations over COVID-19.</p><p>What does that mean for your money? The president of the New York Stock Exchange is here next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: World War II, 9/11, and now COVID-19, major events forcing the New York Stock Exchange to close its floor trading.</p><p>And that is where we find ourselves today. That is the deal beginning Monday. But the exchange will be open for electronic trading.</p><p>So, how's it going to impact everyday investors?</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that, we talk with the president of the New York Stock Exchange, Stacey Cunningham.</p><p>Stacey, thanks very much for joining me once again.</p><p>This is a big deal, closing the trading floor for a period of time. What are your expectations?</p><p>STACEY CUNNINGHAM, PRESIDENT, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE: You know, it is a big deal, Maria.</p><p>We haven't closed the trading floor, as you mentioned -- there are few historic moments where the trading floor has been closed.</p><p>What's different about this time is that electronic trading will continue. So, that part of it is different. We run multiple markets. We run five equity exchanges, two options markets. Many of them trade fully electronically.</p><p>The New York Stock Exchange introduces the human judgment element on top of stock trading. That leads to dampening volatility during times of stress. And as we have seen lately, the markets have been pretty volatile.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: So, we were hanging on to try and keep that extra added protection into the market.</p><p>But it got to a point where we just were concerned. We couldn't guarantee that people were going to be able to be protected, their health. So, while we're seeing how the virus unfolds and steps that we can continue to take, we're temporarily shifting to fully electronic, until we can get that -- have more clarity around that situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what are your expectations in terms of how long this lasts?</p><p>Stacey, when we spoke earlier this week on FOX Business on \"Mornings With Maria,\" you said, look, if there's a situation where we need human interaction, where we need that extra buying or selling to balance out a trade, we have it here on the floor of the NYSE.</p><p>Are you worried that you will not have that component now with electronic trading only?</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: I do think we will see some added volatility.</p><p>I will give you an example. Last Friday, when the president announced that he was going to fill the oil reserves, it was just a few minutes before the closing auction. And we saw massive buy orders coming into the -- into the market right at that close.</p><p>The traders here on the floor were able to go solicit offsetting sell orders, so that they could dampen that volatility and reduce price swings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: And so that's an important function that they're able to deliver. When we go fully electronic, you don't see that same effect.</p><p>So, yes, I do think it's going to add to a little bit of -- additional volatility in an already volatile period of time. So that's concerning. From an operations perspective, I'm confident it'll work smoothly. So stocks will still open and close. Traders will still be able to send their interest in. And things will trade normally.</p><p>I just expect you're going to see additional volatility around the edges. And that's unfortunate, given how the markets are already dealing with so many price swings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stacey, let me move away from the operations of this, because we clearly understand why you're closing the trading floor for a temporary period of time.</p><p>You have got, what, a couple hundred people on the floor right now?</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, there are a few hundred people.</p><p>And I will say this is a very patriotic group, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: So they're looking to come back as soon as possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: They want to do their part, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. So...</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: And they understand the value and the service they provide to investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO: As we all do, and of course.</p><p>So, put that aside for a moment. I want to ask you something about sentiment, because you have been on the floor for years. Before you had this role of president, you were there in the trenches on the floor of the exchange.</p><p>What is your take on sentiment, particularly today? As the president started talking about vaccines, talking more about cures and about therapies to treat coronavirus, we saw the market change direction.</p><p>We saw the market actually trade up and finish up 188 points on the Dow Jones industrial average, about 1 percent. Do you feel a change in sentiment on the floor, because we have lost $7 trillion in market value?</p><p>I'm wondering where the sentiment goes now, Stacey.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, I mean, markets react to uncertainty, as you know well, right?</p><p>And so what we have been trying to understand is, how is this virus pandemic going to continue to unfold? What's the long-term impact going to be on Americans in their everyday lives?</p><p>And I think what we're seeing is the government rising to the occasion to answer some of those questions. These are the things that they're going to do.</p><p>I have had the opportunity over the past couple of weeks to talk to the federal administration, to the Treasury Department, to the House Financial Services Committee, to our regulators, to local, city and state government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: And all of them are very focused on helping those in need.</p><p>And I think that you will see, through the stimulus package and the announcements that the president continues to make, there is a lot of interest in addressing the short-term pain on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: And so that's where I think you're seeing market reaction.</p><p>It's a very -- it's a changing moment, very fluid. Every single day, we get new news, and people are reacting to that in real time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Real quick, Stacey, do you want to see any other changes in terms of the regulations over financial services on the New York Stock Exchange?</p><p>Because the president's doing fast track at the FDA. Is there anything standing in the way in terms of creating a more effective trading situation for Wall Street that you would like to see from a regulatory standpoint, real quick?</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: Yes, one thing I will highlight, because it's been rumored a few times that there's talk of shutting the markets down to stop...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: ... stop the market decline.</p><p>I have not had that conversation with any of those groups I talked about. They're not considering it at Treasury, at Congress, in any of those areas. And I think that that -- understanding that that's not the case would be -- actually be helpful to investor sentiment.</p><p>If people hear the market might be closed, they may be more inclined to sell, because they're afraid they won't be to -- in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: So, I think hearing a clear statement, which we have heard from Secretary Mnuchin, we have heard from Chairman Clayton at the SEC...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: ... they have no plans to close the market. You're hearing it for me.</p><p>The markets are staying open.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: We're not talking about closing the markets. We're not talking about shortening the trading day.</p><p>Repeating that message, I think, is really important for everyone to hear.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>Stacey, thank you. We will see you soon. Appreciate it very much.</p><p>CUNNINGHAM: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now to the scramble to contain -- thank you, Stacey.</p><p>To the scramble to contain this contagion, a massive undertaking, how is the president's task force doing?</p><p>Next up, stay with us on that. The joint task force commander during Hurricane Katrina, General Russel Honore, is next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: ... anything like this in history. There's never been. Nobody has ever seen anything like this.</p><p>But we're doing the right thing. We have to get rid of -- our big war is not a -- it's not a financial war. It's a war. And it's a medical war. We have to win this war. It's very important.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump earlier today on the medical war we are facing against COVID-19.</p><p>Let's get the read right now on the White House response so far from the man who was at the center of the response to Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>Joining us right now, retired Lieutenant General Russel Honore.</p><p>And, General, good to see you this afternoon. Thanks very much for being here.</p><p>LT. GEN. RUSSEL HONORE (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have seen a lot in the way of responses. How would you grade the response so far? It feels like you're seeing a real coordinated effort among several institutions throughout the country.</p><p>What do you say?</p><p>HONORE: Yes, I think we're starting to get a handle on how this thing should work.</p><p>The White House should be about policy and tactics. But the real solution to this is going to be logistics. I think it was President Eisenhower who said, amateurs study tactics, what to do; professionals study logistics.</p><p>We got to get the logistics down. And, today, the president empowered the governors to use that money that's been put at FEMA, so they can draw on that money to buy what they need. The private sector has a lot of capacity to help solve some of these issues.</p><p>At the same time, FEMA has some rules that they need to employ to make sure that that money is used wisely. A week ago, you could buy an N95 for about $14. I see on the Internet now some of them are going for $95, $100.</p><p>And there's some state agent out there right now ordering a million masks at $80 apiece. We got to spend that money wisely, because that disaster capitalism will kick in and we will waste the money.</p><p>And that should be a concern to Congress. But I think the president has empowered the governors. They have got to do the right thing. That 25 percent payback should give them an incentive. If they do it right, the government may not collect that back.</p><p>But I think the president has empowered the right people in governors to order what they need. And now we have a mechanism. Last week, we didn't have a mechanism. That Stafford Act will put that money at the right place where every governor know how to deal with the FEMA regents to order with the need, or to order from the private sector, with immediate reimbursement from FEMA, and then that can be audited later.</p><p>But I think we're headed in the right direction. Right now, we need a need for speed and unleash the power of the private sector to help solve these problems.</p><p>BARTIROMO: General, you see the military getting involved as well in terms of makeshift hospitals. Do you want to see more military involvement?</p><p>As we see these numbers spike, there's a real worry about a strain on our health care system, not enough beds, for example. Can the military help out in that regard?</p><p>HONORE: Yes, we could put up tents.</p><p>But a tent, I lived in them for 37 years, three months and three days in the Army. They are very temporary. They're better with all the empty hospitals we got. What I tell the government and the folks, the governors, my advice to them, tell the military what you want, not how to do it.</p><p>We got great planners, we have got great logisticians, and we're very good at logistics. We supply stuff all around the world. One thing the government might do is lean a little bit more on that military logistics capacity we have for planning and distribution and supplies.</p><p>That's what we do 24/7 around the world. We got a great capacity. And we might need to ask the United States Northern Command to put one of those joint planning cells in up there, one with the White House and one with FEMA, to help them do the joint planning and logistic planning they need.</p><p>We got capacity in the military that can help with this. We just need to use it the right way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, as part of this medical war, the president is trying to get all hands on deck. Do you think that the money will go to the places that is -- are most in need?</p><p>I mean, he's trying to fast-track potential COVID-19 drugs. So we're going to be talking about that. In terms of business, is the money being used properly, as you see it right now?</p><p>HONORE: As of this time, because the money has been directed from the White House.</p><p>I reminded a colleague last night who was complaining about something that the White House don't run operations. They make decisions. It's up to the agencies that work for them to execute this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HONORE: And, again, the president said that today. You governors got that. The White House is not a distribution center.</p><p>He reminded his own staff of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>HONORE: That's what needs to happen.</p><p>As far as the disaster capitalism, everybody's got to be watching that, that we don't go into price-gouging, not just at the corner grocery store...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: As you just said, sure.</p><p>HONORE: We got to make sure these big companies we are bringing in don't exceed the price.</p><p>Yes, General, it's great to get your insights this afternoon. Thank you, sir. And thank you for your service to our great country. We so appreciate it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: As part of this medical war, the president is pressing the FDA to fast-track potential COVID-19 drugs.</p><p>Let's talk about what that means for the battle against this virus.</p><p>Joining us right now on the telephone is the former FDA Commissioner David Kessler.</p><p>Commissioner, it's good to see you. Thank you so much for weighing in here.</p><p>What's your take on this fast-track movement?</p><p>DAVID KESSLER, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER: So, FDA has always has -- I did -- I was involved in AIDS.</p><p>When I started, there was one drug. It didn't work very well. We have the fast-track mechanism. By the time we left, there was more than a dozen. So I have lived this.</p><p>So, FDA has always had this fast-track mechanism, certainly for the last several decades. The real question is, we need the clinical data. That's the key. We need data from clinical trials that show that a drug works.</p><p>Mechanisms are there. We need the data.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, give me the downside risk, then, Commissioner, because, obviously, these -- these regulations were in place for a reason.</p><p>When you blow off these regulations, you get the drug on the fast track, the worry is that perhaps there could be safety issues. Is that a concern?</p><p>KESSLER: I don't think you have to worry about FDA shortcutting the process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>KESSLER: I mean, no doubt that fast track means you're going to approve a drug based on less data, and there's always risks.</p><p>But the real key here is having the data. There's really two types of fast track. Most of the time, a company comes in and says, here's the data. Here's the clinical data. FDA reviews it, and then FDA puts it through a fast-track process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KESSLER: What we really need is, have the agency -- and I know they're trying to do this -- take a proactive -- proactively go out and get the data and work with companies to get the data, and then review it.</p><p>Without the data...</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>KESSLER: ... we're not going to -- we're not going to be able to make decisions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, so we need the clinical data. We will be watching that. This is a very important point that you make, Commissioner.</p><p>Thanks so much for weighing in this afternoon.</p><p>KESSLER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will see you soon. And we will certainly be watching that clinical data and this fast-track approach.</p><p>Could those packages being delivered to your door be a virus at your doorstep? Why one case of COVID-19 at an Amazon facility is raising new concerns -- right here next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Breaking news right now, Mayor de Blasio speaking.</p><p>Let's listen in.</p><p>(JOINED IN PROGRESS)</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY): ... what we need from our federal government and how crucial that is in the equation.</p><p>The city of New York is working constantly to protect our people. I know the state of New York City doing the same thing. And we are coordinated and we share goals and strategies.</p><p>But we all are waiting for federal help that still is not arriving. And that is the central challenge. And we have to talk bluntly about that, and I will today.</p><p>But to everyone who's dealing with this confusion and these challenges, I feel it, my family feels it, just like you. We're all trying to make sense of a new reality.</p><p>What I'm going to try and do every time I give you an update is tell you the blunt truth. And I'm trying to -- very hard to make sure I tell you what we exactly know. And when we're not sure about something, we need to be clear about that too.</p><p>It would be a mistake to tell you something certain if we're not certain. It would be a mistake to hold back things that you need to know. And it certainly would be a mistake to sugarcoat this very, very painful reality.</p><p>I think New Yorkers want real talk. I think New Yorkers like it straight. And we're going to do that.</p><p>So, I will be talking about several things today that are really painful and troubling. And I want everyone to understand that. I am not here to give you false reassurance. I have a lot of things I will say that should cause you to be confident about what we can do in this city, confident particularly in the fact that we have the finest health care institutions, the finest doctors and nurses, and all the people who work in our health care facilities, the lab techs, everyone who works in our facilities.</p><p>This is -- there's literally no place on Earth with a stronger and better health care sector than New York City, nowhere on Earth. And we are going to ask of our colleagues in health care so much in these coming weeks. They are already heroes.</p><p>But they're going to have to work in battlefield conditions. Their strength, their courage, their resilience are all going to be needed. We're all going to be depending on them, just like we depend every day, not only their work, but on our first responders and so many of our public servants.</p><p>Everyone is going to be needed. Everyone needs to answer the call. Everyone needs to step up for the good of everyone else.</p><p>But, despite my tremendous confidence in our people and our ability to serve them, I also have to be very clear about the extent of this crisis. It is unlike anything we have seen outside of wartime, with the possible exception of the Great Depression itself.</p><p>We can make obvious and powerful, painful parallels even to things like 9/11, the days and weeks after that. But this crisis is even more unknown in many ways, because we don't understand the exact trajectory we're on.</p><p>And we know it will reach very deep into our communities. That is not a reason to be hopeless, by any stretch, because, remember, every single piece of evidence we have continues to tell us that this is a disease that, for 80 percent of those infected, will have very little impact.</p><p>So I want people to think about this. I will tell you a lot of things that are tough and sobering. But I want you also to remember this side of the equation. There will be many New Yorkers who never get this disease. And there will be many New Yorkers who get this disease, approximately 80 percent who get it, and will feel very little and experienced very little.</p><p>But those 20 percent who will experience a much tougher time with this disease, people in particular who are older, and that means particularly folks over 50, and especially over 70, and it means those, of course, with those serious preexisting conditions we talk about so often, lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and compromised immune system, for those people, particularly if they're over 50, we're worried.</p><p>And we need them to take extraordinary measures. We need you to take extraordinary measures. If you're in that category of people, we need you to live differently. And we need your families to adjust as well.</p><p>You're going to hear from Dr. Barbot in a few minutes, and she's going to talk to you, as the city's doctor, and give advice directly to New Yorkers in light of an ever-growing crisis.</p><p>But I heard from a friend in Brooklyn from the Midwood community just yesterday. And he said something I thought really captured it. He said, in a very tight-knit extended family, over decades and decades, it would have been unimaginable to keep his older parents away from their grandchildren.</p><p>But he said now he understands, because of coronavirus, his older parents, who have vulnerabilities of their own, they have to understand this is not the time to visit with their grandchildren, because we just can't run that risk.</p><p>It's time for getting on the phone to your loved ones. It's time for getting on FaceTime, but it's time to make adjustments that wouldn't have been imaginable in other situations, because we have never dealt with this situation before. This is literally unlike anything we have seen in our memory.</p><p>It will not be the same as the 1918 flu epidemic, because, for one thing, the health care capacity of the city and this nation are tremendously. Better public health ability, the information flow, it's night and day compared to 100 years ago.</p><p>But in terms of the extent, that's the only other parallel we can make in terms of recent health care history. It's going to be an epidemic, a pandemic that reaches deep into our communities. And we have got to be honest about that. We have got to make more changes in the way we live. And we got to do things we wouldn't normally do.</p><p>I also want to emphasize this is a crisis that has an end point. As I said, it will play out in unpredictable ways. It'll play out for a period of time. And that's what makes it different from some other things we have been through. It will go on for months, but it will not go on forever.</p><p>At some point in the coming months, this crisis will start to abate. And we will be able to start the work of getting our lives back to normal and getting our city back to all the things about it that we love so much.</p><p>But it will be months, so it will be a long battle. I don't think it serves anyone to be told, get ready for something easy. I think it is much better to tell people, get ready for something difficult and something that will go on for a long time, but also have confidence that we can get through it.</p><p>And that's what I truly believe. The numbers I will go over with you today are nothing short of staggering, but they are not just numbers. I will tell you statistics that I have trouble even conceiving of myself.</p><p>But I don't want you to think of them as statistics. I want you to think of them as your fellow New Yorkers. Every number means another person has been affected by this disease, another family. And that's what I feel watching a crisis that is really, really affecting the lives of our people and putting a lot of people in danger.</p><p>So I will tell you the honest truth. And I will go out of my way in the weeks ahead to always level with you, but I will also tell you what we can do. And that's a lot.</p><p>And I will be very honest about what we need our federal government to do, because I have to be clear with you. We alone, even if we're the greatest city in the world -- and we are -- we alone cannot solve this crisis.</p><p>And I need people to hear that, not to create fear, but to level with people. In the next few weeks, with the extraordinary resources of New York City, we will fight this battle no matter what. But, as we get into April, the farther we get into April, the more we will need the help of the federal government.</p><p>It must arrive in time. And there is time for that help to arrive. But if the federal government does not do all in its power immediately, it's as simple as this. There will be a lot more people who get sick who didn't need to get sick, and there will be people who die who didn't need to die. It's as simple as that.</p><p>So we need to act now. And I know our federal government has the capacity. We have the finest military in the world, the largest, by far, extraordinary resources. Unlike the city or the state -- and I always say it very bluntly -- the federal government literally prints money. They can create any credit line they want to save the lives of Americans.</p><p>But we're not seeing that, not even close, at this point. So, I will go into some very specific information now. And then you will hear from Dr. Barbot. And then we will open up to questions from the media. And we will be doing all this remotely. It's the first time we're doing it. And I want to just say to all my colleagues in the media, we will try and get it right, but it may be a little difficult the first time, but please bear with us as we try and perfect this new system.</p><p>This is something we will be having to do for quite a while to keep everyone safe.</p><p>I have given you a framework to think about this situation with. And I will be updating you regularly. But, again, it will not be all bad news. It often will be tough information to hear, but not all of it is bad, because, in the middle of this fight, we have the extraordinary heart and soul and spirit of New Yorkers.</p><p>And here's an example for you. Just on Tuesday, I put out a call to retired health care workers and those who work in private health care offices to come forward and join up to serve in the fight against coronavirus.</p><p>I asked people who have already given so much of their lives to others to step forward and come out of retirement. I asked people who are earning a living and are not obligated to join public service, I asked them to join, nonetheless, in the name of all New Yorkers.</p><p>That was Tuesday. Today, Thursday, as of today, 1,746 health care professionals have stepped forward to augment the ranks of those already serving at the front line in our hospitals and clinics. That's something all New Yorkers should be very, very proud of, and I am certain those numbers will grow.</p><p>This is going to be one of the most difficult moments in New York City history. I ask everyone who has health care training and who can help us to please step forward now. And anyone who's willing to volunteer, please go to NYC.gov/helpnownyc, NYC.gov/helpnownyc.</p><p>And I want to express my tremendous gratitude on behalf of 8.6 million New Yorkers, to all of you who have come forward and are ready to serve to protect all of us.</p><p>And what you are seeing from those retired health care workers and those private sector and health care workers, you're seeing in many other ways, the extraordinary efforts of our colleagues in our public hospitals and clinics and all those at the voluntary hospitals who are already doing so much, our first responders, the envy of the nation, all that they are doing to protect us.</p><p>Our social service workers, who are helping people through all of the challenges they're confronting now. Our sanitation workers, who are doing absolutely crucial work to keep the city clean while we encounter a health care crisis.</p><p>On Monday, I talked about a very valiant, noble group of workers...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Somewhat of a sobering press conference this afternoon from New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, giving a COVID-19 update.</p><p>We're going to monitor this conference and bring the news as it develops.</p><p>Let's bring in FOX News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier right now.</p><p>And, Dr. Saphier, you're hearing what I'm hearing from de Blasio. It certainly feels like we're about to hear some significant numbers in terms of the spikes, the number of cases developed in New York right now. Your reaction to what we have heard just now?</p><p>DR. NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You know, I agree.</p><p>I think it sounds like something pretty dramatic is coming. And it's true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SAPHIER: We're expecting this.</p><p>We have really ramped up our testing, which is exactly what we needed to do. But now the reality is going to set in. We're going to see how many people are infected. And, also, I think we're going to hear what -- the toll this has taken on health care workers.</p><p>I do just want to say that there is some tiny bit light at the end of the tunnel right now. Two of the first people that tested positive in New York, it looks like one has completely recovered and one is near 100 percent recovered.</p><p>So, although we're still in the midst of this, and we're going to continue to see those numbers rise, it is good to also remember there are people recovering.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a great point. And I'm glad you brought us to an optimistic point, because the markets also saw some optimism today, trading up at the close, after the president talked about upcoming therapeutics and upcoming potential vaccines, using certain drugs that are on the market now for COVID-19.</p><p>What is your expectation in terms of some of those efforts?</p><p>SAPHIER: So, I think it's great that we already have some FDA-approved medications for -- like anti-malarial medications and utilized for other things that have proved safe to use in people, that they're showing some efficacy against COVID-19.</p><p>It's much easier to bring something that's already gone through FDA approval to try it with -- for something new, as opposed do a brand-new medication. And there's been a couple of studies that really gives some hope right now.</p><p>And I expect that this is going to continue on, and the more that we use this with, through the FDA and just through compassionate use, I think we're going to start being able to help those recovering, and our death numbers may be decreasing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the Amazon delivery packaging story.</p><p>We talked about this earlier on \"Mornings With Maria\" over on FOX Business, but everybody is concerned about how long this virus lives, lives in the air, lives on surfaces. Give us your take in terms of mail, money, getting a package.</p><p>You said you open your packages outside of your house.</p><p>SAPHIER: That's right.</p><p>I mean, it's funny, because, after I said that this morning with you, my mother actually texted me: Are you really doing that?</p><p>And I'm like, yes, I am.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SAPHIER: And I should have had someone take a picture because I opened up packages today, and that's exactly what I do. And this comes at the same time that an Amazon facility, one of the delivery facilities in Long Island, just reported their first positive case in a staff member.</p><p>They shut down the facilities to -- and sent everyone home with full pay to sanitize. But this study came back showing that there are viable particles on cardboard up to 24 hours.</p><p>Now, that's to say, it's very few particles left, but there are still particles up to 24 hours. And the important thing is, the way that I keep saying to everybody, to myself, to my family, let's just pretend everything right now has the virus on it. We have the virus, you have the virus, and most things you touch have the virus.</p><p>If you have that mentality, you're probably going to be doing some pretty good choices on how to not get infected and how to keep your family safe.</p><p>So I have been opening up my packages outside. I have actually been leaving the mail for a day in the mailbox, and I do open things outside. And then I throw things away outside in the outdoor trash cans. I come right in, I clean my hands, and I wipe everything down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, very smart.</p><p>And, Dr. Saphier, it's good to see you. We will be checking back, of course, as we continue our coverage here. We will see as soon, Nicole Saphier.</p><p>Wuhan, China, was once the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, of course. Now they are claiming to have no new cases of this virus. Can we trust this information?</p><p>Joining us now to break down the very latest numbers from Wuhan, FOX's Bill Hemmer -- Bill.</p><p>BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS HOST: Hey, Maria. Good afternoon to you.</p><p>You -- we can have this debate as to what you trust out of China or not or when it actually started in China. Was it January? Was it December? Was it prior to that? '</p><p>Wuhan reported zero cases today. Around the world at the moment, Maria, as of 4:15 East Coast time, there are about 238,000 cases, total deaths 9,800, total recovered about 85,000.</p><p>I want you to look at this graphic right here. This is -- the yellow line here, countries outside of China. Over the past two months, the rate of increase is not going in the direction -- we want this yellow line, Maria, to start moving to the right. So we will watch that.</p><p>I want to show you another map over here. A lot of viewers, a lot of questions too on Twitter, e-mail, on Facebook. They want to know about the death rate here, based on these countries. China's got 1.2 billion people, Italy's got 60 million.</p><p>Here's what we did earlier today to crunch the numbers and give you a sense. And this is a grim statistic. It's a death rate. In Italy, among those who have contracted the virus, the death rate is greater than 8 percent. In Iran, it's 6 percent. In China, it's 4 percent.</p><p>Again, China's leveling off, as we reported for that past couple of days.</p><p>In the U.S. at the moment, Maria, we're at 1.4 percent, and South Korea is below us at 1 percent. They say we want to be around South Korea. Why is that?</p><p>What they did in South Korea was very effective. I will just show you this right here just to give you a different graph, so you can understand this. This is China. This is Italy. South Korea is the blue line. The U.S. is green below that.</p><p>We want to be the blue line in this big battle, Maria. And we will see over time if we can maintain that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>HEMMER: Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, it is really moving fast.</p><p>Bill, thank you,</p><p>HEMMER: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bill Hemmer, checking the progress there and the numbers.</p><p>So, how can lawmakers be positive they can pass what's needed, when some of them are testing positive?</p><p>We're going to take a look at that when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We have got fast-moving information today. With two lawmakers now testing positive for COVID-19, is that a concern as they try to put together a relief package?</p><p>Let's talk more about this, ask my next guest, a member of Congress and a doctor himself. Joining us right now is Texas Republican Congressman Michael Burgess.</p><p>Congressman, it's always good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>How concerned are you that this actually has hit Congress right now, with your colleagues now testing positive?</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R-TX): Well, yes, of course, it was inevitable.</p><p>Certainly feel badly for the people that have been affected. Two are under quarantine, which means they're not ill, but they have voluntarily taken themselves out of circulation, which I think is the responsible thing to do.</p><p>The...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely.</p><p>BURGESS: Obviously, we do have -- we do have two members who have shown symptoms and tested positive after -- after they went to the physician with those -- with those symptoms.</p><p>That's, you know, no different from the rest of the population. I know there's a lot of discussion about whether or not we need to be present to vote. I think we do. I think that sends a terrible message to the country if we say we're going to vote on probably one of the biggest spending bills ever conceived, and we're going to phone it in?</p><p>But we will see what people decide about that. I know those are ongoing discussions right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Congressman, I know that we have only a couple of seconds here -- a couple of minutes. And we appreciate you joining us, even though this is an abbreviated interview, relative to our usual interviews.</p><p>BURGESS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to get your take on when we are going to see this fiscal stimulus. Tell me about the vote. I noticed that there are a couple of your colleagues on the Republican side who voted no because of the cost.</p><p>But tell me about that. When do you actually see the stimulus materializing?</p><p>BURGESS: Well, my understanding is, the Senate is supposed to vote on it today or tomorrow. This is the third bill.</p><p>The second bill has already passed, and then down to the White House for signature.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BURGESS: The third bill is supposed to pass the Senate today.</p><p>And then probably midweek next week, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, is when it will be available for the House to vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Good.</p><p>BURGESS: It'll probably be a prolonged vote, not a 15-minute vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that is...</p><p>BURGESS: But we need to be there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We sure do.</p><p>Congressman, thank you very much.</p><p>BURGESS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>New reports on a death that may shake the travel industry even more. TMZ is reporting a 34-year-old man has died from COVID-19 two weeks after visiting Walt Disney World and Universal Studios in Florida.</p><p>We will be watching that, as well as the markets. Join me tomorrow on \"Mornings with Maria,\" FOX Business, 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Have a good day, everybody.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

The outbreak has driven spikes in the usage of online streaming, tutoring, and medical consultation services, and the risk of increased time indoors could further boost the sector, according to the bank. The sector faces risks from antitrust regulation around big tech firms and connections to the travel industry, the bank warned. UBS recommends exposure to the Nasdaq Internet Index, which includes stakes in Netflix[2], Facebook[3], Amazon[4], and other household names. </p><p>Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories.[5]Internet stocks offer \"some relief\" for investors with little appetite for coronavirus risks, analysts at UBS[6] wrote Friday. US stocks posted a strong rebound Monday, ending a streak of losses that pushed indices deep into correction territory[7] through the end of February. Yet some experts are calling the relief rally premature[8] and warning investors to stay defensive until more is known of the coronavirus outbreak's trajectory. The epidemic remains a dire source of volatility for risk assets, and Treasury bonds' record-low yields[9] make it more expensive than ever to park cash in the popular safe-haven. The growing risk of coronavirus becoming a pandemic is weighing on investors' desire to stay exposed to stocks, but the recent sell-off presents an alluring opportunity in internet equities, according to UBS. The heightened market volatility reminded the bank's analysts \"of the power of the internet,\" and the chance for new quarantine orders in the near term could boost usage of popular online services, UBS said. The team pointed to recent spikes in the use of online medical consultation, tutoring, and streaming services since the outbreak began. The Nasdaq Internet Index \u2014 which includes internet giants such as Facebook[10], Netflix[11], and Amazon[12] \u2014 grants investors exposure to a diverse set of firms that could gain from populations spending more time indoors, UBS said. \"We view the recent market sell-off as an attractive entry point, and the stay-at-home nature of the companies offer some shelter relative to the broader market,\" the team of analysts wrote. The index's biggest risk is its holding of travel-related firms, the team added, as the sector remains under considerable pressure from the epidemic. Major airlines swiftly halted travel to and from heavily afflicted regions in recent weeks, and further expansion of the outbreak could drag further on travel and tourism companies. UBS also alerted clients to the latent risk that the biggest companies in tech remain under regulatory scrutiny for data privacy controversies and antitrust concerns. Calls from lawmakers and Democratic presidential candidates to break up big tech firms have prompted some worry around whether the household names will stay the same if a regulation-friendly administration takes office. The bank remains positive on the sector despite fresh regulatory stresses. Shifting cash to internet companies before markets resume their bullish climb gives investors \"one way to gain equity exposure to the pockets of the market that are well,\" UBS said. The Nasdaq Internet Index gained 2.7% in Monday's trading session.

Latin America is no exception, and has been particularly affected due to very high infection numbers. With more than 7.9 million cases and more than 300,000 deaths , the region has been described as the world's worst hit region. That is why, according to the World Bank's June assessment , the Latin American economy will contract 7.2% in 2020 as a whole. What's more, some of the promising, if modest, trends of the last two decades are being reversed by the pandemic. </p><p>This was a region that was starting to reduce huge levels of inequality thanks to significant economic growth from the commodity boom that ended in 2013, as well as some innovative wage policies and social programmes introduced by progressive governments. Within this context, younger people are being especially badly hit . School closures are hurting education and, as in many countries, job prospects for them are particularly bad. If the region cannot control the virus and kickstart its economy, we will see the growth of a 'lockdown generation', trapped in unemployment, informal jobs and in-work poverty.Unemployment and the gig economyBoth the quantity and quality of jobs are deteriorating rapidly as a result of the economic paralysis created by the pandemic. The UN's International Labour Organization estimates that the health crisis will push unemployment rates in the region up from 8.1% to 11.5% in 2020, the equivalent of more than 11.5 million newly unemployed. As a result, an extra 30 million are expected to fall into poverty (and these estimates were made in May, before the effects of the virus really took hold). Young people will be disproportionately affected, having already been enduring unemployment rates that were three times higher than that of older adults before the pandemic.But it's the historically high level of informal work in Latin America that will make the recovery much more difficult. Before the pandemic, more than half of the workforce across the region was in informal and precarious employment, with no social protections like sick pay or even written contracts. Again, young people make up an even higher proportion of this informal workforce.<br/>Young people are particularly vulnerable to the economic effects of coronavirus. EPA-EFE/JUAN IGNACIO RONCORONI With economies contracting due to the pandemic, even more people are turning to gig work throughout the region in search of a daily income. But this comes with costs . Relying on work as a courier, taxi driver or providing cleaning services through an app was already a tough job. It's generally low-paid and circumvents minimum-wage laws, as workers are classed as self-employed or they simpy work outside of all national labor laws. It's precarious, offering no job security or benefits like sick pay or paid holidays. It's also very isolating, as you are generally working on your own, and it offers very little in the way of career prospects.Risks and rewardsWith the pandemic, the risks involved with gig work increased considerably as these workers come into contact with so many different people. But the pandemic also brought demand for these services, with more people ordering groceries and takeaways under lockdown, or taking taxis instead of public transport. Yet life as a gig worker has not improved. Across Latin America these key workers have reported a lack of support in terms of personal protective equipment and health insurance. Huge numbers also say their incomes have stayed the same or even worsened, despite carrying out more jobs. In one survey of 298 drivers across 29 cities, 64% said their pay had dropped. This is due to changes in the terms offered by companies.<br/>Delivery drivers demonstrate in Mexico City to demand job improvements amid the coronavirus pandemic. Sashenka Gutierrez/EPA-EFE Thousands have protested for better pay and rights. The last couple of months have seen strikes by delivery drivers in cities across the region, including Argentina , Brazil , Colombia and Mexico. Different app companies operate there but the demands are the same: for better pay from the companies and better regulation from governments to prevent exploitation.The lack of regulation is a big part of the problem. It allows the dark side of the gig economy to develop: a growing pool of workers with no employment protection, underpaid with few other job options, and little power to negotiate with big tech companies managing their workforce through algorithms.Latin America's recovery from coronavirus will require significant change to the region's labour markets. Without better protection from underemployment and in-work poverty, the region risks making inequality worse again. Listening to the demands of striking gig workers is a good place to start.<br/>MENAFN1409202001990000ID1100795366</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1100795366</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V4-NRW1-JCNX-32NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 14, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(Photo by MAURO PIMENTEL/AFP via )   By Luciana Zorzoli , Cardiff University   Coronavirus has hit the healthcare systems and societies of the global south even harder than the rest of the world due to their already weak economies and high debt levels . Latin America is no exception, and has been particularly affected due to very high infection numbers. With more than 7.9 million cases and more than 300,000 deaths , the region has been described as the world\u2019s worst hit region. That is why, according to the World Bank\u2019s June assessment , the Latin American economy will contract 7.2% in 2020 as a whole.    What\u2019s more, some of the promising, if modest, trends of the last two decades are being reversed by the pandemic. This was a region that was starting to reduce huge levels of inequality thanks to significant economic growth from the commodity boom that ended in 2013, as well as some innovative wage policies and social programmes introduced by progressive governments.    Within this context, younger people are being especially badly hit . School closures are hurting education and, as in many countries, job prospects for them are particularly bad. If the region cannot control the virus and kickstart its economy, we will see the growth of a \u201clockdown generation\u201d, trapped in unemployment, informal jobs and in-work poverty.   Unemployment and the Gig Economy   Both the quantity and quality of jobs are deteriorating rapidly as a result of the economic paralysis created by the pandemic. The UN\u2019s International Labour Organization estimates that the health crisis will push unemployment rates in the region up from 8.1% to 11.5% in 2020, the equivalent of more than 11.5 million newly unemployed.    As a result, an extra 30 million are expected to fall into poverty (and these estimates were made in May, before the effects of the virus really took hold). Young people will be disproportionately affected, having already been enduring unemployment rates that were three times higher than that of older adults before the pandemic.    But it\u2019s the historically high level of informal work in Latin America that will make the recovery much more difficult. Before the pandemic, more than half of the workforce across the region was in informal and precarious employment, with no social protections like sick pay or even written contracts. Again, young people make up an even higher proportion of this informal workforce.    With economies contracting due to the pandemic, even more people are turning to gig work throughout the region in search of a daily income. But this comes with costs . Relying on work as a courier, taxi driver or providing cleaning services through an app was already a tough job. It\u2019s generally low-paid and circumvents minimum-wage laws, as workers are classed as self-employed or they simpy work outside of all national labor laws. It\u2019s precarious, offering no job security or benefits like sick pay or paid holidays. It\u2019s also very isolating, as you are generally working on your own, and it offers very little in the way of career prospects.   Risks and Rewards   With the pandemic, the risks involved with gig work increased considerably as these workers come into contact with so many different people. But the pandemic also brought demand for these services, with more people ordering groceries and takeaways under lockdown, or taking taxis instead of public transport.    Yet life as a gig worker has not improved. Across Latin America, these key workers have reported a lack of support in terms of personal protective equipment and health insurance. Huge numbers also say their incomes have stayed the same or even worsened, despite carrying out more jobs. In one survey of 298 drivers across 29 cities, 64% said their pay had dropped. This is due to changes in the terms offered by companies.    Thousands have protested for better pay and rights. The last couple of months have seen strikes by delivery drivers in cities across the region, including Argentina , Brazil , Colombia and Mexico. Different app companies operate there but the demands are the same: for better pay from the companies and better regulation from governments to prevent exploitation.    The lack of regulation is a big part of the problem. It allows the dark side of the gig economy to develop: a growing pool of workers with no employment protection, underpaid with few other job options, and little power to negotiate with big tech companies managing their workforce through algorithms.    Latin America\u2019s recovery from coronavirus will require significant change to the region\u2019s labour markets. Without better protection from underemployment and in-work poverty, the region risks making inequality worse again. Listening to the demands of striking gig workers is a good place to start.

People are scared that without regulation, we are destined to live in a 'surveillance state.' But people are also scared of coronavirus (COVID-19). Is this the moment that big tech proves that big data can be used for the greater good?</p><p> What is big tech's role in the fight against coronavirus? What should it be?A Grand VisionAs I think about how big tech might lead the fight against COVID-19, the first thing that comes to mind is that data is more powerful in the presence of other data. The more complete the data set, the more you can learn from it. Which means enemies, frenemies, competitors, and compatriots must all join together to win the fight. This requires leadership, but it also requires something we've never had before: a universal database of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI).The Life StarIf you had enough information from the search engines (all of them, not just Google), you would know where people were getting sick. If you had enough information from the social networks (all of them, not just Facebook and Twitter), you would know when people were starting to feel ill. If you had enough PHI, you would know who was getting sick and who was more or less likely to get sick. The data sets would be huge, but there are well-understood predictive tools you would use to give governments and health officials advanced warnings and assessments of risk.  This would allow business as usual until a level of risk had been reached, and then preemptive measures could be used to protect people in a given risk zone. Lives would be saved. The economy would feel the minimum impact. There are many good things that could come from analyzing and using the data in this 'grand vision' database.The Death StarNo one (not even the black-ops data miners) have ever put this much PII and PHI together in one place. Bad actors would find this treasure trove of data irresistible. I cannot imagine all of the horrible, evil stuff you could do with a data set this complete. It would be marketing heaven, but a living hell. You could mine it to offer low-cost insurance to the healthiest and deny insurance to the least healthy, then do the same thing with mortgages, bank loans, credit cards, housing, car insurance, and on and on. The list is endless. I know calling this 'The Death Star' is an unfortunate metaphor, but this kind of information could literally be used to deny sick people the insurance they need to obtain life-saving healthcare. What Should We Do?On one hand, this data exists. Right now, it is in many different places in many different databases. It can be gathered. It can be analyzed. And we could save tens of thousands of lives. On the other hand, amassing this database would empower even the most altruistic and good natured among us to wonder about alternative uses.Big Tech LeadershipThis is where big tech leadership comes in. There are ways to hash this data and keep it anonymous. We can mine the information we need without exposing individual identities - it will be very difficult to accomplish (not technically, sociologically). Big tech would have to pick a leader or leaders, and they would have to rally IT professionals and CEOs across many industries. The big tech leadership would have to convince people that there is a safe way to use big tech's power for the greater good.Broken PromisesI've been hearing about the value of the 'free and open' Internet since it was conceived. In hindsight, none of the promises of social media or about the free flow of information have turned out to be true. We have an unending river of unfiltered information that is highly polluted by algorithmic bias. Forget the truth; the best narrative wins. Don't worry if the AI model is constantly retuning itself to increase your teenager's addiction to social media; they'll grow up just fine. 'We have to rely on the data,' says the corporate executive as that executive denies a job to a qualified candidate, even though executives using the services have no idea what proxy data has been used to make calculations possible.For this to work, all of the 'freedom and openness' in the previous paragraph would have to be worked through. The Internet would need to be weaponized against COVID-19. The problem is that once you weaponize the information, it is a weapon. And this weapon would be more powerful than any we've seen in information age warfare.Socratic Debate Is Called ForOne of the great things about the current state of the Internet is that it allows us to hold moderated Socratic debates on important topics. So What is your thesis? It's time for a Socratic debate.Take the Survey If the survey is not visible, click here[1]. Author's note:This is not a sponsored post.

I'm Dagen McDowell, sitting in for Maria Bartiromo, who is on her way to Miami, Florida for the Super Bowl. We will both be live from Florida -- from South Beach tomorrow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it's Thursday right now, January 30th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coronavirus outbreak, the death toll rising to 170 and more than 7,700 cases confirmed. Japan, confirming two people testing positive without showing any symptoms. We have the very latest.</p><p>Futures are under pressure as concerns about that virus and its impact on global economy grows. Major indices ending yesterday mixed after the Federal Reserve chief Jay Powell said that the coronavirus may pose risks to the global economic growth.</p><p>The corona virus hitting markets in Europe. You have losses across the board, all north of 1 percent losses there in England, France, and Germany.</p><p>And the Bank of England holding interest rates steady saying more stimulus not needed right now and says it sees signs of economic growth following December's election.</p><p>It was right across the board in Asia overnight as more businesses are shutting down due to the spreading virus. You have the Hang Seng losing more than 2.5 percent in Hong Kong. China's composite remains closed for the lunar new year.</p><p>Earnings in focus. Verizon with a beat on revenue but a miss on earnings, adding wireless costumers will be taking another hit on Yahoo. Coca-Cola out with a beat on revenue driven by strong demand for soft drinks, teas, and coffees.</p><p>And UPS, a slight miss on revenue but saying it saw boost from Amazon shipments over the holidays.</p><p>And Facebook under pressure, this after reporting slowing growth and a surge in expenses.</p><p>And Tesla, look at the stock, surging. Up 9.5 percent in premarket trading after reporting its second straight quarter of profits, and saying it will sell more than half a million vehicles this year.</p><p>Hear to break it all down with me Payne Capital Management president Ryan Payne; \"New York Post\" editorial member Kelly Jane Torrance is sitting in. Thank you Kelly -- for being here. And \"Wall Street Journal\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman. All here.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I will do my Nancy Grace imitation within the next hour.</p><p>FREEMAN: Oh.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So hang on to that.</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was one of my favorite moments of the last well, lifetime.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti meantime has some of the top stories we're watching this morning -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CPRD: And we start with the coronavirus -- Dagen. The death toll rising to 170 in China, more than 7,700 infected.</p><p>This as three Japanese evacuees from Wuhan, China tested positive for the virus. Two had no symptoms whatsoever -- that's a scary thought for a lot of people. More than a dozen airlines around the globe now canceling flights to China.</p><p>The White House is forming a task force to monitor the virus. The World Health Organization will meet today to consider declaring this a public health emergency. Americans returning from China now under a three-day voluntary quarantine. And that is the plane they got off of yesterday.</p><p>Let's take a live look right now of a cruise ship in Italy where 6,000 people are being held as two passengers are being checked there. So this is a worldwide situation. Carnival Cruise Lines is down 6.5 percent.</p><p>Federal agents making quite a find -- an alleged drug smuggling tunnel along southern border. Check this out -- it's said to be the longest ever discovered in that area. It stretched from Tijuana Mexico into San Diego County, California. Pretty sophisticated. It had a rail system, air vents and electricity inside as you can see. No arrests have been made in connection with the tunnel.</p><p>And this, Dagen -- six suspects arrested in connection with the $7 million fentanyl ring are now out on bail, thanks to new laws right here in New York. The suspected dealers were taken into custody during a raid in Upper Manhattan this week. Prosecutors believe the drugs were going to be sold on the streets of New York and New England. But because of new laws they were released without bail.</p><p>And a Japanese billionaire looking to take his soulmate to the stars. He's pulled the plug on this search. The billionaire backing out of a documentary search for a girlfriend to take the voyage around the moon with him on a SpaceX flight. Get this -- 28,000 people applied to be his girlfriend. He thanks them for their interest -- Dagen. But he says, you know what, it was a little selfish of me. We're not going to do this. He backed out.</p><p>Md: You don't think he did it for attention? That is impossible.</p><p>Thank you -- Lauren.</p><p>Turning to 2020, we are just five days away from the Iowa caucuses. A new Monmouth University poll shows that Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders in a virtual dead heat. The former vice president is polling at 23 percent; Senator Sanders at 21 percent. They're followed by Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.</p><p>Meantime, I want to show you this. Joe Biden got in a little testy exchange with a voter in Iowa. Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are you going to do about climate change? You say you're against pipelines. But then you want to replace these gas lines. That's not going to work.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No, no, no.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got to stop building and replacing pipelines.</p><p>BIDEN: You have to go vote for someone else. Because you're not going to vote for me in the primary.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to vote you in the general if you treat me right.</p><p>BIDEN: I'm not.</p><p>Look, you're asking for a picture of me. You're coming up and tell me you won't support me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, no.</p><p>BIDEN: My plan -- yes, yes, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I said I'm going to support in the general.</p><p>BIDEN: In the general.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.</p><p>BIDEN: I'm looking for a primary.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kelly -- it gets better. So he got a pat, a poke and then he grabbed his coat like this which sets Joe Biden -- he likes to put it, you know, he is friendly guy.</p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, \"NEW YORK POST\": Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But he is assumed the guy was a sanders supporter. And the guy never said -- he went, I am supporting Tom Steyer. So it looked like Joe Biden sees Bernie Sanders as a threat.</p><p>TORRANCE: And I think the Democratic establishment does, too. They are actually starting to try to get together and say listen we have been very hands-off. We haven't attacked Sanders like we should -- and this is not just Joe Biden's people. This is, you know, anybody who does not want a radical Democratic socialist in the race and winning the nomination.</p><p>But, you know, looking at this video, this is not the first time that Biden has done this. He actually touched a reporter recently in a very similar way as well.</p><p>And let's imagine, of course, if Donald Trump had done that. I mean you have to say this guy is having trouble dealing with questions from fellow Democrats. What is he going to do in the general? He does not like being questioned.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In that video, Joe Biden made the mistake that I try to avoid and often don't avoid is not listening to who is talking to you. He clearly was not paying attention to what the guy was saying. He was like I said I was going to vote for you in the general.</p><p>And it just -- and maybe it's the fatigue of the campaign trial but what do you make of the Biden-Bernie face-off in Iowa and maybe New Hampshire?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think certainly it looks like Joe Biden is not interested in hearing alternative opinions as far as his program. Maybe the campaign trial is beginning to wear on him a little bit.</p><p>I don't -- I don't think it is obviously a disaster for him. And generally, I think he still looks pretty strong. And I think the reason is because if you look at polling, most people in the Democratic Party do not identify with Bernie Sanders in terms of issues. Most Democratic voters despite what you might see on Twitter and various cable networks do not identify themselves as left wing progressives.</p><p>There a lot of people in the Democratic Party who call themselves moderates and even conservatives. So I think Biden is a better fit with how most of the voters out there see themselves and the agenda.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, I thin the other question is how is Bloomberg playing to all this? He's going to spend like $300 billion -- excuse me, million by next month on his campaign. And I'm curious because he's more middle of the road --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: -- I'll be very interested how he plays out against Biden as well.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Yes. I think he's a legitimate contender especially given the really impressive record he has in New York. So it's now just a billionaire self-funder, it's a guy with a real political resume.</p><p>TORRANCE: Yes. with the Bernie versus Joe though, I mean Bernie Sanders is going up in the polls. And I have to wonder, we heard, you know, there were some theories that maybe Nancy Pelosi held off on sending the articles of impeachment to the senate to help Joe Biden because now it ties up senators like Elizabeth Warren, like Bernie Sanders.</p><p>But you know, now you are getting on primetime television a case that Joe Biden is corrupt and that he is not a good guy and I wonder, are they regretting that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we've got to move on, but I will say this and the Democrats learned nothing from what happened with the Republicans and the establishment conservatives and President Trump. The more you attack him, the more you dismiss him and say he is a real estate developer from New York City who likes brass and smoked glass. The more you do that and dismisses ideas and dismiss the passion around him, the more the base, his supporters are energized and the more people take a look at his campaign.</p><p>Mark my words, Sanders has got momentum and he's got steam and it's because of people like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden supporters.</p><p>Last hour Maria spoke with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross about economic impact of USMCA.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY: It could be 579,000 jobs -- almost 600,000 jobs, and $235 billion added to our gross domestic product. That is about 1.2 percent of our GDP.</p><p>So it will be some major fraction of that gradually phased in over the first few years. So it is a very big initial lift and it's one of the many reasons I think it's almost physically impossible for there to be a recession this year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: James -- you told me -- I'm going to steal this from you -- you told me in the greenroom, we were listening to this. You said that he made a really good case for accelerating growth in the new year.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think that last part where he talks about how it is really tough to see how we could have a recession, I think he did make a good case. And I think you don't necessarily need to buy his claims about the USMCA job growth. But when he was talking about big picture, trade fights are resolved, General Motors strike over, Boeing 737 Max deliveries probably resume sometime this year -- then you got the obviously very healthy consumer, good policy mix -- it's a good economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Boom. I was making this hand motion when James --- this was the 737 Max taking off. So you're going to take it off -- we get the GDP report. The first reading on the fourth quarter at the bottom of the hour.</p><p>That's why we're -- that's why I'm talking fast. And we're heading to break. And we have so much more to talk about this morning.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing -- we take a look at Facebook. It takes a hit on slowing growth but Microsoft and Tesla on a tear. After the bell eyes will be on Amazon.</p><p>Countdown to the Super Bowl kickoff, rapper Kanye West has big plans for the big game as ticket prices soar sky high. His Sunday service, yes.</p><p>And bringing the heat to an iconic flavor. Old Bay is spicing things up with a limited edition hot sauce that sold out within an hour. You do not eat steamed blue crab without Old Bay, or shrimp for that matter, where I come from.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then coming up, something more serious. The deadly coronavirus outbreak -- fresh fears surfacing over the spread of misinformation. How Twitter is trying to fight that problem.</p><p>Plus beyond finger-lickin' good -- KFC teaming up with Beyond Meat to bring buckets of plant-based fried chicken -- it's not chicken, it's -- well, it's on the menu. That is what it is. We'll tell you where you can get your hands on it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Tech on a tear. Big name tech companies seeing fourth quarter growth as earnings season rolls on. Already about one-third of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings.</p><p>Facebook beating expectations but a warning over slow growth is weighing on that stock this morning. It's down more than 7 percent. But up on this 9 percent year-to-date before that earnings report.</p><p>Meantime Microsoft shares poised to open at a new all time high after reporting strength in its cloud business.</p><p>And Tesla driving to a new high after posting a second straight profit for the quarter.</p><p>We're also watching Amazon. It reports after the bell today.</p><p>Joining me now, Synovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan. Dan -- your thoughts. Break it down for us.</p><p>DAN MORGAN, PORT FOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUS: Hi -- Dagen.</p><p>Well, they were all pretty good reports. I mean if you think about even the Facebook that came out, they were -- you know pushed aggressively 25 percent growth in advertising and they've been warning us that advertising has been slowing.</p><p>I think that one thing that the market really got upset about Dagen -- was the 51 percent jump in total cost and expenses for fiscal year 2019. That really weighed on the stock.</p><p>As you know, the stock has made a big run. It was at an all-time high coming into that earnings report so there wasn't a lot of error -- room for error going into that report.</p><p>And then Microsoft, as you mentioned before, a dynamite report. Intelligent cloud was up 27 percent. Acer (ph) was up 62 percent, I had estimated 55 percent growth. So very, very strong on the cloud front. I think they generated about $134 billion in cash.</p><p>So Microsoft was lights out, they hit on every single metric. And quite frankly, Dagen -- I didn't think the Facebook report was that bad but obviously everybody is very worried about cause (ph) associated with security going forward. You have Zuckerberg going over to Brussels. So I think that manifested in a bit of sell-off on the stock when they made that announcement.</p><p>MCDOWELL: on that note, just since you brought it up -- Dan that Mark Zuckerberg is going to -- on a European mission trip to Brussels, as you said, next month to discuss Internet rules and regulations with leaders of the European Union to personally lobby E.U. lawmakers.</p><p>What -- what do you make of that? Because again, I am going to -- as you answer -- answer about Europe and then I will ask you about growth here.</p><p>MORGAN: Yes Dagen -- so I think it is a really good move by Mark Zuckerberg. I mean he's basically showing that he's being proactive, right? We know what happened in the Cambridge Analytics issue, you know, year and a half ago. We know what happened in the U.S. We know about Elizabeth Warren and all these political pundits here in the U.S. are constantly throwing darts at Facebook.</p><p>So he is going over there. He's is trying to feel out and get a hold on exactly what those regulations are and ensure them that he is going to do everything in his power to protect data, right. And privacy and so forth.</p><p>So I think his goal is to show good faith that he wants to abide by the rules and by personally going over there and meeting with the E.U. in Brussels, he's showing that he is just not pushing it off and that's not something serious because let's face it Dagen -- they don't want to have another write-off like they did a couple of quarters ago.</p><p>You remember they wrote a big check to -- it's either the FTC or the Justice Department. They just kind of wrote it off on the quarter, it's like $500 million or something -- it was a huge number. And obviously, they don't want to keep writing checks. So I think that's the reason why they're showing this proactive movement.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. I'll point out that Elizabeth Warren keeps tweeting about this. She tweeted within the last 24 hours, talking about \"The stakes of this election are too high. We need to fight the spread of false information that disempowers voters and undermines democracy. I will do my part calling on fellow candidates and big tech companies to do their part.\"</p><p>Because as Rob Schneider, the actor said, that we're just -- maybe the American people were just so completely stupid that we can't think for ourselves. But anyway, go ahead -- Ryan.</p><p>PAYNE: Hey Dan -- Ryan Payne from Payne Capital. You know, well, we are starting to see now tech -- obviously the numbers have been fantastic. But we are also seeing things are priced to perfection and Facebook's a great example of that right here.</p><p>Earnings are still great but the stock is still down 7 percent. Is there still time to add money to tech here even with valuations where they are?</p><p>MORGAN: You are right -- Ryan. I mean you look at the same stocks, right. You got Google, Microsoft, Apple -- all kind of trading in the same range - - 25, 30 times earnings. You got Netflix and Amazon around 60 times earnings.</p><p>PAYNE: Crazy.</p><p>MORGAN: So is there room to keep going, right?</p><p>And you know, my response is I have been in the business since 1987. I went through the whole 90s and with the tech stocks. And I ran tech mutual funds back then. And you know, back then, we're trading at 50 times earnings on the S&amp;P information technology benchmark. Now we are at about 27 times.</p><p>So I still think there is some room but, you know, Ryan -- where I think there is opportunities is may be not so much in these price perfection same stocks like you are talking about, but in other areas, you know, like in cloud. You got Sales Force, Workday. You've got the chips have done really well, right, even though they pulled back a little bit. That was a great trade over the last 12 months. So I think we're starting to see the strength kind of throw out in the tech space.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dan -- great to see you. Terrific analysis.</p><p>MORGAN: Okay.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I like somebody who's been around --</p><p>MORGAN: Thank you -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- as long as I have. Dan Morgan -- thank you, again.</p><p>MORGAN: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up -- beyond finger-lickin' good. KFC teaming up with Beyond Meat to brings buckets of plant-based fried, call it \"clicken\"? I don't know what to call it. But it's a plant-based option.</p><p>FREEMAN: Non-chicken.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Plus bringing the heat -- Old Bay spicing up its classic seasoning with a limited edition hot sauce but you better act fast.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Apple and Broadcom paying hefty fines for patent breaches.</p><p>Kristina Partsinevelos on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more -- Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That would be Caltech -- the California Institution of Technology saying that they won a jury verdict against Apple and Broadcom. The reason they're saying is that Broadcom used their wi-fi chips in Apple iPhones and those wi-fi chips infringed on parents that Caltech did indeed file.</p><p>We have filed Apple right now that's not commenting but they are appealing the decision, the jury is -- the fund is going to be $1.1 billion -- that's $1.1 billion jury verdict.</p><p>Beyond Meat though -- I want to shift gears because I know you guys talked about this before the commercial break. Beyond Meat has announced that they're expanding their partnerships with Kentucky Fried Chicken the launch the BFC, the Beyond Fried Chicken sandwich -- and I just made up that acronym -- I don't know what it's going to be called but they launched these chicken sandwiches in Atlanta.</p><p>They sold out in less than five hours. They were so successful that they're expanding it to 70 other locations in Nashville, Tennessee; Charlotte, North Carolina and it's going to be in shelves February 23 or until supplies last.</p><p>And last but not least, UPS just put out some mixed earnings. They failed to -- they missed on revenue. Their earnings per share came in line but they did announce that they're going to be joining forces with Waymo -- that is the self-driving unit of Google. They're going to be driving vehicles -- these are self-driving cars that go from UPS facilities and they're just going to be delivering packages to a sorting facility in Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>This is going to be test-drove in the next few months or so but this is big news for both of those. And I will be interviewing the CEO of UPS later on in the day and we'll have clips on that on Fox Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Get down. Awesome.</p><p>Thank you -- Kristina. Kristina Partsinevelos at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Countdown to Super Bowl kickoff. Rapper Kanye West has big plans for the big game as ticket prices go sky-high.</p><p>And bringing the heat -- Old Bay spicing up its classic seasoning with a limited edition hot sauce but you better act fast.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>It is Thursday, January 30.</p><p>Maria on her way to the Super Bowl.</p><p>We've got breaking news on this U.S. economy. We're waiting on the first reading on GDP growth in the fourth quarter. The expectation is for growth of 2.1 percent, same as in the third quarter. We will bring you that number as soon as it hits.</p><p>Meantime, take a look at how futures are trading so far this morning. We're exactly an hour away from the opening bell. We have losses across the board because of the concern about the spread of that coronavirus. 2.1 percent growth right on the money, right on the nose. Deirdre Bolton has more on this report on GDP growth. Deirdre?</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: That is exactly right, Dagen. 2.1 percent matching the third quarter and exactly what economists had expected. Although I do want to say in reading around there was really a very big range because there were a lot more volatile elements than before, as a few economists were telling me, Dagen, including the price of oil for example. So I saw some estimates as low as 1.8 percent. I saw some as high as 2.1.</p><p>So in that light, we can be pretty optimistic in the sense that is coming in very much at the higher end of the range. A few things I'm going to be breaking down later for the most part. It's us. It's consumer spending that has been holding up the U.S. economy as we know two-thirds of GDP. The element that was the slowest last quarter, which I'm going to keep digging through the numbers here was the business equip -- or business investment rather in equipment and structures.</p><p>And a lot of economists that I was speaking with, they were saying, listen to U.S.-China trade war has taken a toll on confidence, business leaders confidence, they were not so ready to commit new capital, for example, two new infrastructures. So I'm going to begin to go through those numbers as well. And you remember this Tuesday again, the last time in that third quarter, we actually saw home buyers come back for the first time in seven quarters.</p><p>I'm going to see if the homebuyers kept up this time. In the meantime, what you need to know that headline, as expected, matching the third quarter at 2.1 percent. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Deirdre, great insight for that. Thank you so much. Let's bring it out and talk to it. Ryan, what do you make of this because you did point out that this was -- this was solid simply because some of the estimates were low for the quarter.</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: That's right. So the high end of the range, which is great. And also, this is the same growth now we've had for over a decade. So it's just more of the same steady, steady growth. And that's why I think this expansion is just going to continue because there's no real overheating in the economy. And go back to James that I spoke back in the green room. The other thing is now we have trade deals, companies are spending again. So that could be huge for GDP coming into 2020. Very --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm going to call Reuters out on this, James.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's the headline from the Reuters report. The U.S. economy miss the Trump administration's three percent growth target for the second straight year. That's the headline. That is the first sentence of their wire report. It is. it is 2.3 percent growth for last year 2019, that's the slowest since 2016. But what do you make -- what do you make of this report for the quarter -- for the most recent quarter?</p><p>FREEMAN: I think Deirdre hit it on the head there. This is the cost of the trade fight. We saw a faster growth. We saw exactly that Trump plan in the aftermath of his tax cuts that encourage businesses to invest. We saw that surge in capital expenditures after the tax cut came through. Then we got into this trade fight. And we've seen how we're back to kind of slow OK, good, but not great growth.</p><p>And that's why I think you have to be excited now because he has resolved at least for the phase one, the China deal. He is just yesterday, signed the enacting legislation on the U.S.- Mexico-Canada deal. Now you've got the great Trump tax cut policy. You've got the deregulation and you've got trade peace should be a good year.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>TORRANCE: Yes. I mean, markets hate uncertainty. And there's been a lot of uncertainty with these trade wars going on. But, you know, Deidre also mentioned I think it's important is the consumer. We had record spending over the holiday season. New home sales are up, I think, almost record numbers. So yes, I think that all of the Democrats that have been really, I think hoping for recession because that's their only chance. I think --</p><p>PAYNE: It's good for elections.</p><p>TORRANCE: -- to win in November. Exactly. I think it was wishful thinking. I think the numbers we're seeing, they look great. And I think it's strange as you said, Dagan, that Reuters report. It's -- but that I think you can spin numbers, you know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm just -- again, I've been -- I was a writer -- I was a writer and a journalist before I ever started working in T.V. and just give me the number. Just tell me the number and analyze why it's good. OK? Bad, whatever. But just give me the number. But again, it's -- I guess it is political. It is political in every way. We're going into an election year. What do you think about the coming year because we were talking about what Wilbur Ross was saying, and it does look like that there's a lot of not -- of course, we're watching these futures and there's the issue of the coronavirus, but there's a lot of wind at the backs of not just our economy, but the global economy.</p><p>PAYNE: That's exactly right. And James hit me on the head just here in the U.S. But if you look at manufacturing data across the pond, I mean, that's actually getting better too. So, I mean, this year we can really see a return to global growth. And that's just good for everybody. So I think overall, it was funny last year, we've been talking about a recession. Now it just seems laughable which I was saying last year for the record.</p><p>But now, yes, I think now we get the global economy picking up too. That's just another one at the back for everybody. It's all good stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One -- Michael Kantro was from Cornerstone Macro was on yesterday and he -- and he has been writing about this that consumer free cash flow, that is after tax bills, food, energy, debt service, everything is at a record high.</p><p>PAYNE: They save now. American save. That's like incredible. It's been years since we said.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Saving and spending. And how can you be increasing your savings and increasing spending obviously, it's got to be more jobs and higher wages.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it's the combination is the -- it's the trinity. It's the perfect combination of low interest rates, which eight -- that takes eight. We've got the beginning of this trickling into the economy. 18 months that the U.S. economy will feel the impact of lower interest sights, low oil prices. And I think President Trump can take some credit for that, given the -- we're now the number one producer of energy in the world. And then full employment, those are three things that will keep the economy moving - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TORRANCE. And the energy thing I think is very important, Dagen, because you're likely to have an election this year, which President Trump's rival is not going to be as supportive. Now, it's going to depend of course, if it's Biden, or if it's Sanders or somebody else, but on the whole, the Democrats don't like fracking. They want to ban it. They don't like new pipelines. But this is something that's really shored up the American economy and of course, energy independence.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's what -- I actually made notes when I first saw that Joe Biden video at the top of the hour that we played or the man confronting him about, we don't rebuild pipelines. We don't need any pipelines and I wanted Vice President Biden. He's a Democrat, but he is a moderate. Maybe they only want.</p><p>FREEMAN: Relatively, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Relatively moderate, but I want him to look at that man and say, we have pipelines because we're delivering plentiful, cheap fuel to the people who need it. And by that we are raising the standard of living for people in this country. This is a critical part of not only our economic growth but our national security. And we use these fuels because they're inexpensive.</p><p>And it helps Americans and it -- but you will never hear -- he might believe that but you'll never hear that.</p><p>PAYNE: That's a good point.</p><p>TORRANCE: And -- to say quickly, Pennsylvania has seemed just an economic almost a miracle. Thanks to energy, thanks to fracking. And, you know, if the Democrats elect someone that wants to get rid of it, I don't think -- I nominate someone, I don't see how they're going to win Pennsylvania.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, just add to it too. It's also a tax break because oil prices have come down for the U.S. consumer as well. There's low oil prices also factor as another stimulus. So that's actually been very good for the consumer.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. The Democratic debate on this is basically how many trillions of dollars of costs should we impose on U.S. workers and consumers in order to reduce emissions even further? And so you -- yes, I -- you are never going to hear that message that you were during the vice president did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: China's building one coal fired power plant awake, that China's responsible for half -- virtually a majority of the emissions growth problems.</p><p>FREEMAN: That's where the growth is. We get more and more efficient, we get more and more GDP out of every barrel of oil every year. We -- we're not the emissions problem going forward. That's for sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Democrats will do everything to have the cause. But ultimately, it is somebody commuting to work and trying to heat their home with a reasonably priced fuel that is going to get hurt the most. But again, let's take a look, the futures 158-point loss, we still have a triple digit loss on the Dow right now. And despite this solid economic growth in the fourth quarter, 2.1 percent.</p><p>The features are selling off the markets week here because of these new concerns about the spread of the coronavirus and Lauren Simonetti has all the details on that, Lauren?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, Dagen. Everyone's trying to figure out how extensive this is going to be. Take a look right now though of shares of Carnival, sharply lower down 6-1/2 percent right here in the premarket because of this.</p><p>And Italian News Service is reporting and where the 6000 people are stuck on one of the company's ships in Rome. There it is. Two people on the ship were from Hong Kong, they have been quarantined. One of them with was said to be mild flu symptoms, but everybody is just so nervous right now. It's affecting the company's stock price.</p><p>Social media companies like Twitter are now scrambling to fight misinformation about the virus. The company says it's redirecting questions about the outbreak to the CDC for the best answers.</p><p>Americans spending more on healthcare these days but are actually dying sooner. The cost making up 16.9 percent of the U.S. economy. That was for 2018. According to a study by the Commonwealth Fund, it says a marriage laid out $10,000 a person on average, double the amount in countries like Australia and the U.K. The study also finding that Americans have the lowest light expectancy at birth.</p><p>And this, an extra spicy sauce proven to be a hot commodity. McCormick selling out of its latest Old Bay hot sauce in an hour after went on sale online. But if you need to get your hands on a bottle, go to eBay. You can get it for $120 if you were so inclined. Imagine that bringing the heat, baby. You're speechless, Dagen. You're speechless.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIMONETTI: She's on eBay.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. You know what I'm doing? I'm in -- Googling all bay because again, in my family, you get a box of that Old Base Seasoning in your Christmas stocking.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you're steaming blue crabs, you better have copious amount of Old Bay on them. If you are steaming shrimp, you better have Old Bay on them. My fingers better be orange with Old Bay when I'm peeling shrimp.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TORRANCE: This is making me miss Washington, D.C. where I just left in November. You know, you go up to Baltimore and get those, you know, peel those shrimp with Old Bay.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Old Bay includes celery salt, black pepper, crushed red paper flakes and paprika. It's that paprika to steal on old Whoopi Goldberg joke about barbecue potato chips. You can use it as eye makeup. It's delicious but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: That's what was in your stocking. It was made for makeup.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly. I digress. But I love my Old Bay.</p><p>Sylvester goes silver. Fans are going crazy after the star debuted a head of silver hair. Coleslaw.</p><p>Plus, it's game time. We take you live to Miami for a sneak peek at how the San Francisco 49ers cheerleaders better known as the Gold Rush preparing with a big game. That is awesome and a special update right now from the Tennis Channel.</p><p>ANDREW KRASNY, THE TENNIS CHANNEL HOST: Welcome back to another special Tennis Channel Australian Open court report. For Fox Business. I'm Andrew Krasny. Day 11 and Melbourne saw one veteran and one rising star punch their tickets to the final. 21-year-old Americans Sofia Kenin took out world number one absolutely party and straight sets to reach her first career Grand Slam final. With the win, Kennin becomes the first American other than Serena or Venus to reach the final in Melbourne since 2005.</p><p>Next up for Kenin, Garbine Muguruza. The Spaniard took out Simona Halep to advance to her first major final since 2017. Muguruza who came into the tournament ranked 32 in the world is now just one win away from her third career grand slam title.</p><p>And don't forget Tennis Channel's live coverage of the Aussie Open hits the air Thursday at 10:00 p.m. Eastern. I'm Andrew Krasny.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Super Bowl Sunday. Fans getting ready to cheer for their favorite team from the stands, homes, from bars. But on the field, the job goes to a very talented bunch of motivators. Cheryl Casone is live with the San Francisco 49ers cheerleaders. Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh, good morning, Dagen. The sun is out right here in Miami in South Beach and the Gold Rush is with me on our Fox at Ladies. Good morning.</p><p>LAUREN LOPEZ, PROFESSIONAL CHEERLEADER, SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS: Good morning.</p><p>DANIELLE DELPINO, PROFESSIONAL CHEERLEADER, SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS: This is Lauren and this is Danielle. You two are the co-captains. We've got Tiffany over here, Doran to my left, to the -- to the stage right. Are you excited about the Super Bowl on Sunday?</p><p>DELPINO: We are so excited. We feel so blessed to be here and the weather and just being in Miami has been incredible.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. And that's a good point. You know, you all are in San Francisco. I used to live there years ago. It gets pretty darn cold. And so this Miami is a nice place to be cheering, right?</p><p>LOPEZ: Oh, absolutely. It's really chilly at home and this is such a nice little break for us.</p><p>CASONE: Well, let's talk about the fans, ladies, because obviously it's all about the fans on Sunday. Normally you just do the home games. This is a special trip for the Gold Rush because you're going to be here on the field on -- do you get nervous when you -- when you know it's gonna be Super Bowl Sunday? Are you excited to see everybody? How are you feeling?</p><p>LOPEZ: We are so excited. We actually have eight of us here right now and the rest of the 32 members on our team are joining us today. So we are so excited and we cannot wait to see faithful show up on Sunday.</p><p>CASONE: The 49 are faithful. That is for sure. So I know who you're rooting for. But Lauren, tell me how do you train because, you know, people think, oh, cheerleading must be so fun. It's a lot of work. You basically are all athletes in your own regard. Right?</p><p>DELPINO: So we're fortunate enough to be able to only practice once a week for about six hours and then the rest of it is on us. And we usually get together and have fun and practice during the week when we have time.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. Okay. Do you have other jobs? I've always wanted to ask that of a cheerleader. Do you have another job besides that?</p><p>DELPINO: Yes, I'm a teacher and we all have many different jobs.</p><p>CASONE: OK. What do you do besides cheerleading?</p><p>LOPEZ: I'm an administrative assistant.</p><p>CASONE: Oh, wow. OK. So you guys are working double jobs. Oh, that's that sounds tough to me. All right. Let's talk about some of the things that you're doing here in Miami because I know that earlier this week, you went to a children's hospital here in Miami, and you've actually packed gift baskets yourselves to take to some of the kids at the hospital. Tell me about that.</p><p>DELPINO: Yes. So we had a appearance with Baskets of Hope and we got to pack with other volunteers, pack little goodie bags and we are actually heading to the Children's Hospital later today. And we are so, so excited for it.</p><p>CASONE: OK. So that's it. Well, you guys have had a busy week. Thank you so much for being here on \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\" and Fox Business. As we send it back to Dagen and the gang back in New York. We're going to give you a little bit of a rally. This is what we call it, Dagen. A rally. And I got to say go Niners. I'm here with the Gold Rush. What can I say? Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's awesome, Cheryl. I can't wait to see you. I want to add this because people were skeptical of the comments about the San Francisco weather versus Miami. Like not that cold. Here's my favorite quote, having lived also lived in San Francisco for a year, the coldest winter I ever saw was the summer I spent in San Francisco.</p><p>PAYNE: Mark Twain.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it's attributed to Mark Twain. Maria on our way to Miami right now. I'll be -- I'll be right behind her. We'll be live from South Beach starting tomorrow morning. And of course, you can catch the game Sunday on Fox kickoff. 6:30 p.m.</p><p>Coming up. Sylvester Stallone's new do. How fans are reacting after the star debuted a head of silver.</p><p>Plus, we're counting down to the Super Bowl kickoff. We'll tell you that rapper -- about rapper Kanye West big plans for the big game. As ticket prices go sky high.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Warning buzz for you. First up. Rocky aging gracefully. Hollywood icon Sylvester Stallone posting this on Instagram yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SYLVESTER STALLONE, AMERICAN ACTOR: Keep punching, my friend. Keep punching.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: He is 73 years of age. The -- Sylvester Stallone clearly embracing his light gray hair and beard after dyeing his hair black for years. Kelly, thumbs up,</p><p>TORRANCE: I give it the thumbs up, two thumbs up. He, you know, Sly Stallone, he is charismatic. So no matter what color his hair is, he can pull it off. I have to say I'm a little jealous. You know, being a -- being a woman, it's a little harder, I think for us to be able to pull off a full head of gray. I don't have one yet. But, you know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TORRANCE: Thank you. But, you know, someone likes Sly, I mean that guy he's got -- he's got charisma. He's got that personality. So he just looks great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I dye my hair and I have a lot more salt than pepper. If I didn't. I leave it at that. We're headed to the Super Bowl. MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live from Miami tomorrow on Monday. But how much will those lucky fans inside the stadium be paying for tickets? SeatGeek says the average resale ticket price for Sunday's game is up to $6,845. Last year sales top 4600 -- almost $4700, 4657 for the Rams versus the Patriots matchup.</p><p>Meantime, rapper turned gospel artist. Kanye West is planning his own Super Bowl event in Miami. His Sunday service set for 11:00 a.m. ahead of the big game. Ryan?</p><p>PAYNE: I mean it's appropriate, the man has a messiah like complex. You know, now I'm called Jesus for goodness sakes. So I think, you know, adding that element of doing in a church. It's completely appropriate for Kanye.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. But he's been doing these regularly and it is a serve -- its church service, James. You can go.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. It's interesting he's selling his new songs now which are more -- I think overtly Christian than in the past and I think people kind of wondering, you know, it's sometimes hard to crossover with -- especially in pop music but it seems to be pulling it off. So that should be an interesting event.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've seen Kanye West in concert with one of our producers, Justin. He's incredible. Again, crossover, he's doing gospel, criminal justice reform with his wife. He can do everything except play football. That's a different story. MORNINGS WITH MARIA is back right after this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back before we go. I have to do this. What are you grading at? What's wrong with you? What Nancy Grace did to James because he was like smiling because he's a smiley guy. So, I had to do that for you.</p><p>FREEMAN: And you have to smile when you listen to Nancy Grace.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. She's on next week. But before that, tomorrow, Super Bowl. We stay tuned. Maria Bartiromo's interview in the San Francisco 49ers president, Al Giudo tomorrow from Miami. I'm heading down there as well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020013003cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3H-TMR1-JB20-G3HX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7095\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002J8M</classCode><className>COCA-COLA CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Is this the moment that big tech proves that big data can be used for the greater good? What is big tech's role in the fight against coronavirus? What should it be?</p><h>A grand vision</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As I think about how big tech might lead the fight against COVID-19, the first thing that comes to mind is that data is more powerful in the presence of other data. The more complete the data set, the more you can learn from it. Which means enemies, frenemies, competitors and compatriots must all join together to win the fight. This requires leadership, but it also requires something we've never had before: a universal database of personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI).</p><h>The life star</h><p>If you had enough information from the search engines (all of them, not just Google), you would know where people were getting sick. If you had enough information from the social networks (all of them, not just Facebook and Twitter), you would know when people were starting to feel ill. If you had enough PHI, you would know who was getting sick and who was more or less likely to get sick. The data sets would be huge, but there are well-understood predictive tools you would use to give governments and health officials advanced warnings and assessments of risk.</p><p>This would allow business as usual until a level of risk had been reached, and then preemptive measures could be used to protect people in a given risk zone. Lives would be saved. The economy would feel the minimum impact. There are many good things that could come from analyzing and using the data in this \"grand vision\" database.</p><h>The death star</h><p>No one (not even the black-ops data miners) have ever put this much PII and PHI together in one place. Bad actors would find this treasure trove of data irresistible. I cannot imagine all of the horrible, evil stuff you could do with a data set this complete. It would be marketing heaven, but a living hell. You could mine it to offer low-cost insurance to the healthiest and deny insurance to the least healthy, then do the same thing with mortgages, bank loans, credit cards, housing, car insurance and on and on.</p><p>The list is endless. I know calling this \"the death star\" is an unfortunate metaphor, but this kind of information could literally be used to deny sick people the insurance they need to obtain life-saving health care.</p><h>What should we do?</h><p>On one hand, this data exists. Right now, it is in many different places in many different databases. It can be gathered. It can be analyzed. And we could save tens of thousands of lives. On the other hand, amassing this database would empower even the most altruistic and good natured among us to wonder about alternative uses.</p><h>Big tech leadership</h><p>This is where big tech leadership comes in. There are ways to hash this data and keep it anonymous. We can mine the information we need without exposing individual identities -\u00a0it will be very difficult to accomplish (not technically, sociologically). Big tech would have to pick a leader or leaders, and they would have to rally IT professionals and CEOs across many industries. The big tech leadership would have to convince people that there is a safe way to use big tech's power for the greater good.</p><h>Broken promises</h><p>I've been hearing about the value of the \"free and open\" Internet since it was conceived. In hindsight, none of the promises of social media or about the free flow of information have turned out to be true. We have an unending river of unfiltered information that is highly polluted by algorithmic bias. Forget the truth; the best narrative wins. Don't worry if the AI model is constantly retuning itself to increase your teenager's addiction to social media; they'll grow up just fine. \"We have to rely on the data,\" says the corporate executive as that executive denies a job to a qualified candidate, even though executives using the services have no idea what proxy data has been used to make calculations possible.</p><p>For this to work, all of the \"freedom and openness\" in the previous paragraph would have to be worked through. The Internet would need to be weaponized against COVID-19. The problem is that once you weaponize the information, it is a weapon. And this weapon would be more powerful than any we've seen in information age warfare.</p><h>Socratic debate is called for</h><p>One of the great things about the current state of the Internet is that it allows us to hold moderated Socratic debates on important topics.

Is this the moment that big tech proves that big data can be used for the greater good?</p><p> What is big tech's role in the fight against coronavirus? What should it be? A grand vision As I think about how big tech might lead the fight against COVID-19, the first thing that comes to mind is that data is more powerful in the presence of other data. The more complete the data set, the more you can learn from it. Which means enemies, frenemies, competitors and compatriots must all join together to win the fight. This requires leadership, but it also requires something we've never had before: a universal database of personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI). The life star If you had enough information from the search engines (all of them, not just Google), you would know where people were getting sick. If you had enough information from the social networks (all of them, not just Facebook and Twitter), you would know when people were starting to feel ill. If you had enough PHI, you would know who was getting sick and who was more or less likely to get sick. The data sets would be huge, but there are well-understood predictive tools you would use to give governments and health officials advanced warnings and assessments of risk.This would allow business as usual until a level of risk had been reached, and then preemptive measures could be used to protect people in a given risk zone. Lives would be saved. The economy would feel the minimum impact. There are many good things that could come from analyzing and using the data in this \"grand vision\" database. The death star No one (not even the black-ops data miners) have ever put this much PII and PHI together in one place. Bad actors would find this treasure trove of data irresistible. I cannot imagine all of the horrible, evil stuff you could do with a data set this complete. It would be marketing heaven, but a living hell. You could mine it to offer low-cost insurance to the healthiest and deny insurance to the least healthy, then do the same thing with mortgages, bank loans, credit cards, housing, car insurance and on and on.The list is endless. I know calling this \"the death star\" is an unfortunate metaphor, but this kind of information could literally be used to deny sick people the insurance they need to obtain life-saving health care. What should we do? On one hand, this data exists. Right now, it is in many different places in many different databases. It can be gathered. It can be analyzed. And we could save tens of thousands of lives. On the other hand, amassing this database would empower even the most altruistic and good natured among us to wonder about alternative uses. Big tech leadership This is where big tech leadership comes in. There are ways to hash this data and keep it anonymous. We can mine the information we need without exposing individual identities \u2014it will be very difficult to accomplish (not technically, sociologically). Big tech would have to pick a leader or leaders, and they would have to rally IT professionals and CEOs across many industries. The big tech leadership would have to convince people that there is a safe way to use big tech's power for the greater good. Broken promises I've been hearing about the value of the \"free and open\" Internet since it was conceived. In hindsight, none of the promises of social media or about the free flow of information have turned out to be true. We have an unending river of unfiltered information that is highly polluted by algorithmic bias. Forget the truth; the best narrative wins. Don't worry if the AI model is constantly retuning itself to increase your teenager's addiction to social media; they'll grow up just fine. \"We have to rely on the data,\" says the corporate executive as that executive denies a job to a qualified candidate, even though executives using the services have no idea what proxy data has been used to make calculations possible.For this to work, all of the \"freedom and openness\" in the previous paragraph would have to be worked through. The Internet would need to be weaponized against COVID-19. The problem is that once you weaponize the information, it is a weapon. And this weapon would be more powerful than any we've seen in information age warfare. Socratic debate is called for One of the great things about the current state of the Internet is that it allows us to hold moderated Socratic debates on important topics. So What is your thesis? It's time for a Socratic debate.Named LinkedIn's Top Voice in Technology, Shelly Palmer is CEO of The Palmer Group, a consulting practice that helps Fortune 500 companies with technology, media and marketing.

But how is this new <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</url> different from previous ones and what can we do about it? </p><p>Fear is normal during times of danger - it's what has kept us alive through millions of years of evolution. During outbreaks, we fear because we don't know enough, what we know keeps changing, scientists and governments can't seem to agree on the facts, and we fear death from unnatural or unpredictable causes. Cognitive dissonance only makes it worse - we ask ourselves why, if there's nothing to worry about, millions of people are under quarantine, for example. Psychologically, we fear things we can't see or control. Sociopolitically, we imagined that borders will protect us from \"foreign threats\", so we panic when viruses penetrate these borders so effortlessly. </p><p>Since 2009, three tectonic shifts have taken place to worsen these fears. First, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/social-media\">social media</url> - the technology of tomorrow - is being used by societies stuck with the preparedness of yesterday. Second, trust in governments is at historical lows, further eroded by opaque and inconsistent outbreak responses. And third is a combustible mixture of latent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/racism\">racism</url> and increasing nationalism that has been lit by irresponsible politicians. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Social media</emphasis></p><p>Just 11 years ago, only 17 per cent of the world had smartphones, there were only 30 million <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/twitter\">Twitter</url> and 360 million       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/facebook\">Facebook</url> accounts, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/whatsapp\">WhatsApp</url> had just launched. Today, smartphone penetration is at 45 per cent, 500 million tweets are sent every day and 2.9 billion people use Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/instagram\">Instagram</url> each month. </p><p>Social media has given everyone a platform, but not everyone knows how to use it responsibly. The velocity, volume and variety of information can be terrifying. For the average citizen, given their limited bandwidth and time, it's easier to trust friends and family than distant, faceless experts, and quicker to just hit forward without verifying. </p><p>Big tech companies claim to merely offer \"neutral platforms\" as an excuse to avoid responsibility for user-generated content. But are they really neutral if they are home to a morass of fake news, hate speech, political misinformation and extremist rhetoric? </p><p>Entire education systems must be revamped to train the population how to search for, verify and use information. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech\">Big Tech</url> must self-regulate and be regulated in ways that protect free speech while eliminating dumb, divisive or dangerous rhetoric. During outbreaks, governments, health professionals, traditional media, civil society and responsible citizens must \"flood the zone\" with truth and solidarity, to flush out trolls, racists and bigots. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Declining trust</emphasis></p><p>Trust in institutions, politicians and governments is declining, mostly thanks to political polarisation and a general deterioration in people's quality of life, public services and institutional performance. Health authorities and public health care services have been caught on the back foot. Much of this isn't their fault, as science alone has never been the sole criterion for health care decisions: politics, economics and the social contract all played important roles. </p><p>Outbreaks are different. Saving lives is the overriding objective, and cool, calm and evidence-based science must take precedence. However, in societies with trust deficits in politicians such as in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong\">Hong Kong</url>, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-states\">United States</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/malaysia\">Malaysia</url>, or in authoritarian and opaque societies like mainland       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china\">China</url>'s, doctors and scientists try to dissociate themselves from their political masters with varying levels of success. </p><p>Political leaders must work with health care professionals to make decisions during an outbreak - yet during this crisis some political leaders are seemingly making decisions largely on political grounds without giving science an equal say. </p><p>This outbreak will burn itself out, leaving us to prepare for the next one, which will require both adequate investment in response capabilities to strengthen our health systems and system-wide upgrades. Universal health coverage, enhanced primary care and competent professionals will not only mitigate outbreaks but also help manage ageing populations with non-communicable diseases. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Increasing nationalism</emphasis></p><p>Globalisation has undoubtedly polarised societies around the world, with nationalist instincts manifesting in discrimination or xenophobia against certain ethnicities during this outbreak. Travel bans, a convenient fig leaf for latent racism, are increasingly being deployed despite little evidence that they work against viruses that have no passports. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3048368/china-coronavirus-outbreak-plague-fear-and-prejudice-could-be-just\">Coronavirus outbreak: the plague of fear and prejudice could be just as lethal</url></p><p>This outbreak may have started in China, but it's not China's fault, just like the 2009 H1N1 outbreak that started in the United States - causing up to 575,000 deaths - wasn't theirs. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/world-health-organisation\">World Health Organisation</url>'s calls for solidarity are correct: this is a war between species, not between countries. Helping China, and every country facing an outbreak, is not only compassionate and ethical, but also common sense. </p><p>Global scientific collaboration must accelerate with freer and more transparent data sharing. Open-access repositories operated by neutral brokers like the WHO or the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/european-union\">European Union</url> can be trust-building instruments. Academic, publishing, intellectual property and patent systems must reform their incentive structures to reward collaboration, not destructive competition. In the meantime, we can and should help China as much as possible while worldwide, health systems should shift from containment to mitigation strategies. </p><p>This will not be the last time the world reels from an outbreak of infectious disease. Health leaders must recognise the shifting technological, sociopolitical and geopolitical landscapes in which we now operate to formulate solutions. Science alone can't save us, but a combination of science, compassion, public trust, good governance and solidarity can. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dr Swee Kheng Khor specialises in health systems, health policies and global health, and is currently based at the University of Oxford.</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2020.

I'm Nellie Bowles, the tech and culture reporter, here now with the roundup of the news. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  It was a week that captured the central issues of tech in 2020: privacy versus the convenience of smart home devices, dependence on the smooth running of China's manufacturing industry, battles over regulation in Europe and the lockdown on internal dissent at Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>  So to those wanting to take a break from the endless Democratic primary jockeying, settle into a good chair, because what the week brought you is a basket of beautiful tech features.</p><p>  We begin:</p><p>  Coronavirus is starting to affect tech production lines and demand for products. Apple cut its sales expectations for the quarter, citing the virus's impact on factories and stores. The warning was a clear indication of how big the company has bet on China and how the impact of the outbreak might ripple out into the global economy, explored in an article by Daisuke Wakabayashi.</p><p>Amazon executives are also preparing for coronavirus disruptions. An article by Karen Weise and Michael Corkery outlined the measures the company is taking to hedge against the potential that the impact of the virus gets worse. The Everything Store is ''making larger and more frequent orders of Chinese-made products that had already been shipped to the United States,'' they wrote.</p><p>  But at the same time, some suppliers are trying to lower demand, cutting back on advertising and promotions so they don't run out of stuff.</p><p>  Privacy debates and doorbells</p><p>  Speaking of Amazon: Not everyone agrees on where to draw the line between privacy and convenience, sometimes not even everyone in the same house. One couple fighting over whether to keep an Alexa-enabled Echo speaker in the home invented their own solution: a bracelet of silence that jams microphones. Wear it and it's like smart-home armor. The tale of the couple, two computer science professors, was brought to us by Kashmir Hill.</p><p>  But if you do agree on getting something that records video and listens -- especially a Ring doorbell -- there are some privacy best practices, which Brian X. Chen outlined in his latest Tech Fix column. There are many, many steps required, including getting a burner phone number. And his conclusion: ''If that all sounds like a lot of effort just to use a security camera, that's because the security concerns make Ring products impractical to own.''</p><p>  In Europe, leaders are very good at regulating technology, pioneering responses to issues of privacy and antitrust, but can it build tech giants of its own? My colleagues Adam Satariano and Monika Pronczuk wrote: ''As Europe has created a reputation as the world's most aggressive watchdog of Silicon Valley, it has failed to nurture its own tech ecosystem. That has left countries in the region increasingly dependent on companies that many leaders distrust.'' Now it is trying to change that and reclaim ''technological sovereignty.''</p><p>  Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley companies have been making more trips to Brussels recently to lobby against some of that regulation: a new digital policy, including first-of-its-kind rules on the ways that artificial intelligence can be used by companies, Adam wrote.</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  Noam Scheiber and Kate Conger had a big story in the The New York Times Magazine on the Great Google Revolt: what happened when a group of employees tried to make the company stop doing work they saw as unethical.</p><p>  Mostly, they were fired. Dive into the article to understand how Google went from an ultra-transparent company that encouraged employee dissent to, well, not.</p><p>  The Style section's Penelope Green took us to deathbeds. As more people choose to die at home and more families have smartphones, deathbed photos are returning.</p><p>  ''What's happening now is that people are taking back that process,'' said Stanley B. Burns, 81, an ophthalmologist who runs the Burns Archive, a collection of post-mortem and medical photos. ''But the impulse to photograph is the same as it was for the Victorians.''</p><p>  Our colleague in Opinion, Susan Fowler, shook the tech world in 2017 when she wrote a first-person account of working at Uber and suffering the indignities and discrimination of a sexist, start-up workplace.</p><p>  Her memoir, ''Whistleblower: My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber,'' is out now, and the Book Review called it ''a powerful illustration of the obstacles our society continues to throw up in the paths of ambitious young women.''</p><p>  Marker, a new business site by Medium, is rolling out some great stories this week including a series on ''The New Rules of the I.P.O.''</p><p>  Kickstarter officially voted to unionize. There have been large efforts to organize tech labor, but many have faltered.</p><p>  San Diego is likely to recognize Instacart workers as employees rather than independent contractors, according to a story in Bloomberg Law.</p><p>  A general reminder from The New York Times Magazine's Future of Work issue: Professional video game players are in high demand as the industry competes for talent, and now they make even more money.</p><p>  According to Newzoo, a games-and-e-sports analytics company, competitive e-sports revenue last year was about $1.1 billion, an almost 27 percent increase from 2018, Robert Capps wrote.

Goodnight from Sussex.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, July 30th. Your top stories right now, 6:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast, stimulus stalemate. Now, lawmakers are far from an agreement on the next round of coronavirus aid; this as the extra unemployment benefits are set to expire tomorrow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The coronavirus effect on the U.S. economy, coming up. At 8:30 a.m. Eastern this morning, we will get the first read on the second quarter GDP. It is expected to show a record-breaking contraction, a decline of 34.1%, expected this morning.</p><p>Plus, initial jobless claims are also expected this morning to rise for a second week in a row.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve not even thinking about raising rates now. Fed Chair Jay Powell saying the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetime. Warning; containing COVID is essential to protecting our health and the economy.</p><p>Big tech in focus; Facebook, Amazon, Google and parent Alphabet, and Apple, all reporting today, their earnings after the bell. The CEOs grilled on Capitol Hill yesterday about anti-conservative bias, business practices, privacy and China. Highlights from the fiery hearing coming up.</p><p>Markets this morning, pointing to a sell off at the start of trading. Take a look at Futures indicating a decline of 216 points right out of the gate; the NASDAQ down 95; and the S&amp;P lower by 28.</p><p>Markets rallied yesterday following the Federal Reserve decision; take a look at 4 O'Clock on Wall Street. The market was up 160 points on the Dow. The NASDAQ was up 140. And the S&amp;P up 40 points yesterday.</p><p>Unrest in America with violence raging in major cities; federal agents will start leaving Portland. In a separate effort, they're headed to help restore law and order in other cities.</p><p>And the NBA tipping off today, players taking the court in a bubble at Disney World with empty stands; we will check it out.</p><p>The CEO of FanDuel is here, Matthew King joining me live at 8:40 a.m. Eastern on how the virus is impacting gambling.</p><p>Mornings with Maria is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning right across the board, take a look at European indices with the FTSE 100 right now down 90 points, the CAC quarente down 51, and the DAX Index in Germany lower by 289 points. We got to sell off underway this morning.</p><p>The German economy shrinking a record 10.1%, that's to the second quarter due of course to the coronavirus shutdowns. We'll get the GDP this morning in 2.5 hours time for the U.S.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower. Take a look. The worst performer there, as you can see was the Hong Kong market. Hang Seng down two-thirds of 1%. The major indices flat overnight.</p><p>Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning right now, another round of talks between the White House and Congress on a new COVID- 19 stimulus bill set for today with no compromise in sight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are still very far apart on a lot of issues. I do think there's a subset of issues that we do agree on, but overall we're far from an agreement and The President is very focused on the issue of unemployment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Republicans proposing a second round of $1,200 checks for Americans making less than $75,000 a year. Democrats want to extend that $600 weekly unemployment benefit, while Republicans are pushing to cut that amount to $200 a week.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejecting President Trump's support for a short- term bill, if the two sides cannot reach an agreement by tomorrow when enhanced jobless benefits are set to expire.</p><p>Well, the U.S. reaching another grim milestone in the coronavirus pandemic, surpassing 150,000 deaths, now leading the world in deaths and cases in the United States. Seven States reporting a record number of deaths in a single day yesterday. All members of the House of Representatives now required to wear masks while on the floor, after Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert tested positive for COVID-19. Attorney General Bill Barr was tested after being with Gohmert at Tuesday's House hearing; Barr tested negative.</p><p>President Trump touting America's dominance in the oil and gas industry during a visit to Texas yesterday, The President toured an oil rig in Midland and promised to put America first when it comes to energy production. The President also doing some fundraising during that trip.</p><p>Federal agents are now expected to begin leaving Portland today as the city sees a 63rd night of unrest. The Trump Administration and Oregon leaders reaching a deal yesterday to withdraw agents after accusations of excessive force used against protesters. This as The White House enhances the expansion of Operation Legend, deploying agents to Milwaukee, Cleveland and Detroit.</p><p>Fiery hearing, big tech on the hot seat yesterday facing tough questions from the House Judiciary Subcommittee, all virtually, in Washington.</p><p>The CEO's of Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google grilled about competition and alleged political bias. The tech giants also asked about China technology theft. Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, the only one to say the problem is well documented. President Trump weighing in on Twitter saying he will take action against big tech if Congress doesn't.</p><p>Well, investors are awaiting some key economic data this morning. Futures are down ahead of the GDP number. The first estimate of the second quarter GDP is coming out later this morning. The number expected to show a record- breaking decline, 34.1% contraction in the last quarter.</p><p>Initial jobless claims also hitting the tape this morning. The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits possibly rising for a second week in a row this morning.</p><p>Joining me right now to talk more about all of that is Adviser Investments' Chief Investment Officer Jim Lowell, along with the conversation this morning - joining the conversation is Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, Forbes Media Chairman and former Republican Presidential candidate Steve Forbes, and Strategic Wealth Partners' President and CEO Mark Tepper. Great to see everybody this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Great to see you.</p><p>JIM LOWELL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ADVISER INVESTMENTS: Good to be with you.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good morning.</p><p>MARK TEPPER, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, STRATEGIC WEALTH PARTNERS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jim, let me kick it off with you. Your expectations first. We've got earnings as well as economic data. What drives markets this morning?</p><p>LOWELL: Well, my expectations are that we're going to get that grim economic report, but the market's known that not just for weeks but months. I think it has priced it in, still it may be selling on the news. We also think that the big tech earnings clearly are going to help this market either propel a little bit more, regain some of the losses it may see today, as we wind our way into the year.</p><p>This is a market where fear continues to be pushed to the back seat based on a lot of hopes relating to medical data. From our view, medical data matters more than economic data, matters more than earnings data. It's the foundation for a sustained rebound from where we are. That said, of course, we've enjoyed a remarkable rebound over the last handful of months to the point where I hope investors are not getting complacent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the earnings today? We've got a Dow component Proctor &amp; Gamble this morning, which we are waiting on as well as health insurer Cigna, both reporting this morning. Then we had the technology giants on the hot seat yesterday, but Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet will report their earnings tonight. What has been your expectation or assessment of the earnings you've seen so far, and what to expect tonight?</p><p>LOWELL: We expect to see tech continue to exhibit strength. We expect to see healthcare to continue to exhibit strength and consumer staples. Those three themes have effectively been boosted by tailwinds from the pandemic, as opposed to other industries and sectors in the marketplace which obviously have been hammered by it. And we don't see anything in the medical data to suggest that those trends - consumer staples, tech, healthcare - are going to abate any anytime soon.</p><p>So we do think there's opportunity in this kind of marketplace, but for all those who are looking on the value stock side of the fence, saying that their valuations are so dramatically cheap, that they're a raging buy, we're not buying that. We think that's still a value trap. We still think you can let your tech winners run so long as they're counterbalance buys them good defensive bulwarks. In particular, we like, actively managed total bonds, so a whole suite of bonds.</p><p>We like cash reserves in our tactical portfolios. We're seeing evidence that gold, which obviously has been gaining dramatic momentum here is also something that the tactical models are intrigued about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright. So then you want to have a little exposure to gold, while you're also having exposure to the market as well as having some hedges. Let me get to Mark Tepper, what do you make of all of that, Mark?</p><p>TEPPER: Yes, so - I mean today's a big day, right? You've got four of the five biggest companies reporting today. And when you look at the five biggest companies in the S&amp;P, they make up over 20% of the market cap of the S&amp;P. So obviously as go the big boys, go the market typically.</p><p>But, what's interesting to me is that the market has been resilient. I mean, we're within 5% or so of hitting all-time highs despite all the economic speed bumps we've been hitting with economic re-openings and rolling them back. And then the big boys have been stalling out. So you look at the performance of Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, they've all underperformed the market since July 1st, yet the market continues to grind higher.</p><p>So that is pretty impressive to me. I agree with what Jim said. I don't think there's a lot of value in just buying the index right now. You need to look for specific opportunities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course, we heard from the Federal Reserve yesterday, giving the markets a boost, Steve Forbes, what was your take on that? Chairman Jay Powell said that the Central Bank will not raise rates, leaving them near zero. Powell added that the path to economic recovery is linked to the coronavirus response. We're talking about zero rates, Steve, until what? 2024, at least?</p><p>FORBES: Pick a date? Maybe 2124 (ph), the way things are going now. But I think it's very interesting in terms of the mention of gold, that's moving up. And if we start to get some inflationary pressures next year or weakening of the dollar, it would be very interesting to see how the Fed responds, because usually they try to slow the economy down when they see signs of that. They don't have that option this time. So I think there's more turbulence ahead than the markets realize in terms of what's going to happen with the dollar.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jim, what do you make of that? Any surprises from your standpoint from the Federal Reserve yesterday?</p><p>LOWELL: No, the fact that they are towing the line of not even thinking about raising rates and to Steve's point, 2024, certainly there's a lot of concern that this Fed has to be able to fend over the coming weeks and months, not just quarters and years. And we know that this market rebound is effectively based on Fed fiscal and what I'd call furlough stimulus. Those are three very weak legs for any economy, for any market to stand on.</p><p>So while we're thankful for the gains we've received, we think our job is going to be extremely difficult safeguarding those gains on a going forward basis, even as we will remain selective in terms of adding to opportunities where and when we see them, not just domestically, but certainly in Europe, which is absolutely beaten down for - mainly for the right reasons, but also globally, with particular regard to China and small mid cap stocks in the emerging markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, we will leave it there. Interesting to know, Europe. Yes, that the valuation is - a different story in Europe relative to the United States. Jim, it's good to see you. Thank you, sir. Jim Lowell, joining us there. We are just getting started this morning.</p><p>Coming up next hour, Florida Senator Rick Scott is here to talk about the latest on coronavirus and the stalled stimulus plan. Then Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz joining me on big techs' grilling on Capitol Hill. One of those big techs on the move this morning.</p><p>In the AML (ph), former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders is here to talk about the stalled stimulus talks and the conservative bias in social media.</p><p>Then from live to virtual, we are introducing you to a new streaming platform for concerts, all coming up right here. But first quick break, and then past due, the back rent is swelling in America as lawmakers offer no eviction relief. Then you've got questions, we've got some answers. Our new segment \"Ask the Panel\" begins next week. Send video question to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:maria@foxbusiness.com\">maria@foxbusiness.com</email> You are watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A heated back and forth on Capitol Hill yesterday, the CEOs of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet and Apple testified virtually facing tough questions from the House Judiciary Subcommittee about antitrust, privacy, anti-conservative bias. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Can you assure Americans today you won't tailor your features to help Joe Biden in the upcoming election.</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ALPHABET: We won't do any work to politically tilt anything one way or the other. It's against our core values, Congressman.</p><p>JORDAN: But you did it in 2016. In spite of the fact that you did it in 2016, President Trump won. I just want to make sure you're not going to do it again in 2020. I'll just cut to the chase, big techs out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact. The power these companies have to impact what happens during election, what American citizens get to see prior to their voting is pretty darn important.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): It is possible that at Facebook, your employees do have the power to disadvantage conservative viewpoints.</p><p>MARK ZUKERBERG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FACEBOOK: Of course, when you have tens of thousands of employees, people make mistakes. People have some of their own goals some of the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is The Federalist's Senior Editor Christopher Bedford, Chris, good to see you this morning, your reaction to what you saw yesterday.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: Good morning. I thought it was a good mixture of questions. I was surprised by the substance of the questions, where Democrats coming at it from an anti-monopoly point of view and worries about that, and Republicans bringing up the very important issue of censorship here.</p><p>The tech CEOs of course managed to not answer a lot, but at the same time, give us some interesting things. Google claims, for example, that the reason why the daily colors, traffic to search has flatlined since May 5 is because of a partnership with law enforcement to stop any election interference.</p><p>That does not pass the smell test at all. That seems either farcical or just not true at all. I was annoyed that we didn't see much criticism of China. Mark Zuckerberg was the only CEO willing to even say that there was data theft going on or technology theft going on. To see Tim Cook compliment Huawei, a spy agency for China, was a little disconcerting. But I was happy with the substance of the questions from both sides of Congress.</p><p>BARTIROMO: One analyst at accounting company this morning is telling his clients, heavy criticism of big tech gives regulators cover to file antitrust lawsuits against Google and Facebook. Do you believe antitrust lawsuits are coming?</p><p>BEDFORD: I think it's very likely. There's a huge appetite for it in Washington. Republicans who are traditionally the defenders of big business have felt extremely slighted and attacked and targeted by a lot of these companies in Silicon Valley, and Democrats have never really traditionally been an ally for big business against antitrust.</p><p>So they've managed to align both sides of the political spectrum in D.C. They don't usually agree on anything on the same side here against them. That usually means there's political will to get that kind of thing done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright. So in this report that I'm looking at from Paul Gallant at Cowen, heavy criticism gives regulators cover to file antitrust lawsuits against Google and Facebook. But he thinks, for Apple and Amazon, lawsuits remain unlikely. And Cicilline seemed to suggest that Amazon could actually be poised for a breakup. We'll be watching that. Dagen McDowell, jump in.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Chris, the root of any kind of antitrust bust-up is rooted in consumer benefit versus consumer detriment. And The Wall Street Journal in its editorial page writes about this, that big techs' antitrust paradox at the legal test for antitrust is consumer benefit, not size.</p><p>And in terms of benefit, I know that The Federalist has experienced this, that you're so reliant on Google's ad network that they can, if they see fit, de-platform you, demonetize you and essentially puts you out of business.</p><p>Nevertheless, The Federalist and the vast majority of online publications in this day and age literally couldn't exist without Google's ad network. Back in the first dot-com bubble, you couldn't afford to go out and hire an ad sales team to bring in enough money to stay afloat. I saw business after business topple because of that. But a site like The Federalist has basically sold part of yourself and your soul to Google just to exist.</p><p>BEDFORD: Well, The Federalist would have taken a hit for sure if we'd been cut out of the advertising network, but we would have survived because we have a diversity of different revenue inflows at The Federalist.</p><p>Some other sites would absolutely not survive, those that are responsible directly for Google's traffic. Google has this thing here where they've undercut a lot of the traditional ad sellers. So, when you used to go to a new site and be able to have an actual program that was bought - sold to that - bought by that news site or bought by the advertiser, looks attractive, is tailored to that new site and not to the consumer, it would usually load a lot faster and those are the old days of selling those.</p><p>Google would sell ads so much cheaper and using their wealth of information, target that information, that it was almost foolish to buy traditional ad campaigns. That drove a lot of that business out of business in general. And then it was only Google. It's a dangerous reliance they've created</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. You are an example of the impact. Chris, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>BEDFORD: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Christopher Bedford from The Federalist. Quick break and then more of yesterday's big tech hearing as the CEOs defend their business practices. That's right after this, stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): Why shouldn't Instagram now be broken up into a separate company?</p><p>ZUKERBERG: Well, Congressmen, I think the FTC had all of these documents and reviewed this and unanimously voted at the time not to challenge the acquisition. I mean I think with hindsight, it probably looks like obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today.</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Does Amazon ever access and use third party seller data when making business decisions?</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMAZON: I can't answer that question yes or no. What I can tell you is we have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business. But I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg facing questions over their business practices at yesterday's hearing. Steve Forbes, it wasn't just a focus on conservative bias. It was also antitrust. What did you make of it?</p><p>FORBES: Well, yes. And I think this underscores the fact that these big companies have not been very good at dealing with the criticisms. They've not done much to get a good public will. Maria, in the old days, the old AT&amp;T before it went out - it was a legal monopoly, went out of its way to make sure every complaint was dealt with. They went out of their way to assuage everyone, make everyone happy. And these people have displayed an arrogance that is coming back to bite them.</p><p>Consumers love the surfaces they have which is why those companies continue to do well. But politically, they've offended both sides. And when they've had the practices they shouldn't have done, they've been slow in responding to them. Looks like they tried to brush it aside.</p><p>And so they're going to get political trouble, whether it's Section 230, which shields them from liability of what appears on their platforms or something else. They're going to take a political hit and they brought it on themselves, not because of their overall performance, but because of their arrogance.</p><p>Now they responded to legitimate criticisms, whether it's Google not allowing Prager to have some of their lectures on YouTube, stupid things like that. They've been very, as Germans would say dummkopf on that and it's going to hurt them and it's going to hurt us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Mark Tepper, it was interesting to look at both sides because both sides of the aisle were mad at big tech and the Democrats were prepared. They were cutting people off just as much as the Republicans' anger over the censorship of conservative speech.</p><p>TEPPER: Yes, that's definitely been a big problem with social media in general. But if you think about it, we're fighting the wrong fight. I mean, we're fighting against Facebook, we're fighting against Twitter, we're not fighting against TikTok. And that's all my kids are on right now is TikTok, right?</p><p>That's the fight we should be fighting right now. But with regards to these companies, here's the defense for each of them. Amazon can say that they've lost some competitive edge during the crisis because a lot of consumers are opting for curbside pickups. You've got Walmart, Target, Shopify, Stamps.com, all those have been thriving.</p><p>Facebook and Google can say that they have proven to be the only option for small businesses to market their services and products because salespeople aren't going door to door, and then Apple, they're under fire because of their app store. But as far as I can see, their commission structure is completely transparent. So that in my opinion is the defence for each of these companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a great point. And by the way, both sides of the aisle have also asked the Attorney General to ban TikTok. So you're right about the TikTok issue, probably not enough upset about that.</p><p>A quick break, and then unrest in Portland. While the Oregon Governor says that federal agents are leaving, the administration says not so fast. We're going to take a look at what's happening there when we come back. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, July 30th. Let's take a look at markets here at 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast. We are looking at a pretty sizable decline.</p><p>At the start of trading this morning, the Dow Industrials down 234 points right now, the Nasdaq futures down 109 and the S&amp;P futures down 30 ahead of the second quarter GDP that is expected to show record-breaking declines for the quarter, 30-plus percent contraction, jobless claims also out this morning in 2 hours time, also impacting markets this morning.</p><p>We'll get that negative economic data as soon as it hits the table. Meanwhile, markets rallied yesterday following the Federal Reserve's decision and commentary from Jay Powell at the close yesterday. The DowIndustrials were up 160 points, the Nasdaq was up 140 and the S&amp;P was up 40 points. UPS, a stock to watch this morning, soaring on better-than-expected earnings, the shipping giant reporting strong demand because of the pandemic. The stock is up almost 10 percent on UBS checking -- UPS rather.</p><p>Checking global markets this morning, it is red across the board in Europe, European indices down across the board with the FTSE down 99, the CAC Quarante down 65, the Dax Index down 320 points right now as we learn that the German economy is shrinking a record 10.1 percent in the second quarter due to the coronavirus shutdowns. The economic data out of Germany impacting markets there.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower there as well, although here, you've got fractional moves pretty much across the board overnight in Asia. A severe tropical storm making landfall in Puerto Rico, making its way toward the United States, Cheryl Casone with the details on that now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST: That's right, Maria, and good morning to you. Isaias is the ninth-named storm of 2020, and what a name it is. The system formed yesterday over the Caribbean Sea, this storm is already battering Puerto Rico with heavy winds and rain and is expected to head towards Florida this weekend. Warnings have been issued for nearby islands and territories. Well, shares of Qualcomm are soaring in pre-market trading, a couple of pieces of news here, stock up almost 12 percent as you can see.</p><p>First, the company has reached a long-term patent deal with Huawei. We're moving a major legal clause that's been hanging over the company and the stock. Qualcomm is going to receive $1.8 billion from the settlement. Company's earnings also came in better-than-expected and company's forecasting higher-than-expected revenue for the third quarter. And here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.</p><p>PayPal reporting quarterly profits are up 86 percent, thanks to a shift to online spending amid of course, the COVID-19 pandemic. A home outside of Phoenix, Arizona just sold for $5.5 million, a lot of interest in this one because it set a record price in that community in Arizona. And then actress Lori Loughlin has sold her Bel Air mansion to Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen, sales price, $18.75 million. She's got a few legal bills, Maria, to cover. And those are your headlines from here, back over to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thanks so much. Meanwhile, we want to zero in on the unrest in Portland once again, a large group of U.S. border patrol agents moving in overnight, this despite the governor of Oregon saying yesterday that federal officers guarding the federal courthouse would be leaving by today. However, the Trump administration is insisting that some agents remain in the city in case they are needed and to defend that court building and federal buildings. President Trump weighed in on this yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look at the anarchists in Portland. If they don't solve that problem locally very soon, we're going send in the National Guard and get it solved very quickly, just like we did in Minneapolis and just like we will do in other places.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>They want to solve their problem, they've got a very short time to do it, but they'll need to solve their problem or we send in the National Guard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And in a separate effort, Operation Legend, the Justice Department will send officers to 3 cities, 25 officers to Milwaukee, 25 officers to Cleveland, 40 officers to Detroit. The operation is already underway in Kansas City, Chicago and Albuquerque. Joining me right now is former NYPD detective and Brosnan Risk Consultant CEO, Pat Brosnan. Pat, it's great to have you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>I've tried to differentiate --</p><p>PAT BROSNAN, FORMER NYPD DETECTIVE: Good morning --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's going on in Portland from what's going on in other cities because I know that the Secretary of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf told me that the situation in Portland is to defend the federal buildings. The court, for example, the other situations are unrest and violence for other reasons. What's your take on what's going on across the country, sir?</p><p>BROSNAN: Well, first off, let's start off -- I try to save my special designation for Mayor de Blasio which is titanically unaware. I tried to save that for him, but Kate Brown's comment that the federal officers brought violence to her community really forces me to make an exception, Maria, which I don't usually do. What you have here are riots --</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK --</p><p>BROSNAN: For fun and profit, that's what you see here. These are not mostly peaceful riots. There was 28 federal officers seriously injured as of July 22nd. This is anarchy as our great president astutely pointed out, and it is not ever to be misconstrued as protests or peaceful protests or demonstrations. And those are the facts, and we're seeing the same thing in all the other cities, and I ascribe it to what I call the 7 deadly sins, Maria, which is defunding of the police department, the desecration of a police department, the disinterest in prosecutors -- they don't want to bring the charges.</p><p>They're letting everybody escape, we're emptying the jails because of COVID, we're enacting bail reform, we're enacting diaphragm laws, and on top of it all, we're empowering the criminal. We are empowering and bolding --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So --</p><p>BROSNAN: The criminals, at the same time we're demeaning --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>BROSNAN: Desecrating and debasing law enforcement and the law enforcement officers and the rule of law. This is a perfect storm for criminality. It really is, and it's not the Summer of love I can tell you that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've got police in Oakland, California blocked by a judge from launching crowd control weapons like stinger grenades, rubber bullets and pepper balls. So, the cops really can't do their jobs, they don't have the tools that they should be. Meanwhile, in Portland, I mean, we are still waiting to hear the fate of two agents and their eyesight. Two agents actually may very well go blind forever, lose their eyesight because these anarchists that you're talking about were shooting lasers in their eyes.</p><p>What is supposed to be done about this, how do you deal with it, Pat, when the governor and the leadership of these cities will not allow their local police to fight back or to get involved?</p><p>BROSNAN: It's mind-bending, it really is and forgive me, but when I hear about the judges who are making these decisions, I don't know, are they cut from the Helen Keller mode? I mean, really, deaf, dumb, blind to what's going on to the violence that's rocking the country to the desecration of the rule of law. They will not give the police the tools with which to combat these riots that are really destroying the rule of law and diminishing the impact of law enforcement across the country.</p><p>I don't know how we reverse them, Maria. I was there for the rock and roll '80s in New York, I was a south Bronx robbery detective, I was a gun detective for a number of years. I was here when Rudy turned the law around in '93, I was actually one of his bodyguards. And the fact is, in a matter of weeks in New York City, de Blasio has unraveled two decades of extraordinary work, which just goes to show how quickly and how swiftly and decisively it can be unraveled.</p><p>New York City is the worst I've ever seen it, and I was here for the opening day of crack which was right around St. Patrick's Day actually, the high holy day and March of '85, but it's unbelievable, it's sad --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, one of the issues -- one of the issues is that the plainclothes men, right? I mean, the anti-crime stoppers who are plainclothes police officers he disbanded that in New York. So how significant do you think that move was --</p><p>BROSNAN: The height --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And again, what is your solution pact?</p><p>BROSNAN: The height -- the height, I'm sorry, the height of madness, Maria. The 600 men and women that were actually tasked with the duty and responsibility of legally removing illegal weapons from the bad guys, he cut them. Let's not do that. So -- and then with an unbelievable one-two punch, almost a week later, he takes 1.5 billion from policing and moves it into social service work. This is a one-two punch, the likes of which we haven't seen before.</p><p>I mean, there's no reason not for the bad guys to carry a gun in New York City because no one is searching them. The standard police officer on patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right --</p><p>BROSNAN: Is responding to 911 calls. The units that search them as you pointed out, the street-wide -- city-wide anti-crime units, they're disbanded. They're sitting behind desks --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right --</p><p>BROSNAN: In the headquarters -- or by the way, they're probably at the pension section --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right --</p><p>BROSNAN: Retiring because that's going on in record numbers as well --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>BROSNAN: Not surprisingly. You know, when a cop signs on, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, it really is, a lot of people -- a lot of people leaving the force, yes --</p><p>BROSNAN: And put their hand up, they didn't sign on for desecration. They didn't sign on for disrespect, and I've got to tell you, it's the worst that I've ever seen --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Pat, it's great to get your insight this morning, thanks so much. Pat Brosnan joining us there. Thanks for your service --</p><p>BROSNAN: My pleasure, thank you --</p><p>BARTIROMO: As well, we appreciate it. Coming up, past due, back rent swelling in America now as lawmakers offer no eviction relief. We are at a standstill now on stimulus. Then from in-person to virtual, we're introducing you to a new streaming platform for concerts, you are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, from the arena to virtual stages, live music is evolving in the era of COVID-19 like everything else. Dreamstage, a new premium ticketed live streaming platform launches today, allowing artists to perform before a global audience and get paid for it. Joining us right now is Dreamstage CEO and co-founder Thomas Hesse and artistic director and co-founder Jan Vogler, an artist himself. Great to have you, gentleman here, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>THOMAS HESSE, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DREAMSTAGE: Well, good morning, Maria.</p><p>JAN VOGLER, CO-FOUNDER &amp; ARTISTIC DIRECTOR, DREAMSTAGE: Good morning, nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This sounds like it's a great idea, Thomas, tell us more about the platform, how it works. I'm happy to see that you were able to come up with a solution in this extraordinary moment in time, Thomas.</p><p>HESSE: Yes, absolutely, the COVID pandemic has really destroyed the concert business, artists are suffering and we want to put them back to work. We -- you know, create these beautiful events where people have the ability to perform to their fans, it's high quality, it's streaming and super high quality, and it's in a beautiful virtual concert hall.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it sounds beautiful, Yon, what are the benefits for you as an artist to use this platform. Tell me how different it is for you as opposed to, you know, being in an incredible concert hall with thousands of people watching you, you're what? Alone or with a few people in the room, tell me about it?</p><p>VOGLER: Well, I think it's a new Zonra, a new art form, and I'm very excited to explore it, and I think artists want a beautiful place, a destination where they feel at home and Dreamstage will be that destination in the virtual world, and I feel it's overdue for us as artists to arrive in the 21st century. And this pandemic had to be horst in the catalyst to propel us into this world, and it's very necessary for us to explore now in order to connect with our fans and give pleasure to our audience.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How different does it feel for you, Jan, as an artist?</p><p>VOGLER: It's very different. I've done a couple of live-streams, 24-hour streams with your positions, and so it's nice to mention it on your program back in March. And I feel we can actually reach our audience extremely precisely because through social media and through the internet, we can reach our audience, so in a nice way, in a different way.</p><p>And it feels as -- when I play live for a camera, it feels just the same, my heart beat goes up and I feel the adrenaline kicking in. So it's actually an exciting way to perform --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fantastic. Well, I like the fact that you still get the adrenaline rush even though you're not looking at, you know, thousands of people in the audience. Thomas, let's talk about how you monetize this time as what are the prices for someone wanting to go to this virtual concert and how do you make money on this?</p><p>HESSE: The prices are between $15 and $30, some of the classical concerts we're launching with are 25, some other concerts, we're talking to some of the greatest stars in popular music will be probably around $20. We think it's amazing for the artists to be able to reach all their fans in this way, and from anywhere to anywhere. You know, fans worldwide and we will be making a lot of money for the artists who have been looking for this, they get the bulk of the revenue will go to the artists.</p><p>We will also share their contacts so that artists can reach their fans directly which I think is overdue. We're not standing in the middle between the artistes and the fans, we want to enable that. And so it's going to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's good point, yes --</p><p>HESSE: As comfortable for an artist, as playing between 5 and 15 in-person shows in real life. So we're really thinking it's going to be great for the artist.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is fantastic, we will check out the new streaming platform, gentlemen, congratulations, we'll be watching. Great news, we will check out --</p><p>HESSE: Thank you --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dreamstage's Box Office --</p><p>VOGLER: Thank you, Maria --</p><p>HESSE: Thank you, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Open today. Thomas Hesse and Jan Vogler, great to see you both, gentlemen. Coming up, CEOs, they're just like us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're on mute --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Bezos, I believe you're on mute.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Jeff Bezos' microphone blunder making a buzz this morning, we've got it when we come right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, he might be the world's richest man, but Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos facing some of the same tech issues that we've all faced during this pandemic. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bezos, you're on mute.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Bezos, I believe you're on mute.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: How many times has that happened to you? Richest man in all, but all the same as everybody else. Dagen, what do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that, that might be the only thing that he shares with every man and every woman, you know, snacking, he didn't get a question for the first two hours of the hearing, he was like snacking and then drinking, what? Coffee. But just know that his snack bars are made with honey from the tears of humming birds. I'm kidding.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Steve Forbes.</p><p>FORBES: Well, obviously, he didn't know how to use Alexa to get him through this thing or his kids weren't around to help him as I do at my house.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good one. Good one --</p><p>FORBES: And have these stack of issues, and with the snacking, I'm sure he was thinking of those politicians snacking on the politicians or the competition. And I'm glad that somebody could get something substantive of that hearing. So bless Mr. Bezos on that one --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and he was the one everybody was watching because he hasn't testified before, so people were really focused on him. All right, how about this Barbie for president. Mattel releasing her campaign team, the diverse collection includes a presidential candidate, campaign manager, fundraiser and voter. What do you think about this group, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Better than the Barbie I grew up with because my Barbie I shaved her head and dressed her in G.I. Joe's outfit. So this is an advancement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Finally, players and fans celebrating the return of baseball. Check this out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The video going viral, Mark, it's pretty good. What do you think?</p><p>TEPPER: It just makes me feel good, it makes me happy. I love baseball. I am so glad we're actually playing baseball right now. I've never watched so many Cleveland Indians games back-to-back-to-back at the beginning of a season. It's fantastic. Everyone out there is doing their best to adjust to this new normal. You've got fake fan sounds in the background, you've got this being done virtually, it's probably about as good as it gets, given the circumstances. So, I love it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we are all adapting to a new normal and a new reality for sure. All right, we'll slip in a break when we come back, big tech grilled on the Hill. What we learned from yesterday's hearing, it's all right here next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.

According to insiders I talked to, the companies all view their roles similarly: to keep existing products working even amid new demand, provide accurate information and fight misinformation, and to help in the broader fight against the coronavirus.What they're saying: \"We just realize the seriousness of the moment and the importance of getting it right at a moment when our services are really needed,\" Facebook VP Molly Cutler said in an interview. Cutler, who largely stays out of the media spotlight, leads Facebook's strategic response team, reporting to Sheryl Sandberg, and has been running the operations of its companywide virus response effort. </p><p>When you ask people at the companies, they say they want to help because it is the right thing to do. But many acknowledge they also hope that the public will start to see their companies they way they do.These companies start with central positions in our new, virus-transformed lives. Google's Search is where most people start their information hunts, and also plays a role in everything from video chatting to email and productivity software to entertainment (via YouTube).Facebook's core service lets people see what their friends are up to, while Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Live and Facebook Messenger each help replace in-person contact.Amazon delivers needed physical goods, and also digital entertainment through Prime Video, Audible and more.Apple's devices and apps are helping people get their work done and keep the kids entertained.Microsoft's shift to services over the past few years means that many workers can pick up at home where they left off at the office. Now the companies are pushing hard not just to connect isolated people but also to promote reliable information that's desperately needed. Facebook has been working[1] with the World Health Organization since last month, offering free advertising space in the home feed to promote accurate info.Google and YouTube are promoting information[2] from the CDC, WHO and New York Times when people enter virus-related searches.Google is also building some new websites[3] to handle coronavirus information, as you may have heard. Companies are also contributing to their communities, paying hourly workers[4] even when their on-site jobs can't be performed, and taking other public-minded measures. Yes, but: Despite these efforts, misinformation remains a constant problem. Already, Facebook-owned WhatsApp has been home to some harmful rumors, a longstanding challenge within private messaging systems. The big tech companies have announced they are working together[5] to promote quality information, but they have yet to offer many details on that effort.While trying to find ways to help, Google has found itself in a tough spot, with the White House repeatedly mischaracterizing and overstating its efforts[6]. On Tuesday, Facebook was also incorrectly flagging[7] coronavirus news stories and other accurate information as spam or violations of community standards, as the result of what the company said was a bug. The big companies also face the challenge of meeting the needs of the moment while also shorthanded themselves. Most are based in California and Washington, two states hard hit by the pandemic. Many of their workers are now also homeschool teachers and caregivers, while also trying to do their day jobs. Our thought bubble: Critics who have raised alarms about Big Tech's concentration of power, manipulation of attention and misuse of user data aren't likely to give up their analyses just because the firms pitched in during a public health crisis. Nonetheless, the companies suddenly have a new opening to burnish their public images and win some more hearts and minds.

They miss that the crisis is not good and not about tech. They miss that to whom much is given, much is expected. They miss how many other industries and companies have contributed and sacrificed during this crisis without expecting something in return. </p><p>Spontaneously this past week, a tech op-ed chorus broke out singing a new tune and tale, that the Coronavirus Crisis could benefit Big Tech and save it from much of the Techlash. Consider:Coronavirus gives Big Tech an opportunity to shine -Axios 3-18-20[2];Has the coronavirus killed the Techlash?Wired 3-20-20[3];Big Tech has the cash to expand after crisis, Regulatory threat also likely to recede for now,FT 3-20-20[4]; andWhat Techlash? Virus Could Remake Industry Giants Image, The Information3-23-20[5]. Like some catchy new tunes lyrics, these don't make sense. Why is the Coronavirus Crisis no cure for the Techlash? First, Americans strong bipartisan views undergird the Techlash in the U.S. Consider a recent Gallup poll of Americanspublished[6]3-11-20. It found 77% of Americans think Google, Facebook, and Amazon have too much power. 74% are very concerned about misinformation on the Internet. 68% are very concerned about the privacy of their personal data stored by the Internet platforms. 59% believe elected officials and candidates pay too little attention to Techlash issues. 60% believe Internet platforms do more to divide society, than to unite society (11%). And 47% believe Internet platforms create more problems than they solve, than solve more problems than they create (15%). Second, core 2020 election dynamics will continue to propel and sustain the Techlash. Ananalysis[7]of the 2016 U.S. electorate shows that Google, Facebook, and Amazon's tech libertarian values were at odds with ~96% of the 2016 American electorate's reported political values. Importantly, the dominant Internet platforms aren't outsiders. Their business as vacuums of inside information make them the insiders' insider, and the elites' elite. They are the most powerful political wing of 'the establishment,' that populists on both sides of the political spectrum are rejecting. This all makes the Techlash a strong populist political issue and means both parties believe that the election could hinge on who wins thepopulist vote[8]. Importantly, both parties greatly fear that Google and/or Facebook could take sides in the election and non-transparently abuse their dominant social intermediary positions to steer the election's outcome against them. Tellingly, every 2020 Presidential candidate, top congressional leader, and State Attorney General are part of the Techlash because dominant Internet platforms command extraordinary unaccountable and non-transparent power. As this crisis reminds, Google and Facebook are still allowing rampant Coronavirusmisinformation[9]on their platforms, misinformation that can be deadly. Third, the Techlash is broad, robust, serious, and lasting. The DOJ has beeninvestigating[10]Alphabet-Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft for potential anticompetitive behavior since July. U.S. Attorney General Barr recentlysaid[11]he expects to decide on whether to file a DOJ antitrust case against Alphabet-Google for suppressing competition by early summer. Last month, the FTC started a newreview[12]of Alphabet-Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft's unreviewed acquisitions over the last decade in search of anticompetitive patterns of behavior. The FTC continues to investigate whether Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were anticompetitive and hassignaled[13]that past acquisitions could be unwound, and Facebook broken up. FTC Chairman Simons recentlysignaled[14]the FTC's Facebook decision is near. The FTC isinvestigating[15]whether Amazon Marketplace is acting anticompetitively vis a vis the two million seller competitors that it hosts on its platform. Tellingly, Amazon faces a new class action Sherman monopolizationlawsuit[16]for price-fixing, and a newcomplaint[17]for tying its Marketplace and logistics services to force prices up. Amazon's recent Coronavirus Crisisdecision[18]to only deliver essential items, unilaterally has competitivelydisadvantaged[19]multitudes of Amazon seller competitors that heavily depend on Amazon's dominant Marketplace, logistics, and delivery services to be fair and transparent. Almost all State Attorneys General are part of antitrust probes into Google and Facebook. In Congress, both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees also are investigating them. At the same time, dominant Internet platforms are also using this crisis period as an opening to bombard the recentlyintroduced[20]EARN IT Act, a Senate bill that would make their Section 230 intermediary liability protections contingent on earning immunity by following best practices to prevent the exploitation of children. In short, the Coronavirus Crisis is no cure for the Techlash. That's because the Techlash is broad, robust, serious, populist, and lasting, and because this health crisis and governments' responses to it, are making dominant online platforms even more essential to consumers and society. ***Scott Cleland served as Deputy U.S. Coordinator for International Communications &amp; Information Policy in the George H.

The outbreak of coronavirus, such as the tsunami in Japan and the floods in Thailand in 2011 that hit auto and electronics companies, or the 1999 earthquake in Taiwan that paralyzed the semiconductor industry, have shown us how vulnerable the highly interconnected global supply chains.</p><p><br/>This time, the trigger is an epidemic that originated in China, which remains the factory in the world and the second largest economy. It comes at a time of uncertainty in American politics, and we are in the midst of what Ray Dalio, the founder of the Bridgewater hedge fund, calls a \"paradigm shift\" for both markets and economies. This is a new era in which a few of the old rules will apply.<br/>Last week, Goldman Sachs warned investors not to expect us to expect us to grow profits from Us companies by this year, mostly because of the growing impact of the virus. However, I wonder how much profit growth can be expected in large corporations even after the contagions run out and the results of The November uses' US presidential election are known.<br/>In this new and unstable era, the main forces that pushed profit margins over the past 40 years\u2014globalization, increased concentration of companies, the lowest tax burden for companies but not for workers, and the largest portion of wealth for companies and not for employees\u2014they face adverse factors.<br/>The substantial margins obtained by today's highly optimized and complex multinationals depend heavily on their ability to manufacture in China, sell in the U.S. and Europe, and accumulate wealth wherever they are most convenient, particularly in favourable tax destinations such as Hong Kong, Dublin or the Cayman Islands.<br/>As Gavekal founding partner Charles Gave said in a note to customers last week, these companies were perfected and are as efficient as English rugby player Manu Tuilagi. \"However, as England fans well know, the problem with Tuilagi is that as a result of his injuries he can hardly ever wear the white shirt. The more optimized a system is, the more fragile it could become.\"<br/>I wonder years ago when the fragility of complex global multinationals will force them to change their business models, and I think we have reached that point. I believe the coronavirus will accelerate the decoupling of the economic ecosystems of the U.S. and China, so it will increase regionalization and production localization. That could give rise to \"less efficient but more resilient supply chains,\" says Mike Pyle, chief global investment strategist at BlackRock. He also believes that the trend towards decoupling and deglobalization will accelerate as a result of the virus.<br/>If decoupling continues, multinational companies will have to make costly decisions about labor, productivity and transportation in order to disassociate themselves from China. That's something many investors have, given that the two potential winners of the U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders (whom many now consider the Democratic favorite), believe that greater nationalism would be positive Economic.<br/>Sanders and many other Democrats would also like to reduce the concentration of businesses, which helps raise margins but reduced government tax collection, worker stake in revenue, and competition. Many on both sides of the spectrumAmerican politicians (not to mention in Europe) would be happy to curb the power of the big tech companies\u2014 which are responsible for most of the S&amp;P; 500\u2014for a variety of policy reasons, from national security and competition to privacy and tax justice.<br/>The fiscal policy of \"impoverishing the neighbor\" (to which the U.S. surrendered in 2017 with Trump's tax cuts and regulatory changes) reinforced companies' margins for decades. But that also seems to be changing: some European countries are taxing tech giants, the OECD is pressuring member states to collaborate with new digital tax rules, and states like California are looking at strategies like a digital dividend tax. In a world where populists gain influence, I find it hard to imagine that they will not raise corporate taxes or workers' share of income.<br/>Meanwhile, the spectre of slower growth, or even a recession by November, increases the chances of Sanders being elected president. Even if Trump is re-elected or the Fed approves further quantitative easing, I doubt that American companies' profit margins will return to the levels close to where they have been in recent years.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-11087687</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBG-X7N1-DY1R-B0J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 2, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Since its underwhelming stock market listing last year, it has been looking for ways to rationalise its services and stem the outflow.</p><p>The pandemic has provided the perfect backdrop. It may have undermined demand for ride-hailing, but it has also forced a reckoning for Uber\u2019s cash-strapped rivals and is already leading to the kind of consolidation that might otherwise have taken years. Armed with a strong balance sheet from what now looks like a well-timed IPO, Uber has not been wasting time.</p><p>Last week the focus was on scooters. As lead investor, Uber arranged the cash injection needed to keep rival Lime afloat. Merging its own scooter operation into Lime and supplying new leadership for the company means it has gone some way to rationalising the fragmented scooter business in the US, at the same time giving it a foot in the door with more localities.</p><p>This week, attention has shifted to food delivery. The proposed merger of Uber Eats with Grubhub, combining the number two and three players in the market in the US, would solve a big problem for both. Food delivery has been the main cause of Uber\u2019s cash burn, as it is forced into the same expensive subsidy game that once occurred in ride-hailing. The fierce competition has also left a dark cloud over Grubhub, which was one of the first to use the internet to help local restaurants find more business. Grubhub\u2019s cash profit margins have already slipped from the mid-20s three years ago to 14 per cent last year, and are expected to hit 4 per cent in 2020.</p><p>If this market in the US turns into a two-horse race with current market-leader DoorDash, it will doubtless bring an easing of the subsidy wars and go a long way to silencing the Uber sceptics.</p><p>Another activity that has become a cash drain for Uber also looks to be facing some consolidation, though the company has yet to show its hand. Driverless cars could be the future of ride-hailing networks, but for now the technology is an expensive diversion.</p><p>On top of previous technology delays, the health crisis is making it harder to test autonomous vehicles and pushing the era of robotaxis further into the future. Under pressure to channel management attention and financial reserves in the challenging period ahead, companies such as Uber \u2014 and their investors \u2014 are now likely to be thinking hard about whether they can stay the course.</p><p>Waymo, the Alphabet driverless car unit, has just lifted its fundraising to $3bn \u2014 while Zoox, one of the best-funded start-ups in the field, has reached a crossroads, as it considers a possible sale as well as another fundraising to back its proposed shared rides service.</p><p>Local authorities will eventually play a central role in deciding how services like this take shape on city streets. It may be too soon for driverless cars \u2014 but in home delivery, their influence is key.</p><p>The 15 per cent cap San Francisco has placed on food delivery services during the crisis highlights what is at stake. As delivery markets consolidate, there will be good reason to make measures like these permanent, as cities look both to protect their homebound residents and try to support their battered local restaurants.</p><p>As with the development of ride-hailing, this is likely to lead to confrontation and messy compromises. San Francisco\u2019s fee cap, for instance, led Uber Eats to stop delivering to the outlying area of Treasure Island, prompting a backlash over claims that it was cherry picking the most profitable parts of the market.</p><p>A more coherent alternative to this rough-and-ready way of marrying the interests of bottom-up innovation and city-level priorities would be to bring the tech companies and local authorities together at an earlier stage to plan the best way forward. But one vision of how that might work has just hit the skids.</p><p>The Alphabet \u201csmart city\u201d subsidiary Sidewalk Labs last week abandoned an ambitious plan for a greenfield development in Toronto that was meant to represent the ultimate in tech-enabled city life. The project\u2019s leaders blamed the extreme economic uncertainty for the failure. But it already looked to be on the rocks, the victim of both Big Tech hubris and thorny local politics.</p><p>With grand plans like this a distant dream, a battle in the streets remains the main way that the future of local services will be determined. This is the kind of warfare that Uber once thrived at. How the new, more civic-minded version of the company tries to drive home its relative advantage has yet to be seen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-662aa5dd4e8f4957ae7f669f6b6c127d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX2-7711-DXP9-94VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 15, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Mergers &amp;

The study, published by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee, comes amid claims such as cocaine being a cure for the virus and 5G networks helping to spread the disease.   Other damaging misinformation includes false \"remedies\", including a message forwarded many times about a soup made from herbs that could prevent COVID-19.   Chair of the committee, Julian Knight, told Sky News: \"We've heard from healthcare workers on the front line who have reported quite serious incidents of people who've ingested bleach and other chemicals.   \"We need a regulator that's able to effectively go to the social media companies...and be able to say to them: 'If you do not follow correct procedures if you're failing in your duty of care to your customers I'm afraid you're going to face fines or even more serious sanctions'.\"   The false claims linking 5G networks to the virus led to several arson attacks on phone masts and some engineers became targets for abuse.   Dave Snowdon works for Openreach in Birmingham and first heard about the conspiracy theory when two men approached his van.   \"I wound the window down and immediately they said: 'Are you working on the 5G network? You aren't anything to do with 5G masts?'.   \"And then he said: 'You best not be or there'll be trouble' in strong language, kicked the door of the van, and then knocked the mirror out of the side door, got in the car and sped off.\"   The director of the Oxford Internet Institute, Professor Philip Howard, contributed to the committee's report and said most misinformation about COVID-19 came from one of two sources.   He told Sky News: \"The first is state-backed media agencies in Russia and China and their goal is just to present misinformation about how their governments are dealing with the crisis and how democracies are weak and unable to adequately protect their citizens.   \"The second source is just people who want to make money.\"   MPs have called on the government to publish draft legislation on social media in the autumn.   Mr Knight said: \"Evidence that tech companies were able to benefit from the monetisation of false information and allowed others to do so is shocking. We need robust regulation to hold these companies to account.   \"The coronavirus crisis has demonstrated that without due weight of the law, social media companies have no incentive to consider a duty of care to those who use their services.\"    The committee has also said the final decision on a regulator should be made.   Earlier this year the government said it was \"minded\" to appoint Ofcom but had not yet confirmed that decision.   Jo Stevens, Labour's shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary, said: \"The pandemic has reinforced just how dangerous misinformation can be - with serious consequences for people's health. But despite consecutive Conservative governments knowing about the problem of misinformation for years, this report lays bare that once again the government has been slow to act.   \"It has been more than 15 months since the promised online harms legislation, and the select committee shares our concerns that this long overdue legislation puts safeguarding profits of the big tech platforms before public safety.\"   A DCMS spokesperson said: \"We are developing world-leading plans to put a duty of care on online platforms towards their users and will introduce legislation as soon as possible.   \"Since the start of the pandemic, specialist government units have been working around the clock to identify and rebut false information about coronavirus. We are also working closely with social media platforms to help them identify and remove incorrect claims about the virus that could endanger people's health.\"         \u00a9 Sky News 2020</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42645754109</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DB-FFY1-JCSC-J406-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Channel 103</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Jersey</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUxNjJDMEQ5N0YwNDMzM0JDMjEzM0UzOTYzMzI3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjYzNTE0RkM2QzIxNDg4MzhEMjFGREVEM0ZCQUM2RDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUE4ODNBQkNCRDczNEQ1QzhCOEU1REIxNjhEN0Q0Qjk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

It also believes the legislation would create a regulator that can hand out GDPR equivalent fines, give the regulator robust powers to investigate companies and request information and create a culture of transparency by legally compelling tech firms to disclose any breaches of the duty of care and major design changes to their platforms.</p><p>Responding to the NSPCC's concerns a Facebook spokesman said: \"There is no place for grooming or child exploitation on our platforms and we use technology to proactively find and quickly remove it.</p><p>\"We have a content and security team of over 35,000 people investigating reports from our community and working to keep our platforms safe.</p><p>\"Our teams also work closely with child protection experts and law enforcement, reporting content directly to specialists such as CEOP (Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command) and NCMEC (National Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children).\"</p><p>Commenting on the number of sexual communication with a child offences which have been recorded in the county, a Lancashire Police spokesman said: \"Lancashire Constabulary is committed to preventing child sexual abuse, helping victims and bringing offenders to justice. It is a crime that can affect any child, anytime, anywhere - regardless of their social or ethnic background.</p><p>\"Anyone with concerns about child sexual exploitation can contact police on 101.

The three companies have a chance to burnish their images amid intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee, who accuse the companies of engaging in anti-competitive behavior[3] by using their clout to defend market share or expand into adjacent markets. Washington lawmakers from both parties regularly attack the companies with a broad range of accusations, from doing too little to protect children to aiding hucksters who use the coronavirus outbreak to rip people off. But the coronavirus pandemic has offered the companies, all of whom hold sizable cash reserves and have an outsized capacity to influence American lives, a chance to play the role of savior while casting aside the image of profiteering data usurpers. 'I'm glad that they're willing to help,' Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican, said of Google's efforts to develop screening mechanisms for the virus. 'I hope that they're actually helping and not using this as an opportunity to drum up business.' </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vbtransform.com/Facebook\">https://www.vbtransform.com/Facebook</url> was the latest company to announce it wanted to help limit the economic damage from the coronavirus on Tuesday when it said it would give $100 million in cash grants and ad credits[4] to up to 30,000 small businesses in over 30 countries. Alphabet's Google was first out of the gate late last week, receiving high praise from President Donald Trump for developing a website[5] to help speed up the process of finding who needs a coronavirus test. Then Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos has been in regular contact with White House staff in recent days, said on Monday it would hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States to deal with a surge in online orders. Amazon also said it would add $2 to its minimum $15 per hour to U.S. workers' wages through April. Scott Wallsten, president of the Technology Policy Institute, which counts all three companies among its members, said the current environment offers an opportunity to reset how people think about technology companies and will 'add a new dimension' to the debate on how big tech hurts competition. Bhaskar Chakravorti, Dean of Global Business at The Fletcher School, Tufts University, who has been tracking the effects of digital technology on issues such as global health and economic development, said the focus has shifted to how big technology companies are stepping up to fight misinformation and facilitating a 'socially distant economy.' 'We're not just getting information about the public health situation but we are trying to replicate some semblance of business online with their help,' he said.

The three companies have a chance to burnish their images amid intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee, who accuse the companies of engaging in anti-competitive behavior by using their clout to defend market share or expand into adjacent markets. Washington lawmakers from both parties regularly attack the companies with a broad range of accusations, from doing too little to protect children to aiding hucksters who use the coronavirus outbreak to rip people off. </p><p>But the coronavirus pandemic has offered the companies, all of whom hold sizable cash reserves and have an outsized capacity to influence American lives, a chance to play the role of savior while casting aside the image of profiteering data usurpers. \"I'm glad that they're willing to help,\" Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican, said of Google's efforts to develop screening mechanisms for the virus. \"I hope that they're actually helping and not using this as an opportunity to drum up business.\" Facebook Inc was the latest company to announce it wanted to help limit the economic damage from the coronavirus on Tuesday when it said it would give US$100 million in cash grants and ad credits to up to 30,000 small businesses in over 30 countries. Alphabet Inc's Google was first out of the gate late last week, receiving high praise from President Donald Trump for developing a website to help speed up the process of finding who needs a coronavirus test. Then Amazon.com Inc, whose founder Jeff Bezos has been in regular contact with White House staff in recent days, said on Monday it would hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States to deal with a surge in online orders. Amazon also said it would add US$2 to its minimum US$15 per hour to U.S. workers' wages through April. Scott Wallsten, president of the Technology Policy Institute, which counts all three companies among its members, said the current environment offers an opportunity to reset how people think about technology companies and will \"add a new dimension\" to the debate on how big tech hurts competition. Bhaskar Chakravorti, Dean of Global Business at The Fletcher School, Tufts University, who has been tracking the effects of digital technology on issues such as global health and economic development, said the focus has shifted to how big technology companies are stepping up to fight misinformation and facilitating a \"socially distant economy.\" \"We're not just getting information about the public health situation but we are trying to replicate some semblance of business online with their help,\" he said.

And this is YOUR WORLD.</p><p>And what in the world is going on with so many fast-moving developments, a lot of shouting going on in Capitol Hill with some of the richest people on the planet. More on than that in a second.</p><p>To the president who now is saying, you know, if not for me, this energy independence we're enjoying now as a nation could all go away.</p><p>David Spunt right now in Midland, Texas, with more on what the president plans to say -- sir.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, good afternoon.</p><p>President Trump on his way right now to this Double Eagle Energy rig. He's going to be here to give a speech after he takes a tour. It feels somewhat like a campaign rally, Elton John blasting in the background right now.</p><p>President Trump will take the stage in about 20 minutes. But, Neil, the Permian Basin, where I am right now in Midland, it is suffering tremendously, many people out of work. Many of those pump jacks normally moving at a fast clip are just sitting still and collecting dust.</p><p>Earlier, Neil, this morning, I had a chance to take a tour with a local CEO of one of the oil rigs that has just been sitting there for several months. Neil, oil prices just a few months ago for a very brief period, as you know, traded in the negative, very scary for many people.</p><p>The president today will tout his plan to ease regulations on oil permits.</p><p>I spoke with Trent Latshaw. He's the CEO of Latshaw Drilling based in Tulsa. He has 41 rigs across Texas and Oklahoma. He said he's laid off more than 300 people in a matter of just a couple of weeks. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRENT LATSHAW, CEO, LATSHAW DRILLING: I have been in the industry for 47 years now, had my own company for 40 years. And this is my seventh cycle downturn that I have seen. And I'd have to say this is probably the worst one I have seen so far.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SPUNT: Neil, another part of the president's trip, a fund-raiser in Odessa, where he just left, about a 30-minute drive.</p><p>Democrats say the president's fund-raiser is a sign Texas may be in play this November as a purple state. Members of the Trump campaign team, they're confident Texas is going to stay ruby red.</p><p>Someone who will not be here Neil, Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert. He was supposed to be on Air Force One, but if you're near the president or expected to fly on Air Force One, you get a test, no exceptions, results in 15 minutes. Gohmert tested positive this morning. He did not board Air Force One.</p><p>He is rarely seen with a mask around Capitol Hill. He was walking the halls yesterday, before and after hearing with Attorney General Bill Barr. A spokeswoman for the attorney general told me yesterday -- or told me today that the attorney general will actually be tested as a precaution.</p><p>Gohmert, though, said -- told a local news station in Texas he's going to quarantine for 10 days. And he believes that a mask is a personal freedom decision.</p><p>We have some video of the motorcade, dozens and dozens of cars lined up along the local highway here. It takes about 10, 15 minutes from downtown Midland to get out here. Cell service is spotty, but people are out here in the heat ready to see President Trump.</p><p>Neil, he takes the stage in about 20, 25 minutes after he takes a tour of that energy oil rig. And the main theme today is easing restrictions on permits, deregulations, making oil and gas permitting a lot easier. That is welcome, welcome news for many people in the crowd here today -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, good luck putting up with the heat, my friend, David Spunt following all of that in Texas.</p><p>In the meantime, there's not much the parties can agree on when it comes to stimulus and all this, but here's where they were united, Democrats and Republicans going after four of the richest guys on the planet.</p><p>Today, we had the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Alphabet all getting a grilling by Republicans and Democrats alike. You don't often see that. But both parties have problems with all of these guys. And it was reflected front and center in some fiery testimony.</p><p>Gillian Turner following all of it from Capitol.</p><p>Hey, Gillian.</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>So, according to sources here on Capitol Hill, this epic, monster hearing was about two years in the making, and it kicked off with a fiery start. Jim Jordan went straight for the heart of the issue that conservatives have been wanting to grill these big tech CEOs about for a long time. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): We all think the free market is great. We think competition is great.</p><p>We love the fact that these are American companies. But what's not great is censoring people, censoring conservatives and trying to impact elections. And if it doesn't end, there has to be consequences. There have to be consequences.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: All four of the CEOs testifying today have faced criticism for being biased against conservatives, Google's Sundar Pichai, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Now, Zuckerberg pushed back hard against the accusation. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, FACEBOOK: Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas. We have distinguished ourselves as one of the companies that defends free expression the most.</p><p>We do not want to become the arbiters of truth. I think that that would be a bad position for us to be in and not what we should be doing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: Neil, in a really fiery exchange just a few moments ago, Jim Jordan pushed really hard against Sundar Pichai of Google. He put him on the firing line.</p><p>He asked him, is Google -- this is a quote -- \"Is Google going to help Joe Biden in the 2020 election?\"</p><p>Now, Pichai kind of hemmed and hawed, tried to not answer the question for a moment. But, eventually, he did say, you have my commitment we will not try and help Joe Biden win the 2020 election. It was a great moment.</p><p>CAVUTO: And a lot of fiery moments, at that.</p><p>Thank you, Gillian, very, very much, Gillian Turner on all of that.</p><p>Just to put it into perspective before we get to our next story here, if you take the combined net worth of Jeff Bezos, at about $180 billion, $88 billion for the Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, couple of billion each for Tim Cook and Pichai certainly of Google, you're talking almost $300 billion. That's the GDP of a lot of countries, all being queried on the Hill today.</p><p>We will update that, but it comes at a time when all their stocks are racing.</p><p>So, I wonder if the market is thinking all of this is Kabuki theater and nothing's going to come of it. We just don't know. But we're following it very, very closely on a day the Dow advanced 161 points. Technology had a big lot to do with that.</p><p>But, in the meantime, area of agreement stops when it comes to going after tech titans between the parties, because, when it comes to more stimulus being designed by the parties, they are miles apart, or, should I say, trillions of dollars apart?</p><p>And even within each party, there are differences, but more so among Republicans.</p><p>Chad Pergram following that drama -- Chad.</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good afternoon, Neil.</p><p>Well, they're kind of at a standoff right now. And the good news is, is that they're talking, the secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, and the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. They're in with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, right now.</p><p>But this is something that Mark Meadows said just a few minutes ago, going into the meeting -- quote -- he says that: \"Pelosi and Schumer are more entrenched than they were just a week ago. I'm not optimistic that we will reach any kind of a comprehensive deal.\"</p><p>Now, there's a lot of dissension, there's a lot of dissonance on the Republican side of the aisle. Listen to Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): I didn't know it was in the bill. I dug it out myself. I'm embarrassed about it.</p><p>This is supposed to be a coronavirus bill.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: Now, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, is underscoring the GOP division.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D-NY): They can't even get their act together to produce a halfway legitimate legislative proposal.</p><p>We all witnessed a week-and-a-half of infighting on the Republican side, as the country careened towards several cliffs created by Republican delay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: Now, Senate Republicans, they balked at the plan put forth by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, just a couple of days ago. Again, that's that dissonance.</p><p>And so Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, he says that he is going to try to write his own bill with Democrats and Republicans. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): We're not going to get every Democrat to vote for the Senate bill, because a lot of Republicans won't vote for it.</p><p>I think there's going to be close to half the conference will find a reason not to vote for any more packages. We're at war.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: Now, at the end of the day here, this bill is going to need Democratic votes to pass.</p><p>And there's a reason why Meadows and Mnuchin are spending so much time with the speaker of the House. They have to have those Democratic votes, despite what Meadows said a few minutes ago.</p><p>And if they're going to pass a bill, it's probably going to be a unique combination of Democrats and Republicans coming together. Neil, there's a little bit of chatter here on Capitol Hill in the past couple of hours about trying to do a bridge bill, an interim bill, because of these unemployment benefits, which expire at the end of the week.</p><p>That's something that Marco Rubio, the Republican senator from Florida, has advocated. but Meadows said that it doesn't seem like the Democrats are there and would be willing to do that -- back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you, my friend, very, very much, Chad Pergram.</p><p>As he was wrapping up that report, we're getting word right now that Vice President Pence is saying that the president will be making his RNC speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, after all.</p><p>As you know, the Republicans had sort of bifurcated their planned convention, with the big part of it supposedly going to Jacksonville, Florida. Then the president nixed those plans with the rise in cases there.</p><p>Our John Roberts reporting right now -- again, this coming from the vice president -- that the president will make the RNC speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, after all. So, we will keep track of that.</p><p>Also keeping track of these fast-moving developments with a fair and balanced view on the stimulus measure, first with Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, coming up after him, Democratic Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Senator, very good to see you, first off.</p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN (R-OH): Neil, thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: First of all, I know I'm just hitting you with this, Senator. That is, the president will make his speech in Charlotte after all.</p><p>What do you think of this?</p><p>PORTMAN: Well, I think it's great.</p><p>I mean, I saw yesterday in the press conference he hinted at it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>PORTMAN: And I think conventions are important. I think it'll be mostly virtual and remote. And that's probably appropriate.</p><p>But it's good he's going to Charlotte. I don't think there will be a lot of people there, is what I understand. It's more a made-for-TV moment. So, good for FOX News.</p><p>CAVUTO: Let me ask you a little bit, separately, about the stimulus measure.</p><p>The president, we just mentioned him and this planned speech. He might touch on it in Odessa, Texas, where he will be speaking soon. He's not a fan of what Republicans are kicking around regarding stimulus.</p><p>And I'm wondering what -- what's got his goat. Do you know what the issue is for him, how much of a problem that could be for Republicans?</p><p>PORTMAN: Well, I think he's supportive.</p><p>I mean, I just got out of a meeting with Secretary Mnuchin and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. And they're trying to help come up with a compromise here between Republicans and Democrats. And we have to have a compromise, because it takes 60 votes in the Senate. We have only got 53 Republicans, and, of course, the House is controlled by the Democrats.</p><p>So this has got to be a matter of, as we did last time, finding common ground. And I think the proposal that Mitch McConnell put out yesterday is a good start, actually. It addresses a lot of the issues that Democrats and Republicans alike think are important.</p><p>It actually has a $1,200 check, $2,400 for a couple. So, this is the stimulus checks that have gone out once before. That's very popular among Democrats. It also has a lot of help for the schools. In fact, the $105 billion for education is comparable to what the Democrats put in their proposal, although the proposal itself is more than three times as big.</p><p>On the school funding part, Republicans are right up there. So there's there's a lot in there to like. There's also provisions in there to ensure we don't go off the cliff in terms of the $600 unemployment insurance.</p><p>Right now, there's an extra $600 put in by the federal government, on top of the state benefit. Most people believe that that's creating a disincentive to work, because you're paying roughly 68 percent of the people more on unemployment insurance than they can make at their work.</p><p>But I think there's also a sense that needs to be something that continues, but at a lesser level. So, that's what the Republican proposal has. It's 70 percent of your wages would be covered, which is better than what the states generally have.</p><p>In most states, it's somewhere around 50 percent, some less, some more. So, I think it's a good starting point, Neil. And I hope we can get there.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I guess, wasn't the issue, Senator, that you would be waiting around for that to be resolved, right, and that this could put people in limbo?</p><p>Is it your sense that the $600 weekly benefit, scheduled to stop the end of this week, will indeed stop? From there on, it might be $200. I know Mitt Romney had talked about taking it down by $200 every 30 days until this is all resolved. Where are you on this?</p><p>PORTMAN: Yes, I think there needs to be a lessening of the $600, because it's not good for anybody. It's not good for the workers who are not reconnecting with their businesses, because, in some cases, lower-income folks, the bottom 20 percent, maybe they can make twice as much on unemployment insurance as they can going back to work.</p><p>So I'm hearing a lot from small businesses and from larger and midsize businesses and from nonprofits. Yesterday, I heard from someone who helps the development -- developmentally disabled in Ohio saying they can't get their workers back.</p><p>So, I mean, I think we need to lower it to a number that gives people help during this tough time, because unemployment is still relatively high, and because some businesses have not reopened because of COVID-19. So I think we need to provide the help.</p><p>And I do think that money is being spent also, which is not bad for the economy. But it can't be so much, Neil, that it creates that disincentive.</p><p>You and I have talked before about my idea of saying, OK, if it's going to be at that level, then let's be sure and have a return-to-work bonus, so that an individual can take some of that federal benefit with them back to work for a period of time.</p><p>Our proposal is six weeks. We think that would help to also deal with this issue of not creating a disincentive to get people back to work.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>All right, Senator, we will watch it closely, as the drama unfolds, Senator Rob Portman of the state of Ohio.</p><p>PORTMAN: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Fair and balanced, right now to Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, who joins us right now.</p><p>Senator, very good to have you.</p><p>SEN. BOB CASEY (D-PA): Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: How important do you think this unemployment benefit issue is going to be?</p><p>Are you in the camp of Democrats who says, keep the $600 weekly checks coming right through the end of the year?</p><p>CASEY: Yes. And I think the House made the right determination on that, Neil.</p><p>Look, I know there's been a narrative -- and I think it's a lot of mythology -- that somehow there's a disincentive here.</p><p>But Brookings, a respected think tank, studied this, found no evidence. I have in my hand here just the Washington Center for Equitable Growth says, lack of -- lack of opportunities to work is not a disincentive to work, and it's not keeping employment -- unemployment levels high.</p><p>Look, the main problem we got here is that we have got the worst -- the worst public health crisis in 100 years, the worst economy in about 75 years.</p><p>I live in a state where, in the Great Recession, even in the bad recession of the early '80s, unemployment numbers never hit even 11 percent. We have been at 13 percent now two months in a row, and unemployment is still a huge problem.</p><p>There are lots of ways to continue to jump-start the economy. Cutting the - - wiping out these unemployment benefits is not the way to do that. And when you remove two-thirds of it, you're harming a lot of people who have had a real tough time in this -- in the downturn.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator, the president is in Odessa, Texas. He will be speaking there very soon. He's talking about energy independence.</p><p>And he says that, if -- he's said this in the past as well -- that, if Joe Biden gets elected, you can kiss all that goodbye, as well as the markets and the economy and all of that.</p><p>When you hear that, what do you think of that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CASEY: Well, when the president says it, I have lots of doubts. Let's just be -- let's deal in understatement for a moment.</p><p>But, look, the argument that he's been making against Joe Biden on energy is just -- is full of holes. Everyone knows that Joe Biden is going to have an EPA administrator who's going to be enforcing the environmental laws. There's no question about that.</p><p>But he's also going to be investing in energy strategies, clean energy strategies, that will not only create a lot of jobs and move our energy portfolio forward, but will also, at the same time, be consistent with the challenges we face on keeping the environment clean, and making sure we're dealing with climate change, which we can't continue to ignore.</p><p>I think the president has been searching for an argument against Joe Biden, and he's having real trouble.</p><p>CAVUTO: Real quickly, you have heard about the dust-up over the way Senator Biden kind of sneaks out, Republicans say, of his little man cave, makes a speech, takes a reporter's questions, disappears again.</p><p>They say that that might be playing it safe, but it's going to guarantee he loses. What do you -- what do you take and make of that strategy?</p><p>CASEY: Well, Neil, I think you know the state of Pennsylvania pretty well, and you know the region that I live in, Northeastern Pennsylvania. People are not buying that.</p><p>And these are -- these are parts of the state, the Northeast and the Southwest, where the president did extraordinarily well, even among Democrats, last time. It's not working this time, because people know Joe Biden. They know his character. They know his decency.</p><p>And they're hearing more and more, as weeks go by now. He's in his fourth week of outlining an economic plan, Build Back Better. And people are hearing that. They're watching his speeches, when he talks about the economy with great detail, and then taking questions.</p><p>So I don't -- I don't think it's really working. I realize the president keeps going back to it, but I think what people are looking for in the middle of this pandemic, where are a lot of people are dying and a lot of people have been sick -- 151,000 people are dead -- and I would note, for that, 40 percent of them in nursing homes, which we should address in this next bill.</p><p>But they want a leader who's going to give them a game plan for how to deal with the virus and how to create and retain jobs. Joe Biden is doing that. He put out ideas about how to deal with this pandemic in January.</p><p>If the president listened to his outline of a strategy then, we'd be in better shape.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>CASEY: So, that's what people are looking for.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. I thought you were going to give us a FOX News Alert and say you are not going to support Joe Biden and instead go to the president.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: That was not what I heard.</p><p>So, Senator, always good having you. Continued good health. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>CASEY: Thanks, Neil. Same to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator Bob Casey of the beautiful state of Pennsylvania.</p><p>You know, they're all beautiful. Pennsylvania is a -- it just -- it's just such a great state.</p><p>All right, we have a lot more coming up for you here. We told you about the big gain we had at the corner of Wall and Broad. I told you about the stimulus fighting back and forth and how that's going.</p><p>Told you about how the president is planning to talk about how -- the wind that is at his back right down and at the economy's back, the energy independence we have. But can energy independence go a little too far, and can prices drag so low that it boomerangs on us?</p><p>Maybe the president touches on that in the Lone Star State -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will be hearing from the president of the United States very shortly. He's in Odessa, Texas.</p><p>In case you're counting, this is his 16th visit as president to the Lone Star State, amid some polls that show things could be very, very competitive there. Too early to say, for sure, but has this red state began to turn purple? It's anyone's guess.</p><p>But Kaylee McGhee joins us right now of The Washington Examiner, excellent reporter, writer, commentator.</p><p>I watch and follow all these polls, Kaylee, and they show it's a much more competitive race than it should be in Texas, but Texas has demographically changed as well.</p><p>And I'm wondering if it will be as tough a fight for Republicans as some of these polls indicate right now, essentially a draw?</p><p>KAYLEE MCGHEE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: The numbers certainly seem to suggest that Texas is becoming a purple state.</p><p>And I remember sitting down with former Texas Rep. Will Hurd several months ago, and he told me at the time that Texas was fast becoming a purple state, if it wasn't one already.</p><p>So, this is a legitimate concern for Republicans. And that's why you see President Trump continuing to visit the state. He's really had to change the way that he companies, because, at this point, Texas does have the ability to change the electoral map completely.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Kaylee, what happened?</p><p>I mean, you follow this very, very closely. But it would seem to me that when governors there were trying to attract companies to move, particularly from high-tax states like California, they got what they wished. Companies did relocate, but, with them, they relocated a very diverse worker base that's enjoying the lower taxes and everything else.</p><p>But it's also a wider, more Democratic field of workers, right?</p><p>MCGHEE: And not just companies.</p><p>You have had many, many different families from the West Coast basically transplant to Texas to flee high taxes and just the ridiculous price of homes, and et cetera.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MCGHEE: I remember living out in Los Angeles for a summer, and the lady that I was staying with actually said that she was planning to move to Texas because she could no longer afford her mortgage in California.</p><p>So there's a very real concern among West Coast people that they just can't afford to live there anymore. And they're moving to Texas' cities, and they are turning the state blue.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, be careful what you wish for, right?</p><p>But let me get a better sense of what could be deciding it in states like Texas. Obviously, you had that unexpected spike in cases and the hurricane to deal with. But a lot of them are getting angry, impatient, suits back and forth against the governor, whether he opened things too soon and then shut them down too fast, and bars.</p><p>And when they ended karaoke at 9:00 p.m., I said, that was it. That was the deciding moment.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: But what happened?</p><p>MCGHEE: Well, Governor Abbott is really doing what he really needs to be doing, which is reintroducing certain regulations to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>I think the criticism of him has been very unfair up to this point, because when he reopened as early as he did, there was nothing in the numbers to suggest that he shouldn't have done that. And now we're seeing this -- quote, unquote -- \"second wave\" that's kind of reintroducing itself.</p><p>And now we're going back into a semi-shutdown in the state, which is what he did in the first place. So I don't see anything wrong with it. He's doing what he should have been doing. And that's that.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, the president is going to keep talking up energy independence, Texas, of course, a huge beneficiary of that.</p><p>And he seemed flabbergasted a couple of weeks ago, when he was hearing about these polls, that, A, he didn't buy them, B, they seemed to be fake, but that it would be just very unusual for a state that's benefited, he says, from his policies to make us energy-independent and fracking and all of that, for him to be in a tight race that he's in.</p><p>So he wasn't buying that. But is the energy issue a dominant one, or is it still the coronavirus and how he's deemed to be handling it?</p><p>MCGHEE: Certainly, in states such as Texas, Pennsylvania, where you have a really large energy industry presence, I do think that the Trump administration's work rolling back regulations from the Obama administration and even previous administrations is a very compelling issue.</p><p>These are blue-collar workers who depend on these energy-related jobs. And the more that Trump can do to tell them that he is on their side, and that he's working to roll back these regulations that often cripple the energy industry, that is a winning factor.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Very good catching up with you, Kaylee. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>It looks like the president is ready to take the podium there. Again, this is an opportunity for him to do a little bit of crowing about the economic comeback and even the comeback we have seen since the slow reopening of the country and in Texas, bumps and all, that has got a lot more people returning to work, about eight million-plus, the president will be noting, over the last couple of months.</p><p>The president of the United States.</p><p>(JOINED IN PROGRESS)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you. Thank you, Cody. Good job you did, Cody. He was wealthier four months ago, but he'll be up there very soon. He's doing good. Come on. Sit down, please. Let's have some fun.</p><p>And I really am -- I'm thrilled to be here in Midland, Texas, with the extraordinary men and women of Double Eagle Energy. And what a nice welcome. And thank you very much.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: There's a lot of big, beautiful rigs behind me.</p><p>Thanks to the hardworking citizens like you, the United States of America is now the number one energy superpower anywhere in the world. So, congratulations. That was -- it was not that easy, but now it's getting easier.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: We're here today to celebrate your incredible achievements. We're also here to send a clear message to the zealots, radicals, and extremists trying to shut down your industry and to make America subservient to foreign producers. That won't happen to this nation again.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: It took a long time to be independent. And as long as I'm your President, we will never let anyone put American energy out of business, which is what they'd like to do.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: We will never again be reliant on hostile foreign suppliers. We will defend your jobs, and we will defend the Lone Star State.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: I love this state. And we will defend America's newfound energy independence.</p><p>Before going any further, I want to provide you with a brief update on our battle against the China virus. Our hearts are with the people of Texas. We love our people. We love our country. Statewide, the percent of patients testing positive has stabilized, and the number of new cases has begun to substantially decline, but Texans must remain vigilant.</p><p>To protect our seniors, my administration has deployed personal protective equipment and rapid point-of-care testing systems to every Medicare -- and Medicaid-certified nursing home in your state. No matter where you go, they have it.</p><p>This week, Texas hospitals are receiving 500 cases of antiviral treatment, remdesivir -- it's been very, very successful -- enough to treat 3,200 patients.</p><p>Under my administration's Operation Warp Speed, we're developing vaccines in record time. Earlier this week, a promising vaccine entered the final stage of clinical trials, long ahead of schedule, with more following very quickly behind. We have some of the greatest companies, labs in the world doing this. This is the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Together, we will end the plague from China. We will defeat the virus. I want to thank everyone at Double Eagle Energy for hosting us today, including the co-founders -- two great, young, smart people: Cody Campbell and John Sellers. Thank you, Cody. Thank you, John. Thank you, fellows. Good job.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Thanks also to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt. David, thank you. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette. Texas has keep -- really kept him very busy. Where's Dan? You've been very busy. Very busy.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: A great senator and a great friend of mine, Senator Ted Cruz. Ted, thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: He's out there fighting for you, I want to tell you. Thank you, Ted.</p><p>Representatives -- and these are friends of mine and they're warriors -- Jodey Arrington and Mike Conaway. Thank you, fellows.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you. Great job.</p><p>A very, very special man and a very special talent in Governor Greg Abbott.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you, Greg. Great job you're doing. And he's working hard, and you're doing a fantastic job. Our people are working together and you're getting everything you need. So, good. Thank you for doing such a good job.</p><p>And thank also Dan Patrick, your lieutenant governor -- my friend. Thank you very much, Dan.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Great help. It's a great team. No better team in the country. Thank you.</p><p>Midland County Judge Terry Johnson. Thank you, Terry. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Your former governor -- a great man, a friend of mine -- Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. Nobody did a better job than my Rick. Thank you, Rick.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: And we have so many other distinguished guests and local leaders, and we just want to thank you all for being here. Thank you all very much. Great honor. Thank you very much for being here.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Under the last administration, America's energy industry was under relentless and unceasing attack. You know that. But the day I took the Oath of Office, we ended the war on American energy and we stopped the far-left assault on American energy workers. Now, the assault -- you've seen what's going on; it could come again. But I have a very strong feeling you're not going to have to worry about it. If you do, you're in big, big trouble.</p><p>I withdrew from the one-sided, energy-destroying Paris Climate Accord. It was a disaster.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: It cost us billions of dollars, and it would have made us a noncompetitive nation.</p><p>We canceled the Obama administration's job-crushing Clean Power Plan. You know all about that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: I approved the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access pipelines immediately upon assuming office.</p><p>We opened up ANWR in Alaska to energy exploration, ended the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands, and reopened public lands and offshore areas to oil and gas exploration. That's where David Bernhardt has done such a great job. Thanks, David.</p><p>We unlocked the full energy potential of Texas and New Mexico. And New Mexico -- we're proud that we've been here. We're proud to help. You have been fantastic. A lot of jobs.</p><p>And since my election, oil and gas production in the Permian Basin has more than doubled.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Under the Trump administration, the United States has increased oil production by 3. 1 million barrels per day. That's some number. Never been anything like that number.</p><p>For the first time in nearly 70 years, we have become a net energy exporter.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: And the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the face of the Earth.</p><p>To ensure we maintain this dominant position long into the future -- we will never lose this position -- my administration is announcing today that export authorizations for American liquefied natural gas can now be extended through the year 2050.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Mr. Governor, is that long enough? OK, 2050 -- that seems like a long time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TRUMP: He said, Let's make it longer.</p><p>At the same time, we're strongly protecting our environment. Air pollution is down significantly since I took office. While other countries are polluting the world's air and oceans, we will never cease to be a leader in protecting our natural environment. And that's what's happening.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: People don't know that about us. We love our environment.</p><p>Under my administration, the United States will continue to have among the cleanest air and cleanest water anywhere on Earth, and that's what we have.</p><p>Thanks to our pro-American energy policies, we're also taking jobs and factories away from countries with poor environmental standards, such as China, and bringing jobs back to America where they belong.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Before the invisible enemy struck our shores, we created 800,000 new energy jobs -- a third of them in Texas. That was just the new jobs; add on to that millions of other jobs. After the China virus struck, we implemented historic economic relief. When oil crashed, I got Saudi Arabia, Russia, and others to cut nearly 10 million barrels a day, and got OPEC Plus and Mexico to agree to the deal. And hence, we're OK now. We're back. We're back.</p><p>And I will tell you...</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: And I can tell you that I spoke with Dan and Greg, and I spoke with Senator Ted Cruz -- I spoke with a lot of people -- and we were very close to losing a very powerful, great industry. And we did a job. We did a great job all together, working together -- a job like I think nobody could have done. And now we're back, and now we're just going to keep expanding. It's going to see -- you will see. It's happening. But we really did -- we did a great job.</p><p>And I want to thank, frankly, Saudi Arabia. I want to thank Russia. I want to thank Mexico. And I want to thank OPEC, as they call it, Plus. It's called OPEC Plus. That's OPEC plus a lot of other countries. But they all came together and they did a job on the industry, and we appreciate everybody's help.</p><p>This action stabilized world oil prices that had been in a freefall, and saved millions of energy jobs, and frankly, it saved your industry. Four months ago, people were very, very concerned about that industry. And now it's just going to be a question of how fast will you put people on.</p><p>Through the Paycheck Protection Program, we provided over $1 billion in emergency aid to keep Texas energy workers on the payroll. We kept them all on the payroll. We opened up 30 million barrels of space in Strategic Petroleum Reserve, allowing American companies to store surplus oil to be sold at a later time. And we filled up our 75 million barrels in the Strategic Reserve. And, Dan, you've done a fantastic job on that. Thank you very much.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: I only wish he bought it when the oil was selling for zero, and they paid you $37 in addition. You get a barrel, plus 37. I said, Dan, why didn't you make that deal? I would have loved that. But you did well. Thank you very much.</p><p>Today, I'm taking another bold action to support energy jobs in Texas. In a few moments, I will sign four critical permits, granting approval to vital pipeline and railway infrastructure on our nation's border. That's a big deal. This will include two permits allowing the export of Texas crude to Mexico -- a giant victory for the workers of this state that you've been after for many years.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Right? You've been after that one for many years. I said, What do I know about it? If you want to do it, it's OK with me. And we're doing it, so that's been a long time in the making.</p><p>We're joined today by some of the incredible patriots of the Texas oil and gas industry who are benefiting from America's energy boom. Josh Guinn was born and raised right here in Odessa and Midland. Where's Josh?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you, Josh.</p><p>After spending a few years away at school, Josh came back home to West Texas. Josh's dad worked on the oil rigs. Josh worked on the oil rigs. And he hopes his three children will work one day doing the same kind of incredible work and looking for the wonderful opportunities in American energy. Josh, thank you very much. Congratulate your family. You're going to have a great future.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p>Brian Welch spent five years in the Army, supporting our victory in the Gulf War. Then he became -- (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) -- hello, Brian. Thank you, Brian. Then he became an energy worker. Did you make the right move, Brian? I think so. Right? Better believe it.</p><p>With over 25 years of experience, Brian is senior pumper with Double Eagle Energy. Do they treat you well? They better. They better, or I'm going to come back and see those two guys.</p><p>Just like thousands of other veterans who work in this industry, Brian has made America safer with his service, and now he's helping keep us secure by maintaining American energy independence, which we have. Thank you very much, Brian.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Great job.</p><p>To Brian and every veteran who works in the American energy sector, we salute your noble service and we thank you very much. We thank you very much. Everybody, thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: While my administration is fighting for workers like you, the radical left -- have you ever heard of the radical left, Brian? You don't want to hear about them. You don't want to know about them -- is fighting to abolish American energy, destroy the oil and gas industries, and wipe out your jobs.</p><p>Washington Democrats have embraced Representative Ocasio -- Cortez's nearly $100 trillion Green New Deal disaster -- I've added the fourth word; it's a disaster -- which would ban oil and gas leasing on all federal lands. And, by the way, there'd be no fracking.</p><p>So let me ask you, Mr. Governor, how do you think that works in Texas? No fracking, no drilling, no oil. Is that OK? Good. I don't think Biden is going to do too well in Texas. He's already written it off. It's gone. No fracking. That's part of his platform.</p><p>If these far-left politicians ever get into power, they will demolish not only your industry, but the entire U.S. economy. Their stated agenda includes rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, spending billions and billions of dollars in order to make us non-competitive and seeking an even higher level of restrictions; mandating net-zero carbon emissions -- which, frankly, is impossible -- for all new homes, offices, and buildings by 2030. Not possible to do. And if you ever did it, it would cost so much that your home would be valueless.</p><p>This would cause the cost of construction to skyrocket and effectively end the use of natural gas in homes because it would be an impossible situation. They're asking for things, just so you understand, that are impossible.</p><p>I don't know -- I haven't checked recently: What have they done with cows? Remember, there were going to be no more cows and no more cattle. I think they might have left that one off the manifesto, but it'll be back.</p><p>Their platform calls for mandating zero-carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. In other words, no drilling, no fracking, no coal, no shale, no gas, no oil; otherwise, they've been very good to the industry, I think.</p><p>You got to be careful. You know, people don't take it seriously. If they got in, you will have no more energy coming out of the great state of Texas, out of New Mexico, out of anywhere -- Oklahoma, North Dakota. Name them. Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania does a lot. People don't realize that. A lot. It would throw Pennsylvania, Ohio -- so many other places. You don't realize how big it is. They want to have no fracking, no nothing.</p><p>The policies required to implement this extreme agenda would mean the death of American prosperity and the end of the American middle class. It would mean, I think, even worse than that. It would destroy our country. I used to say, Would become another Venezuela. Same ideology. You would become another Venezuela. Venezuela used to be one of the richest in the world, per capita, and period, one of the richest in the world -- among the largest oil reserves. Now they don't have water, they don't have medicine, they don't have food. You got a lot of oil; it doesn't matter. Doesn't seem to matter. They don't have anything. And that can happen to us.</p><p>All you have to do is look at Portland. Look at the agitators. Look at the anarchists in Portland. And our people have done a great job in protecting our courthouse. And I told my people, a little while ago: If they don't solve that problem locally, very soon, we're going to send in the National Guard and get it solved very quickly, just like we did in Minneapolis and just like we will do in other places.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: They want to solve their problem. They've got a very short time to do it. But they'll either solve their problem or we send in the National Guard.</p><p>The U.S. energy industry would grind to a halt, and every single energy- producing state would be plunged into a depression. Two million jobs would vanish overnight in just the state of Texas alone. And I think the number is probably, Greg, a lot higher than 2 million. Millions more would disappear in New Mexico and Ohio and Colorado and Pennsylvania.</p><p>By imposing these punishing restrictions -- and beyond restrictions -- the Washington radical-left, crazy Democrats would also send countless American jobs, factories, industries to China and to other foreign polluting states. They want us to take care of our air, but China doesn't take care of its air. In all fairness, India doesn't take care of its air. Russia doesn't take care of its air. But we do. Not on my watch, it's not going to happen -- I can tell you that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Because as long as I'm President, we will always put America first. It's very simple. Very simple.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: For years and years, we put other countries first, and we now put America first.</p><p>As we have seen in cities and towns across our nation, it's not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy; they want to destroy our country. These people are sick. They are sick. And you better get used to hearing it because they have some real problems. They don't love our country in any way, shape, or form. They don't love our country. There's no respect for the American way of life. There is no way of life ever in history that's been like the great American way of life. There is no respect, but there is by you, and there is by 95 percent of our people. Our people love our country, and our people love our anthem and they love our flag. Remember that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: The radical left wants to tear down everything in its way. And in its place, they want power for themselves. They want power. Hard to believe -- power. They want to uproot and demolish every American value. They want to wipe away every trace of religion from national life. They want to indoctrinate our children, defund our police, abolish the suburbs, incite riots, and leave every city at the mercy of the radical left. That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen.</p><p>And, by the way, I just ended the rule on suburbs. You know, the suburbs -- people fight all of their lives to get into the suburbs and have a beautiful home. There will be no more low-income housing forced into the suburbs. I abandoned and took away and just rescinded the rule. It's been going on for years. I've seen conflict for years. It's been hell for suburbia. We rescinded the rule three days ago, so enjoy your life, ladies and gentlemen. Enjoy your life.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: The proud people of Texas will never bow, kneel, or surrender to the left-wing mob. You will always stand tall and strong for America. Everyone here today carries the legacy of some of the toughest, fiercest, and most determined people ever to walk the face of the Earth -- your ancestors. You know that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: You know that.</p><p>Generations of Texas oil workers before you gave every last bit of sweat and heart and grit that they had to build up this country. They loved our country. They loved our country so much, they couldn't breathe. Their pride and devotion helped raise up America's cities, power our factories, propel our industries, sustain our families, supply our military, and fuel America's rise into the strongest, wealthiest, and greatest nation the world has ever known. We are now at the strongest point, militarily, we've ever been due to -- I will tell you. Ted? Where is Ted? He was a big leader in this. Stand up again, Ted.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: Ted Cruz, John Cornyn, and our Senate, and our House approved $2. 5 trillion to rebuild entirely the United States military. It's now at a point that it's the strongest it's ever been. A lot of the equipment is still coming in -- brand-new planes and missiles and everything you can think of.</p><p>And I want to thank you, Ted. You were one of the real leaders, and John, too. The two of you. I appreciate it very much. You were well represented.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: We have the greatest equipment on Earth. We have equipment that I can't even tell you about. You don't want to know about it, frankly, and hopefully we never have to use it.</p><p>Now it's your turn to help lead our nation to even greater heights. Today, we give thanks for each and every one of you, and we are telling the Washington politicians trying to abolish American energy: Don't mess with Texas.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: And I just want to finish by saying that I've had a great relationship with your leaders, with your politicians, with all the people in Texas. We've had great success. We had a great victory.</p><p>They said, Oh, I don't know if he'll win, and we won -- not only did we win, we won quickly and easily. And now we're leading what we had even four years ago.</p><p>I will never let you down. I will never let Texas down.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: And your governor and your lieutenant governor and your senators, they know that very well. So thank you. And thank you very much. Greg, Dan, thank you very much. Ted, thank you. Great job.</p><p>God bless you and the great state of Texas. God bless you. God bless you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: So on behalf of every American energy worker, I will now sign these very important permits that your governor and your senators have been after me for a long time to sign. And they've been after a lot of other presidents to sign them, but they never were able to get it done. But we got it done, and we got it done for a great state called Texas.</p><p>Thank you very much, everybody.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, you have been listening to the president of the United States in Midland, Texas.</p><p>He's talking up energy there and approval for a pipeline, some more infrastructure along the Southern border, which had been stymied in the past, under past administrations, Republican and Democrat both, I might point out, that this is something that the president is saying is near and dear to his heart.</p><p>He wanted to remind Texas, in his 16th appearance now as president of the United States, that he's looking out for them, and saying that all this goes, essentially, if Joe Biden comes in, because he's not a fan of fossil fuel and traditional energy.</p><p>So, the president says, that kind of stuff, you can kind of kiss goodbye. He has said much the same about the market run-up we have had and the economic run-up we had, certainly prior to the virus.</p><p>But, of course, the comeback we have seen in the economy and eight million jobs since, America has slowly begun reopening, this at a time, of course, when Texas had a bumpy reopening itself, some spikes in cases, governor Abbott there with the president, but saying that much of this has subdued a little bit and we might be over the worst of it.</p><p>At least, that's what they hope in the Lone Star State.</p><p>We got Tom Bevan of RealClearPolitics.</p><p>You know, Tom, when I see these polls that show, despite all of that and the energy full-court press he has been making that would benefit Texas, he's in the fight of his life.</p><p>But how serious is that fight? I mean, a lot of people look at it and say, it would be very, very tough for Joe Biden to pull it off, or would it?</p><p>TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE EDITOR, REALCLEARPOLITICS.COM: Well, I mean, the polls certainly suggest that Texas is competitive, and it's more competitive than the Trump folks want.</p><p>But, I mean, again, we're in the thick of the coronavirus crisis that is on the minds of all folks, and he's not getting great marks on that.</p><p>Joe Biden's in the basement, not really -- there's really no campaign that's going on. So, there isn't -- the Trump folks always say, when they have an opportunity to define Joe Biden, that they do very, very well. Trump tried to do some of that today.</p><p>But, eventually, there will be more engagement in the campaign. I think that's where the Trump folks -- and there's still a lot more Republican -- registered Republicans in Texas than Democrats.</p><p>And even when you have the phenomenon like Beto O'Rourke, who turned out a ton of Democrats a couple of years ago, Ted Cruz still won that race by three points. So, I think the Republicans still feel pretty good about Texas.</p><p>I mean, listen, if he loses Texas, he's going to lose big. I mean, he's going to lose a lot of other states. So, I think his bigger worries are not so much Texas, but more in the Upper Midwest. That's where this race is going to be really won or lost.</p><p>CAVUTO: But if you have to take a lot of your resources and put them into a state that was, like, in the past an easy pickup, is that the case? Does it hurt Republicans, even if they pick it up and maintain it, that it will be a fight?</p><p>BEVAN: Sure, absolutely.</p><p>I mean, the map certainly has been expanded, and not in ways that favor Trump. He's fighting in Texas. He's got to fight a little bit in Georgia. He's fighting in places like Florida.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>BEVAN: He's fighting in Ohio and Iowa.</p><p>So these are states that he won -- certainly, in the case of, like, Ohio, for example, or Iowa, he won pretty handily. They're a lot closer. In some cases, he's even behind in some of the polling.</p><p>So, yes, they're going to be more -- they're going to be playing defense in more states than they did before. And that's going to create challenges for his campaign, for sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Tom, thank you very, very much.</p><p>I want to bring Charlie Gasparino into the mix right now.</p><p>Charlie, you might have been hearing a lot of this. It's a familiar theme the president goes back to. Look, Texas, this is the energy sort of comeback that I orchestrated. It all goes if that other guy gets in. Look at the markets. He didn't touch on them today. That other guy comes in, that too goes, the comeback in the economy that started before the virus, that's now resuming with the reopenings and the eight million new jobs added to the economy since this slow, albeit, clumsy reopening.</p><p>What do you make of that and the theme that he will keep pounding, this all goes if I go?</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think it was an effective, very effective speech, from an economic standpoint.</p><p>Of course, you can always quibble. Like, he's in Texas. Why is he in Texas now? I mean, why does he need to be there, if it's not competitive? And that's a problem, I guess, tactically, when you look at the map.</p><p>But I think Donald Trump really does have a shot, if he can pound the economic message that he pounded today in Texas home in Pennsylvania and other states where there's fracking. He can -- he could narrow the gap.</p><p>And the reason why is because the -- Joe Biden's campaign has embraced a lot -- plenty of left-wing solutions to economic issues. And it's not just the riots in the streets that the -- that the -- that the Democratic mayors are almost embracing and pacifying. It's really pathetic.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: It's this economic agenda that they have.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Let me follow up on that real quickly, Charlie.</p><p>We're cutting on time. One is this notion that the stimulus bill is looking like a tougher haul than the president or Republicans thought.</p><p>GASPARINO: Well, that's...</p><p>CAVUTO: They're down to about a trillion-dollar price tag, which is huge. Now, the $3.5 trillion the Democrats want, I'm just wondering, where is this going?</p><p>GASPARINO: Listen, they may just pass one aspect of it, and that's the unemployment insurance extension, because Nancy Pelosi holds a lot of cards.</p><p>Why does she want to give Mitch McConnell anything, including liability waivers for businesses that want to open? I mean, she can -- she can -- she can filibuster that, because she knows she has him over -- she basically has him over a barrel, because, if they don't extend unemployment insurance and benefits, well, the public really wants that.</p><p>And it's why the whole fight that they had over the payroll tax between Kudlow and Mnuchin materialized. Mnuchin knew it right at first.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: There was no way that that was going to get through Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>So, this -- she's putting up a fight on a lot of different issues. So just look for a piecemeal thing. I think they're just going to do the unemployment stuff and just call it a day.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>You could be right. Charlie Gasparino, thank you, buddy. I appreciate it.</p><p>And that unemployment stuff he's referring to is what to do about the $600- a-week unemployment benefit via Uncle Sam that ends the end of this week. There is talk that they're going to keep it going. It might not be $600. It might be $200 in the beginning. Mitt Romney has come up with a plan, how about we cut it by $200, make it $400, revisit every 30 days?</p><p>Bottom line, Republicans don't want to give up that fight, because they realize it could boomerang on them.</p><p>Here comes \"THE FIVE.\"</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

The spike in the Volatility Index (VIX) on Friday is starting to reflect fears about the spread of the deadly coronavirus which has already killed 80 people in China, infected more than 2,700 globally and is showing no signs of retreating. The latter issue is leading investors to sell risk assets and flee to safe havens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whether the market reaction to the coronavirus will be short-lived or extended further remains a guessing game for now. The bottom line is how much global economic output will be wiped out, and so far, no one knows the answer.</p><p>Investors prefer to increase their cash allocation and overweight safe havens, such as Treasuries, Gold and the Japanese Yen, until we have a clear assessment on the degree of economic impact. However, if the mortality rate continues to rise with no cure to the virus, investors will move to panic mode, so expect to see further downside in risk assets. That's why investors are advised to keep a close eye on the VIX index.</p><p>While the coronavirus is set to grab all the headlines, this week is shaping up to be a busy one on many fronts. Earnings season gets into full swing with 145 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting results, central banks in the UK and US decide on monetary policy, President Trump's impeachment trial enters its second week and key economic data are due to be released.</p><p>Earnings</p><p>Tech giants will be under the spotlight with Apple, Microsoft and Amazon among the names to be reporting results on Wednesday and Thursday. Those big tech firms contributed to a large chunk of the S&amp;P 500 rally in 2019 with Apple rising 86%, Microsoft 55% and Amazon 23% last year. For these companies to sustain their upside momentum, we need to see not just earnings surprise to the upside, but upcoming quarters projections as well.</p><p>Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Facebook, Tesla, Pfizer, General Electric, Boeing, Caterpillar, and United Technologies are among the big firms reporting this week.</p><p>Central Banks Meetings</p><p>The Federal Reserve and Bank of England will be holding their first meetings of 2020.</p><p>The Fed is widely expected to remain on hold when delivering its statement on Wednesday. We also anticipate very little changes to their economic projections. With a robust labour market and moderate inflation, we don't expect to see any amendments to monetary policy in the near term. Market participants still need to know how long the Fed will remain on the sidelines, but the only answer they're likely to receive is \"we are data-dependent.\"</p><p>However, the BoE's rate decision is likely to be much more interesting with markets split 50/50 on whether we'll see a rate cut on Thursday. MPC members have been talking up the case for lower rates so far this year, but the positive PMI releases last week will likely lead to more of a wait-and-see approach. Whatever the outcome from the meeting, expect to see volatility in the Pound.</p><p>For information, disclaimer and risk warning note visit: FXTM</p><p>FXTM Brand: ForexTime Limited is regulated by CySEC and licensed by the SA FSCA.

Quick Fix    \u2014 First the House, now the Senate: As the country braces for a second wave in coronavirus cases, a Senate subcommittee is holding a hearing on the persistence of Covid-19 robocalls and related scams \u2014 and what businesses and the government should do about it.   \u2014 Tech measures advance in the House:  Lawmakers approved a set of amendments to their annual defense spending bill dealing with everything from TikTok to deepfakes and bias in artificial intelligence.   \u2014 In social media we trust: Or do we? More than half of social media users have less confidence in tech platforms\u2019 ability to protect the November election from foreign interference after last week\u2019s unprecedented Twitter hack, according to a new poll.

A message from Facebook:     Facebook launches Global State of Small Business Report. At Facebook, we are committed to helping small businesses succeed. We partnered with the World Bank and the OECD to survey businesses in 50+ countries and regions to understand the challenges they face and ways we can better support them. Go further: Read the first report       Tech of the Town    TODAY, IRL, ON THE HILL: SENATE EXAMS SCAMS \u2014 The director of the FTC\u2019s Consumer Protection Bureau, Andrew Smith, is among the witnesses testifying this afternoon at a Senate Commerce consumer protection subcommittee hearing on Covid-19 scams . Chair Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) plans to single out \u201cillegal robocalls pitching low-priced health insurance\u201d and other scams targeting vulnerable populations like seniors, per opening remarks shared with POLITICO. He also plans to press the witnesses on \u201ccurrent enforcement efforts to detect, identify and prosecute criminal organizations engaged in these illegal activities.\u201d   \u2014 Sound familiar? Today\u2019s session is more or less a Senate counterpart to a House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee hearing earlier in July on Covid-19 privacy harms and scams online, from price gouging to counterfeit products. Today, Smith and the other witnesses \u2014 including Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt \u2014 are expected to highlight what businesses and federal and state governments are doing, and what they should be doing more of, to crack down on pandemic-era ploys.   HOUSE VOTES TO ADVANCE SLEW OF TECH MEASURES \u2014 In a rare flurry of activity for tech policy on Capitol Hill, House lawmakers on Monday approved a series of amendments to their annual defense spending bill that touched on everything from government use of TikTok to the dangers of so-called deepfakes and to bias in artificial intelligence.   \u2014 What made it through: The House passed a massive bloc of amendments that included a proposal by Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) to ban the use of TikTok on federal devices; two plans from Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.) to ban the Defense Department from using some funds to acquire AI not vetted for algorithmic bias, and separately to require that regulators file reports to Congress on how deepfake videos affect national defense; and a Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) amendment requiring DoD to issue a report to Congress on social media use by terrorists and on the threat of online radicalization.   \u2014 What\u2019s next: The House is slated to consider amendments today to have the GAO probe \u201cpredatory social media\u201d targeting service members and their families and to establish an Open Technology Fund \u201cto promote global internet freedom by countering internet censorship and repressive surveillance by authoritarian regimes.\u201d Neither is up for debate on the House floor, indicating likely passage. The House is expected to pass its version of the National Defense Authorization Act today, with a Senate vote likely soon to follow. The two chambers will then need to reconcile differences between the bills.   \u2014 TikTok's reaction: A TikTok spokesperson said in response to the House vote that the company's \"entire and growing U.S. team have no higher priority than promoting a safe app experience that protects our users' privacy.\" They added, \"Millions of American families use TikTok for entertainment and creative expression, which we recognize is not what federal government devices are for.\"   TECH TO TIKTOK\u2019S RESCUE \u2014 After the House voted to bar TikTok on government devices , a leading tech research institute is warning the Trump administration against banning the Chinese-owned video app in the U.S. \u2014 an idea floated in recent weeks by top officials and the president himself. Instead, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation argues, members of Congress should prove that TikTok has done wrong, as lawmakers claim it has, and then U.S. regulators should hold TikTok accountable for any missteps.   \u2014 \u201cTikTok has stated clearly and unambiguously that it has not and will not provide U.S. user data to the Chinese government ,\u201d said ITIF Vice President Daniel Castro. \u201cIf the U.S. government has evidence to the contrary, it should share this information with lawmakers and the public. Similarly, if the app is not complying with U.S. data privacy or other laws, regulators should hold it accountable for any violations.\u201d He added that the U.S. punishing foreign tech firms based on \u201crumors and innuendo\u201d sets a precedent for other countries to retaliate and freely \u201cimpose trade restrictions on digital goods and services for vague and undefined national security threats.\u201d   ASK THE AUDIENCE: DO YOU TRUST TWITTER AHEAD OF THE ELECTION? \u2014 In the wake of last week's unprecedented Twitter hack , more than half of social media users fear that the platforms cannot successfully thwart election interference or disinformation campaigns ahead of November, according to a new Morning Consult poll .   \u2014 Of more than 2,000 social media users polled over the weekend following the breach, 56 percent said they have \u201cless confidence\u201d in tech platforms\u2019 ability to fight such attempts from bad actors and more than 70 percent have \u201clittle or no trust\u201d in the sites to protect sensitive personal information like full name, email address, birth date and geolocation. (Sixty-five percent felt the same about banking information.)   \u2014 Meanwhile, over in Congress: The top two Democrats in the House and Senate, as well as the top two Democrats on the respective intelligence committees, put out an urgent call for an FBI briefing on an apparent election-related foreign influence operation targeting lawmakers, our POLITICO colleagues report : \u201cAmong the Democrats\u2019 concerns is that a Senate investigation being led by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has become a vehicle for \u2018laundering\u2019 a foreign operation to damage Joe Biden, according to two people familiar with the demand.\u201d A Johnson spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment.   \u2014 What does Biden have to say about that? In his most definitive statements to date on election interference \u2014 obtained first by POLITICO \u2014 the presumptive 2020 Democratic nominee threatened to hold the Kremlin and other foreign governments accountable for any meddling if elected, Natasha Bertrand reports . Biden said he \u201cwill treat foreign interference in our election as an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation\u2019s government,\u201d and plans to \u201cdirect the U.S. Intelligence Community to report publicly and in a timely manner on any efforts by foreign governments that have interfered, or attempted to interfere, with U.S. elections.\u201d         LOBBYING LATEST: HEY, SMALL SPENDER \u2014 Google continues to reduce its spending on federal lobbying, at least the kind that has to be publicly disclosed. The search giant shelled out $1.69 million during the second quarter, new records show . For comparison, Google spent $2.94 million during the same quarter last year and $5.83 million in the second quarter of 2018. Google has laid off several outside firms and restructured its internal staff over the past two years, but the steep decline is still surprising given the company\u2019s woes in Washington have only grown. Google declined to comment.   \u2014 Twitter spending held relatively flat at $390,000 in the second quarter, but the social network has tapped TwinLogic Strategies as its latest outside lobbyist . The firm will work on content moderation and intermediary liability issues, among other policy matters. Other notable new contracts: Cypress Advocacy is lobbying for Amazon Web Services on the CARES Act; BL Partners is on retainer for T-Mobile; and Mercury Public Affairs is advocating on behalf of Netflix.    Transitions    Antitrust expert and former Justice Department official Fiona Scott Morton is advising Amazon and Apple as the tech giants face federal antitrust probes, per Bloomberg . \u2026 Melody Neil , former founding partner and principal of an advocacy firm that offered government affairs expertise to companies and business trade associations, joined the data center services provider Digital Realty as a senior director of business operations and government affairs. \u2026 Denise Linn Riedl , chief innovation officer for the city of South Bend, Ind., and Leon A. Wilson , the Cleveland Foundation\u2019s chief of digital innovation and chief information officer, were named board members for the Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society. \u2026 ICYMI: Alabama announced the creation of the Alabama Innovation Commission , also known as Innovate Alabama , its first statewide commission promoting entrepreneurial and tech growth. The advisory council includes Alabama native and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .    Silicon Valley Must Reads    Trump\u2019s texting trouble: When the Trump campaign recently tested out its mass-text messaging program, key for its small-donor outreach and voter turnout, the program was flagged as spam and shut down by telecom giants, POLITICO reports .   Surprise: Google promised privacy with its coronavirus contact tracing app, but government agencies are now surprised that this isn\u2019t quite the case, NYT reports .    Quick Downloads    Orders for the oversight board: \"A new policy-focused nonprofit that emerged from the recent wave of big tech scrutiny is calling for members of Facebook's Oversight Board to either step up or step down,\" TechCrunch reports on the group Accountable Tech.   Should Facebook take sides? \u201cBoycott organizers want Facebook to \u2018pick a side\u2019 and align its corporate operations with aggressive activism on issues such as racism and social justice,\u201d former Facebook policy director Matt Perault, who now leads Duke\u2019s Center on Science and Technology Policy, writes on Chicago Booth\u2019s ProMarket blog . \u201cBut picking a side would mean a radical shift in the company\u2019s approach to its product and alienate many of its users.\u201d   Tips, comments, suggestions?

Smaller countries like the UAE can leverage together to do this.</p><p>\"You know, life is difficult when you develop new technologies, including technologies that that are incredibly influential over you and me and our fellow citizens, and the best way of making sure we have a level playing field is for governments to create the right framework around that,\" he said.</p><p>He suggested Microsoft would welcome regulation in areas like facial recognition \"to make sure our engineers are navigating in the right way\".</p><p>\"We welcome that,\" he said. \"We think it's helpful that the guard rails are being defined by governments and decision makers.\"</p><p>He noted that facial recognition technology can be both hugely beneficial in healthcare but its potential for misuse in surveillance should make it a priority area for government regulation.</p><p>\"This is an area where we as a company have said very clearly from the beginning, we will welcome regulations,\" said Mr Klynge. \"We should not leave it in the hands of the tech industry to define how that technology's brought out. Better have regulation coming out from responsible, progressive, democratic countries than leaving it alone to the tech industry.\"</p><p>He highlighted that citizens, governments and civil society should demand companies behave responsibly, even if it means technologies are not fully utilised immediately.</p><p>\"What that means in practice is perhaps to take a firmer approach to these technologies, despite the fact that you're not using the full potential of technologies from the outset,\" he said.</p><p>He stated that companies are coming to appreciate they must have a greater understanding of local customs and cultures and government objectives before rolling out new technology.</p><p>Mr Klynge added that Europe must catch up to a world that is increasingly bi-polar with the US and China as the main developers of technology.</p><p>Covid-19 has presented an opportunity for technology companies and governments to sit down and talk about regulation.</p><p>Read More</p><p>Trump signs executive order to 'strip social media of protection'</p><p>Twitter hides Donald Trump tweet over Minneapolis protests for 'glorifying violence'</p><p>\"Could you imagine handling the pandemic without 21st century technology?\" said Mr Klynge.</p><p>\"Even more people would have been in a difficult situation of losing their jobs, their income. That said, we want to make sure that that dependency will not be translated into what has been called tech-lash, the concerns that we will be too dependent on big American companies that are not playing by the democratic rule book.</p><p>\"I think we have to work together to get that right and pay attention to concerns that are being expressed by citizens, by civil society and by governments.\"</p><p>The Future of Diplomacy series is hosted by the Office of Public and Cultural Diplomacy in the UAE.

Minnesota is due to lift lockdown measures in mid-May even as cases continue to climb. Iowa, which did not implement restrictions on movement, recorded another 386 cases on Thursday, and its infection curve is not flattening, according to a New York Times tracker.[1] Nebraska has seen cases more than double since April 30, while major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago are still suffering from high death tolls. For more, read:States reopen after coronavirus lockdowns: Some New York counties open Friday; New Jersey, Delaware beaches to reopen for holiday weekend[2] Health officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious-disease expert,[3] continue to caution that moving too quickly to reopen plants, offices and shops could cause unnecessary deaths and suffering \u2014 and also disrupt any economic recovery. </p><p>Fauci and others have consistently warned that reopening should be conducted using testing and contact tracing to avoid a second wave of infections that is worse than the first. President Donald Trump said late Thursday that testing is 'overrated.' [4] ' More than 30 countries rank higher than the U.S. in terms of per capita testing. ' 'We have more cases than anybody in the world, but why? Because we do more testing,' Trump said in comments to workers at an Owens &amp;#38; Minor Inc. OMI, -2.14%[5] medical-supply plant in Allentown, Pa. 'When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn't do any testing, we would have very few cases. They [the media] don't want to write that. It's common sense. We test much more.' Critics on social media noted a flaw in the president's logic:  Others observed that the U.S. has lagged in testing when measured on a per capita basis, and is far behind such countries as South Korea and Germany that have successfully contained their infection rates. More than 30 countries rank higher than the U.S. in terms of per capita testing, according to Worldometers.info. [6] 'The [Trump administration] is obsessed with magic bullets \u2014 vaccines, new medicines, or a hope that the virus will simply disappear,' medical journal the Lancet wrote on Friday.[7] 'But only a steadfast reliance on basic public health principles, like test, trace, and isolate, will see the emergency brought to an end, and this requires an effective national public health agency,' it said in an article on how the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control has been sidelined and had its reputation battered during the pandemic. The CDC's initial batch of tests were faulty and had to be replaced, delaying the initial effort. Since then, the agency has been at odds with federal government advisers, including Dr. Deborah Birx, head of the U.S. COVID-19 task force, who was reported by the Washington Post recently to have said: 'There is nothing from the CDC that I can trust.' That is an 'unhelpful statement,' according to the Lancet, 'but also a shocking indictment of an agency that was once regarded as the gold standard for global disease detection and control. How did an agency that was the first point of contact for many national health authorities facing a public health threat become so ill-prepared to protect the public's health?'  There was more bad news from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which said late Thursday that it is investigating preliminary data suggesting Abbot Laboratories ABT, -2.05%[8] 15-minute test can miss COVID-19 cases, falsely clearing patients of infection, as the Associated Press reported.[9] The test is used daily at the White House to test President Donald Trump and key members of his staff, including the coronavirus task force. It is also used at thousands of hospitals, clinics and testing sites across the U.S. Abbott Labs said Friday that it stands by the test.[10]Latest talliesThere are now 4.50 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and 304,835 people have died from it, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.[11] At least 1.6 million people have recovered. The U.S. has the highest case toll at 1.43 million and the highest death toll at 86,744.  Russia has the second highest case tally at 262,843, after another 10,000 were counted overnight. Russia's death toll stands at just 2,418, according to official government reporting. The U.K. has 238,003 cases and 34,077 deaths, the highest death toll in Europe and second highest in the world after the U.S.  Spain has 230,183 cases and 27,459 deaths, while Italy has 223,885 cases and 31,610 deaths.  Brazil saw another spike in cases overnight and now has 208,031 cases and 14,267 deaths. France has 178,994 cases and 27,428 deaths, while Germany has 175,233 cases and 7,897 deaths. Slovenia became the first European country to call a formal end to its coronavirus outbreak[12], reopening to European Union citizens entering from neighboring Italy, Hungary and Austria.  Turkey has 146,457 cases and 4,055 deaths, and Iran has 116,635 cases and 6,902 deaths. India has moved ahead of China, where the disease was first reported late last year[13], by case count. India has 85,760 cases and 2,753, while China has 84,031 cases and 4,637 deaths.  New York is still the U.S. epicenter with 348,192 cases and 27,617 deaths, according to the New York Times data. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has announced a gradual reopening of the state that starts with five regions where the rate of infection can be managed, according to a checklist of metrics that the state has asked regions to monitor daily.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) launched a clinical trial testing hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 2,000 patients with mild and moderate cases of COVID-19.  Hydroxychloroquine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis; azithromycin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic.  The trial was announced Thursday during Dr. Rick Bright's testimony before a House of Representatives committee.[16] Bright has filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging that his reluctance to promote hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, as Trump had publicly advocated on multiple occasions, led to his demotion within the National Institutes of Health.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.TEVA, +2.18%[17] donated the hydroxychloroquine for the trial, which is evaluating whether the drug combination can prevent hospitalization and death. 'Although there is anecdotal evidence that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may benefit people with COVID-19, we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes,' NIAID director Fauci said in a statement.  The FDA in March granted an emergency-use authorization to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as COVID-19 treatments. More recently, the regulator authorized Gilead Sciences Inc.'s GILD, -1.25%[18] remdesivir as a COVID-19 treatment;[19] however, there are no proven, FDA-approved therapies that treat the disease.  Don't miss:These 23 companies are working on coronavirus treatments or vaccines \u2014 here's where things stand[20] The American Medical Association[21] said antibody tests should not be used to determine immunity against future infections with the novel coronavirus or make the case for less stringent social distancing rules. The serologic tests, which test for past infections with COVID-19, can be used to help determine the prevalence of the disease in the U.S. population, but the prevalence of false positives and cross-reactivity (when a test identifies antibodies for other coronaviruses, such as the one that causes the common cold) are of concern.  The AMA, which is the largest lobbying organization for physicians in the U.S., also said antibody tests should not be used to form the basis of 'immunity certificates,' a concept that would allow people who test positive for COVID-19 antibodies to move more freely in their communities. It also warned doctors to pay attention to whether a serologic test has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration, which recently cracked down on how it is regulating the makers of antibody tests. Hologic Inc. HOLX, +1.01%[22] received its second emergency-use authorization, or EUA, for a COVID-19 test from the FDA on Friday. Hologic expects to produce an average of a million tests a week. Funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority was used to develop the test. The company previously received an EUA for a molecular COVID-19 test in mid-March.What's the economy saying? Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April after the pandemic locked down much of the economy, cost millions of jobs and spawned an unprecedented slump in consumer spending, as MarketWatch's Jeffry Bartash reported. [23] Retail sales tumbled in every category except online shopping, the government said Friday. Sales also sank by a revised 8.3% in March, easily marking the worst back-to-back declines in modern American history. Economists polled by MarketWatch expected a 12.5% plunge 'With states either already starting to reopen their economies, albeit at differing speeds, or at the least planning for such a move, retail sales should begin to stabilize and rebound in the months ahead,' said senior economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC Capital Markets. Yet he cautioned that the rebound will be much slower than the slump in spending. The New YorkFed's Empire State business conditions index rose 29.7 points to -48.5 in May, the regional Fed bank said Friday. This was the second lowest reading on record. Economists had expected a reading of -65, according to a survey by Econoday. Any reading below zero indicates deteriorating conditions.  For more, read:Empire State index shows activity continued to decline sharply in May[24] Consumer sentiment improved slightly in early May after a two-month free fall, as some states began to reopen economies and stimulus checks began to arrive. The preliminary reading of the consumer-sentiment survey in May edged up to 73.7 from 71.8 in April, the University of Michigan said Friday.[25] Economists had forecast a small decline. See now:Almost half of workers who lost their job due to COVID-19 are 'finding it difficult to get by,'Fed survey says[26]What are companies saying? J.C. PenneyJCP, +21.24%[27] said Friday that it made a $17 million interest payment on May 14 [28]to avoid a default event and is continuing to evaluate its strategic options. The news cheered investors who were expecting the troubled department-store chain to file for bankruptcy, following Neiman Marcus's and J. Crew's filings last week. Elsewhere, companies continued to offer updates on the reopening of their businesses, to cut costs and withdraw guidance and fret about the uncertain outlook for a recovery. Here are the latest things companies have said about COVID-19:  \u2022 Applied Materials Inc. AMAT, -4.39%[29] reported mixed second-fiscal-quarter revenue results that fell short of Wall Street estimates. Applied Materials reported net income of $755 million, or 82 cents a share, compared with net income of $666 million, or 70 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue climbed 12% to $3.96 billion from $3.54 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected net income of 93 cents a share on sales of $4.09 billion.  \u2022 Boeing Co. BA, -2.05%[30] named Mike Delaney the head of the company's 'confident travel initiative to develop 'new solutions to help minimize air travel health risks amid the COVID-19 pandemic and drive awareness of health safeguards already in place.' Delaney currently serves as vice president of digital transformation at Boeing's commercial airplanes unit. The team will work with operators to advise on existing, approved disinfectants compatible with flight decks and cabins as well as and testing other sanitizers.  \u2022 Conagra Brands Inc. CAG, +1.00%[31] provided a sales update for its fiscal fourth quarter to date through May 3, with the processed and packaged foods seller saying total retail sales rose 37.2% from a year ago. For the 10-week period ended May 3, frozen retail sales grew 29.7%, with frozen meals sales, which includes single- and multi-serve meals, increasing 27.1%. Snacks retail sales rose 20.4% and staples brands sales, which includes brands within grocery and refrigerated businesses, jumped 53.5%. The sales update is in conjunction with Conagra's investor meeting scheduled Friday.  \u2022 Denny's Corp. DENN, +4.56%[32] reported first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, although revenue tumbled 36%. During the crunch of the pandemic, the restaurant chain has gone to streamlined menus, 'Dine-Thru' curbside service programs, and shareable family meal packs. \u2022 Dillard's Inc. DDS, +12.00%[33] reported a smaller fiscal first-quarter loss than expected, as well as the reopening of stores. The retailer says it plans to reopen 116 stores and five clearance centers next week. Once they are open, the company will have 241 stores and 29 clearance centers in service. 'COVID-19 has impacted every aspect of our business. The mall business in general and department stores, specifically, have been particularly hard hit,' Dillard's Chief Executive William T. Dillard II said in a statement.  \u2022 Online-gambling and fantasy-sports company DraftKings Inc. DKNG, +15.48%[34] posted a wider-than-expected loss for the first quarter and sales that lagged estimates as live sporting events were canceled due to the pandemic. The company, which went public in April via a blank-check company merger with a $6 billion valuation, said revenue jumped 30% despite the effects of COVID-19. The company has continued to make progress on priorities, including entering new states, and investing in product and technology to create more live betting for American-based sports. The company has created products that allow customers to engage in fantasy sports and betting on eNASCAR, Counter Strike, and Rocket League, as well as pop culture events such as TV shows 'Survivor,' 'The Last Dance' and 'Top Chef.' The company does not anticipate an impact to FY2021 or long-term plans due to COVID-19,' it said in a statement. \u2022 Farfetch Ltd. FTCH, -11.26%[35] reported a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss and sales that beat views. The company is 'well capitalized' to continue on the path to adjusted profits for full-year 2021. Investments it made to build its global platform, such as global logistics and a diversified supply network, have been paying off during the pandemic. That enabled 'the continuity of our operations and delivery of our strong first quarter 2020 results. While the pandemic had no 'material impact' on first-quarter performance, uncertainty from the evolving crisis prevents the company from providing guidance.  \u2022 U.S. cannabis company Green Thumb Industries Inc.GTII, +15.27%[36] GTBIF, +15.23%[37] more than tripled revenue in the first quarter as it continued to pare down its losses.. The company said it has $71.5 million in cash and equivalents as of the end of March and total debt amounted to $92.9 million. \u2022 Kroger Co. KR, -0.82%[38] has hired 100,000 people over the past eight weeks, adding to the 460,000 workers the grocer had before the COVID-19 outbreak. Kroger has spent $700 million in associate pay and safeguards against the spread of coronavirus since March. Hiring began quickly, with the company bringing on 30,000 by April 1. Part of that investment has been in a 'hero bonus,' a $2-per-hour pay bump for workers that will end mid-May. 'In the coming months, we know that our associates' needs will continue to evolve and change as our country recovers,' the company said in a statement. 'We continuously evaluate employee compensation and benefits packages. Our average hourly wage is $15 and with benefits factored in, like health care, the hourly wage is over $20.'  \u2022 The New York Stock Exchange will reopen its trading floor to 'a subset' of floor brokers on May 26, with new safety measures, Stacey Cunningham, the exchange's president, said in a guest column in the Wall Street Journal. The NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange ICE, +0.23%[39], has been limited to electronic trading since closing the trading floor in response to the pandemic on March 23. 'We opted to close our floor temporarily in the early days of the pandemic to help slow the spread of disease. Two months later, we've learned a lot and are in a position to reopen the floor with vital new safety measures, as we begin working together to restart the U.S. economy,' Cunningham wrote.[40] \u2022 Nike Inc. NKE, +0.50%[41] said strong online sales are picking up the slack for sluggish or non-existent store sales. More than 95% of its stores in China and South Korea are open, with some still operating with reduced hours. Foot traffic remains below past years, but that has been offset by higher conversion rates and online sales. Outside China and South Korea, most Nike stores are closed to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. That has resulted in 'significantly lower' wholesale revenue and higher inventory, Nike said. Some stores in countries such as Brazil, France, Germany, and the United States have reopened, with some also operating with reduced hours. In preparation for more reopenings, Nike has implemented social-distancing and traffic-control measures, provided extra product and facility cleanliness, and given face coverings to its retail employees. \u2022 Vans and North Face parent VF Corp. VFC, -6.27%[42] posted fourth-fiscal-quarter earnings that missed expectations, as the pandemic reduced consumer demand. Outdoor revenue, which includes North Face, fell 15% to $848.3 million, below the FactSet consensus of $919.9 million, and active revenue, which includes Vans, declined 9% to $1.03 billion to miss expectations of $1.07 billion. VF said it could not provide financial guidance given the uncertainties associated with COVID-19. Separately, the company declared a regular dividend of 48 cents a share, payable June 22 to shareholders of record on June 10. Big Tech &amp;#38; Small Business Vs.

The people that run these companies are the richest people in human history and the most powerful and most unaccountable people in human history.</p><p>They have not just railways, like others did, or the steel mills, like [Andrew] Carnegie did. But in fact, they have data and information. They have never had so much data on so many human beings. It's an incredibly powerful thing.</p><p>This pandemic, which is global, these companies, which are global, have created a situation where they are accelerating the trends they were already causing, such as the death of Main Street retail, this shift into monolithic companies. Google owns search, Facebook owns social media, Amazon owns commerce.</p><p>We've seen that we need them desperately in this pandemic situation in order to operate our society. It only further solidifies their strength. It further takes away the ability of regulators to control them.

Never before have five companies held such powerful sway over the index, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The swelling at the top increasingly matters for regular investors, who have been putting more of their 401(k) accounts into funds that mimic the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. The majority of money invested in U.S. stock funds is now in index funds, according to Morningstar, and any $100 going into an S&amp;P 500 index fund is automatically putting nearly $18 of it into just those five stocks.</p><p>The trends mean investors are increasingly beholden to the fortunes of five companies. Consider last Thursday, when Microsoft alone accounted for two thirds of S&amp;P 500 index funds' gains. These tech giants can carry just as much weight on the way down, and that increases risk for investors, particularly when the threat of additional, profit-reducing government regulation is hanging over the industry.</p><p>\"This doesn't have to correct itself immediately,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent report for investors, but they nevertheless see it as unsustainable.</p><p>The last time five stocks controlled this much of the S&amp;P 500 was during the tech bubble at the turn of the millennium. That bubble eventually popped, and stocks like Cisco and General Electric shrank to become smaller players. Microsoft was also among them, but it has since climbed back to the top.</p><p>One difference between this time and the dot-com bubble is that many analysts don't see prices as grossly over-inflated now. Each of today's Big Five is producing strong growth even when the global economy has been stuck in a sluggish pace for years. Apple's earnings per share surged 19% in the in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, for example.</p><p>Morgan Stanley sees the top 1% loosening its hold on the S&amp;P 500 in one of two ways. The first scenario has investors deciding on their own to move their dollars to less-loved areas of the market, which would be a positive for the overall stock market. The second would be more negative: Investors leave once the Big Five show they're unable to sustain their eye-popping growth.</p><p>Until then, the concentration at the top of the S&amp;P 500 puts more pressure on investors to keep their portfolios diversified, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p>One of the tenets of investing is to have a diversified portfolio, where some pieces can zig when others zag in hopes of keeping the overall pot safer. An index fund owning hundreds of stocks may be less diversified than it appears, though, when the five most dominant companies within it can often move in a herd given how much overlap is in their businesses.</p><p>\"It takes work, but look at areas that really can help provide that diversification that investors really need right now,\" Roland said. \"It sounds so boring, but balanced is beautiful.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-2823946ed0ff770d48c8bb5523daa621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y54-T2P1-DYN6-W3YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"536\"/><timeReceived>6:51 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Never before have five companies held such powerful sway over the index, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The swelling at the top increasingly matters for regular investors, who have been putting more of their 401(k) accounts into funds that mimic the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. The majority of money invested in U.S. stock funds is now in index funds, according to Morningstar, and any $100 going into an S&amp;P 500 index fund is automatically putting nearly $18 of it into just those five stocks.</p><p>The trends mean investors are increasingly beholden to the fortunes of five companies. Consider last Thursday, when Microsoft alone accounted for two thirds of S&amp;P 500 index funds' gains. These tech giants can carry just as much weight on the way down, and that increases risk for investors, particularly when the threat of additional, profit-reducing government regulation is hanging over the industry.</p><p>\"This doesn't have to correct itself immediately,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent report for investors, but they nevertheless see it as unsustainable.</p><p>The last time five stocks controlled this much of the S&amp;P 500 was during the tech bubble at the turn of the millennium. That bubble eventually popped, and stocks like Cisco and General Electric shrank to become smaller players. Microsoft was also among them, but it has since climbed back to the top.</p><p>One difference between this time and the dot-com bubble is that many analysts don't see prices as grossly over-inflated now. Each of today's Big Five is producing strong growth even when the global economy has been stuck in a sluggish pace for years. Apple's earnings per share surged 19% in the in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, for example.</p><p>Morgan Stanley sees the top 1% loosening its hold on the S&amp;P 500 in one of two ways. The first scenario has investors deciding on their own to move their dollars to less-loved areas of the market, which would be a positive for the overall stock market. The second would be more negative: Investors leave once the Big Five show they're unable to sustain their eye-popping growth.</p><p>Until then, the concentration at the top of the S&amp;P 500 puts more pressure on investors to keep their portfolios diversified, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p>One of the tenets of investing is to have a diversified portfolio, where some pieces can zig when others zag in hopes of keeping the overall pot safer. An index fund owning hundreds of stocks may be less diversified than it appears, though, when the five most dominant companies within it can often move in a herd given how much overlap is in their businesses.</p><p>\"It takes work, but look at areas that really can help provide that diversification that investors really need right now,\" Roland said. \"It sounds so boring, but balanced is beautiful.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHATNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHATNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y51-90J1-JBP6-R1HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155832</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Chattanooga Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chattanooga Times Free Press (Tennessee)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 9, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Never before have five companies held such powerful sway over the index, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The swelling at the top increasingly matters for regular investors, who have been putting more of their 401(k) accounts into funds that mimic the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. The majority of money invested in U.S. stock funds is now in index funds, according to Morningstar, and any $100 going into an S&amp;P 500 index fund is automatically putting nearly $18 of it into just those five stocks.</p><p>The trends mean investors are increasingly beholden to the fortunes of five companies. Consider last Thursday, when Microsoft alone accounted for two thirds of S&amp;P 500 index funds' gains. These tech giants can carry just as much weight on the way down, and that increases risk for investors, particularly when the threat of additional, profit-reducing government regulation is hanging over the industry.</p><p>\"This doesn't have to correct itself immediately,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent report for investors, but they nevertheless see it as unsustainable.</p><p>The last time five stocks controlled this much of the S&amp;P 500 was during the tech bubble at the turn of the millennium. That bubble eventually popped, and stocks like Cisco and General Electric shrank to become smaller players. Microsoft was also among them, but it has since climbed back to the top.</p><p>One difference between this time and the dot-com bubble is that many analysts don't see prices as grossly over-inflated now. Each of today's Big Five is producing strong growth even when the global economy has been stuck in a sluggish pace for years. Apple's earnings per share surged 19% in the in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, for example.</p><p>Morgan Stanley sees the top 1% loosening its hold on the S&amp;P 500 in one of two ways. The first scenario has investors deciding on their own to move their dollars to less-loved areas of the market, which would be a positive for the overall stock market. The second would be more negative: Investors leave once the Big Five show they're unable to sustain their eye-popping growth.</p><p>Until then, the concentration at the top of the S&amp;P 500 puts more pressure on investors to keep their portfolios diversified, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p>One of the tenets of investing is to have a diversified portfolio, where some pieces can zig when others zag in hopes of keeping the overall pot safer. An index fund owning hundreds of stocks may be less diversified than it appears, though, when the five most dominant companies within it can often move in a herd given how much overlap is in their businesses.</p><p>\"It takes work, but look at areas that really can help provide that diversification that investors really need right now,\" Roland said. \"It sounds so boring, but balanced is beautiful.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-2823946ed0ff770d48c8bb5523daa621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y54-T341-DYN6-W4K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"536\"/><timeReceived>6:51 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Now that they've already taken over our lives, big tech companies are taking over the stock market.  The five biggest U.S. stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Google's parent company, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 have grown so explosively that they account for nearly 18% of the S&amp;P 500 index by market value, when they make up just 1% of its population. Never before have five companies held such powerful sway over the index, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.  The swelling at the top increasingly matters for regular investors, who have been putting more of their 401(k) accounts into funds that mimic the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. The majority of money invested in U.S. stock funds is now in index funds, according to Morningstar, and any $100 going into an S&amp;P 500 index fund is automatically putting nearly $18 of it into just those five stocks.  The trends mean investors are increasingly beholden to the fortunes of five companies. Consider last Thursday, when Microsoft alone accounted for two thirds of S&amp;P 500 index funds' gains. These tech giants can carry just as much weight on the way down, and that increases risk for investors, particularly when the threat of additional, profit-reducing government regulation is hanging over the industry.  #8216;This doesn't have to correct itself immediately,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent report for investors, but they nevertheless see it as unsustainable. (Ad) 5G phones cost a staggering $1,300. If you plan on buying one anytime soon... I got some news for you. It's a worthless investment. 5G won't work, unless this one tiny company steps in with its miraculous solution to save it. That's according to E.B. Tucker. He believes the tiny company that'll save 5G is the biggest stock market story for 2020. The last time five stocks controlled this much of the S&amp;P 500 was during the tech bubble at the turn of the millennium. That bubble eventually popped, and stocks like Cisco and General Electric shrank to become smaller players. Microsoft was also among them, but it has since climbed back to the top.  One difference between this time and the dot-com bubble is that many analysts don't see prices as grossly over-inflated now. Each of today's Big Five is producing strong growth even when the global economy has been stuck in a sluggish pace for years. Apple's earnings per share surged 19% in the in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, for example.  Morgan Stanley sees the top 1% loosening its hold on the S&amp;P 500 in one of two ways. The first scenario has investors deciding on their own to move their dollars to less-loved areas of the market, which would be a positive for the overall stock market. The second would be more negative: Investors leave once the Big Five show they're unable to sustain their eye-popping growth.  Until then, the concentration at the top of the S&amp;P 500 puts more pressure on investors to keep their portfolios diversified, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.  One of the tenets of investing is to have a diversified portfolio, where some pieces can zig when others zag in hopes of keeping the overall pot safer. An index fund owning hundreds of stocks may be less diversified than it appears, though, when the five most dominant companies within it can often move in a herd given how much overlap is in their businesses.  #8216;It takes work, but look at areas that really can help provide that diversification that investors really need right now,#8217; Roland said. #8216;It sounds so boring, but balanced is beautiful.#8217; (Ad) 5G phones cost a staggering $1,300.

Never before have five companies held such powerful sway over the index, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.</p><p> The swelling at the top increasingly matters for regular investors, who have been putting more of their 401(k) accounts into funds that mimic the S&amp;P; 500 and other indexes. The majority of money invested in U.S. stock funds is now in index funds, according to Morningstar, and any $100 going into an S&amp;P; 500 index fund is automatically putting nearly $18 of it into just those five stocks.</p><p> The trends mean investors are increasingly beholden to the fortunes of five companies. Consider last Thursday, when Microsoft alone accounted for two thirds of S&amp;P; 500 index funds' gains. These tech giants can carry just as much weight on the way down, and that increases risk for investors, particularly when the threat of additional, profit-reducing government regulation is hanging over the industry.</p><p> \"This doesn't have to correct itself immediately,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent report for investors, but they nevertheless see it as unsustainable.</p><p> The last time five stocks controlled this much of the S&amp;P; 500 was during the tech bubble at the turn of the millennium. That bubble eventually popped, and stocks like Cisco and General Electric shrank to become smaller players. Microsoft was also among them, but it has since climbed back to the top.</p><p> One difference between this time and the dot-com bubble is that many analysts don't see prices as grossly over-inflated now. Each of today's Big Five is producing strong growth even when the global economy has been stuck in a sluggish pace for years. Apple's earnings per share surged 19% in the in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, for example.</p><p>Morgan Stanley sees the top 1% loosening its hold on the S&amp;P; 500 in one of two ways. The first scenario has investors deciding on their own to move their dollars to less-loved areas of the market, which would be a positive for the overall stock market. The second would be more negative: Investors leave once the Big Five show they're unable to sustain their eye-popping growth.</p><p> Until then, the concentration at the top of the S&amp;P; 500 puts more pressure on investors to keep their portfolios diversified, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p> One of the tenets of investing is to have a diversified portfolio, where some pieces can zig when others zag in hopes of keeping the overall pot safer. An index fund owning hundreds of stocks may be less diversified than it appears, though, when the five most dominant companies within it can often move in a herd given how much overlap is in their businesses.</p><p> \"It takes work, but look at areas that really can help provide that diversification that investors really need right now,\" Roland said. \"It sounds so boring, but balanced is beautiful.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FILE- In this Sept. 4, 2018, file photo Amazon and Apple stock prices are shown on an electronic screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York.

Never before have five companies held such powerful sway over the index, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.</p><p><br/>The swelling at the top increasingly matters for regular investors, who have been putting more of their 401(k) accounts into funds that mimic the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. The majority of money invested in U.S. stock funds is now in index funds, according to Morningstar, and any $100 going into an S&amp;P 500 index fund is automatically putting nearly $18 of it into just those five stocks.<br/>The trends mean investors are increasingly beholden to the fortunes of five companies. Consider last Thursday, when Microsoft alone accounted for two thirds of S&amp;P 500 index funds' gains. These tech giants can carry just as much weight on the way down, and that increases risk for investors, particularly when the threat of additional, profit-reducing government regulation is hanging over the industry.<br/>\u201cThis doesn't have to correct itself immediately,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent report for investors, but they nevertheless see it as unsustainable.<br/>The last time five stocks controlled this much of the S&amp;P 500 was during the tech bubble at the turn of the millennium. That bubble eventually popped, and stocks like Cisco and General Electric shrank to become smaller players. Microsoft was also among them, but it has since climbed back to the top.<br/>One difference between this time and the dot-com bubble is that many analysts don't see prices as grossly over-inflated now. Each of today's Big Five is producing strong growth even when the global economy has been stuck in a sluggish pace for years. Apple's earnings per share surged 19% in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, for example.<br/>Morgan Stanley sees the top 1% loosening its hold on the S&amp;P 500 in one of two ways. The first scenario has investors deciding on their own to move their dollars to less-loved areas of the market, which would be a positive for the overall stock market. The second would be more negative: Investors leave once the Big Five show they're unable to sustain their eye-popping growth.<br/>Until then, the concentration at the top of the S&amp;P 500 puts more pressure on investors to keep their portfolios diversified, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.<br/>One of the tenets of investing is to have a diversified portfolio, where some pieces can zig when others zag in hopes of keeping the overall pot safer. An index fund owning hundreds of stocks may be less diversified than it appears, though, when the five most dominant companies within it can often move in a herd given how much overlap is in their businesses.<br/>\u201cIt takes work, but look at areas that really can help provide that diversification that investors really need right now,\u201d Roland said. \u201cIt sounds so boring, but balanced is beautiful. \u201d<br/>To sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here.<br/></p><p>Copyright \u00a9 2020 BridgeTower Media.

Never before have five companies held such powerful sway over the index, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The swelling at the top increasingly matters for regular investors, who have been putting more of their 401(k) accounts into funds that mimic the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. The majority of money invested in U.S. stock funds is now in index funds, according to Morningstar, and any $100 going into an S&amp;P 500 index fund is automatically putting nearly $18 of it into just those five stocks.</p><p>The trends mean investors are increasingly beholden to the fortunes of five companies. Consider last Thursday, when Microsoft alone accounted for two thirds of S&amp;P 500 index funds' gains. These tech giants can carry just as much weight on the way down, and that increases risk for investors, particularly when the threat of additional, profit-reducing government regulation is hanging over the industry.</p><p>\"This doesn't have to correct itself immediately,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent report for investors, but they nevertheless see it as unsustainable.</p><p>The last time five stocks controlled this much of the S&amp;P 500 was during the tech bubble at the turn of the millennium. That bubble eventually popped, and stocks like Cisco and General Electric shrank to become smaller players. Microsoft was also among them, but it has since climbed back to the top.</p><p>One difference between this time and the dot-com bubble is that many analysts don't see prices as grossly over-inflated now. Each of today's Big Five is producing strong growth even when the global economy has been stuck in a sluggish pace for years. Apple's earnings per share surged 19% in the in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, for example.</p><p>Morgan Stanley sees the top 1% loosening its hold on the S&amp;P 500 in one of two ways. The first scenario has investors deciding on their own to move their dollars to less-loved areas of the market, which would be a positive for the overall stock market. The second would be more negative: Investors leave once the Big Five show they're unable to sustain their eye-popping growth.</p><p>Until then, the concentration at the top of the S&amp;P 500 puts more pressure on investors to keep their portfolios diversified, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p>One of the tenets of investing is to have a diversified portfolio, where some pieces can zig when others zag in hopes of keeping the overall pot safer. An index fund owning hundreds of stocks may be less diversified than it appears, though, when the five most dominant companies within it can often move in a herd given how much overlap is in their businesses.</p><p>\"It takes work, but look at areas that really can help provide that diversification that investors really need right now,\" Roland said. \"It sounds so boring, but balanced is beautiful.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-2823946ed0ff770d48c8bb5523daa621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y54-T2W1-JC65-50YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"536\"/><timeReceived>6:51 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Never before have five companies held such powerful sway over the index, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The swelling at the top increasingly matters for regular investors, who have been putting more of their 401(k) accounts into funds that mimic the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. The majority of money invested in U.S. stock funds is now in index funds, according to Morningstar, and any $100 going into an S&amp;P 500 index fund is automatically putting nearly $18 of it into just those five stocks.</p><p>The trends mean investors are increasingly beholden to the fortunes of five companies. Consider last Thursday, when Microsoft alone accounted for two thirds of S&amp;P 500 index funds' gains. These tech giants can carry just as much weight on the way down, and that increases risk for investors, particularly when the threat of additional, profit-reducing government regulation is hanging over the industry.</p><p>\"This doesn't have to correct itself immediately,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent report for investors, but they nevertheless see it as unsustainable.</p><p>The last time five stocks controlled this much of the S&amp;P 500 was during the tech bubble at the turn of the millennium. That bubble eventually popped, and stocks like Cisco and General Electric shrank to become smaller players. Microsoft was also among them, but it has since climbed back to the top.</p><p>One difference between this time and the dot-com bubble is that many analysts don't see prices as grossly over-inflated now. Each of today's Big Five is producing strong growth even when the global economy has been stuck in a sluggish pace for years. Apple's earnings per share surged 19% in the in the last three months of 2019 from a year earlier, for example.</p><p>Morgan Stanley sees the top 1% loosening its hold on the S&amp;P 500 in one of two ways. The first scenario has investors deciding on their own to move their dollars to less-loved areas of the market, which would be a positive for the overall stock market. The second would be more negative: Investors leave once the Big Five show they're unable to sustain their eye-popping growth.</p><p>Until then, the concentration at the top of the S&amp;P 500 puts more pressure on investors to keep their portfolios diversified, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p>One of the tenets of investing is to have a diversified portfolio, where some pieces can zig when others zag in hopes of keeping the overall pot safer. An index fund owning hundreds of stocks may be less diversified than it appears, though, when the five most dominant companies within it can often move in a herd given how much overlap is in their businesses.</p><p>\"It takes work, but look at areas that really can help provide that diversification that investors really need right now,\" Roland said. \"It sounds so boring, but balanced is beautiful.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-2823946ed0ff770d48c8bb5523daa621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y56-7891-DY9S-T453-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"536\"/><timeReceived>01:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As more people obtained telephone service, the value of the network increased to both its owners and to users, who could reach more people and conduct commerce more easily as a result of having telephone service.In the conventional analysis,negative network effectsoccur from \"congestion,\" i.e. the network is adding new users so quickly that \"more users make a product less valuable.\"But this superficial analysis misses the fatally anti-social consequences of corporatenegative network effects, a dynamic described by analyst Simons Chase inthis essay[1]. Here is an excerpt:Even the most imaginative and far-reaching narratives about non-obvious economic fragility and off balance sheet risks are mere rants without constructive ideas about causes and solutions.Consider network effects, the popular economic construct applied to market concentration and increasing returns for strategies pursued by some leading tech companies. </p><p>This dynamic economic agent is also known as demand side economies of scale.W. Brian Arthur, the economist credited with first developing the theory, described the condition of increasing returns as a game of strategic positioning and building up a user base to the point where 'lock in' of dominant players occurs. Companies able to tap network effects have been rewarded with huge valuations and highly defensible businesses.But what about negative network effects?What if the same dynamic applies to the U.S.'s pay-to-play political industry where the government promotes or approves of something through a policy, subsidy or financial guarantee due to private sector influence.Benefits accrue only to the purchaser of the network effects, and consumers, induced by the false signal of large network size, ultimately suffer from asymmetric risk and experience what I'm calling a loss of intangible net worth for each additional member after the 'bandwagon' wares off.If this were the case, then you would see companies experience rapid revenue growth (out of line with traditional asset leverage models), executives accumulating huge fortunes and political campaign coffers swelling.But the most striking feature would be the anti-social outcomes,the ones not available without the instant critical mass of government-supported network effects, the ones that, at scale, monetize a society's intangible net worth.Some products tied to these metrics include: prescriptions drugs, junk food targeting children, mortgages, diplomas, and social media. The list of industries that are likely to have gained through the purchasing of network effects in D.C. maps closely to the decay that is visible in U.S. society.The loss of intangible capital and other manifestations ofnon-obvious economic fragility(to use Simons' apt phrase) is the subject of my latest book,Will You Be Richer or Poorer? Profit, Power and A.I. in a Traumatized World[2], in which I catalog the anti-social consequences ofnegative network effectsand other forces eroding our nation'sintangible capital.Consider Facebook, a classic case ofnegative network effectsrunning amok, creating immensely anti-social consequences while reaping billions in profits:Facebook isn't free speech, it's algorithmic amplification optimized for outrage[3](TechCrunch.com).The full social cost of social media's negative network effects are difficult to tally, but studies have found that loneliness and alienation are correlated to how many hours a day individuals spend on social media. (An Internet search brings up dozens of reports such as NPR\u20ac\u2122sFeeling Lonely? Too Much Time On Social Media May Be Why[4].)Facebook is trying to leverage its social media \"lock-in\" to issue its own global currency and both Facebook and Google are trying to offer banking services without any of the pesky regulations imposed on legitimate banks. (Will $10 million in lobbying do the trick? How about $100 million? We've got billions to \"invest\" in corrupting and controlling public agencies and political power.)Once Corporate America locks in cartel-monopoly power, i.e. you have to use our services and products, the corporate sociopaths use their billions in market cap and profits to buy the sociopaths in government.Pay-to-playis the real political machinery; \"democracy\" is the PR fig-leaf to mask the private sector \"lock-in\" (monopoly) and the public-sector \"lock-in\" (regulatory influence, anti-competitive barriers to entry, the legalization of corporate fraud, cooking the books, embezzlement, etc.)Consider Boeing, an effective monopoly which used $12 billion in profits to buy back its own sharesand \"invested\" millions in buying political influence so it could minimize public-sector oversight.Rather than spend the $12 billion designing a new safe aircraft, Boeing cobbled together a fatally flawed design dependent on software, as described inThe Case Against Boeing[5](The New Yorker) to maximize the profitability of its \"lock-in\".Google is running amok on so many levels, it's difficult to keep track of its anti-social \"let's be evil, it's so incredibly profitable\" agenda:Google's Secret 'Project Nightingale' Gathers Personal Health Data on Millions of Americans[6](Wall Street Journal). The goal, of course, is to reap more billions in profits for insiders and corporate sociopaths.The anti-social carnage unleashed by Corporate America's \"lock-in\" / negative network effects has no real limits.Consider the essentially limitless private and social damage caused by Big Tech:Child Abusers Run Rampant as Tech Companies Look the Other Way[7](New York Times).Then there's the opioid epidemic, whose casualties run into the hundreds of thousands,an epidemic that was entirely a creature of Corporate America seeking to maximize \"lock-in\" profits by buying regulatory approval and pushing false claims that the corporate products were safe and non-addictive.Note the media sources of these reports:these are the top tier of American journalism, not some easily dismissed alt-media source.What does this tell us? It tells us the anti-social consequences are now so extreme and so apparent that the corporate media cannot ignore them.Once Corporate America locks-in market, financial and political power, it acts as a virulent Black Plague on the social order, legitimate democracy, and an entire spectrum of intangible social capital including the rule of law.As Simons put it:\"The ethical dimension underpinning the whole system is this: what's moral is what's legal and what's legal is for sale.\"Where does this Black Plague pathology take us? To a collapse of the status quo which enabled it, cheered it, and so richly rewarded it. My recent books:Will You Be Richer or Poorer?
