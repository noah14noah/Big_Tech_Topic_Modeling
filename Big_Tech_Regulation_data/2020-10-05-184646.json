DiStefano</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite all the new pipelines to export natural gas, all of Philly's many new start-up spaces and high-rise towers, and all the new warehouses in former factory regions upstate, Pennsylvania's population is shrinking, writes Mark Vitner, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co., the dominant bank in Philadelphia and many other U.S. metro areas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The state's population of 13 million fell last year for the first time since 1985, Vitner noted in a report to clients last week, citing U.S. Labor Department estimates. (Deaths and move-outs outnumbered births, immigration, and other move-ins by nearly 8,000. Among the states, only Connecticut, West Virginia, and Illinois lost more people.)</p><p>Philadelphia, which has fallen to sixth-largest among U.S. cities, added fewer than 3,000 residents, \";which is disheartening,\"; given young people's \";renewed interest in urban living\"; that has boosted downtown populations across the United States, adds Vitner. About 78 smaller U.S. cities attracted more new residents than Philadelphia. The city's suburbs also grew just slightly. Pittsburgh, the state's second city, continues to shrink.</p><p>What's wrong? Look first at what's right: Philadelphia's constellations of colleges, medical schools, and pharma and medical-related businesses \";are a huge positive,\"; while start-up company support programs (such as those at University City Science Center) and corporate tech programs such as Comcast's MachineQ Internet of Things platform are also drawing skilled professionals to town, Vitner notes.</p><p>The area remains a bargain for college-educated professionals earning national-scale salaries: Philadelphia's lower rents eat up just 28 percent of the typical paycheck here, versus 35 percent to 45 percent in New York, Boston, or the big Western U.S. tech centers. And single-family home prices in the Philadelphia region averaged $249,000 vs. $475,000 in the New York area.</p><p>There was still job growth here, in some sectors. More than 7 of every 10 jobs added in the state last year were in education and health. There was also growth, but a \";marked deceleration,\"; in other professional and business-service fields, including tech and management.</p><p>Most of those jobs, Vitner notes, require college training.</p><p>Among categories popular with the non-college-educated majority: Jobs in manufacturing and retail fell. Small job gains were posted in hotels and restaurants, construction, warehousing, and trucking. The warehouse jobs \";tend to pay much less than the typical manufacturing job\"; in many of the same counties. And many of the new warehouse jobs (at Amazon and Walmart, for example) \";are seasonal or part time.\";</p><p>Once you get away from Philadelphia and other metro centers, \";the urban-rural divide in Pennsylvania is one of the most brazen in the nation,\"; Vitner adds. \";Personal income per capita is now $13,000 higher in Pennsylvania's metro areas than in its rural counties,\"; one of the biggest urban/rural splits in the nation.</p><p>The divide might help explain a point that investment manager James Meyer of Tower Bridge Advisors noted in his July 5 report to clients: While many employers complain that they can't find skilled or entry-level workers, average U.S. wages are still rising only slowly.</p><p>Meyer expects that will affect Federal Reserve policy: Instead of more rate increases in the second half of this year, he expects the Fed to concentrate mostly for now on shrinking its \";bloated\"; multitrillion-dollar balance sheet of mortgage-backed securities left from its efforts to restart the economy after the financial crisis of 2008. (The Fed confirmed Wednesday it plans to speed up shrinking its balance sheet.)</p><p>Investors don't seem worried: Stock prices are back at record levels. Meyer credits President Trump, in part: By stalling Obama-era environmental protections and business regulations, Trump has already \";lowered some costs and increased optimism.\";</p><p>Yet U.S. stock prices have been rising faster than U.S. corporate earnings, Meyer warned. Over time, stock prices \";hinge on earnings and interest rates, not tweets or Washington tumult.\"; So he's worried the big tech stocks leading the market have lately risen \";too far, too fast.\"; And he \";would not be surprised\"; if Alphabet-Google, Apple, Facebook, and even Amazon lose close to half their value, at least for a time, as tech stocks did in the early 2000s.</p><p>What to own if Big Tech is headed lower? Maybe banks, suggests Frederick Cannon, in a report to clients of financial-companies investment bank Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. He compares what's happening now with that big pre-2001 tech-stock boom \u2014 high-growth software stocks rose through the late 1990s, then tumbled; after that, high-dividend financial stocks rose \u2014 until the 2008 blow-up wrecked the party.</p><p>Are banks any better a value now? Raymond James analyst David J. Long notes banks continue boosting loans to midsized businesses. He sees this as a sign that \";growth will accelerate in the second half of the year, particularly if Congress can provide some conviction\"; that tax cuts, or infrastructure spending, or some other Washington plan, will \";stimulate the economy,\"; as Trump has promised.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photograph by: Matt Rourke / AP Photo</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-dixon-60024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P03-FNY1-DYJT-209J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><edition>WEB Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 9, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

And many of the new warehouse jobs (at Amazon and Walmart, for example) \"are seasonal or part time.\"</p><p>Once you get away from Philadelphia and other metro centers, \"the urban-rural divide in Pennsylvania is one of the most brazen in the nation,\" Vitner adds. \"Personal income per capita is now $13,000 higher in Pennsylvania's metro areas than in its rural counties,\" one of the biggest urban/rural splits in the nation.</p><p>The divide might help explain a point that investment manager James Meyer of Tower Bridge Advisors noted in his July 5 report to clients: While many employers complain that they can't find skilled or entry-level workers, average U.S. wages are still rising only slowly.</p><p>Meyer expects that will affect Federal Reserve policy: Instead of more rate increases in the second half of this year, he expects the Fed to concentrate mostly for now on shrinking its \"bloated\" multitrillion-dollar balance sheet of mortgage-backed securities left from its efforts to restart the economy after the financial crisis of 2008. (The Fed confirmed Wednesday it plans to speed up shrinking its balance sheet.)</p><p>Investors don't seem worried: Stock prices are back at record levels. Meyer credits President Trump, in part: By stalling Obama-era environmental protections and business regulations, Trump has already \"lowered some costs and increased optimism.\"</p><p>Yet U.S. stock prices have been rising faster than U.S. corporate earnings, Meyer warned. Over time, stock prices \"hinge on earnings and interest rates, not tweets or Washington tumult.\" So he's worried the big tech stocks leading the market have lately risen \"too far, too fast.\" And he \"would not be surprised\" if Alphabet-Google, Apple, Facebook, and even Amazon lose close to half their value, at least for a time, as tech stocks did in the early 2000s.</p><p>What to own if Big Tech is headed lower? Maybe banks, suggests Frederick Cannon, in a report to clients of financial-companies investment bank Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. He compares what's happening now with that big pre-2001 tech-stock boom -- high-growth software stocks rose through the late 1990s, then tumbled; after that, high-dividend financial stocks rose -- until the 2008 blow-up wrecked the party.</p><p>Are banks any better a value now?  Raymond James analyst David J. Long notes banks continue boosting loans to midsized businesses. He sees this as a sign that \"growth will accelerate in the second half of the year, particularly if Congress can provide some conviction\" that tax cuts, or infrastructure spending, or some other Washington plan, will \"stimulate the economy,\" as Trump has promised.</p><p>___ (c)2017 Philly.com Visit Philly.com at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.philly.com\">www.philly.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTBUS-20170708-PHI-Why-is-Pennsylvania-shrinking-It-s-about-jobs-0708-20170708PHI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Philly.com KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NYX-KYV1-DYNS-34PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">169235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 </copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Philly.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 8, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

They've pushed a flood of misleading editorials in major papers and websites claiming the plan is somehow racist[2] and will unveil a piracy apocalypse[3]. They've nudged Congressional campaign contribution recipients to bash the plan[4] as an extreme case of government over-reach. They've also managed to convince the press and some FCC staffers the idea is an attack on copyright[5], when copyright has absolutely nothing to do with it.Quick background: under the FCC's original proposal[6] (pdf), the FCC wants cable companies to provide programming access to third-party hardware vendors without the need for a CableCARD, the goal being to generate competition in the space resulting in better, cheaper and more open cable boxes. Under the proposal cable operators would be able to use any copyright protection or DRM standard they choose to deliver this content to companies like Google, Amazon or TiVO -- and the FCC has repeatedly stated any final rules would respect existing copyright and financial arrangements between cable and the customer.But because the plan would cost cable providers $21 billion annually in rental fee revenue and result in more open cable boxes (more likely to direct viewers to third party streaming competitors), they've been trying to use a false definition of \"copyright\" to protect its monopoly stranglehold over cable hardware. </p><p>And now, the cable industry has another ally in their attempt to mislead the press and public on this subject: The United States Copyright Office.For months the Copyright Office has been quietly going around \"educating\" DC regulators and politicians on the FCC's cable box reform plan, falsely claiming that the plan is an attack on copyright. These efforts have been effective in getting some of the FCC Commissioners that originally voted to approve the plan to waffle[7] on their decision. The behavior resulted in a number IP lawyers (including Annmarie Bridy) recently warning the Office that it's giving horrible advice[8] and ignoring legal precedent as to the scope of copyright.Undaunted, the Copyright Office this week doubled down on its misleading arguments, sending a letter to Congress[9] (pdf) that's absolutely jam-packed with claims ranging from the incredibly misleading to downright bullshit. At its core, the Office's letter continues to pretend that the FCC's NPRM would require copyright owners to give their content away for free exploitation by third party devices. That the FCC's plan lets \"big tech\" hijack cable's innovation and re-purpose it for all manner of nefarious use has been a cable lobbyist argument for the last year, and it pops up repeatedly in the structural underpinnings of the Office's own argument: \"The Office's principal reservation is that, as currently proposed, the rule could interfere with copyright owners' rights to license their works as provided by copyright law, and restrict their ability to impose reasonable conditions on the use of these works through the private negotiations that are the hallmark of the vibrant and dynamic MPVD marketplace.\"Use of phrasing like \"vibrant and dynamic\" to describe the most-hated[10] industry in the United States gives you a pretty solid sense of the objectivity of the Office's argument. But again, this idea that third parties can simply take cable company programming, throw their own ads on it, and present it as their own isn't what the FCC's proposing. At all. All the same licensing arrangements, consumer cable pricing, advertising, and DRM will remain intact (for better or worse).Throughout the letter, the Copyright Office repeatedly claims that copyright gives cable companies more control than they actually have. While copyright obviously gives an author some control over the copying and redistribution of their works, these rights can't magically be extended wherever and whenever one chooses, especially, as the EFF this week argued in a great reply[11] to the letter, when it conflicts with the rights of the end user:\"Once a copyright holder has released their work to paying customers, like cable subscribers, those customers have their own set of rights: to view TV programs at home or on the go, to skip around within the programs as they wish, to search for and organize the programs and other content they're entitled to see, and to choose tools that enable them to do these things.The Copyright Office's letter implies that cable and content companies could create new rights for themselves just by writing them into private contracts between each other: the right to control which 'platforms and devices' customers can use, the right to limit time-shifting and other fair uses, and the right to 'exclude' other software from a customer's device. While private companies are free to negotiate conditions like these between each other, nothing in the law gives copyright holders the power to impose those conditions on the whole world, snuffing out the rights of users.Of course that's precisely what the cable industry wants to do. For decades the cable industry has enjoyed a captive monopoly over cable hardware, resulting in expensive household rental fees and an erosion in consumer viewing rights. As the more open PC era arrived and challenged the inflexible mantra of traditional cable, the cable industry has worked harder on protecting this model[12] than it has on evolving. Finally faced with a viable threat to monopoly hardware control, cable is falsely claiming that copyright gives it the right to continue imprisoning customers in an antiquated walled garden smelling faintly of old people and mothballs.But here's the important part: copyright law cannot be used for this purpose -- and you'd think the Copyright Office would know that. The Copyright Office is twisting the fact that two private parties can negotiate away fair use and other rights for themselves, but the absolutely cannot negotiate away those rights for the public. Yet that's exactly what the Copyright Office is claiming.In short this isn't a debate about copyright, it's a debate about control. The idea that these new cable boxes and associated services might interfere with contractual agreements around windowing and tiering is simply not a copyright concern and yet here is the Copyright Office incorrectly claiming that it is. The Copyright Office also ignores that these changes don't eliminate or weaken DRM, and that customers using these new, more open cable boxes would still be cable customers, paying the same high prices they always have. Also ignored by the Copyright Office is the fact that these changes would be a net benefit to consumers and countless companies alike.Needless to say, consumer advocacy groups like Public Knowledge were equally unimpressed with the Copyright Office's[13] selective reasoning:\"Under the Copyright Office's analysis, the interests of consumers are irrelevant, and fair use is an obstacle to be overcome. This letter is another example of how the Copyright Office has become dedicated to the interests of some copyright holders -- as opposed to providing an accurate interpretation of copyright law.\"In short, the Copyright Office is being used as a puppet to defend one of the least liked industries in America, distorting the very definition of copyright to help protect said industry's monopoly control over the cable box.Permalink[14] | Comments[15] | Email This Story[16] [ 1]: <url

There are strict cookie policies, the infamous GDPR, laws that regulate returns and refunds of online purchases, and whatnot. And starting September 2019, European sellers are required to comply with another regulation - the Strong Customer Authentication[1] (SCA). Having spent the last 10 years in the ecommerce industry - arguably, one of today's most saturated industries with fierce competition - I think that the EU has taken a step too far and made it near impossible (or at least extremely difficult) for Europen businesses to compete in the global arena.How the SCA regulation worksGenerally, the SCA states that all EU-based businesses that accept online payments must build an additional authentication step into their checkout flow. </p><p>In practice, this means that after clicking the complete purchase button, the buyer must once again confirm the transaction - either by entering a password, a code sent to one's phone, using face recognition, or in any other way. Generally, the purpose of all regulations is usually good and noble - to protect the interests of the consumer. The SCA, for example, is expected to reduce online fraud and make payments more secure. But what's just one extra step for the consumer - a click to accept cookies, receive marketing emails, or confirm a transaction - that's another obstacle for the seller to closing a sale or getting the lead. This can significantly impact the business' conversion rates and revenue. Now, I'm not saying such consumer-protecting regulations are not necessary. What I'm saying is: too many restrictions can hurt them in the long run, as businesses start to struggle. Let me explain what I mean.European businesses lag behind the US and ChinaWhile the US and China have their own laws and regulations, Europe has a whole lot more of them. Quoting Alibaba's Jack Ma[2]: 'Europeeverything you do follows rules and laws. Everything you think about, when you start to worry, you make rules and laws.' The founder of the billion-dollar company also believes that the amount of restricting rules is the main reason why the US and China are way ahead of Europe in terms of technology innovation. There's a logic I can't disagree with - innovations really are difficult to create in a strictly controlled environment. No matter how you look at it, every new regulation not only slows down innovation but also hinders growth. That puts European entrepreneurs in a disadvantageous position when compared to businesses built in the US or China. Strict restrictions can make it more difficult for companies to grow their businesses, as well as keep them afloat. For example, even though the earlier mentioned SCA requirement will only slightly complicate the consumers' checkout experience, that could still lead to a significant drop in conversions.Too many hurdlesAnother question - and understandable concern - is whether this law will complicate entering new markets where people don't know the rules set by Europe. Because the SCA requires that all shoppers, even those located outside of the EU, take this extra authentication step. The problem is that consumers from the other side of the pond already have lowered motivation to order from Europe due to long shipping times and high delivery costs, and making the checkout process longer definitely won't increase it. Instead, it will give buyers just another reason to abandon the cart, when there are plenty of other sellers and service providers with more seamless checkout processes. Now, even though the SCA regulation won't affect all payments, such as payments below \u20ac30, that's a little consolation - orders that go from Europe to the US are rarely under \u20ac30 due to high shipping costs. There are other exemptions, but they don't change much in the big picture either.What to expect in the futureThe good news is that the US is interested in Europe as much as the other way around. For that reason, sooner or later the US might follow the European path and introduce new e-commerce regulating laws as well. Another scenario that I see, is that Europe could expand their local regulations, like the SCA, so that they apply to everyone and anyone willing to do business in the EU. A well-known example of Europe already practicing such a tactic is the GDPR. Contrary to the SCA, it affects all businesses - regardless of their location - that target European buyers. When equally controlled, I believe that businesses from both markets could get back in fair competition again. Otherwise, Europe risks isolating itself and becoming the region where businesses come to struggle.

So far, Paris is all alone\u2014but it may not be for long. Other European countries, including the United Kingdom and Spain, are preparing their own versions of the digital tax, and other big tech countries such as India are considering similar measures. The once-arcane question of tax liability for digital firms is sure to play a big part in the upcoming G-7 summit next month in France, where French President Emmanuel Macron hopes to forge a global solution to an increasingly thorny problem. </p><p>What exactly is the Google tax? France just passed new legislation that went into effect this week that levies a 3 percent tax on the revenues\u2014not profits\u2014that technology firms earn inside the country. The measure is meant to close loopholes in existing international tax law that lets firms earn money in one place\u2014say, France\u2014while having their headquarters and tax liability somewhere else. Its impact on the French Treasury is likely to be modest, with estimates of annual receipts on the order of $450 million to $550 million, though the political symbolism is huge\u2014Macron cut taxes in response to 'yellow vest' protesters and needs[1] to find a way to curb the looming budget deficit. And France, like many countries in Europe, has spent years trying to come to grips with the tax and competition implications of (largely foreign) technology firms. Outgoing European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager famously targeted big tech firms, especially Google and Amazon, for more antitrust scrutiny, and the epitaph[2] for the departing European Commission is basically one of struggling to shoehorn new economic models into existing regulatory frameworks. Why is France going it alone? France and other European countries tried to forge an EU-wide solution to the digital-tax dilemma, but as with so many issues inside the EU, consensus was elusive. A bloc of mostly Nordic countries and Ireland, which have big tech sectors, scuppered the idea. But France, while first out of the gate, isn't likely to remain alone for long. The U.K. is planning to implement a very similar digital tax measure[3] in 2020. Spain and Italy are also close to introducing their own measures, as is New Zealand. India is taking a different route[4] to achieve the same goal, proposing a change in tax rules to apply the same tax treatment to technology firms as to physical concerns. The move didn't go down well in Washington. The French measure, unsurprisingly, has sparked threats of reprisal in Washington. Even before the French law had passed, the United States opened a trade investigation under so-called Section 301 authorities\u2014the same authority used to start the trade war with China. Trump himself lambasted what he called 'Macron's foolishness' and threatened to raise U.S. tariffs on French wines, which the teetotaler said were inferior to American vintages. (He later clarified that, as a nondrinker, he just knows that U.S. wines 'look' better, though any tariffs on foreign wines could only help[5] his own Virginia-based vineyard.) The French agriculture minister replied in kind, labeling[6] the president's comments 'completely moronic.' From the U.S. point of view, the French measure unfairly targets U.S. firms, since American companies dominate the technology space. In fact, in many countries, the digital tax is known informally as the GAFA tax\u2014short for Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. France counters that European and Chinese firms will also be on the hook, and that the measure is meant to modernize the tax code, not single out one country for harsher treatment. The upshot is that France's unilateral move adds more fuel to the dumpster fire that is trans-Atlantic trade relations, which have been in an uneasy standoff for the past year. The two sides have been unable to even start real negotiations on a trade deal, as they have wildly different starting points. The United States wants to pry open all of Europe for U.S. agricultural exports, to which the French and others have repeatedly said no.Hanging over it all is the continued threat of U.S. tariffs on imports of European cars and car parts, which would be a huge blow to France and especially to Germany. France's digital tax just adds one more irritant to a relationship already estranged by bitter disagreements over defense, climate change, Iran, the China challenge, and more. So what's next? The G-7 summit late next month in France will be a first chance for France and the United States to grapple with the issue and see if they can build momentum for some sort of global solution[7]. Paris says it hopes to reach some sort of understanding with Washington and other big economies that will allow it to eventually substitute its unilateral measure for a global one. The problem is that unilateral consensus is hard to find. The EU[8], the OECD[9], the G-7, and the G-20 have all wrestled for years with the question[10] of how to bring early 20th-century tax rules in line with the 21st-century economy, where companies don't need a big physical presence in a country to rake in revenue and profits. France is hoping its opening move may be just enough pressure to break the years-long deadlock.

Ad Policy[3] But just because we still cling to the view that the longer the two of them remain viable candidates, arguing for bold, radical ideas, the better, doesn't mean everyone in our orbit shares that inclination. When Nation editorial board member Zephyr Teachout told me she was endorsing Sanders and asked if the magazine would be interested in publishing her reasons, I said, #8216;Of course.#8217; You can read the result here[4]. However, I also asked her colleagues on the board whether any of them cared to make the case for Warren. Richard Parker accepted the challenge. \u2014D.D. Guttenplan Of the four top-tier candidates still chasing the Democratic nomination, only Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders offer bold realignment as core to their campaigns. Joe Biden\u2014for me, and I'm guessing perhaps for you\u2014is the too-accommodating conciliator, while Pete Buttigieg, though immensely talented, is too young, too corporate, and without experience at the national or even state level.  Related Article In my view, Warren offers a far more plausible and more detailed case for how the next president must run the government once in office. Her #8216;I've got a plan for that#8217; is actually true: She and her staff tapped first-class teams of advisers from nationwide networks of progressive lawyers, economists, techies, educators, medical and military personnel, and environmentalists. In each of her plans[5], she has adroitly analyzed key issues (in readable, nontechnical language) and stated what her administration would do to address them. Whether you support her or someone else (or haven't yet made up your mind), it's well worth taking the time to pull a few of Warren's plans off her website: Big Tech, Big Money, Washington corruption, affordable housing, and student loan debt relief are just a few of the topics on offer. Read what she's actually proposing to do, not just in principle or as distant goals but with a clear road map that anchors each plan in legislation and executive action. Warren has also been consistently effective in helping elect other Democrats[6]\u2014allies a president will desperately need. In 2018 alone, she raised $8 million for congressional candidates, then personally called all 172 of them to offer her support and went on to meet with 61 of them face-to-face to lay out how to best deploy that support. She firmly grasps the reality the media's relentless, monocular focus on the presidential race misses: that in order to deliver bold change, the next president will need a Congress that shares (rather than checkmates) an agenda with the White House. She also understands\u2014and here's where her law school years really show\u2014the critical importance of putting in place a federal judiciary vastly different from the one that has been appointed since this president took office. Related Article Her opposition to Wall Street's endless predations has also been consistent, courageous, and persuasive\u2014and tied directly to her recognition that 40 years of growing income and wealth inequality won't be reversed without the reregulation of finance. She has taken on not just bankers but also fellow Democrats[7], including Larry Summers, Tim Geithner, and, by implication, President Obama himself when he prioritized saving too-big-to-fail banks rather than stopping foreclosures on the homes of 10 million families. She played public and behind-the-scenes roles in crafting the still-unused powers of the Dodd-Frank Act to tame Wall Street and in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Washington's first new (and under the Democrats, demonstrably effective) regulator since the New Deal.  Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/</url> In her skill and dedication campaigning for other candidates; in doggedly shepherding tough, controversial bills through Congress; and in constructing a significant federal agency from scratch, Warren has demonstrated her ability to both win elections and govern. Just as important, in weaving together support across the Democrats' diverse constituencies, she has shown herself to embody not just the prophetic but also the complex and very human mix of emotions most of us feel: indignation, empathy, hope, openness\u2014the deep, abiding yearning to turn America in a new direction. Time and again on the campaign trail, Warren has stunned audiences with her warmth and affection. In her September appearance[8] at Washington Square in New York City, she was an inspired teacher but nobody's schoolmarm. Her personal story\u2014of rising from poverty in Oklahoma, of juggling young motherhood with her studies, of translating academic research into policy and laws that have tangibly improved the lives of millions\u2014offers us insights into her character, history, motivations, and goals that resonate well beyond ultrablue voters and precincts. I firmly believe she is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump. Let me conclude, however, by talking not about Senator Warren but about you and me. This winter and spring, campaign hard for your candidate. Talk with your family, friends, and neighbors; use your social media to expand your advocacy. Knock on doors and call voters you don't know. Sign petitions. Affix bumper stickers. Wear buttons. Keep a record of what you've done and a calendar of what you're going to do between now and November. This is an election in which voter turnout may be as crucial as the votes themselves. I hope Elizabeth Warren is our next president, but more important, I want to be sure Donald Trump isn't. The next time you're asked which candidate you support this year, consider responding, #8216;I will support the nominee of the Democratic Party 100 percent.#8217; Any of the Democrats running\u2014any\u2014would be a far better president than the one we have now.

EDITOR'S NOTEAlthough The Nation has not\u2014yet\u2014endorsed a candidate in the Democratic presidential primaries, we've long made clear our admiration for the two real progressives in the race: Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Ad Policy[3] But just because we still cling to the view that the longer the two of them remain viable candidates, arguing for bold, radical ideas, the better, doesn't mean everyone in our orbit shares that inclination. When Nation editorial board member Zephyr Teachout told me she was endorsing Sanders and asked if the magazine would be interested in publishing her reasons, I said, 'Of course.' You can read the result here[4]. However, I also asked her colleagues on the board whether any of them cared to make the case for Warren. Richard Parker accepted the challenge. \u2014D.D. Guttenplan Of the four top-tier candidates still chasing the Democratic nomination, only Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders offer bold realignment as core to their campaigns. Joe Biden\u2014for me, and I'm guessing perhaps for you\u2014is the too-accommodating conciliator, while Pete Buttigieg, though immensely talented, is too young, too corporate, and without experience at the national or even state level.  Related Article In my view, Warren offers a far more plausible and more detailed case for how the next president must run the government once in office. Her 'I've got a plan for that' is actually true: She and her staff tapped first-class teams of advisers from nationwide networks of progressive lawyers, economists, techies, educators, medical and military personnel, and environmentalists. In each of her plans[5], she has adroitly analyzed key issues (in readable, nontechnical language) and stated what her administration would do to address them. Whether you support her or someone else (or haven't yet made up your mind), it's well worth taking the time to pull a few of Warren's plans off her website: Big Tech, Big Money, Washington corruption, affordable housing, and student loan debt relief are just a few of the topics on offer. Read what she's actually proposing to do, not just in principle or as distant goals but with a clear road map that anchors each plan in legislation and executive action. Warren has also been consistently effective in helping elect other Democrats[6]\u2014allies a president will desperately need. In 2018 alone, she raised $8 million for congressional candidates, then personally called all 172 of them to offer her support and went on to meet with 61 of them face-to-face to lay out how to best deploy that support. She firmly grasps the reality the media's relentless, monocular focus on the presidential race misses: that in order to deliver bold change, the next president will need a Congress that shares (rather than checkmates) an agenda with the White House. She also understands\u2014and here's where her law school years really show\u2014the critical importance of putting in place a federal judiciary vastly different from the one that has been appointed since this president took office. Related Article Her opposition to Wall Street's endless predations has also been consistent, courageous, and persuasive\u2014and tied directly to her recognition that 40 years of growing income and wealth inequality won't be reversed without the reregulation of finance. She has taken on not just bankers but also fellow Democrats[7], including Larry Summers, Tim Geithner, and, by implication, President Obama himself when he prioritized saving too-big-to-fail banks rather than stopping foreclosures on the homes of 10 million families. She played public and behind-the-scenes roles in crafting the still-unused powers of the Dodd-Frank Act to tame Wall Street and in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Washington's first new (and under the Democrats, demonstrably effective) regulator since the New Deal.  Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/</url> In her skill and dedication campaigning for other candidates; in doggedly shepherding tough, controversial bills through Congress; and in constructing a significant federal agency from scratch, Warren has demonstrated her ability to both win elections and govern. Just as important, in weaving together support across the Democrats' diverse constituencies, she has shown herself to embody not just the prophetic but also the complex and very human mix of emotions most of us feel: indignation, empathy, hope, openness\u2014the deep, abiding yearning to turn America in a new direction. Time and again on the campaign trail, Warren has stunned audiences with her warmth and affection. In her September appearance[8] at Washington Square in New York City, she was an inspired teacher but nobody's schoolmarm. Her personal story\u2014of rising from poverty in Oklahoma, of juggling young motherhood with her studies, of translating academic research into policy and laws that have tangibly improved the lives of millions\u2014offers us insights into her character, history, motivations, and goals that resonate well beyond ultrablue voters and precincts. I firmly believe she is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump. Let me conclude, however, by talking not about Senator Warren but about you and me. This winter and spring, campaign hard for your candidate. Talk with your family, friends, and neighbors; use your social media to expand your advocacy. Knock on doors and call voters you don't know. Sign petitions. Affix bumper stickers. Wear buttons. Keep a record of what you've done and a calendar of what you're going to do between now and November. This is an election in which voter turnout may be as crucial as the votes themselves. I hope Elizabeth Warren is our next president, but more important, I want to be sure Donald Trump isn't. The next time you're asked which candidate you support this year, consider responding, 'I will support the nominee of the Democratic Party 100 percent.' Any of the Democrats running\u2014any\u2014would be a far better president than the one we have now.

Also: The dopamine fasters of San Francisco.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(If you don\u2019t already get California Today delivered to your inbox, here\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">the sign-up</url>.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today\u2019s introduction comes from our colleague <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">Conor Dougherty</url>, an economics reporter who often writes about housing issues in the Bay Area:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past few months, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">Google</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">Facebook</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">Apple</url> have pledged to invest a total of $4.5 billion in land and loans toward stimulating the production of affordable housing in California.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">Our article</url> looks at how those efforts, laudable as they are, won\u2019t amount to much unless the state enacts land-use reforms that make it easier and cheaper to build.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The piece goes through the math of California\u2019s housing shortage \u2014 and the comical sums of money it would take to fix it. In comments on the article and on Twitter, a number of readers were shocked by one statistic in particular: It costs about $450,000 a unit to build subsidized affordable housing in California, according to the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at U.C. Berkeley. That\u2019s higher than any state, and while the precise numbers differ, the Government Accountability Office has also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">called out California</url> for having exceptionally high subsidized housing costs.</p><p>Mind you, that\u2019s not the cost of building a single-family home in a coastal city. It\u2019s the average cost of building a subsidized unit \u2014 a modest-sized apartment with bargain finishings in a four- to five-story building \u2014 across the state. And that\u2019s actually a lowball figure: In expensive and housing-starved cities like San Francisco, the price tag for a single unit of affordable housing is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">heading toward $1 million</url>.</p><p>Readers wanted to know how those costs got so high and what is behind it. The details are complicated, but the answer is pretty straightforward: Everything is behind it. Material costs are going up, land costs are going up, labor costs are going up. Add that to all the regulatory hurdles and developer impact fees \u2014 which in California are about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">three times the national average</url> \u2014 and it adds up to dubious distinctions like San Francisco being the second most expensive place to build       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">in the world</url>.</p><p>Not that this is all the fault of policy. Construction is one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">least productive industries</url>, and despite all that\u2019s happened with robots and computers, the building sector is about as efficient today as it was 50 years ago. To combat this, a number of developers are trying \u2014       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">with mixed success</url> \u2014 to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">build modular housing</url> that can be stacked like Legos, figuring that if they can move a large chunk of the construction process indoors to an assembly line, they can drastically lower the cost.</p><p>You can\u2019t talk about costs without getting into politics. Environmental rules, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">union wages</url>, fees that help fund schools: These are the sorts of priorities that any attempt to reduce construction costs will run into. But it\u2019s a conversation that has to happen, regardless of what side of the political aisle you\u2019re on.</p><p>The more it costs to build, the more subsidy it requires to make units affordable. The more subsidy it requires, the fewer people are served by it. In the end, building a building is building a building. Whether you\u2019re building condos for profit or subsidized housing to advance social equity, the basic process is the same. The higher it costs to do it, the fewer you will get.</p><p>[Read more of Conor\u2019s work <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\">here</url>.]</p><p>Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re following</p><p>We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

He is part of a growing chorus. Big tech's long honeymoon period is winding down. The European Union (EU) has been less than sanguine about tech giants' market dominance and practices for some years now. The United States Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, markedly more forgiving than their European counterparts, are also divvying up competition investigations into the tech giants. Calibrating competition policy to regulate digital markets will be a tricky business. But there are opportunities here, particularly for India, where such policy is still a relatively greenfield area.</p><p>US judge Robert Bork's 1978 work, The Antitrust Paradox, redefined competition regulation. He argued for economic efficiency: regulators should protect competition and the consumer, not competitors. Focusing on the latter can prevent companies from achieving economies of scale and benefiting consumers via lower prices. This made intuitive sense. It had the added attraction of bringing economic rigour to the delicate business of regulating markets. Bork influenced multiple jurisdictions, not just the US. The EU had its own imperatives - market integration, for one - but the consumer welfare standard is foregrounded in India's Competition Act, 2002. As the Supreme Court put it in Excel Crop Care vs. CCI, \"The ultimate goal of competition policy is to enhance consumer well-being.\"</p><p>But something is lost in translation when applying the consumer welfare standard to digital markets. Products like Google's search engine or Facebook operate in zero-price markets. The user benefits are immense and obvious. And in the absence of a price, there is no quantifiable user harm by the lights of conventional competition logic. Focusing on price, however, ignores what law professor, Daniel Solove, has dubbed \"architectural harms\" - long term, non-monetary drops in consumer well-being in markets where they surrender excessive data and attention in return for a free product. A small but growing body of jurisprudence and regulatory action is beginning to recognise these costs. The Competition Commission of India, for instance, has noted that users pay an \"implicit price in form of personal data\" when accessing online platforms.</p><p>There are other architectural harms as well. Over the past decade, the world's five largest tech companies have made over 400 acquisitions globally. None have been blocked and few have had riders attached to them. This creates an unhealthy innovation dynamic. Promising startups that could be potential rivals are snapped up. Alternatively, they are run out of town as Amazon did with Quidsi. Venture capital has learnt to invest accordingly. Thus, genuine competition takes place for the most part in areas that are not dominated by a monopoly or duopoly - workplace productivity, say, or urban transportation. Such competition stands a better chance of improving consumer choice in everything from pricing models to privacy protection.</p><p>Regulators globally are starting to grapple with these issues. There have been some innovative measures. Take Germany's Bundeskartellamt. It has ruled that Facebook cannot make access conditional on users allowing it to link non-Facebook data to their accounts. When it demands consent to this loss of control of personal data, it is abusing its dominant position given the lack of social network alternatives. Other cases merely need closer scrutiny.</p><p>Equally, there is overreach. Calls like Hughes's to break up big tech make little sense. Digital markets have unique characteristics. The network externalities that help an Uber attract more cab drivers as its user base grows, and vice versa, or the feedback loops that let Google improve its search engine the more search data it captures, mean that market concentration is inevitable. Admittedly, regulators could have taken a harder look at tech giants' acquisition spree. But post hoc attempts to remedy this would be long and not necessarily successful. It took US regulators a decade to break up AT&amp;#38;T. IBM held out for 13 years, and then the case against it was dropped. Nor would such attempts be appropriate for all tech giants. Apple is a juggernaut of vertical integration. Facebook has expanded horizontally. The others are conglomerates.</p><p>India has an advantage in some ways. The recent vintage of its competition regulation and lack of precedent mean that it has more room for manoeuvre when grappling with such thorny questions. How should pricing dynamics for multisided platforms that undercharge one side and recover costs from the other be assessed? How should relevant product markets and dominance be measured in digital markets? If information is to be considered an implicit cost that users pay for accessing \"free\" products, how much qualifies as abuse of a dominant market position?</p><p>Tech giants' abuse of market power is the symptom, not the problem. The problem is regulatory frameworks that haven't caught up with digital markets. Addressing it requires a measured approach, not blunt force solutions.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Mumbai.

He is part of a growing chorus. Big tech's long honeymoon period is winding down. The European Union (EU) has been less than sanguine about tech giants' market dominance and practices for some years now. The United States Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, markedly more forgiving than their European counterparts, are also divvying up competition investigations into the tech giants. Calibrating competition policy to regulate digital markets will be a tricky business. But there are opportunities here, particularly for India, where such policy is still a relatively greenfield area.</p><p>US judge Robert Bork's 1978 work, The Antitrust Paradox, redefined competition regulation. He argued for economic efficiency: regulators should protect competition and the consumer, not competitors. Focusing on the latter can prevent companies from achieving economies of scale and benefiting consumers via lower prices. This made intuitive sense. It had the added attraction of bringing economic rigour to the delicate business of regulating markets. Bork influenced multiple jurisdictions, not just the US. The EU had its own imperatives - market integration, for one - but the consumer welfare standard is foregrounded in India's Competition Act, 2002. As the Supreme Court put it in Excel Crop Care vs. CCI, \"The ultimate goal of competition policy is to enhance consumer well-being.\"</p><p>But something is lost in translation when applying the consumer welfare standard to digital markets. Products like Google's search engine or Facebook operate in zero-price markets. The user benefits are immense and obvious. And in the absence of a price, there is no quantifiable user harm by the lights of conventional competition logic. Focusing on price, however, ignores what law professor, Daniel Solove, has dubbed \"architectural harms\" - long term, non-monetary drops in consumer well-being in markets where they surrender excessive data and attention in return for a free product. A small but growing body of jurisprudence and regulatory action is beginning to recognise these costs. The Competition Commission of India, for instance, has noted that users pay an \"implicit price in form of personal data\" when accessing online platforms.</p><p>There are other architectural harms as well. Over the past decade, the world's five largest tech companies have made over 400 acquisitions globally. None have been blocked and few have had riders attached to them. This creates an unhealthy innovation dynamic. Promising startups that could be potential rivals are snapped up. Alternatively, they are run out of town as Amazon did with Quidsi. Venture capital has learnt to invest accordingly. Thus, genuine competition takes place for the most part in areas that are not dominated by a monopoly or duopoly - workplace productivity, say, or urban transportation. Such competition stands a better chance of improving consumer choice in everything from pricing models to privacy protection.</p><p>Regulators globally are starting to grapple with these issues. There have been some innovative measures. Take Germany's Bundeskartellamt. It has ruled that Facebook cannot make access conditional on users allowing it to link non-Facebook data to their accounts. When it demands consent to this loss of control of personal data, it is abusing its dominant position given the lack of social network alternatives. Other cases merely need closer scrutiny.</p><p>Equally, there is overreach. Calls like Hughes's to break up big tech make little sense. Digital markets have unique characteristics. The network externalities that help an Uber attract more cab drivers as its user base grows, and vice versa, or the feedback loops that let Google improve its search engine the more search data it captures, mean that market concentration is inevitable. Admittedly, regulators could have taken a harder look at tech giants' acquisition spree. But post hoc attempts to remedy this would be long and not necessarily successful. It took US regulators a decade to break up AT&amp;#38;T. IBM held out for 13 years, and then the case against it was dropped. Nor would such attempts be appropriate for all tech giants. Apple is a juggernaut of vertical integration. Facebook has expanded horizontally. The others are conglomerates.</p><p>India has an advantage in some ways. The recent vintage of its competition regulation and lack of precedent mean that it has more room for manoeuvre when grappling with such thorny questions. How should pricing dynamics for multisided platforms that undercharge one side and recover costs from the other be assessed? How should relevant product markets and dominance be measured in digital markets? If information is to be considered an implicit cost that users pay for accessing \"free\" products, how much qualifies as abuse of a dominant market position?</p><p>Tech giants' abuse of market power is the symptom, not the problem. The problem is regulatory frameworks that haven't caught up with digital markets. Addressing it requires a measured approach, not blunt force solutions.</p><p>Vikram Sinha is junior fellow and head, Strategic</p><p>Communication, IDFC Institute) (This is the first in a four-part series on data governance in India by the Data Governance Network).</p><p>The views expressed are personal</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Until recently, tech corporations were mainly involved in distribution rather than production. But now, instead of simply delivering TV shows, music and films onto our devices and screens, major firms are sinking huge amounts of money into the content itself[3]. The herald of this change was Netflix. Here was a tech company from the heart of Silicon Valley[4] which in 2011 began to commission expensive middlebrow fare for its video streaming service[5]. Amazon soon followed, and now Apple are poaching star TV executives[6], investing a billion dollars a year in production, and almost certainly planning a new video streaming site[7]. Google and Facebook are developing content strategies, too[8]. However, this shift is not, as some would have it[9], a case of boring old 'legacy' media companies giving way to smart, dynamic usurpers that will give the world better television. It is better understood as a wholesale media power grab by the tech sector. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/194593/original/file-20171114-26448-1jl426b.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/194593/original/file-20171114-26448-1jl426b.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>  Taking over? Jesse33/Shutterstock[10]  Blurred boundaries There is a precedent for media being dominated by a bigger, neighbouring sector. In the 20th century, many key developments in media and culture were driven by electronics[11] corporations. The recording and radio industries were essentially created in order to provide content to play on electronics devices - where initially the biggest profits lay. Once content itself became sufficiently lucrative, electronics firms established themselves in production and distribution, forming the heart of vast media oligopolies. Key US broadcasting network NBC was an offshoot of General Electric[12], big record companies were often subsidiaries of electronics giants, and later, Japanese electronics group Sony became a massive media force. Boundaries have blurred, but the electronics and tech sectors remain distinct, with their own cultures and industry bodies[13]. And the new tech oligopoly has even more power than the electronics corporations and media giants. It is important to understand where the now ubiquitous tech sector came from. In truth, it grew out of huge Cold War computing and communication state spending[14] as much as through bootstrap entrepreneurialism. But enthusiasts fervently believed that computers could serve well-being by decentralising communication, and were suspicious of the state. The industry's rapid growth in the 1990s came as global policy-making decisively moved to the view that markets rather than democratic institutions were best at determining how people's needs and desires might be met.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/194604/original/file-20171114-26448-1enss0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/194604/original/file-20171114-26448-1enss0b.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>  ENIAC performed ballistics trajectory calculations for the US Army. U.S. Army Photo/Wikipedia[15]  In this neoliberal version of capitalism, the new breed of tech companies were, unlike their established media and telecommunications peers, very lightly regulated[16]. This was the case not only in terms of competition, but also in terms of responsibility for what passed through their systems. Under US and many Western legal systems, internet service providers, search engines and social media platforms have only very limited liability for the content they host and circulate. Compared with media companies, they have minimal obligations to prevent the circulation of problematic content such as hate speech. They also have considerable freedom to collect and sell data about their users. What's more, media companies have often been compelled by law and regulation to provide materials that serve the public interest[17]. They have been required to make available information relevant to people's lives as citizens, and diverse entertainment and cultural programming. Crucially, the new platforms have no such responsibilities. This minimal burden helped nurture the growth of vast US tech corporations, including eventually the Big Five: Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft[18]. Death sentence? The recording industry was the first place where Big Tech disrupted media. Apple of course was crucial, but the key innovation wasn't the iPod and iTunes, it was the launch of the iPhone and AppStore. These made possible the new music streaming services, most notably Spotify and later Apple Music. For all the criticism it has faced[19], music streaming did manage to stabilise a struggling business - and laid the basis for the normalisation of paid streaming. Then Netflix arrived to begin the tech sector's challenge to cable and satellite for monthly fees, ultimately with its own expensive content. Now television is transmuting[20] into a system of rival subscription streaming services. Like the electronics giants of the 20th century, the tech companies initially stayed away from media content. This is why recent developments are so significant. Companies like Apple and Amazon bring vast resources to the world of audio-visual production (though for now they are keeping away from the less profitable business of recording music). The old media giants should not be mourned - partly because it's not clear that they're dying. Profits and revenues have diminished in music, publishing, and some parts of television, but vast businesses remain. In the US, still the epicentre of global tech and media, there are now two oligopolies in place. Silicon Valley wields its might through software engineering, patents, start-ups and venture capital; Hollywood still deals in stories and images, copyright, and networks of talent management. Telecoms corporations too[21] are increasingly active. These sectors sometimes compete[22], and often cooperate. But tech will undoubtedly dominate because of their vast resources, international range and monopoly power.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/194610/original/file-20171114-26440-l7f3pl.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/194610/original/file-20171114-26440-l7f3pl.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>  Sign of the times. Bernhard Richter/Shutterstock[23]  Public service media have many failings[24], but were founded on principles of serving citizens with high quality information and entertainment. They will increasingly struggle against the vast budgets of Silicon Valley and their Big Media frenemies. Regular regulation But should you worry? Yes. The 'fake news' storms[25] have shown how little tech corporations appear to consider their responsibility to society and democracy. They avoid tax[26]. Like the electronics corporations, their business model involves creating cycles of obsolescence and replacement that are deeply wasteful[27]. The tech oligopoly is further extending its reach over our experience of the world, capturing huge amounts of data about us[28] as it does so. For all the sumptuous content[29] that will no doubt be offered, we should heed calls from commentators[30] and policy-makers[31] for careful critique and stronger regulation. New laws and regulations appropriate for a new era[32] are needed to control tech corporations' operation of data about users, to make accountable the algorithmic processes by which the platforms operate[33], and to ensure that in this new communications world, people have access to truly diverse understandings of other lives, cultures and societies[34].

Even Facebook, which was at the centre of one of the biggest advertising scandals in history, has continued without regulation on its powers but it has a duty of care for its users.</p><p>VPN services can protect your privacy. Here are some of the best VPN services around.<br/>Did you know there is a day dedicated to your privacy? What is Data Privacy Day<br/>Here are the best free privacy software of 2019<br/>More regulations please! But why?</p><p>I want to highlight why tech regulation is needed for the industry. Should these businesses be able to continue to have such a significant impact on every area of our lives, with little to no punishment for breaches of our trust? Alternatively, do we need to find a new way to regulate the tech sector, to avoid fines that are insignificant in proportion to their revenue?</p><p>One of the main challenges is that businesses such as Facebook span multiple regions, making regulation difficult. It requires multiple nations agreeing on the same guidelines and the best way to implement them.</p><p>The French tech tax that has recently been proposed is one example of a nation trying to ensure that these businesses pay their fair share of tax, irrespective of which countries they have a physical presence in. Other countries are now expected to follow, but this only addresses one small area of regulating these businesses.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>At the end of last year, the UK government also proposed the implementation of a digital services tax, requiring all technology giants like Facebook to pay tax on the sales that they generate in the UK. The government has also proposed to launch a market study into the advertising models of the big tech giants, and how this is having a negative impact on publishers.</p><p>This thinking is a step in the right direction for the government, who should aim to &amp;#xA0;reshape the rules that ensure major tech businesses are operating ethically and are responsible for their actions in every region. Enormous fees and fines alone can often be insignificant to such heavyweights, and don&amp;#x2019;t always reflect the severity of actions.</p><p>Here is what I propose</p><p>Instead, we should introduce a regulatory watchdog. Most industries have some form of regulatory body that protects consumers and assists with complaints. These ombudsmen cover everything from telcos, to banking and even the NHS, with an independent team assisting in processing consumer queries. So why shouldn&amp;#x2019;t we have a similar process with tech businesses?</p><p>A watchdog would serve to scrutinise the powers of the big tech giants, adjust market power to allow competition to thrive, and demand greater transparency to build trust, resulting in a more positive online environment for all. We&amp;#x2019;ve seen that self-regulation hasn&amp;#x2019;t worked. A governing body that is able to implement suitable regulations that are sensible and fair would be the only solution to keep unfair practices in check.</p><p>The arguably more essential laws concern protecting individuals; it&amp;#x2019;s important to ensure that these businesses are not leveraging their size, scale, and influence to take advantage of consumers. GDPR was a small step forward here - and other countries are now also implementing similar guidelines - but there is still a lot of confusion around how this will be regulated in the long term.&amp;#xA0;</p><p>To protect users, I believe we should introduce an independent regulatory body like the ombudsman that already assist consumers in the UK. However, we would need buy-in from the tech companies to ensure this is achievable. Telcos are one area where this already works. For example, Vodafone arranged for the services and communication ombudsman to help with a huge number of complaints it was receiving, meaning issues could be resolved quicker than before, and consumers felt more confident and in control of their experience. &amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;</p><p>Taking on such large and powerful businesses like the Big Tech giants is incredibly daunting and we still have a long way to go to ensure that the rules around tech regulation consider the fast and growing pace of these businesses. It&amp;#x2019;s also important to ensure that the rules we do implement are able to adapt to any new technology that is constantly being introduced, whilst being watchful that they don&amp;#x2019;t become irrelevant before they even come into play. We aren&amp;#x2019;t ever going to make changes that resolve all of these issues overnight, but small steps in the right direction will make a long-term difference, and we should start now.</p><p>Ruth Manielevitch is VP Global Business Development at Taptica, a publicly traded, global end-to-end mobile advertising platform that helps the world's top brands reach their most valuable users.<br/>Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBREAK-139439223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBREAK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJX-6701-F11P-X173-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TBREAK MEDIA Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

On the hilly streets of San Francisco and through the suburban sprawl of Silicon Valley the excitement was palpable as newly minted tycoons splashed the proceeds from their IPOs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Relieved that the Millennium Bug had proven to be a damp squib, during the first 10 weeks of 2000 the techheavy Nasdaq index jumped nearly 30pc. Powered by shares in companies such as AOL, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Pets.com\">www.Pets.com</url> and Yahoo! - whose stock price doubled in December 1999 alone - the index rocketed from below 4,000 in January to a peak of 5,048 by March 10.</p><p>Two decades later, as we approach the anniversary of the dotcom crash, the parallels seem stark - at least superficially. The big names may be different but the swollen valuations surrounding them seem familiar.</p><p>On Tuesday, shares in Tesla rose 14pc, meaning the electric carmaker's market cap has more than doubled so far this year. At $160bn (\u00a3123bn), it is now worth more than three times General Motors and is exceeded only by Toyota, which made 9m cars in 2019 compared to Tesla's 367,500.</p><p>Tesla, however, is left in the shade by the true giants of global tech. Put together, two of the biggest US tech companies - Apple and Microsoft - are now worth just under $2.8 trillion. That is more than the valuation of the entire FTSE 100 (about \u00a32 trillion or $2.6 trillion) and modestly higher than the GDP of Great Britain in 2019 ($2.7 trillion), according to IMF figures.</p><p>Such dizzying statistics prompt an inevitable question: How far have we ventured into bubble territory? And will 2020 see a great unravelling in tech valuations, just as in 2000? Complacency would be foolish, but there are important differences. The bull-market rally which peaked in 2000 was propelled by real technological advances and the commercialisation of the internet.</p><p>There were solid, profitable companies involved such as Intel, Cisco and Oracle. Others like Amazon and eBay survived the shakedown and bounced back a few years later.</p><p>Nevertheless, when Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, warned in 1996 of \"irrational exuberance\" in the markets he was on to something. A feeding frenzy was emerging. Powered by cheap money, easy capital and overconfidence, it fuelled a speculative bubble where seemingly any company which slapped a dotcom on to its name could raise cash, often with the flimsiest of business plans, little real proprietary technology and minimal revenues.</p><p>Fast forward 20 years and the situation is rather different.</p><p>There are fewer IPOs of immature companies now and all of the stars of the current boom are mature companies which earn real money.</p><p>Facebook, at 15 years of age, is the youngest of the so-called FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) group whose combined market value jumped 40pc in 2019 compared with a rise of 25pc in the broader US market. In fact, all of the 16 US tech companies worth more than $100bn are now more than 15 years old - and although they are a diverse bunch, they are all financially robust.</p><p>In the three months up to Dec 28, Apple reported revenues of $91.8bn and profits of $22.2bn. It is sitting on a cash pile of $207bn - higher than the GDP of New Zealand. Even Tesla posted a $105m profit in the fourth quarter on revenues of $7.4bn.</p><p>None of this means these companies may not be overvalued. In fact, they are - just not by historically distorted levels. Apple's shares are currently trading at a P/E ratio of just over 25 - slightly below McDonald's at 27. Facebook is at 32.5 and Google-owner Alphabet at 30.75, which is high but not insane. It may be that the market is due a shake-out but the real risks this time around are probably different.</p><p>Big tech companies are increasingly facing a regulatory crackdown amid criticism of the social harm inflicted by their products and the contribution they make in terms of tax. These threats are not equally shared. The \"tech sector\" is disparate.</p><p>Tesla, whose share price jump this week was probably driven largely by the unwinding of short positions by hedge funds, is probably better viewed as a disruptive carmaker than a tech company. Meanwhile, Apple's devicefocused business is fundamentally different from that of Google or Facebook, which are effectively advertising companies. None are easily compared with Amazon, which is better viewed as a retailer with a cloud computing business bolted on.</p><p>On a related point, the biggest tech \"blow-up\" of the past year was WeWork, which is not a tech company at all but a specialist property leasing business which never made it to IPO. Either way, it probably pays to look more closely at the performance of these companies before drawing glib comparisons with 20 years ago.</p><p>From a European perspective, there is something else worrying. All these companies are American and Europe's failure to produce a tech challenger is an understandable concern. The UK may have a vibrant tech start-up scene but few of our companies get beyond even 0.1pc of the valuation of the giants. Britain's biggest listed tech company is Sage, an accounting software business worth \u00a38bn. That is 1pc of Amazon's market cap.</p><p>That is something the UK needs to remedy if it is to build a tech-powered 21st century economy.</p><p>'Apple is sitting on a cash pile of $207bn - higher than the GDP of New Zealand'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-157216568</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4Y-1741-JCBW-N55F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0007598</classCode><className>IPET HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

I spoke with Jason Moss, cofounder of Metis, this week to hear more about their strategy.</p><p>Here's the basics: Kaplan will run at least three more boot camps in Manhattan on top of a previously disclosed software coding camp that starts Monday, including one each in the new fields of data science and digital design. After starting with a single boot camp in Boston, the for-profit education giant is becoming increasingly explicit about its hopes for this non-traditional option.</p><p>The why is easy. Moss told me Kaplan sees the same forces at work as its competitors: A persistent <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/tech-talent-chase-demand-engineers-local-startups-squarespace-piling-perks-article-1.1601996\">struggle among employers</url> to hire qualified people for high-tech positions, and students eager for credentials that don't come along with the extraordinary opportunity costs of college.</p><p>But the surprise isn't that Kaplan's doing it, it's that Kaplan isn't being even more aggressive. There are thousands of unfilled tech jobs in New York, and most boot camps still reject the vast majority of applicants. Kaplan, a division of former Washington Post owner Graham Holdings Co., booked $284 million in revenue last year but has <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/06/washington-post-kaplan_n_3715396.html\">struggled amid regulatory scrutiny</url> in recent years and could really use a strong new stream of revenue.</p><p>Moss said they're moving cautiously because the end user of these programs - large employers - are still dubious. Startups like boot camps, but big tech companies remain unconvinced. \"Most employers haven't really considered boot camps for their hiring needs,\" Moss said. \"What's necessary for larger growth is that this becomes as much of a viable hiring option for mega-corporations and global companies as it is for young, digital startups.\"</p><p>Then of course you have the difficult tradeoff of growing an education business: Are you going for broad impact or narrow, high-quality impact? There's little doubt Kaplan could make money if it launched a slew of boot camps, but would the teachers and students in those programs be up to par? Talent acquisition and student market-building takes time, Moss said.</p><p>This is a similar issue being confronted by the Flatiron School, a highly regarding boot camp program in the Financial District that <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2014/04/09/flatiron-school-takes-on-5-5-million.html?page=all\">took on $5.5 million in venture funding</url> earlier this year but doesn't plan to expand its capacity. They've focused narrowly on making sure their 250 graduates so far are nothing short of elite.</p><p>Kaplan is looking at demand patterns and expects to launch boot camps in other cities, but Moss wouldn't identify them by name.</p><p>\"I don't want to misspeak,\" Moss said. \"There is great enthusiasm for what we're doing, but I think there is still a smart way to grow, and Kaplan wants to make sure we're getting it right, on sort of the outcome measurements, before we turn the crank too much.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

For the industry, the danger is that the next president could espouse policies harmful to tech's bottom line, from pushing for tougher antitrust action to restricting government contracts for companies unwilling to change their ways. </p><p>Klobuchar sounded the theme at the very start of her campaign, during the announcement speech in February where she stood in blowing snow in Minneapolis. </p><p>\"For too long the big tech companies have been telling you 'Don't worry! We've got your back!' while your identities are being stolen and your data is mined,\" the Minnesota senator said.</p><p>Even Cory Booker, a Stanford grad with close ties to Silicon Valley, used a recent NPR interview to lump tech in with other powerful lobbies that need to be reined in. \"We need to make sure that whether it's Silicon Valley or the pharma industry or the big ag, we need to hold people accountable for their actions,\" he said.</p><p>Of the dozen or so prominent Democrats taking steps towards the White House, at least half have decried the power of the U.S. tech industry, talking on the campaign trail about greater antitrust enforcement, stronger privacy regulations and other moves to check Silicon Valley's power.</p><p>Should a Democrat win the White House from President Donald Trump, the tech industry might find itself the target of serious efforts to tame what Pete Buttigieg - the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a long-shot White House hopeful - calls tech's \"complete Wild West environment.\"</p><p>The risks for the industry are real, even if any president has only limited ability to restrain the industry through executive action alone. The Oval Office would still be a perch for rallying allies on Capitol Hill, the way Obama did on health care and Trump has on taxes. A tech-skeptic president could also use the White House as a bully pulpit to prod regulators to impose fines and oppose corporate mergers.</p><p>Warren has taken the hardest line of all, calling for the federal government to shrink and split up industry giants like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. \"To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies,\" she wrote in a blog post this month.</p><p>The Massachusetts senator later singled out Facebook after POLITICO reported that the social media company had taken down Warren campaign ads calling for its breakup. Facebook soon restored the ads, but Warren said the episode only underscored the need for \"a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor.\"</p><p>Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz publicly took Warren's side in that dispute - a rare occurrence that underscores the bipartisan populist appeal of the tech backlash. A Morning Consult/POLITICO poll earlier this month found that near-identical pluralities of Democrats and Republicans agreed with the statement, \"Technology companies have too much power and the federal government should step in to regulate more.\"</p><p>Still, the anti-tech posture is especially popular on the Democrats' left flank. \"Just because a monopoly business happens to be online, that doesn't mean it's good,\" progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted Monday night, in response to the same POLITICO article on Warren and Facebook.</p><p>Trump has taken his own shots at tech, accusing companies like Google and Twitter of being biased against conservatives and branding Amazon a \"no-tax monopoly.\" </p><p>But the tech industry has largely thrived under Trump's policies, benefiting from his broad deregulatory bent and enjoying a bottom-line boon from tax code changes, such as a reduction of the corporate tax rate on holdings brought to the U.S. from overseas. </p><p>In contrast, Democrats vying for their party's nomination insist they will push for real consequences for tech's perceived misdeeds. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii announced her own White House candidacy by calling for the need to \"stand up against overreaching intel agencies and big tech companies who take away our civil liberties and freedoms in the name of national security and corporate greed.\"</p><p>Sanders, who declared his White House bid in mid-February, has railed against Amazon and CEO Jeff Bezos over everything from the wages the company pays its workers to its low aggregate tax. While Trump has raised the latter issue in the context of veiled threats against Bezos' Washington Post, Sanders has inveighed directly against Amazon's tax minimization efforts. </p><p>\"I think most Americans would agree that it is a bit absurd in that you have in the case of Amazon a company owned by the wealthiest person in the world that made, I believe, 11 billion in profits last year and didn't pay a nickel in federal taxes,\" Sanders told POLITICO. \"I don't think too many Americans think that makes sense.\" </p><p>(An Amazon spokesperson told POLITICO, \"Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate.\") </p><p>Buttigieg told NPR early in his candidacy it's unacceptable to let tech companies like Facebook continue on unchecked when it comes to data privacy, calling it \"one of the most important dimensions of our citizenship, of our life and society.\"</p><p>One exception so far is former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, the latest Democratic contender to enter the race, who has largely stayed on the sidelines as tech criticism has grown more fiery and pointed. </p><p>When O'Rourke made his unsuccessful bid last year for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's Senate seat, his campaign site called for stronger antitrust regulations to take on monopolies and protect consumers. But O'Rourke didn't call out tech companies by name, and he's broadly seemed cozier with Silicon Valley than some of his fellow candidates. </p><p>During his Senate run, O'Rourke was the nation's top recipient of individual campaign donations from staffers at a number of tech companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, Intel and IBM. He also spent more on Facebook ads than any other candidate for national office in the 2018 cycle. </p><p>In his 2020 announcement speech Thursday, O'Rourke's tech talk was limited to pushing to get broadband out to rural areas for use in farming and education - and, he joked, to give all Americans the ability to \"go on Tinder to find that special date.\"</p><p>Still, the willingness of so many Democrats to take on Silicon Valley is something of an about-face from Obama's enthusiastic embrace of the tech industry, as he oversaw an administration that worked closely with Google officials. </p><p>And 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's operation tried to carefully lay groundwork for Silicon Valley support, including issuing a detailed tech and innovation agenda vetted by some in the tech industry. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg was even widely reported to be on Clinton's shortlist to join her Cabinet as Treasury or Commerce secretary. </p><p>The marked contrast Democrats with an eye on 2020 have struck against their party's once sunny view on tech is perhaps nowhere more evident than in a stop Zuckerberg made during a high-profile tour of the U.S. just two years ago. His coast-to-coast visits drove widespread speculation that Zuckerberg had his own designs on the Oval Office, though he always maintained he simply wanted to better understand the average Facebook user.</p><p>Zuckerberg's odyssey included a surprise visit to South Bend, Ind., where he stopped by The Local Cup coffee shop and toured the former factory of iconic early carmaker Studebaker. His host? The town's mayor and an old friend of Zuckerberg's from Harvard, Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-1223072</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-BV31-F118-951W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1474\"/><timeReceived>6:40 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For the industry, the danger is that the next president could espouse policies harmful to tech's bottom line, from pushing for tougher antitrust action to restricting government contracts for companies unwilling to change their ways. </p><p>Klobuchar sounded the theme at the very start of her campaign, during the announcement speech in February where she stood in blowing snow in Minneapolis. </p><p>\"For too long the big tech companies have been telling you 'Don't worry! We've got your back!' while your identities are being stolen and your data is mined,\" the Minnesota senator said.</p><p>Even Cory Booker, a Stanford grad with close ties to Silicon Valley, used a recent NPR interview to lump tech in with other powerful lobbies that need to be reined in. \"We need to make sure that whether it's Silicon Valley or the pharma industry or the big ag, we need to hold people accountable for their actions,\" he said.</p><p>Of the dozen or so prominent Democrats taking steps towards the White House, at least half have decried the power of the U.S. tech industry, talking on the campaign trail about greater antitrust enforcement, stronger privacy regulations and other moves to check Silicon Valley's power.</p><p>Should a Democrat win the White House from President Donald Trump, the tech industry might find itself the target of serious efforts to tame what Pete Buttigieg - the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a long-shot White House hopeful - calls tech's \"complete Wild West environment.\"</p><p>The risks for the industry are real, even if any president has only limited ability to restrain the industry through executive action alone. The Oval Office would still be a perch for rallying allies on Capitol Hill, the way Obama did on health care and Trump has on taxes. A tech-skeptic president could also use the White House as a bully pulpit to prod regulators to impose fines and oppose corporate mergers.</p><p>Warren has taken the hardest line of all, calling for the federal government to shrink and split up industry giants like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. \"To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies,\" she wrote in a blog post this month.</p><p>The Massachusetts senator later singled out Facebook after POLITICO reported that the social media company had taken down Warren campaign ads calling for its breakup. Facebook soon restored the ads, but Warren said the episode only underscored the need for \"a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor.\"</p><p>Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz publicly took Warren's side in that dispute - a rare occurrence that underscores the bipartisan populist appeal of the tech backlash. A Morning Consult/POLITICO poll earlier this month found that near-identical pluralities of Democrats and Republicans agreed with the statement, \"Technology companies have too much power and the federal government should step in to regulate more.\"</p><p>Still, the anti-tech posture is especially popular on the Democrats' left flank. \"Just because a monopoly business happens to be online, that doesn't mean it's good,\" progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted Monday night, in response to the same POLITICO article on Warren and Facebook.</p><p>Trump has taken his own shots at tech, accusing companies like Google and Twitter of being biased against conservatives and branding Amazon a \"no-tax monopoly.\" </p><p>But the tech industry has largely thrived under Trump's policies, benefiting from his broad deregulatory bent and enjoying a bottom-line boon from tax code changes, such as a reduction of the corporate tax rate on holdings brought to the U.S. from overseas. </p><p>In contrast, Democrats vying for their party's nomination insist they will push for real consequences for tech's perceived misdeeds. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii announced her own White House candidacy by calling for the need to \"stand up against overreaching intel agencies and big tech companies who take away our civil liberties and freedoms in the name of national security and corporate greed.\"</p><p>Sanders, who declared his White House bid in mid-February, has railed against Amazon and CEO Jeff Bezos over everything from the wages the company pays its workers to its low aggregate tax. While Trump has raised the latter issue in the context of veiled threats against Bezos' Washington Post, Sanders has inveighed directly against Amazon's tax minimization efforts. </p><p>\"I think most Americans would agree that it is a bit absurd in that you have in the case of Amazon a company owned by the wealthiest person in the world that made, I believe, 11 billion in profits last year and didn't pay a nickel in federal taxes,\" Sanders told POLITICO. \"I don't think too many Americans think that makes sense.\" </p><p>(An Amazon spokesperson told POLITICO, \"Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate.\") </p><p>Buttigieg told NPR early in his candidacy it's unacceptable to let tech companies like Facebook continue on unchecked when it comes to data privacy, calling it \"one of the most important dimensions of our citizenship, of our life and society.\"</p><p>One exception so far is former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, the latest Democratic contender to enter the race, who has largely stayed on the sidelines as tech criticism has grown more fiery and pointed. </p><p>When O'Rourke made his unsuccessful bid last year for GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's Senate seat, his campaign site called for stronger antitrust regulations to take on monopolies and protect consumers. But O'Rourke didn't call out tech companies by name, and he's broadly seemed cozier with Silicon Valley than some of his fellow candidates. </p><p>During his Senate run, O'Rourke was the nation's top recipient of individual campaign donations from staffers at a number of tech companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, Intel and IBM. He also spent more on Facebook ads than any other candidate for national office in the 2018 cycle. </p><p>In his 2020 announcement speech Thursday, O'Rourke's tech talk was limited to pushing to get broadband out to rural areas for use in farming and education - and, he joked, to give all Americans the ability to \"go on Tinder to find that special date.\"</p><p>Still, the willingness of so many Democrats to take on Silicon Valley is something of an about-face from Obama's enthusiastic embrace of the tech industry, as he oversaw an administration that worked closely with Google officials. </p><p>And 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's operation tried to carefully lay groundwork for Silicon Valley support, including issuing a detailed tech and innovation agenda vetted by some in the tech industry. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg was even widely reported to be on Clinton's shortlist to join her Cabinet as Treasury or Commerce secretary. </p><p>The marked contrast Democrats with an eye on 2020 have struck against their party's once sunny view on tech is perhaps nowhere more evident than in a stop Zuckerberg made during a high-profile tour of the U.S. just two years ago. His coast-to-coast visits drove widespread speculation that Zuckerberg had his own designs on the Oval Office, though he always maintained he simply wanted to better understand the average Facebook user.</p><p>Zuckerberg's odyssey included a surprise visit to South Bend, Ind., where he stopped by The Local Cup coffee shop and toured the former factory of iconic early carmaker Studebaker. His host? The town's mayor and an old friend of Zuckerberg's from Harvard, Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>Cristiano Lima contributed to this report.</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-1224008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNM-9601-JDJ6-K4CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1474\"/><timeReceived>10:50 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 17, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Whether the platform is owned by Canadians or Americans, it doesn't matter,\" says Lyrette whose company Zenith Canada includes such clients as entertainment giant 20th Century Fox, multinational cosmetic company Coty and Canada Post. \"The end result is what matters.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the Toronto-based Zenith, digital marketing now makes up about 40 per cent of all requests, with the rest split among radio, TV and print. That's up significantly from what it was only years ago, and the trend is increasing, says Lyrette.</p><p>Within the digital space, Google and Facebook command the overwhelming share of advertising dollars at about 72 per cent. The rest is divided up amongst other media, including legacy publishers like magazines and newspapers, who fight for an increasingly smaller share of the pie. In 2018, the amount Canadian marketers spent on digital advertising was estimated to be $7.7 billion.</p><p>There are a myriad of reasons for the dominance of big-tech companies in the advertising world, including better capitalization, analytics, technology, superior targeting and return on investment even as legacy publishers struggle to catch up.</p><p>Some critics argue tech companies have been given a free ride on outdated tax regulations that have caused a crisis in Canada's media industry.</p><p>Canada's tax code was not written for the digital age. And one small but significant change could help to level the playing field between tech giants and domestic publishers.</p><p>Ads purchased on foreign-owned websites are tax deductible under the federal Income Tax Act. That loophole should be closed, critics say, because it encourages local businesses to buy into foreign platforms.</p><p>\"I think the common thread we've had so far is that when given a choice between standing up for Canada's interests or doing basically nothing, the government has gone with the latter,\" says Daniel Bernhard, executive director of the media watchdog group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"Silicon Valley has basically done whatever they wanted. We haven't applied our rules when they are involved and that's become really expensive to all Canadians.\"</p><p>Section 19 of the Income Tax Act was created to help Canadian publishers gain a foothold against their more established foreign competition in order to support domestic news coverage. That legislation was made in the print era. Domestic advertisers couldn't deduct the cost of their advertising in Time's print edition, but they could if they advertised in Time's Canadian competitor Maclean's. However, the restriction doesn't apply to websites.</p><p>\"Essentially, you get a situation where you aren't able to deduct your advertising if you advertise in the print edition of the New York Times, but you get to do that in the online edition, which is completely ludicrous,\" says Bernhard.</p><p>A 2016 study by Bernhard's group found that tax deductibility wouldn't necessarily solve the problem, but it might redirect anywhere from 5 to 10 per cent of annual ad spending to Canadian websites.</p><p>\"It certainly wouldn't be enough to totally change the balance, but it would be a substantial move,\" says Bruce Neve, president of independently owned media-buying company True Media Canada. \"It would be interesting to see what the results would be like if it were really a level playing field.\"</p><p>According to the 2016 study, tax deductibility could bring in an additional $250 million to $450 million in revenue into Canadian coffers. And that number would be even higher today. So far, despite intensive lobbying, the federal government hasn't budged on the original interpretation of Section 19.</p><p>\"Closing the loophole would be a clear message that the government of Canada values Canadian content and Canadian content producers, that they're not scared of Facebook and Google,\" says John Hinds, president and CEO of News Media Canada, which represents daily, weekly and community newspapers across the country. \"Nobody's asking for a free lunch. We just want them to apply the rules to account for the fact we are living in a digital age.\"</p><p>The question is, should Canadian consumers care where they see their advertising? Should advertisers care where they advertise?</p><p>\"One issue is that advertising pays for 90 per cent of the journalism that tells readers more about their backyard, while the internet companies don't have an obligation to tell Canadian stories, they don't have to put anything back,\" says Howard Law, director media sector for Unifor, the country's largest media union, which represents local broadcast workers at CTV and Citytv and newspapers such as the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to queries from the Star. However, Google Canada spokesperson Aaron Brindle stressed his platform shares a \"common mission\" with Canadian publishers.</p><p>\"The fate of Google and the publishing industry are inextricably linked,\" says Brindle in a statement to the Star. \"An open press and healthy news industry plays a critical role in our democracy.\"</p><p>Billions of clicks a month are driven to publishers' websites for free, representing an opportunity for them to grow and monetize an audience, argues Google. Globally, the company shared more than $13 billion with publishers in 2018.</p><p>\"By sharing revenue, driving traffic and supporting innovation we see ourselves as partners to the news industry,\" says Brindle.</p><p>Not all publishers agree with the concept of making it more expensive for Canadians to advertise on foreign platforms.</p><p>Jeff Elgie, publisher of Village Media Inc., a collection of hyperlocal community news websites in Ontario, says that would be a \"huge mistake.\" He says Canadians would be \"effectively disadvantaged\" against anyone outside our borders when it comes to buying advertising.</p><p>\"The U.S. company selling widget 'X' to Canadians, buying ads through Google or Facebook to target Canadians, is going to be able to deduct those expenses, while the Canadian company attempting to do the same thing is not,\" says Elgie. \"Does the media industry really want to have a narrative that suggests that because they want these channels penalized, that every other business in Canada has to be penalized as well?\"</p><p>But critics and government watchdogs say more can be done to make sure digital companies pay their fair share.</p><p>On a separate but significant tax issue, the Canadian auditor general found this month that the Canadian sales tax system has \"not kept pace with the rapidly evolving digital marketplace.\"</p><p>Because they failed to collect the GST on companies such as Netflix, Google and Facebook, Canada lost $169 million in 2017 on digital products and services sold nationally according to the auditor general. That's because companies that don't have a substantial physical presence in Canada do not have to collect taxes. It's up to the consumer to remit those taxes to the government, but that happens rarely, if ever.</p><p>Despite the reluctance of the federal government, Quebec and Saskatchewan, meanwhile have been collecting provincial sales taxes from digital companies since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Facebook has said they would voluntarily collect and remit sales taxes to Ottawa. They are expected to do that sometime in the second half of the year. But Google so far has not followed suit, leaving it up to regulators.</p><p>\"Should the federal government create legislation to require the collection of value-added taxes on digital sales, we would comply with that legislation,\" says Google's Brindle. \"Quebec passed legislation that requires the collection of Quebec Sales Tax. We comply with that legislation.\"</p><p>Unifor's Law meanwhile, says the Canadian government could consider a specific digital content tax similar to some European Union countries that are implementing taxes of anywhere from 2 per cent to a suggested 6 per cent of revenues.</p><p>That situation is similar to the plight of Canadian broadcasters who have noted that competitors such as Netflix don't have to contribute a percentage of their profits into entities such as the Canadian Media Fund. If they did, those funds would go into making Canadian television content. Similarly, some of the proceeds of that digital content tax could be diverted into creating local news.</p><p>\"A content tax could make sense. (Foreign digital platforms) make no significant contribution to journalism, but they vacuum up the advertising dollars,\" says Law.</p><p>Despite the fact she has to be dispassionate about where she places her clients' budgets, media buyer Lyrette says she understands the importance of supporting local media. But she's not in the charity business. Clients want to go where they feel they can get the most eyeballs on a cost effective basis.</p><p>\"In some ways it is the beginning of the end. If you're not supporting your own local community, that media community will eventually go away,\" says Lyrette. \"It's still important to have a local market otherwise your community won't be reflected in it. It's a pretty basic question. But it's also a competitive landscape.\"</p><p>The Trudeau government meanwhile, is paying close attention to the issues of privacy, hate speech and electoral interference. On Thursday, the prime minister announced a \" Digital Charter\" to rein in the industry, including financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p>But so far it hasn't looked at what Hinds says is the underlying issue: The health of the industry.</p><p>\"There are a lot of words around fake news and hate speech. But they have not addressed the business side of the equation. To combat all that, you have to have a healthy industry of credible, legitimate players,\" says Hinds. \"You have to fix that issue first if you are to have any long-term sustainability. What's hopeful is that the rest of the world is engaged in that discussion. And hopefully Canadians will catch on, too.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

We haven't applied our rules when they are involved and that's become really expensive to all Canadians.\"</p><p>Section 19 of the Income Tax Act was created to help Canadian publishers gain a foothold against their more established foreign competition in order to support domestic news coverage. That legislation was made in the print era. Domestic advertisers couldn't deduct the cost of their advertising in Time's print edition, but they could if they advertised in Time's Canadian competitor Maclean's. However, the restriction doesn't apply to websites.</p><p>\"Essentially, you get a situation where you aren't able to deduct your advertising if you advertise in the print edition of the New York Times, but you get to do that in the online edition, which is completely ludicrous,\" says Bernhard.</p><p>A 2016 study by Bernhard's group found that tax deductibility wouldn't necessarily solve the problem, but it might redirect anywhere from 5 to 10 per cent of annual ad spending to Canadian websites.</p><p>\"It certainly wouldn't be enough to totally change the balance, but it would be a substantial move,\" says Bruce Neve, president of independently owned media-buying company True Media Canada. \"It would be interesting to see what the results would be like if it were really a level playing field.\"</p><p>According to the 2016 study, tax deductibility could bring in an additional $250 million to $450 million in revenue into Canadian coffers. And that number would be even higher today. So far, despite intensive lobbying, the federal government hasn't budged on the original interpretation of Section 19.</p><p>\"Closing the loophole would be a clear message that the government of Canada values Canadian content and Canadian content producers, that they're not scared of Facebook and Google,\" says John Hinds, president and CEO of News Media Canada, which represents daily, weekly and community newspapers across the country. \"Nobody's asking for a free lunch. We just want them to apply the rules to account for the fact we are living in a digital age.\"</p><p>The question is, should Canadian consumers care where they see their advertising? Should advertisers care where they advertise?</p><p>\"One issue is that advertising pays for 90 per cent of the journalism that tells readers more about their backyard, while the internet companies don't have an obligation to tell Canadian stories, they don't have to put anything back,\" says Howard Law, director media sector for Unifor, the country's largest media union, which represents local broadcast workers at CTV and Citytv and newspapers such as the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to queries from the Star. However, Google Canada spokesperson Aaron Brindle stressed his platform shares a \"common mission\" with Canadian publishers.</p><p>\"The fate of Google and the publishing industry are inextricably linked,\" says Brindle in a statement to the Star. \"An open press and healthy news industry plays a critical role in our democracy.\"</p><p>Billions of clicks a month are driven to publishers' websites for free, representing an opportunity for them to grow and monetize an audience, argues Google. Globally, the company shared more than $13 billion with publishers in 2018.</p><p>\"By sharing revenue, driving traffic and supporting innovation we see ourselves as partners to the news industry,\" says Brindle.</p><p>Not all publishers agree with the concept of making it more expensive for Canadians to advertise on foreign platforms.</p><p>Jeff Elgie, publisher of Village Media Inc., a collection of hyperlocal community news websites in Ontario, says that would be a \"huge mistake.\" He says Canadians would be \"effectively disadvantaged\" against anyone outside our borders when it comes to buying advertising.</p><p>\"The U.S. company selling widget 'X' to Canadians, buying ads through Google or Facebook to target Canadians, is going to be able to deduct those expenses, while the Canadian company attempting to do the same thing is not,\" says Elgie. \"Does the media industry really want to have a narrative that suggests that because they want these channels penalized, that every other business in Canada has to be penalized as well?\"</p><p>But critics and government watchdogs say more can be done to make sure digital companies pay their fair share.</p><p>On a separate but significant tax issue, the Canadian auditor general found this month that the Canadian sales tax system has \"not kept pace with the rapidly evolving digital marketplace.\"</p><p>Because they failed to collect the GST on companies such as Netflix, Google and Facebook, Canada lost $169 million in 2017 on digital products and services sold nationally according to the auditor general. That's because companies that don't have a substantial physical presence in Canada do not have to collect taxes. It's up to the consumer to remit those taxes to the government, but that happens rarely, if ever.</p><p>Despite the reluctance of the federal government, Quebec and Saskatchewan, meanwhile have been collecting provincial sales taxes from digital companies since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Facebook has said they would voluntarily collect and remit sales taxes to Ottawa. They are expected to do that sometime in the second half of the year. But Google so far has not followed suit, leaving it up to regulators.</p><p>\"Should the federal government create legislation to require the collection of value-added taxes on digital sales, we would comply with that legislation,\" says Google's Brindle. \"Quebec passed legislation that requires the collection of Quebec Sales Tax. We comply with that legislation.\"</p><p>Unifor's Law meanwhile, says the Canadian government could consider a specific digital content tax similar to some European Union countries that are implementing taxes of anywhere from 2 per cent to a suggested 6 per cent of revenues.</p><p>That situation is similar to the plight of Canadian broadcasters who have noted that competitors such as Netflix don't have to contribute a percentage of their profits into entities such as the Canadian Media Fund. If they did, those funds would go into making Canadian television content. Similarly, some of the proceeds of that digital content tax could be diverted into creating local news.</p><p>\"A content tax could make sense. (Foreign digital platforms) make no significant contribution to journalism, but they vacuum up the advertising dollars,\" says Law.</p><p>Despite the fact she has to be dispassionate about where she places her clients' budgets, media buyer Lyrette says she understands the importance of supporting local media. But she's not in the charity business. Clients want to go where they feel they can get the most eyeballs on a cost effective basis.</p><p>\"In some ways it is the beginning of the end. If you're not supporting your own local community, that media community will eventually go away,\" says Lyrette. \"It's still important to have a local market otherwise your community won't be reflected in it. It's a pretty basic question. But it's also a competitive landscape.\"</p><p>The Trudeau government meanwhile, is paying close attention to the issues of privacy, hate speech and electoral interference. On Thursday, the prime minister announced a \" Digital Charter\" to rein in the industry, including financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p>But so far it hasn't looked at what Hinds says is the underlying issue: The health of the industry.</p><p>\"There are a lot of words around fake news and hate speech. But they have not addressed the business side of the equation. To combat all that, you have to have a healthy industry of credible, legitimate players,\" says Hinds. \"You have to fix that issue first if you are to have any long-term sustainability. What's hopeful is that the rest of the world is engaged in that discussion. And hopefully Canadians will catch on, too.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

But the future, perhaps not surprisingly, has been digital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We find the audiences that our clients want.

Globally, the company shared more than $13 billion with publishers in 2018.</p><p>\"By sharing revenue, driving traffic and supporting innovation we see ourselves as partners to the news industry,\" says Brindle.</p><p>Not all publishers agree with the concept of making it more expensive for Canadians to advertise on foreign platforms.</p><p>Jeff Elgie, publisher of Village Media Inc., a collection of hyperlocal community news websites in Ontario, says that would be a \"huge mistake.\" He says Canadians would be \"effectively disadvantaged\" against anyone outside our borders when it comes to buying advertising.</p><p>\"The U.S. company selling widget 'X' to Canadians, buying ads through Google or Facebook to target Canadians, is going to be able to deduct those expenses, while the Canadian company attempting to do the same thing is not,\" says Elgie. \"Does the media industry really want to have a narrative that suggests that because they want these channels penalized, that every other business in Canada has to be penalized as well?\"</p><p>But critics and government watchdogs say more can be done to make sure digital companies pay their fair share.</p><p>On a separate but significant tax issue, the Canadian auditor general found this month that the Canadian sales tax system has \"not kept pace with the rapidly evolving digital marketplace.\"</p><p>Because they failed to collect the GST on companies such as Netflix, Google and Facebook, Canada lost $169 million in 2017 on digital products and services sold nationally according to the auditor general. That's because companies that don't have a substantial physical presence in Canada do not have to collect taxes. It's up to the consumer to remit those taxes to the government, but that happens rarely, if ever.</p><p>Despite the reluctance of the federal government, Quebec and Saskatchewan, meanwhile have been collecting provincial sales taxes from digital companies since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Facebook has said they would voluntarily collect and remit sales taxes to Ottawa. They are expected to do that sometime in the second half of the year. But Google so far has not followed suit, leaving it up to regulators.</p><p>\"Should the federal government create legislation to require the collection of value-added taxes on digital sales, we would comply with that legislation,\" says Google's Brindle. \"Quebec passed legislation that requires the collection of Quebec Sales Tax. We comply with that legislation.\"</p><p>Unifor's Law meanwhile, says the Canadian government could consider a specific digital content tax similar to some European Union countries that are implementing taxes of anywhere from 2 per cent to a suggested 6 per cent of revenues.</p><p>That situation is similar to the plight of Canadian broadcasters who have noted that competitors such as Netflix don't have to contribute a percentage of their profits into entities such as the Canadian Media Fund. If they did, those funds would go into making Canadian television content. Similarly, some of the proceeds of that digital content tax could be diverted into creating local news.</p><p>\"A content tax could make sense. (Foreign digital platforms) make no significant contribution to journalism, but they vacuum up the advertising dollars,\" says Law.</p><p>Despite the fact she has to be dispassionate about where she places her clients' budgets, media buyer Lyrette says she understands the importance of supporting local media. But she's not in the charity business. Clients want to go where they feel they can get the most eyeballs on a cost effective basis.</p><p>\"In some ways it is the beginning of the end. If you're not supporting your own local community, that media community will eventually go away,\" says Lyrette. \"It's still important to have a local market otherwise your community won't be reflected in it. It's a pretty basic question. But it's also a competitive landscape.\"</p><p>The Trudeau government meanwhile, is paying close attention to the issues of privacy, hate speech and electoral interference. On Thursday, the prime minister announced a \"Digital Charter\" to rein in the industry, including financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p>But so far it hasn't looked at what Hinds says is the underlying issue: The health of the industry.</p><p>\"There are a lot of words around fake news and hate speech. But they have not addressed the business side of the equation. To combat all that, you have to have a healthy industry of credible, legitimate players,\" says Hinds. \"You have to fix that issue first if you are to have any long-term sustainability.

But the future, perhaps not surprisingly, has been digital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We find the audiences that our clients want. Whether the platform is owned by Canadians or Americans, it doesn't matter,\" says Lyrette whose company, Zenith Canada, counts such clients as entertainment giant 20th Century Fox, multinational cosmetic company Coty, and Canada Post. \"The end result is what matters.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the Toronto-based Zenith, digital marketing now makes up about 40 per cent of all requests, with the rest split among radio, TV and print. That's up significantly from what it was only a few years ago, and the trend is increasing, says Lyrette.</p><p>Within the digital space, Google and Facebook command the overwhelming share of advertising dollarsat about 72 per cent. The rest is divided up amongst other media, including legacy publishers like magazines and newspapers, who fight for a shrinking piece of the pie. In 2018, the amount Canadian marketers spent on digital advertising was estimated to be $7.7 billion.</p><p>There are myriad reasons for the dominance of big tech companies in the advertising world, including better capitalization, analytics, technology, superior targeting and return on investment, even as legacy publishers struggle to catch up.</p><p>Some critics argue tech companies have been given a free ride on outdated tax regulations that have caused a crisis in Canada's media industry.</p><p>Canada's tax code was not written for the digital age. And one small but significant change could help to level the playing field between tech giants and domestic publishers.</p><p>Ads purchased on foreign-owned websites are tax deductible under the federal Income Tax Act. That loophole should be closed, critics say, because it encourages local businesses to buy into foreign platforms.</p><p>\"I think the common thread we've had so far is that when given a choice between standing up for Canada's interests or doing basically nothing, the government has gone with the latter,\" says Daniel Bernhard, executive director of the media watchdog group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"Silicon Valley has basically done whatever they wanted. We haven't applied our rules when they are involved and that's become really expensive to all Canadians.\"</p><p>Section 19 of the Income Tax Act was created to help Canadian publishers gain a foothold against their more established foreign competition in order to support domestic news coverage. That legislation was made in the print era. Domestic advertisers couldn't deduct the cost of their advertising in Time's print edition, but they could if they advertised in Time's Canadian competitor Maclean's. However, the restriction doesn't apply to websites.</p><p>\"Essentially, you get a situation where you aren't able to deduct your advertising if you advertise in the print edition of the New York Times, but you get to do that in the online edition, which is completely ludicrous,\" says Bernhard.</p><p>A 2016 study by Bernhard's group found that tax deductibility wouldn't necessarily solve the problem, but it might redirect anywhere from 5 to 10 per cent of annual ad spending to Canadian websites.</p><p>\"It certainly wouldn't be enough to totally change the balance, but it would be a substantial move,\" says Bruce Neve, president of independently owned media-buying company True Media Canada. \"It would be interesting to see what the results would be like if it were really a level playing field.\"</p><p>According to the 2016 study, tax deductibility could bring in an additional $250 million to $450 million in revenue into Canadian coffers. And that number would be even higher today. So far, despite intensive lobbying, the federal government hasn't budged on the original interpretation of Section 19.</p><p>\"Closing the loophole would be a clear message that the government of Canada values Canadian content and Canadian content producers, that they're not scared of Facebook and Google,\" says John Hinds, president and CEO of News Media Canada, which represents daily, weekly and community newspapers across the country. \"Nobody's asking for a free lunch. We just want them to apply the rules to account for the fact we are living in a digital age.\"</p><p>The question is, should Canadian consumers care where they see their advertising? Should advertisers care where they advertise?</p><p>\"One issue is that advertising pays for 90 per cent of the journalism that tells readers more about their backyard, while the internet companies don't have an obligation to tell Canadian stories, they don't have to put anything back,\" says Howard Law, director media sector for Unifor, the country's largest media union, which represents local broadcast workers at CTV and Citytv and newspapers such as the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to queries from the Star.

But the future, perhaps not surprisingly, has been digital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We find the audiences that our clients want. Whether the platform is owned by Canadians or Americans, it doesn't matter,\" says Lyrette whose company, Zenith Canada, counts such clients as entertainment giant 20th Century Fox, multinational cosmetic company Coty, and Canada Post. \"The end result is what matters.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the Toronto-based Zenith, digital marketing now makes up about 40 per cent of all requests, with the rest split among radio, TV and print. That's up significantly from what it was only a few years ago, and the trend is increasing, says Lyrette.</p><p>Within the digital space, Google and Facebook command the overwhelming share of advertising dollarsat about 72 per cent. The rest is divided up amongst other media, including legacy publishers like magazines and newspapers, who fight for a shrinking piece of the pie. In 2018, the amount Canadian marketers spent on digital advertising was estimated to be $7.7 billion.</p><p>There are myriad reasons for the dominance of big tech companies in the advertising world, including better capitalization, analytics, technology, superior targeting and return on investment, even as legacy publishers struggle to catch up.</p><p>Some critics argue tech companies have been given a free ride on outdated tax regulations that have caused a crisis in Canada's media industry.</p><p>Canada's tax code was not written for the digital age. And one small but significant change could help to level the playing field between tech giants and domestic publishers.</p><p>Ads purchased on foreign-owned websites are tax deductible under the federal Income Tax Act. That loophole should be closed, critics say, because it encourages local businesses to buy into foreign platforms.</p><p>\"I think the common thread we've had so far is that when given a choice between standing up for Canada's interests or doing basically nothing, the government has gone with the latter,\" says Daniel Bernhard, executive director of the media watchdog group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"Silicon Valley has basically done whatever they wanted. We haven't applied our rules when they are involved and that's become really expensive to all Canadians.\"</p><p>Section 19 of the Income Tax Act was created to help Canadian publishers gain a foothold against their more established foreign competition in order to support domestic news coverage. That legislation was made in the print era. Domestic advertisers couldn't deduct the cost of their advertising in Time's print edition, but they could if they advertised in Time's Canadian competitor Maclean's. However, the restriction doesn't apply to websites.</p><p>\"Essentially, you get a situation where you aren't able to deduct your advertising if you advertise in the print edition of the New York Times, but you get to do that in the online edition, which is completely ludicrous,\" says Bernhard.</p><p>A 2016 study by Bernhard's group found that tax deductibility wouldn't necessarily solve the problem, but it might redirect anywhere from 5 to 10 per cent of annual ad spending to Canadian websites.</p><p>\"It certainly wouldn't be enough to totally change the balance, but it would be a substantial move,\" says Bruce Neve, president of independently owned media-buying company True Media Canada. \"It would be interesting to see what the results would be like if it were really a level playing field.\"</p><p>According to the 2016 study, tax deductibility could bring in an additional $250 million to $450 million in revenue into Canadian coffers. And that number would be even higher today. So far, despite intensive lobbying, the federal government hasn't budged on the original interpretation of Section 19.</p><p>\"Closing the loophole would be a clear message that the government of Canada values Canadian content and Canadian content producers, that they're not scared of Facebook and Google,\" says John Hinds, president and CEO of News Media Canada, which represents daily, weekly and community newspapers across the country. \"Nobody's asking for a free lunch. We just want them to apply the rules to account for the fact we are living in a digital age.\"</p><p>The question is, should Canadian consumers care where they see their advertising? Should advertisers care where they advertise?</p><p>\"One issue is that advertising pays for 90 per cent of the journalism that tells readers more about their backyard, while the internet companies don't have an obligation to tell Canadian stories, they don't have to put anything back,\" says Howard Law, director media sector for Unifor, the country's largest media union, which represents local broadcast workers at CTV and Citytv and newspapers such as the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to queries from the Star. However, Google Canada spokesperson Aaron Brindle stressed his platform shares a \"common mission\" with Canadian publishers.</p><p>\"The fate of Google and the publishing industry are inextricably linked,\" says Brindle in a statement to the Star. \"An open press and healthy news industry plays a critical role in our democracy.\"</p><p>Billions of clicks a month are driven to publishers' websites for free, representing an opportunity for them to grow and monetize an audience, argues Google. Globally, the company shared more than $13 billion with publishers in 2018.</p><p>\"By sharing revenue, driving traffic and supporting innovation we see ourselves as partners to the news industry,\" says Brindle.</p><p>Not all publishers agree with the concept of making it more expensive for Canadians to advertise on foreign platforms.</p><p>Jeff Elgie, publisher of Village Media Inc., a collection of hyperlocal community news websites in Ontario, says that would be a \"huge mistake.\" He says Canadians would be \"effectively disadvantaged\" against anyone outside our borders when it comes to buying advertising.</p><p>\"The U.S. company selling widget 'X' to Canadians, buying ads through Google or Facebook to target Canadians, is going to be able to deduct those expenses, while the Canadian company attempting to do the same thing is not,\" says Elgie. \"Does the media industry really want to have a narrative that suggests that because they want these channels penalized, that every other business in Canada has to be penalized as well?\"</p><p>But critics and government watchdogs say more can be done to make sure digital companies pay their fair share.</p><p>On a separate but significant tax issue, the Canadian auditor general found this month that the Canadian sales tax system has \"not kept pace with the rapidly evolving digital marketplace.\"</p><p>Because they failed to collect the GST on companies such as Netflix, Google and Facebook, Canada lost $169 million in 2017 on digital products and services sold nationally according to the auditor general. That's because companies that don't have a substantial physical presence in Canada do not have to collect taxes. It's up to the consumer to remit those taxes to the government, but that happens rarely, if ever.</p><p>Despite the reluctance of the federal government, Quebec and Saskatchewan, meanwhile have been collecting provincial sales taxes from digital companies since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Facebook has said they would voluntarily collect and remit sales taxes to Ottawa. They are expected to do that sometime in the second half of the year. But Google so far has not followed suit, leaving it up to regulators.</p><p>\"Should the federal government create legislation to require the collection of value-added taxes on digital sales, we would comply with that legislation,\" says Google's Brindle. \"Quebec passed legislation that requires the collection of Quebec Sales Tax. We comply with that legislation.\"</p><p>Unifor's Law meanwhile, says the Canadian government could consider a specific digital content tax similar to some European Union countries that are implementing taxes of anywhere from 2 per cent to a suggested 6 per cent of revenues.</p><p>That situation is similar to the plight of Canadian broadcasters who have noted that competitors such as Netflix don't have to contribute a percentage of their profits into entities such as the Canadian Media Fund. If they did, those funds would go into making Canadian television content. Similarly, some of the proceeds of that digital content tax could be diverted into creating local news.</p><p>\"A content tax could make sense. (Foreign digital platforms) make no significant contribution to journalism, but they vacuum up the advertising dollars,\" says Law.</p><p>Despite the fact she has to be dispassionate about where she places her clients' budgets, media buyer Lyrette says she understands the importance of supporting local media. But she's not in the charity business. Clients want to go where they feel they can get the most eyeballs on a cost effective basis.</p><p>\"In some ways it is the beginning of the end. If you're not supporting your own local community, that media community will eventually go away,\" says Lyrette. \"It's still important to have a local market otherwise your community won't be reflected in it. It's a pretty basic question. But it's also a competitive landscape.\"</p><p>The Trudeau government meanwhile, is paying close attention to the issues of privacy, hate speech and electoral interference. On Thursday, the prime minister announced a \"Digital Charter\" to rein in the industry, including financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p>But so far it hasn't looked at what Hinds says is the underlying issue: The health of the industry.</p><p>\"There are a lot of words around fake news and hate speech. But they have not addressed the business side of the equation. To combat all that, you have to have a healthy industry of credible, legitimate players,\" says Hinds. \"You have to fix that issue first if you are to have any long-term sustainability. What's hopeful is that the rest of the world is engaged in that discussion. And hopefully Canadians will catch on, too.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

But the future, perhaps not surprisingly, has been digital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We find the audiences that our clients want. Whether the platform is owned by Canadians or Americans, it doesn't matter,\" says Lyrette whose company, Zenith Canada, counts such clients as entertainment giant 20th Century Fox, multinational cosmetic company Coty, and Canada Post. \"The end result is what matters.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the Toronto-based Zenith, digital marketing now makes up about 40 per cent of all requests, with the rest split among radio, TV and print. That's up significantly from what it was only a few years ago, and the trend is increasing, says Lyrette.</p><p>Within the digital space, Google and Facebook command the overwhelming share of advertising dollars at about 72 per cent. The rest is divided up amongst other media, including legacy publishers like magazines and newspapers, who fight for a shrinking piece of the pie. In 2018, the amount Canadian marketers spent on digital advertising was estimated to be $7.7 billion.</p><p>There are myriad reasons for the dominance of big tech companies in the advertising world, including better capitalization, analytics, technology, superior targeting and return on investment, even as legacy publishers struggle to catch up.</p><p>Some critics argue tech companies have been given a free ride on outdated tax regulations that have caused a crisis in Canada's media industry.</p><p>Canada's tax code was not written for the digital age. And one small but significant change could help to level the playing field between tech giants and domestic publishers.</p><p>Ads purchased on foreign-owned websites are tax deductible under the federal Income Tax Act. That loophole should be closed, critics say, because it encourages local businesses to buy into foreign platforms.</p><p>\"I think the common thread we've had so far is that when given a choice between standing up for Canada's interests or doing basically nothing, the government has gone with the latter,\" says Daniel Bernhard, executive director of the media watchdog group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"Silicon Valley has basically done whatever they wanted. We haven't applied our rules when they are involved and that's become really expensive to all Canadians.\"</p><p>Section 19 of the Income Tax Act was created to help Canadian publishers gain a foothold against their more established foreign competition in order to support domestic news coverage. That legislation was made in the print era. Domestic advertisers couldn't deduct the cost of their advertising in Time's print edition, but they could if they advertised in Time's Canadian competitor Maclean's. However, the restriction doesn't apply to websites.</p><p>\"Essentially, you get a situation where you aren't able to deduct your advertising if you advertise in the print edition of the New York Times, but you get to do that in the online edition, which is completely ludicrous,\" says Bernhard.</p><p>A 2016 study by Bernhard's group found that tax deductibility wouldn't necessarily solve the problem, but it might redirect anywhere from 5 to 10 per cent of annual ad spending to Canadian websites.</p><p>\"It certainly wouldn't be enough to totally change the balance, but it would be a substantial move,\" says Bruce Neve, president of independently owned media-buying company True Media Canada. \"It would be interesting to see what the results would be like if it were really a level playing field.\"</p><p>According to the 2016 study, tax deductibility could bring in an additional $250 million to $450 million in revenue into Canadian coffers. And that number would be even higher today. So far, despite intensive lobbying, the federal government hasn't budged on the original interpretation of Section 19.</p><p>\"Closing the loophole would be a clear message that the government of Canada values Canadian content and Canadian content producers, that they're not scared of Facebook and Google,\" says John Hinds, president and CEO of News Media Canada, which represents daily, weekly and community newspapers across the country. \"Nobody's asking for a free lunch. We just want them to apply the rules to account for the fact we are living in a digital age.\"</p><p>The question is, should Canadian consumers care where they see their advertising? Should advertisers care where they advertise?</p><p>\"One issue is that advertising pays for 90 per cent of the journalism that tells readers more about their backyard, while the internet companies don't have an obligation to tell Canadian stories, they don't have to put anything back,\" says Howard Law, director media sector for Unifor, the country's largest media union, which represents local broadcast workers at CTV and Citytv and newspapers such as the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to queries from the Star. However, Google Canada spokesperson Aaron Brindle stressed his platform shares a \"common mission\" with Canadian publishers.</p><p>\"The fate of Google and the publishing industry are inextricably linked,\" says Brindle in a statement to the Star. \"An open press and healthy news industry plays a critical role in our democracy.\"</p><p>Billions of clicks a month are driven to publishers' websites for free, representing an opportunity for them to grow and monetize an audience, argues Google. Globally, the company shared more than $13 billion with publishers in 2018.</p><p>\"By sharing revenue, driving traffic and supporting innovation we see ourselves as partners to the news industry,\" says Brindle.</p><p>Not all publishers agree with the concept of making it more expensive for Canadians to advertise on foreign platforms.</p><p>Jeff Elgie, publisher of Village Media Inc., a collection of hyperlocal community news websites in Ontario, says that would be a \"huge mistake.\" He says Canadians would be \"effectively disadvantaged\" against anyone outside our borders when it comes to buying advertising.</p><p>\"The U.S. company selling widget 'X' to Canadians, buying ads through Google or Facebook to target Canadians, is going to be able to deduct those expenses, while the Canadian company attempting to do the same thing is not,\" says Elgie. \"Does the media industry really want to have a narrative that suggests that because they want these channels penalized, that every other business in Canada has to be penalized as well?\"</p><p>But critics and government watchdogs say more can be done to make sure digital companies pay their fair share.</p><p>On a separate but significant tax issue, the Canadian auditor general found this month that the Canadian sales tax system has \"not kept pace with the rapidly evolving digital marketplace.\"</p><p>Because they failed to collect the GST on companies such as Netflix, Google and Facebook, Canada lost $169 million in 2017 on digital products and services sold nationally according to the auditor general. That's because companies that don't have a substantial physical presence in Canada do not have to collect taxes. It's up to the consumer to remit those taxes to the government, but that happens rarely, if ever.</p><p>Despite the reluctance of the federal government, Quebec and Saskatchewan, meanwhile have been collecting provincial sales taxes from digital companies since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Facebook has said they would voluntarily collect and remit sales taxes to Ottawa. They are expected to do that sometime in the second half of the year. But Google so far has not followed suit, leaving it up to regulators.</p><p>\"Should the federal government create legislation to require the collection of value-added taxes on digital sales, we would comply with that legislation,\" says Google's Brindle. \"Quebec passed legislation that requires the collection of Quebec Sales Tax. We comply with that legislation.\"</p><p>Unifor's Law meanwhile, says the Canadian government could consider a specific digital content tax similar to some European Union countries that are implementing taxes of anywhere from 2 per cent to a suggested 6 per cent of revenues.</p><p>That situation is similar to the plight of Canadian broadcasters who have noted that competitors such as Netflix don't have to contribute a percentage of their profits into entities such as the Canadian Media Fund. If they did, those funds would go into making Canadian television content. Similarly, some of the proceeds of that digital content tax could be diverted into creating local news.</p><p>\"A content tax could make sense. (Foreign digital platforms) make no significant contribution to journalism, but they vacuum up the advertising dollars,\" says Law.</p><p>Despite the fact she has to be dispassionate about where she places her clients' budgets, media buyer Lyrette says she understands the importance of supporting local media. But she's not in the charity business. Clients want to go where they feel they can get the most eyeballs on a cost effective basis.</p><p>\"In some ways it is the beginning of the end. If you're not supporting your own local community, that media community will eventually go away,\" says Lyrette. \"It's still important to have a local market otherwise your community won't be reflected in it. It's a pretty basic question. But it's also a competitive landscape.\"</p><p>The Trudeau government meanwhile, is paying close attention to the issues of privacy, hate speech and electoral interference. On Thursday, the prime minister announced a \" Digital Charter\" to rein in the industry, including financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p>But so far it hasn't looked at what Hinds says is the underlying issue: The health of the industry.</p><p>\"There are a lot of words around fake news and hate speech. But they have not addressed the business side of the equation. To combat all that, you have to have a healthy industry of credible, legitimate players,\" says Hinds. \"You have to fix that issue first if you are to have any long-term sustainability. What's hopeful is that the rest of the world is engaged in that discussion. And hopefully Canadians will catch on, too.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

But the future, perhaps not surprisingly, has been digital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We find the audiences that our clients want. Whether the platform is owned by Canadians or Americans, it doesn't matter,\" says Lyrette whose company, Zenith Canada, counts such clients as entertainment giant 20th Century Fox, multinational cosmetic company Coty, and Canada Post. \"The end result is what matters.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the Toronto-based Zenith, digital marketing now makes up about 40 per cent of all requests, with the rest split among radio, TV and print. That's up significantly from what it was only a few years ago, and the trend is increasing, says Lyrette.</p><p>Within the digital space, Google and Facebook command the overwhelming share of advertising dollars at about 72 per cent. The rest is divided up amongst other media, including legacy publishers like magazines and newspapers, who fight for a shrinking piece of the pie. In 2018, the amount Canadian marketers spent on digital advertising was estimated to be $7.7 billion.</p><p>There are myriad reasons for the dominance of big tech companies in the advertising world, including better capitalization, analytics, technology, superior targeting and return on investment, even as legacy publishers struggle to catch up.</p><p>Some critics argue tech companies have been given a free ride on outdated tax regulations that have caused a crisis in Canada's media industry.</p><p>Canada's tax code was not written for the digital age. And one small but significant change could help to level the playing field between tech giants and domestic publishers.</p><p>Ads purchased on foreign-owned websites are tax deductible under the federal Income Tax Act. That loophole should be closed, critics say, because it encourages local businesses to buy into foreign platforms.</p><p>\"I think the common thread we've had so far is that when given a choice between standing up for Canada's interests or doing basically nothing, the government has gone with the latter,\" says Daniel Bernhard, executive director of the media watchdog group Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"Silicon Valley has basically done whatever they wanted. We haven't applied our rules when they are involved and that's become really expensive to all Canadians.\"</p><p>Section 19 of the Income Tax Act was created to help Canadian publishers gain a foothold against their more established foreign competition in order to support domestic news coverage. That legislation was made in the print era. Domestic advertisers couldn't deduct the cost of their advertising in Time's print edition, but they could if they advertised in Time's Canadian competitor Maclean's. However, the restriction doesn't apply to websites.</p><p>\"Essentially, you get a situation where you aren't able to deduct your advertising if you advertise in the print edition of the New York Times, but you get to do that in the online edition, which is completely ludicrous,\" says Bernhard.</p><p>A 2016 study by Bernhard's group found that tax deductibility wouldn't necessarily solve the problem, but it might redirect anywhere from 5 to 10 per cent of annual ad spending to Canadian websites.</p><p>\"It certainly wouldn't be enough to totally change the balance, but it would be a substantial move,\" says Bruce Neve, president of independently owned media-buying company True Media Canada. \"It would be interesting to see what the results would be like if it were really a level playing field.\"</p><p>According to the 2016 study, tax deductibility could bring in an additional $250 million to $450 million in revenue into Canadian coffers. And that number would be even higher today. So far, despite intensive lobbying, the federal government hasn't budged on the original interpretation of Section 19.</p><p>\"Closing the loophole would be a clear message that the government of Canada values Canadian content and Canadian content producers, that they're not scared of Facebook and Google,\" says John Hinds, president and CEO of News Media Canada, which represents daily, weekly and community newspapers across the country. \"Nobody's asking for a free lunch. We just want them to apply the rules to account for the fact we are living in a digital age.\"</p><p>The question is, should Canadian consumers care where they see their advertising? Should advertisers care where they advertise?</p><p>\"One issue is that advertising pays for 90 per cent of the journalism that tells readers more about their backyard, while the internet companies don't have an obligation to tell Canadian stories, they don't have to put anything back,\" says Howard Law, director media sector for Unifor, the country's largest media union, which represents local broadcast workers at CTV and Citytv and newspapers such as the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to queries from the Star. However, Google Canada spokesperson Aaron Brindle stressed his platform shares a \"common mission\" with Canadian publishers.</p><p>\"The fate of Google and the publishing industry are inextricably linked,\" says Brindle in a statement to the Star. \"An open press and healthy news industry plays a critical role in our democracy.\"</p><p>Billions of clicks a month are driven to publishers' websites for free, representing an opportunity for them to grow and monetize an audience, argues Google. Globally, the company shared more than $13 billion with publishers in 2018.</p><p>\"By sharing revenue, driving traffic and supporting innovation we see ourselves as partners to the news industry,\" says Brindle.</p><p>Not all publishers agree with the concept of making it more expensive for Canadians to advertise on foreign platforms.</p><p>Jeff Elgie, publisher of Village Media Inc., a collection of hyperlocal community news websites in Ontario, says that would be a \"huge mistake.\" He says Canadians would be \"effectively disadvantaged\" against anyone outside our borders when it comes to buying advertising.</p><p>\"The U.S. company selling widget 'X' to Canadians, buying ads through Google or Facebook to target Canadians, is going to be able to deduct those expenses, while the Canadian company attempting to do the same thing is not,\" says Elgie. \"Does the media industry really want to have a narrative that suggests that because they want these channels penalized, that every other business in Canada has to be penalized as well?\"</p><p>But critics and government watchdogs say more can be done to make sure digital companies pay their fair share.</p><p>On a separate but significant tax issue, the Canadian auditor general found this month that the Canadian sales tax system has \"not kept pace with the rapidly evolving digital marketplace.\"</p><p>Because they failed to collect the GST on companies such as Netflix, Google and Facebook, Canada lost $169 million in 2017 on digital products and services sold nationally according to the auditor general. That's because companies that don't have a substantial physical presence in Canada do not have to collect taxes. It's up to the consumer to remit those taxes to the government, but that happens rarely, if ever.</p><p>Despite the reluctance of the federal government, Quebec and Saskatchewan, meanwhile have been collecting provincial sales taxes from digital companies since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Facebook has said they would voluntarily collect and remit sales taxes to Ottawa. They are expected to do that sometime in the second half of the year. But Google so far has not followed suit, leaving it up to regulators.</p><p>\"Should the federal government create legislation to require the collection of value-added taxes on digital sales, we would comply with that legislation,\" says Google's Brindle. \"Quebec passed legislation that requires the collection of Quebec Sales Tax. We comply with that legislation.\"</p><p>Unifor's Law meanwhile, says the Canadian government could consider a specific digital content tax similar to some European Union countries that are implementing taxes of anywhere from 2 per cent to a suggested 6 per cent of revenues.</p><p>That situation is similar to the plight of Canadian broadcasters who have noted that competitors such as Netflix don't have to contribute a percentage of their profits into entities such as the Canadian Media Fund. If they did, those funds would go into making Canadian television content. Similarly, some of the proceeds of that digital content tax could be diverted into creating local news.</p><p>\"A content tax could make sense. (Foreign digital platforms) make no significant contribution to journalism, but they vacuum up the advertising dollars,\" says Law.</p><p>Despite the fact she has to be dispassionate about where she places her clients' budgets, media buyer Lyrette says she understands the importance of supporting local media. But she's not in the charity business. Clients want to go where they feel they can get the most eyeballs on a cost effective basis.</p><p>\"In some ways it is the beginning of the end. If you're not supporting your own local community, that media community will eventually go away,\" says Lyrette. \"It's still important to have a local market otherwise your community won't be reflected in it. It's a pretty basic question. But it's also a competitive landscape.\"</p><p>The Trudeau government meanwhile, is paying close attention to the issues of privacy, hate speech and electoral interference. On Thursday, the prime minister announced a \" Digital Charter\" to rein in the industry, including financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p>But so far it hasn't looked at what Hinds says is the underlying issue: The health of the industry.</p><p>\"There are a lot of words around fake news and hate speech. But they have not addressed the business side of the equation. To combat all that, you have to have a healthy industry of credible, legitimate players,\" says Hinds. \"You have to fix that issue first if you are to have any long-term sustainability. What's hopeful is that the rest of the world is engaged in that discussion. And hopefully Canadians will catch on, too.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

But with success has come a backlash, and then a backlash to the backlash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On paper, Buttigieg ticks a lot of presidential-candidate boxes; you can't write about Mayor Pete without mentioning he's a Rhodes scholar, he's a veteran, and he has an articulate, cool-tempered decency reminiscent of Barack Obama. And yet the mayor has drawn the ire of the plugged-in progressive left. There's something curious about the disdain, notes Derek Thompson in The Atlantic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a field of many other milquetoast moderates - including front-runner Joe Biden - why has Mayor Pete been singled out for special skewering by young radicals?</p><p>I am not so young, but I am one of those crazy radicals who have been concerned about the intractable domination of our society by a small band of wealthy interests. So I'll tell you why I don't like Buttigieg. It's not because I think he'd be an especially bad president. Like Biden, the mayor seems to possess the baseline capacity to run America in a way that isn't an embarrassment or a disgrace, which would certainly be a step up from the current administration. He has also articulated some interesting policy ideas, and he has managed to win a lot of hearts online - a talent, of a sort, in an election measured in cheesy viral hits.</p><p>Yet every time I hear him speak, I get the sense that he's trying too hard to please everyone and that - in a way that recalls some of Obama's worst tendencies toward misguided centrism - he'll end up pleasing no one in the process.</p><p>Ultimately, I worry Buttigieg will easily lose to Trump because he is ill suited to make the simplest and most powerful argument against the current administration's apparent economic successes.</p><p>That argument goes like this: Though the economic stats look pretty good, the Trump boom is a mirage and a moral disgrace. Today's seemingly rosy climate is the culmination of a political economy that consistently rewards the already wealthy at the expense of everyone else. The only way to reverse the trend toward inequality is to reform the way America does business. A politician who pushes for these reforms needs courage because the forces arrayed against structural change are powerful.</p><p>But while Mayor Pete has outlined several progressivesounding ideas for overhauling Americans' economic lives - including a call for universal health care (that will still include a hefty role for private corporations), an idea for lowering student debt (but not making college free), a promise to strengthen regulations against monopolies (but a reluctance to break up Big Tech) - he lacks authenticity.</p><p>Rather than fundamental reform, many of his proposals end up sounding like opportunistic incrementalism, as if he wants to be seen to be doing something without really doing much at all, for fear of arousing the forces arrayed against reform. Even Biden, who has built his brand on common-man folksisms, seems more believable, and he has explicitly promised billionaires that nothing much will change for them.</p><p>My fears about Mayor Pete's easy way with the wealthy were confirmed this week, when he convened a group of big-money donors on a tour through Silicon Valley. I wasn't surprised that he has proved so attractive to the tech set. With his slick, easy optimism, Mayor Pete reminds me of so many techies who promise big, disruptive change while refusing to accept the full costs of achieving their idealism. For them, there's always an easy, slapdash, cost-free revolution: Just use the right hashtag on Instagram and you, too, can spark regime change in the Arab world.</p><p>I suspect we'll need a bolder candidate to take on Trumpism and corporate control. The Mayor from McKinsey is the wrong man to make the case.</p><p>The Democrat who meets Trump in 2020 will face a big challenge: countering the idea that Trump's economic policies are \"working,\" at least according to the traditional way we measure this stuff.</p><p>The American economy, we are told, is resplendent and aglow. Thanks to a tax cut that swelled corporate coffers and a frenzy of deregulation that unleashed long-term dangers in exchange for short-term profits, the hits just keep coming: We're now in the longest expansion in history, with little sign of abating. Job growth regularly defies naysayers. The stock market seems to set a record more often than people stream Mariah Carey Christmas hits.</p><p>On CNBC the other day, anchor Jim Cramer, reflecting the mood of Wall Street, said, \"These are the best numbers of our lives.\"</p><p>For the president, the political argument here is straightforward. Like Bill Clinton in 1996 or Ronald Reagan in 1984, Trump is planning to point to an economy doing its best George Costanza: We're back, baby, we're back! Every week on Twitter, Trump chef-kisses new economic stats as if he'd personally assembled the national dish.</p><p>That's one way to put it. Here's another way: This economy is stupid. As my colleague David Leonhardt writes, headline economic stats are increasingly divorced from more substantive metrics on American well-being. This is a country in which prosperity rains on the rich while hundreds of thousands of people go bankrupt every year for getting sick. This is a country in which it is not unusual to encounter developing-world misery alongside the most obscene collections of wealth ever recorded. There's a lot of job growth, but a lot of the jobs are low-wage, high-toil jobs. It's a country in which every nearly every economic sector trends toward monopoly and oligarchy, and in which regulators let companies call the shots - see the FAA and Boeing or the FTC and Google.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have turned these dismal realities into the central pillars of their campaigns.</p><p>Both are calling for policies that fundamentally overhaul corporate control of the economy. As their detractors note, it's unlikely that they will be able to achieve many of those goals in our polarized political climate. But what matters to me is that they are making the case. They have articulated both far-reaching, structural policy goals and political strategies that mesh with the spirit of those goals. Not only are they calling for fundamental change that will alter vast sectors of the economy, but they are also committed to undoing the influence of corporations and the wealthy in their own path to the White House, underscoring their commitment to their goals.</p><p>I don't see how Mayor Pete can make a similarly compelling case. I don't see how he can take on Trump's economy without at least attempting to fight the CEOs who championed the corporate cash-grab that made it so hot.</p><p>And I don't see how he can take on those CEOs while holding fundraisers in Napa Valley \"wine caves.\"</p><p>Mayor Pete seems like a lovely man. That's the problem.</p><p>He'll get eaten alive by the corporate machine that now runs the world.</p><p>Farhad Manjoo is a New York Times columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-121919C004art2xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897D7163BBD40 NWBKCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSJ-DRT1-DXVP-V012-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1187\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Record-Journal<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

And they're all trading at or close to all-time highs, with Amazon up 50% year to date, Microsoft up 26%, Apple up 24%, Facebook up 12% and Alphabet up 7%. </p><p>What explains their outperformance through one of the most dramatic economic dislocations in history? </p><p>They've all been beneficiaries of the massive demand for anything and everything that helps businesses or individuals communicate and transact online during the Covid-19 lockdowns. And their strong balance sheets have led them to better weather the economic storms than their competitors.</p><p>\"I like to say the crisis has accelerated the inevitable,\" says Mark Mahaney, an analyst who covers internet stocks for RBC. \"We've had two decades of migration of products and services online. And we just accelerated that by one or two years -- compressed into the span of two months.\"</p><p>So Amazon has obviously benefited from the growth in online retail, Microsoft has seen growing demand for its collaboration and cloud businesses, and Apple's Services businesses have shown strong improvement, in addition to growing optimism about its upcoming 5G line-up of phones. </p><p>As for Facebook and Google, while they saw some dramatic deceleration in ad demand during the initial stages of the lockdown, those numbers have improved considerably in the time since then. </p><p>\"Those two should be almost back to full growth by the end of this year, if not early next year,\" said Mahaney. </p><p>What could stand in the way of the FAAMG stocks continuing to dominate and lead the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq higher?</p><p>The main risks seem to be if there was a major reversal in the gradual opening up of the economy and the re-institution of lockdowns hurting the economic recovery, as well as legal and regulatory risks as several of the tech giants get investigated by different authorities in the U.S. and Europe for anticompetitive and other practices. </p><p>Of the two, legal and regulatory actions seem more likely, but such actions often take a long time to have an actual impact on operations, and so look for the largest companies to continue to dominate for at least the near-term.</p><p>For better or worse, the fate of the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rests largely in the hands of Big Tech right now.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

If you add Yahoos Bing-powered portal, its 27 percent. So why are loud voices clamoring for Microsoftto give up on search? Bings Online Services Division doesnt make money. Shortly after Microsoftreleased its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/07/there-is-one-apple-but-many-microsofts-the-company-you-dont-know/\">quarterly earnings results</url>, ZDNets Larry Dignan called the OSD an \u0153      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/microsofts-online-sinkhole-85-billion-lost-in-9-years/52989\">online sinkhole</url>, noting that the division last turned a profit in 2006 and had lost $8.5 billion over nine years.

Investment bankers, CEOs and other high paid types would be thrown out of their jobs or see they paychecks cut. Manufacturing and other sectors that employ middle class workers would see a comeback. But, according to a new study from National Employment Law Project, that's not how things worked out. Recessions often narrow the income gap. This recession has done the opposite. The study, which was authored by NELP's Annette Bernhardt, found that by far the bulk of the jobs lost, 60%, were in the middle range of the income scale. That compares to 21.3% for workers in high income jobs, and 18.7% for low-wage workers. Given the job loss, you would expect middle-income jobs to have rebounded the most in the past two years. But that's not the case. In fact, 73% of the jobs that have been added since the beginning of the recession have been in what the study calls low wage jobs. The middle class squeeze is still on.<br/><br/>All Things Digital<br/>Link:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://allthingsd.com/20110729/china-solution-yahoo-softbank-and-alibaba-reach-agreement/\">China Solution: Yahoo, Softbank and Alibaba Reach Agreement</url><br/>\u0153Yahoo, SoftBank and the Alibaba Group have reached an agreement in their contentious dispute around the Alipay payments unit. The trio have been in extended talks since Alibabas CEO Jack Ma spun Alipay out from Alibaba without the approval of Yahoo and Japans SoftBank, which own large stakes in Alibaba. At the time, he said he did so in order to get critical regulatory approvals from the Chinese government. The move prompted an ugly fight between Alibaba and its partners. In a statement, the trio said: \u0153The agreement is consistent with the two agreed-upon principles established at the outset of the negotiations: structure the inter-company relationship between Alipay and Taobao in order to preserve the value within Taobao and, by extension, within Alibaba Group; and provide that Alibaba Group is appropriately compensated for the value of Alipay. Under terms of the agreement, the three companies said that Alipay will continue providing payment services to Alibabas Taobao commerce site and other subsidiaries; Alibaba will be paid almost half of Alipays pre-tax income; and Alibaba will get between $2 billion and $6 billion \u201d or 37.5 percent of the total equity value \u201d in the event of an Alipay IPO or other liquidity event.<br/><br/>The Source<br/>Link:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/source/2011/07/29/investors-are-worried-about-a-u-s-debt-default/\">Investors Are Worried About a US Debt Default</url><br/>\u0153If there really is a rising risk of a U.S. default, why have Treasury bond yields been falling? Surely, default risk ought to be met with higher bond yields as investors demand a premium for the possibility they wont be paid. A brief glance at the euro zones bond markets shows just how demanding investors can be when they start to worry. That investors are worried about a U.S. default is clear from the price of insuring U.S. government debt. The price of credit default swaps on one year U.S. Treasury bonds has shot up to 75 basis points from the narrow range around 25 basis points where they traded through most of the first half of this year. The fact that its more expensive to buy CDS protection for one year U.S. debt than for five year debt indicates that investors are most worried about the current impasse. How then do you reconcile these two facts: investors are worried the U.S. government will default on its debt, but they continue to buy Treasury bonds.\"<br/><br/>Free Exchange<br/>Link:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/07/global-crisis\">Policy Failure on a Massive Scale</url><br/>\u0153MAYBE everything will turn out all right. One shouldn't forget that possibility. As each day passes, however, frustration grows. Leaders in America and Europe are dallying with failure on an epic scale. They are constrained by dysfunctional institutions, it's true. In Europe, the architecture of the currency union is far too underdeveloped to weather a crisis of the current magnitude. In America, the creaking machinery of the legislature is ill suited to settlement of big questions on a short time frame amid divided government. But it's no longer sufficient to blame inadequate policy responses on institutions alone. America and Europe are flailing because their leaders are failing. They seem to be too small for the tasks at hand, too petty, and too myopic. The challenges facing Europe and America are big, but they're not mysterious. In Europe, the issues are sovereign debt, vulnerable banks, and a poorly designed currency area. It's not tricky to see what must be done. Peripheral debts should be addressed through austerity, sure. But unsustainable debt loads need to be written down. Banks should be recapitalised to prevent trouble in financial markets. Emergency funds should be bolstered to fight sovereign and banking contagion. And substantial fiscal integration must take place, including fiscal transfers to support peripheral economies while they get their budgets in order. The central bank should also stop fighting the phantom of accelerating inflation.

(FB[1]), Apple Inc. (AAPL[2]), Amazon.com (AMZN[3]), and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL[4]) that have the potential to result inantitrust[5] lawsuits could significantly undercut the growth,profit margins[6], and share prices of these companies. </p><p>Past cases of antitrust lawsuits, such as occurred with AT...nc. (T[7]), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT[8]), and IBM Corp. (IBM[9]), led to declines in the stock values of those companies and a downward shift in the trajectory of sales growth, highlighting the risks facing today's \"superstar\" tech giants, according to Goldman Sachs.'Regulatory risk is back in focus for equity investors amid reports of potential government antitrust investigations,' analysts at Goldman wrote in a recent report. Advising investors to reduce their exposures to stocks that become subject an antitrust lawsuit, they added, 'In the past, stock valuations and share prices declined between lawsuit filing and resolution (after years of litigation), and was followed by a downshift in the trajectory of sales growth.' Antitrust Lawsuit Fallout: Microsoft Falling valuations after lawsuit launched in 1998Company ordered to change practices in 2000/2001 settlementSlower growth, falling valuations after resolutionStock trades sideways for 15 years Source: Goldman Sachs; Yahoo! Finance.  What It Means for Investors  The starkest example is the antitrust case leveled against Microsoft in 1998[10], which caused the company'svaluation[11] to fall right up until the case was resolved in 2000/2001. Following the settlement, which involved the company having to change its practices, growth slowed and valuations continued to fall through to 2011\u2014the stock essentially traded sideways for about 15 years.Antitrust lawsuits against IBM in 1969 and AT...n 1974 also led to falling valuations before both lawsuits were eventually settled in 1982. In the case of IBM, the lawsuit was dropped, but the company's growth slowed, and while valuations initially started to climb, they soon reversed and continued their previous downward trajectory. AT...as broken up, and while valuations rose, growth slowed.Since these three cases, U.S. equity markets have become increasingly concentrated, renewing calls for regulators to step in and ensure markets remain competitive. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet have all quickly garnered a large share of their respective industries' sales, have significantpricing power[12] and high margins. Such characteristics, while earning the companies who exhibit them the label \"superstars,\" also tend to grab the attention of regulators.'The current landscape suggests there are only one or two significant players in important digital spaces, including internet search, social networks, mobile and desktop operating systems, and electronic book sales,' U.S. Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the Department of Justice's (DOJ) top antitrust official,said on Tuesday[13].The DOJ is reported to have begun investigating Google and Apple, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC[14]) is ramping up an investigation on Facebook and Amazon, and the House Judiciary Committee is launching a more general Big Tech antitrust investigation. Looking Ahead  As of yet, no lawsuits have been launched against these companies, a fate that they and their shareholders will no doubt hope to avoid. Of course, supposing the investigations determine that any one of these Big Tech firms should be broken up, there are some who believe that such a move would actually be a boon, not just for competitive markets, but for theshareholders[15] as well. NYU professor Scott Galloway, believes abreak up would foster greater innovation[16], growth, and valuations.

Microsoft (MSFT) on Sunday said it is pushing forward with talks to acquire TikTok, following a conversation...</p><p>New York (CNN Business)TikTok is scrambling to keep its American presence alive, and Microsoft has emerged as a potential, albeit unlikely, savior.   Microsoft (MSFT) on Sunday said it is pushing forward with talks to acquire TikTok, following a conversation between CEO Satya Nadella and President Donald Trump, who previously threatened to ban the app in the United States. The transaction could be complicated and difficult to accomplish. And Microsoft has in recent years shifted its strategy away from consumers toward businesses. Still, analysts say the deal is almost certain to be worthwhile for both companies. It's clear why TikTok would be interested in the deal: Trump has said he will ban the app if it doesn't find an American buyer by September 15. Microsoft may be TikTok's only hope. While other Big Tech firms might seem like a more natural fit to acquire TikTok \u2014 Facebook (), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) are facing antitrust scrutiny that would likely get in the way of an acquisition. Multiple analysts have described the acquisition as a potential \"coup\" for Microsoft \u2014 an opportunity to scoop up one of the world's fastest growing social media platforms at a time when TikTok may be desperate to make a deal. \"This is a unique deal of a decade opportunity with a price tag that could easily be consummated,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Monday. Microsoft would probably pay some portion of $50 billion \u2014 the estimated valuation of TikTok as a standalone business \u2014 to take control of the app's operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. News of the possible deal broke on Friday, and since the closing bell on Thursday, Microsoft's market cap has gained $80 billion, a sign that investors like the idea. Ives said he estimates TikTok's valuation could reach $200 billion within just a few years \"given the steep user and engagement trajectory of TikTok.\" DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria agreed, saying TikTok has the potential to grow \"exponentially,\" especially because social media use has exploded during the coronavirus pandemic. A consumer-focused investment Microsoft is a longtime leader in the corporate space that has shifted its focus away from consumer-oriented offerings and linked its future to the success of its cloud business. So the TikTok deal would mark a significant push into the consumer space. It would add a big name to Microsoft's existing consumer-oriented offerings, which have had mixed success. While LinkedIn has a growing community of influencers and gaming products Xbox and Minecraft are popular, Microsoft recently shut down its Mixer game streaming platform. Other Microsoft offerings aimed at consumers, such as Bing and the now-defunct Windows phone, have flopped. \"Microsoft is a company we all know, but it's very much an enterprise software company,\" Jaluria said. \"TikTok might be a way for Microsoft to grow their consumer presence and consumer business.\" Although most people don't think about dancing teens when they think enterprise software, bringing on TikTok could help showcase Microsoft's corporate prowess: If Microsoft is able to button-up concerns around the app's data privacy policies and host a rapidly growing social network on its Azure cloud platform, it would underscore the security and geofencing capabilities of the service, Jaluria said. Will it work? Despite some failed bets in the company's past, a number of acquisitions made during Nadella's tenure at Microsoft have proven highly successful. Microsoft's $26 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 was a \"slam dunk\" for the company, in part because the social media platform was allowed to retain significant independence, Jaluria said. \"They haven't rebranded it, if you look on the website, they don't call it LinkedIn by Microsoft or something silly like that ... And LinkedIn gives Microsoft so much data that they can benefit from,\" Jaluria said, adding that a similar approach could work with TikTok. \"As long as they don't change the fundamental product, and let it run how (the app's) leadership wants it to, I think it will be a successful acquisition,\" he said. But there are risks, too. As part of the deal, Microsoft committed to ensuring American users' private data is stored in the United States. Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance will need US officials' sign-off on the deal and may have to make some kind of payment to the US Treasury. And acquiring an app created in China could bring new scrutiny on Microsoft at a time when US-China relations, especially over technology, are at a low point. Microsoft has largely avoided the recent wave of regulatory scrutiny directed at its Big Tech peers, but that could change if it acquires a controversial social media app created in China with a massive user base. Already, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has floated a suggestion that Microsoft be required to \"divest its Chinese holdings\" in order to be allowed to buy TikTok, he told CNN's Jim Scuitto on \"Newsroom\" Monday. \"I don't think there will be significant antitrust scrutiny on this deal, because Microsoft doesn't have any footprint in consumer social media,\" Jaluria said. \"But a post-TikTokMicrosoft could be in crosshairs because they would have a business where they're leveraging data. That's the issue people have worried about with Facebook and Google \u2014 using data for advertising.\" And then there's the question of whether TikTok's explosive success is really sustainable. If TikTok proves to be the next Instagram (and is able to withstand competition from a Facebook-owned rival launching soon), the deal will be a clear win, Wedbush's Ives said. \"However, if TikTok becomes the next Snapchat and has a host of user growth and monetization issues in the future, then this acquisition could detract from the valuation over time given massive competition

Microsoft (MSFT) on Sunday said it is pushing forward with talks to acquire TikTok, following a conversation between CEO Satya Nadella and President Donald Trump, who previously threatened to ban the app in the United States. The transaction could be complicated and difficult to accomplish. And Microsoft has in recent years shifted its strategy away from consumers toward businesses. Still, analysts say the deal is almost certain to be worthwhile for both companies. It's clear why TikTok would be interested in the deal: Trump has said he will ban the app if it doesn't find an American buyer by September 15. Microsoft may be TikTok's only hope. While other Big Tech firms might seem like a more natural fit to acquire TikTok \u2014 Facebook (), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) are facing antitrust scrutiny that would likely get in the way of an acquisition. Multiple analysts have described the acquisition as a potential \"coup\" for Microsoft \u2014 an opportunity to scoop up one of the world's fastest growing social media platforms at a time when TikTok may be desperate to make a deal. \"This is a unique deal of a decade opportunity with a price tag that could easily be consummated,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Monday. Microsoft would probably pay some portion of $50 billion \u2014 the estimated valuation of TikTok as a standalone business \u2014 to take control of the app's operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. News of the possible deal broke on Friday, and since the closing bell on Thursday, Microsoft's market cap has gained $80 billion, a sign that investors like the idea. Ives said he estimates TikTok's valuation could reach $200 billion within just a few years \"given the steep user and engagement trajectory of TikTok.\" DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria agreed, saying TikTok has the potential to grow \"exponentially,\" especially because social media use has exploded during the coronavirus pandemic. A consumer-focused investment Microsoft is a longtime leader in the corporate space that has shifted its focus away from consumer-oriented offerings and linked its future to the success of its cloud business. So the TikTok deal would mark a significant push into the consumer space. It would add a big name to Microsoft's existing consumer-oriented offerings, which have had mixed success. While LinkedIn has a growing community of influencers and gaming products Xbox and Minecraft are popular, Microsoft recently shut down its Mixer game streaming platform. Other Microsoft offerings aimed at consumers, such as Bing and the now-defunct Windows phone, have flopped. \"Microsoft is a company we all know, but it's very much an enterprise software company,\" Jaluria said. \"TikTok might be a way for Microsoft to grow their consumer presence and consumer business.\" Although most people don't think about dancing teens when they think enterprise software, bringing on TikTok could help showcase Microsoft's corporate prowess: If Microsoft is able to button-up concerns around the app's data privacy policies and host a rapidly growing social network on its Azure cloud platform, it would underscore the security and geofencing capabilities of the service, Jaluria said. Will it work? Despite some failed bets in the company's past, a number of acquisitions made during Nadella's tenure at Microsoft have proven highly successful. Microsoft's $26 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 was a \"slam dunk\" for the company, in part because the social media platform was allowed to retain significant independence, Jaluria said. \"They haven't rebranded it, if you look on the website, they don't call it LinkedIn by Microsoft or something silly like that ... And LinkedIn gives Microsoft so much data that they can benefit from,\" Jaluria said, adding that a similar approach could work with TikTok. \"As long as they don't change the fundamental product, and let it run how (the app's) leadership wants it to, I think it will be a successful acquisition,\" he said. But there are risks, too. As part of the deal, Microsoft committed to ensuring American users' private data is stored in the United States. Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance will need US officials' sign-off on the deal and may have to make some kind of payment to the US Treasury. And acquiring an app created in China could bring new scrutiny on Microsoft at a time when US-China relations, especially over technology, are at a low point. Microsoft has largely avoided the recent wave of regulatory scrutiny directed at its Big Tech peers, but that could change if it acquires a controversial social media app created in China with a massive user base. Already, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has floated a suggestion that Microsoft be required to \"divest its Chinese holdings\" in order to be allowed to buy TikTok, he told CNN's Jim Scuitto on \"Newsroom\" Monday. \"I don't think there will be significant antitrust scrutiny on this deal, because Microsoft doesn't have any footprint in consumer social media,\" Jaluria said. \"But a post-TikTokMicrosoft could be in crosshairs because they would have a business where they're leveraging data. That's the issue people have worried about with Facebook and Google \u2014 using data for advertising.\" And then there's the question of whether TikTok's explosive success is really sustainable. If TikTok proves to be the next Instagram (and is able to withstand competition from a Facebook-owned rival launching soon), the deal will be a clear win, Wedbush's Ives said. \"However, if TikTok

So far this year, MSFT shares have climbed by nearly 30%. Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler, quoted in a report by Barron's[6], offers that \"Microsoft has distinct advantages in portions of the market that should give the company the ability to reach, over time, revenue that is not that dissimilar to that of Amazon AWS (Amazon Web Services).\" With big gains already made in 2019, some analysts are predicting the stock could continue to climb by more than 20% in the year to come. How Microsoft Dwarfs Its Big Tech Rivals (Market Value) Microsoft: $1.02TAmazon: $905.6BApple: $893.8BFacebook: $497.3B Source: Investopedia  Microsoft Should Continue to Rise  Cloud-computing sales are a major driver of Microsoft's strong stock performance in recent months. </p><p>Moerdler anticipates sales in this area of more than $140 billion over the long term, with fiscal 2018 cloud-computing sales of $8 billion. Between software subscriptions like the its popular Office 365 and Azure, Microsoft's cloud-computing business, the company has positioned itself exceptionally well at a time when interest in the cloud space is booming. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella indicated that the company is \"accelerating [its] innovation across the cloud and edge so our customers can build the digital capability increasingly required to compete and grow.\" Another column by Barron's points out that the Azure segment saw fiscal third-quarter sales climb by 73% year-over-year. What It Means  The impressive performance of Microsoft's cloud segment has pushed the company's stock upwards, but it's the timing of these gains as compared with losses across many other tech leaders that makes MSFT stand out. A spate of antitrust[7] reviews has plagued many of Microsoft's rivals in the tech sector. Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon are in hot water which has threatened their respective stock prices in recent weeks, though each has recovered somewhat in the last few sessions.Microsoft was the target of its own major antitrust probe[8] which ended in 2001, but the company has long moved on from any negative public perception surrounding those events. As a result, while some of its biggest competitors are mired in regulatory challenges and negative publicity, Microsoft has been free to grow on the strength of its strong performance figures. What's Next  Last Friday, Microsoft's shares climbed above $132, bringing the company's market capitalization to over $1 trillion for the first time since it briefly achieved the landmark in April. As of the end of trading on Monday, MSFT remains above the $1 trillion threshold, ensuring that it dwarfs the other Big Techs. According to a report by Bloomberg[9], 36 analysts have predicted an average price target of $143 for MSFT stock, suggesting there is still plenty of room for upside. Piper Jaffray analyst Alex J. Zukin suggested that \"we continue to very much have a 'buy it and forget it' mentality on the stock right now as the company appears to be in the midst of secular fundamental growth.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/msft/\">https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/msft/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/aapl/\">https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/aapl/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/amzn/\">https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/amzn/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/fb/\">https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/fb/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/goog/\">https://www.investopedia.com/markets/stocks/goog/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-microsoft-stock-advantages-cloud-computing-51559680017?mod=RTA\">https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-microsoft-stock-advantages-cloud-computing-51559680017?mod=RTA</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antitrust.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antitrust.asp</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/microsoft-antitrust.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/microsoft-antitrust.asp</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-07/microsoft-regains-1-trillion-in-value-as-stock-climbs-to-record?utm_source=google..._medium=bd...Id=google\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-07/microsoft-regains-1-trillion-in-value-as-stock-climbs-to-record?utm_source=google..._medium=bd...Id=google</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VLK1010971560239151778251761300039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IVR-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9S-YDX1-F03R-N30H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><timeReceived>7:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investopedia Stock Analysis</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001S8A</classCode><className>FORBES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Early on, Klein brought up immigration, and clearly didn\u2019t anticipate the exchange he was about to have with the socialist candidate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI think if you take global poverty that seriously, it leads you to conclusions that in the U.S. are considered out of political bounds, things like sharply raising the level of immigration we permit, even up to a level of open borders,\u201d Klein said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sanders cut him off. \u201cOpen borders?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cNo, that's a Koch brothers proposal.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cReally?\u201d Klein asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would make a lot of global poor richer, wouldn't it?\u201d Klein said. </p><p>\u201cIt would make everybody in America poorer,\u201d Sanders responded. \u201cYou\u2019re doing away with the concept of a nation state, and I don't think there's any country in the world that believes in that. If you believe in a nation state or in a country called the United States or U.K. or Denmark or any other country, you have an obligation in my view to do everything we can to help poor people.\u201d</p><p>He went on, \u201cWhat right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don't believe in that.\u201d</p><p>In hindsight, it\u2019s an astounding exchange. In just four years, something akin to open borders, which Klein viewed as \u201cout of political bounds,\u201d has become the rallying cry of nearly all Democratic candidates for president. Sanders can no longer call open borders \u201ca Koch brothers proposal\u201d; abolish ICE is a major platform item of his left-wing base. Meanwhile, Republicans chant \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d </p><p>When we talk about the changes President Trump has wrought on us in his 30 months in office, we may think mostly of his effects on the Republican Party. But his influence goes much deeper than that. He has transformed the Right, but the Left has transformed itself in response to him.</p><p>To attend this month\u2019s conference on National Conservatism in Washington, D.C., you first had to prove you were not a white nationalist. \u201cI remember when I filled out the application to come here, I was very surprised,\u201d recalled a college professor who attended the conference. \u201cIt asked who I was. There was enough information that they could do a search, to see if I had posted anything online that was racist I guess.\u201d Then there was a waiting period. \u201cI never applied for a conference before and had to wait,\u201d he laughed. </p><p>The professor was not a white nationalist and his registration was accepted. Others were not so lucky; six people received letters denying their requests to attend. </p><p>\u201cDear Patrick Casey,\u201d read one to the head of Identity Evropa, a white nationalist group involved in the Charlottesville \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally at which a woman was murdered and men wielding tiki torches chanted \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d \u201cThank you for your interest in participating in the Edmund Burke Foundation\u2019s National Conservatism Conference. After discussing this matter with the conference presidium, we have concluded that we will be unable to honor your request to register for this event. This determination is based on professional associations that are incompatible with national conservatism as we understand it.\u201d </p><p>The letter was signed by Yoram Hazony, a prominent Israeli political theorist and author of The Virtue of Nationalism, who founded The Edmund Burke Foundation, which hosted the conference, and David Brog, another one of the organizers and a former executive at Christians United for Israel. (Disclosure: I have visited Hazony at his home, where we discussed nationalism at great length.)</p><p>\u201cIf racism and race theories are your thing, I'm sure there are lots of other conferences where you'll feel more at home,\u201d Hazony tweeted, after a furious Casey shared the letter publicly.</p><p>The distinction between nationalism and racism was a recurring one throughout the conference. \u201cWe are nationalists, not white nationalists!\u201d Brog declared during the conference\u2019s opening remarks. \u201cBut no screening system is perfect. So if there is anyone here tonight who believes that being an American has anything whatsoever to do with the color of someone's skin, there is the door. Please leave. Your ideas are not welcome here.\u201d</p><p>Brog\u2019s remarks acknowledged the stakes of the nascent movement. The new nationalists seek to reintroduce nationalism without the racism with which it has sometimes historically been associated, and are doing so at a time when nationalism\u2019s most public avatar, the U.S. president, calls himself a nationalist and also has a penchant for racist statements. The day that the conference began, Trump told four congresswomen of color that they should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they were \u201coriginally\u201d from. All four are U.S. citizens, and only one is an immigrant. </p><p>But the new nationalism is about far more than immigration, and some of it would be entirely familiar to liberals. For new nationalists also oppose free markets and Wall Street\u2019s influence on politics, and are deeply concerned about the poor, broken communities falling prey to the opioid epidemic, and the abandonment of workers by both major political parties. I can\u2019t recall the threat of socialism being mentioned at the three-day conference. On the contrary, much of it would not have sounded out of place in a campaign speech by Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. </p><p>In fact, Tucker Carlson, one of the keynote speakers, called Warren\u2019s book, The Two Income Trap, one of the best books he\u2019d ever read on economics. His message that identity politics is a distraction while elites pick your pocket echoed things Bernie Sanders said on the campaign trail in 2016. \u201cIt is not good enough for somebody to say, \u2018I\u2019m a woman, vote for me\u2019,\u201d Sanders said in 2016. \u201cWhat we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to Wall Street, to the insurance companies, to the drug companies, to the fossil fuel industries.\u201d</p><p>Sanders does not say those things now and Warren would never embrace Carlson back. Past comments about how the working class is threatened by cheap immigrant labor are left unsaid in 2019. The idea that America\u2019s most vulnerable should come before those of other countries is not only heterodox; it\u2019s considered downright racist.</p><p>National conservatives hope to provide intellectual heft and backbone to Trumpism so avoids being an ephemeral phenomenon. Can they? </p><p>In The Virtue of Nationalism, Hazony defines a nation as \u201ca number of tribes with a common language or religion, and a past history of acting as a body for the common defense and other large-scale enterprises.\u201d As a conglomerate of tribes, rather than a unified entity with a singular ethnic or racial makeup that requires protection, a nation is always heterogeneous, and thus never based on race, writes Hazony. It\u2019s not biological homogeneity that ties the members of a tribe together, but rather what Hazony calls \u201cbonds of mutual loyalty\u201d that create a unit from diverse clans and tribes, operating as the glue that binds the nation together.</p><p>For Hazony, it is loyalty, rather than biology, that lies at the heart of nationalism. He balks at the biological determinism involved in reducing politics to genetics. </p><p>Still, it is a proudly conservative theory. It\u2019s based on values such as loyalty and obligation, tradition and even scripture, rather than John Locke\u2019s classical liberal values of consent, choice, and contracts. The new nationalists do embrace the idea that there is one main culture that determines the destiny of a nation. \u201cWhat is needed for the establishment of a stable and free state is a majority nation whose cultural dominance is plain and unquestioned, and against which resistance appears to be futile,\u201d Hazony writes. </p><p>Hazony concedes that this has sometimes led to the oppression of minorities. \u201cAmericans expressed their national freedom and self-determination while tolerating slavery and odious race laws for much of their history,\u201d Hazony writes. He believes it essential that the majority culture protect minorities, for both moral and strategic purposes. When these obligations to protect minority tribes are not met, \u201canarchy and empire follows.\u201d</p><p>This focus on the majority culture is hard to swallow. For the new nationalists, America\u2019s dominant culture is a Christian one. Religious minorities are peripheral, and at least for some, diversity is not an objective good to be pursued or even cherished. </p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t something we should try to engineer,\u201d Rusty Reno, another one of the conference organizers and the editor of First Things, told me. \u201cWe should try to seek the common good of a society and promote the well-being of American citizens, and if for some reason, I don't know, if for some reason, everyone wants to become Catholic, I wouldn't say this is a bad thing.\" </p><p>Wouldn\u2019t he think it was a tragedy if there were no more Jews in America?</p><p>\"No. What if everybody makes Aliyah?\" He replied, using the Hebrew word for immigrating to Israel. </p><p>\u201cI think that would be really bad for America, and really sad,\u201d I said.</p><p>\"I don't know. Yes and no. You try to do what's best for the commonweal,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn't want to socially engineer a society to keep it the way it is.\"</p><p>But there's a difference between socially engineering it and having an emotional attachment to certain minorities, I countered.</p><p>\"Depends where you're from,\u201d he said. \u201cNew York wouldn't be New York without its Jews. There would be a sense of loss, even as a gentile in New York. That's part of the landscape of the city. It seems to me that's a beautiful thing and of course you would naturally cherish that. But if you grew up in Cedar City, Utah, if it became more diverse, you would lose the place you grew up in. And you'd feel a sense of loss for that. So it just depends ... For the country as a whole, I think yeah, Americans do cherish our heterogeneity. Too much homogeneity would cause people to feel like, hey wait a minute, that's not really our country.\"</p><p>What is \u201cour country\u201d is placing a premium on tradition, family, church, and independence; the new nationalists really like Brexit.</p><p>The list of things they dislike is longer. It begins with identity politics, an \u201cendless distraction factory\u201d according to Peter Thiel, a keynote speaker, or \u201can obsession with the atomized self,\u201d as Mary Eberstadt would have it, or \u201ca never-ending fight of dominant versus oppressed groups\u201d per Mike Gonzalez, or, for Hazony, because it reduces politics to biology.</p><p>But they are also deeply suspicious of what they see as libertarianism\u2019s excesses. Eberstadt quipped that libertarianism is like moonshine: If you\u2019re healthy, it might help you overcome some trifling malady, but if anything is wrong with you, it can kill you. They are far more suspicious of war, big business, and Silicon Valley than is a typical cross-section of conservatives. And they really hate \u201cImagine,\u201d by John Lennon. </p><p>The new nationalism has thus found itself sitting astride what have been traditionally liberal and conservative agendas, making targets of both left-wing ideologies and right-wing sacred cows. Take Tucker Carlson\u2019s idea that \u201cthe main threat to live your life as you wish doesn\u2019t come from the government anymore but from the private sector.\u201d</p><p>Like the insistent and repeated condemnations of racism that reoccurred throughout the conference, these are not the sentiments one is used to hearing from conservatives but from the Left. The idea that free trade, massive corporations, rising inequality, and endless war are bad for America used to be fundamental pillars of the Democratic Party.</p><p>But they\u2019ve been creeping into conservative discourse. The Tea Party united fiscal and social conservatives who pushed back against Bush-era \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d which they viewed as big government conservatism. The Bush-era approach to foreign affairs is being reassessed as well. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, of Florida, recently declared, \u201cFreedom cannot be America\u2019s gift to the world, purchased with the blood of U.S. service members alone.\u201d</p><p>Increasingly, Republicans have been speaking about big tech companies as monopolies, joining Democrats in criticizing their lack of regulation. \u201cI don't trust you guys,\u201d Republican Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona said recently at a hearing about Facebook. \u201cInstead of cleaning up your house, now you're launching into another business model.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps no one represents this new conservative path better than Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. In June, he proposed a bill that would tighten federal scrutiny of social media companies with the threat of curtailing their ability to moderate their platforms according to their own terms of service. It received a thumbs-down from David French at National Review, who warned it would \u201cenable public censorship,\u201d and from Elizabeth Nolan Brown at Reason, who called it \u201cOrwellian.\u201d At the Federalist, however, law professor Adam Candeub and tech writer Jeremy Carl argued that the bill \u201cwill stop major internet firms from targeting conservatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe great divide of our time is not between Trump supporters and Trump opponents, or between suburban voters and rural ones, or between Red America and Blue America,\u201d Hawley said at the conference. \u201cNo, the great divide of our time is between the political agenda of the leadership elite and the great and broad middle of our society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefending the vulnerable, protecting the weak\u201d should be the goal, Hawley argued.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren is running for president on the Democratic side for the same reason. \u201cEvery person in America should be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules, &amp; take care of themselves &amp; the people they love,\u201d she tweeted when launching her campaign. \u201cAmerica\u2019s middle class is under attack.\u201d By who? \u201cBillionaires and big corporations.\u201d Then last week, Warren released a trade plan that would give unions and green groups more sway over deals and echoed protectionist rhetoric increasingly common on the right. The plan, Politico noted, is \u201ccloser to Donald Trump\u2019s agenda than Barack Obama\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>It comes back to the elephant in the room, which is immigration. There was a time recently when the fact that immigrants drive down the wages of poor Americans concerned the party that is supposed to represent the poor and working class. Not anymore. Most Democrats running for president, including Warren, have called for decriminalizing crossing the border illegally and for expanding immigration, the result of pressure from Latino activists, Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and a backlash against Trump\u2019s draconian measures on the border. </p><p>The Left's common reaction to Trump is to equate all nationalism with white nationalism. As if to prove their point, one of the speakers at the conference did veer into racist language when discussing immigrants. Amy Wax, a law professor at University of Pennsylvania, made the case for restricting immigrants from Third World countries because of their cultural distance from America. \"Embracing cultural distance, cultural distance nationalism, means in effect taking the position that our country will be better off with more whites, and fewer non-whites. Well, that is the result, anyway,\" she said. The theory doesn't rely on race, Wax argued, because correlation is not causation, but these \"racial dimensions,\" as she preferred to call them, spook conservatives. </p><p>But Wax was the exception that proved the rule. Her remarks stood out because they were so out of step with those of other speakers. The vast majority stressed the importance of fighting racism and whose calls for less immigration came in the context of a call to focus on vulnerable Americans. </p><p>It is this version of nationalism that the Left must engage with. </p><p>What might a liberal nationalism look like?</p><p>In her book Why Nationalism, published this year, former Israeli parliamentarian Yael \"Yuli\" Tamir, like Hazony, takes issue with the liberal order. Liberalism granted us real, necessary freedoms, Tamir argues, but it left us with a thin, impoverished politics that failed to provide for a crucial human desire: the need for recognition, and the pride one takes in belonging to something larger than oneself. This Tamir calls \u201cthe emotional and moral bias grounded in membership.\u201d </p><p>Like Hazony and the new nationalists, Tamir believes that xenophobia is not an inherent component of nationalism. While in-group favoritism is a human constant, out-group hostility comes from a feeling of unfairness or felt injustice: \u201cHumanity bears Cain\u2019s mark; individuals cannot be envy-free, neither can they ignore the anger invoked by injustice.\u201d</p><p>That sense of injustice flooded the United States thanks to globalization, writes Tamir. She calls it globalism, which I will refrain from doing, because many view it as an anti-Semitic dog-whistle. Tamir, obviously, does not mean it that way. Nationalism is a rational response. In this telling, embracing nationalism can be the cure for 21st century racism and ethnocentrism because it digs out one of the primary causes, inequality, by its roots. </p><p>Like Hazony, Tamir calls us to accept the body politic as we find it. Rather than fighting against human nature or seeking to circumvent it, we must accept that people require recognition, and feel powerful forces of envy and destruction when left behind, ignored, and made to feel invisible. </p><p>It\u2019s a crucial message, and not just for anyone interested in winning an election in the near future. We have obligations to our fellow citizens, beginning with taking the body politic as we find it. Our democracy, even the concept of democracy, depends on it.</p><p>As Tamir aptly puts it, \u201cthe legitimacy of a democratic regime depends on the support it gathers among its citizens. The question of who is a member thus gains special importance.\u201d</p><p>This idea, that democracy requires a national border and a meaningful texture to bind its citizens to each other, was clear to Sanders just four years ago. Now, it\u2019s an idea that could get you branded a racist, in large part thanks to an all-encompassing #Resistance to Trump, whose racial provocations make it easy to blur the line between nationalism and white nationalism. </p><p>But the Left should resist that conflation. Failing to engage nationalism seriously risks ceding the intellectual playing field to conservatives for a generation on an issue that won\u2019t go away just because it is ignored.</p><p>Batya Ungar-Sargon is the opinion editor of the Forward.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2275032532</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVH-6V71-DY0W-42GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3094\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

They should enjoy the win and celebrate the 25,000 jobs headed to each. Of course, there is no guarantee the bet will pay off over the longer term. And the short-term impact surely means tighter housing and worse traffic. </p><p>Citizens in both places should ask hard questions about whether officials overbid, especially given Amazon splitting HQ2. Still, the potential opportunity to firmly anchor and expand positions as technology and entrepreneurial hubs was probably too good to pass up. Behind a \u201cVirginia is for Amazon Lovers\u201d sign, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam speaks at a news conference after the announcement that Crystal City has been selected as home to Amazon\u2019s new headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, November 13, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque There\u2019s also little doubt that giving companies large subsidies to relocate or open new sites is generally a pretty bad idea. An Upjohn Institute study last year looked at the record of economic development incentives from 1990 to 2015. During that period, goodies for business more than tripled, increasing in worth from 9 percent of business taxes to 30 percent. Yet there wasn\u2019t much correlation with \u201ca state\u2019s current or past unemployment or income levels, or with future economic growth.\u201d Nor typically do these packages appear decisive in corporate decisions. But Amazon might be different. Its gravitational pull might be large enough to justify the cities\u2019 investment. What economists typically suggest instead of targeted incentives are broader policies to improve a state\u2019s competitiveness, such as tax and regulatory reform, as well as fashioning an education system that churns out lots of skilled workers. Indeed, Bezos chose to start Amazon in Seattle because it was a tech hub with lots of smart workers and offered a favorable tax environment. But how did Seattle first get a reputation as a good place to start a tech firm? The city can thank Microsoft founders Paul Allen, who died last month, and Bill Gates for relocating their young software firm from Albuquerque some four decades ago. It was a big break after a tough decade for the region. Layoffs at Boeing were devastating, and the Emerald City became a national joke after a couple of real estate agents rented a billboard displaying a plea copied by struggling cities everywhere: \u201cWill the last person leaving Seattle \u2014 Turn out the lights.\u201d Then came Allen and Gates. Although Microsoft was expanding fast in New Mexico, the company headed for Bellevue, just 10 miles from Seattle, on New Year\u2019s Day, 1979. But it wasn\u2019t because of some analytical business decision, such as the one Bezos made. The Seattle natives just wanted to go home. And the decision transformed the city. As economist Enrico Moretti notes, college graduates in Seattle then were making just $4,200 more than those in Albuquerque vs. $14,000 more today. The arrival or emergence of dynamic tech firms can create a powerful entrepreneurial ecosystem that enables a clustering of new firms. This not only attracts knowledge workers but also generates spillover jobs for everyone from lawyers to construction workers to lower-paid service employees. Seattle got lucky, and surely many cities that submitted bids to Amazon were hoping to get lucky, too. You kind of have to. \u201cIf you look at the history of America\u2019s great innovation hubs, they haven\u2019t found one that was directly, explicitly engineered by an explicit policy on the part of the government,\u201d Moretti, author of \u201cThe New Geography of Jobs,\u201d has said. Of course, New York City and Washington are hardly left-behind cities. But the arrival of Amazon should formidably strengthen their already strong tech sectors. It really is a unique opportunity, one that could help recession-proof both regions. And even if Washington follows through with threats to regulate big tech, Amazon should remain a pretty reliable employer in New York and Virginia for years to come due to the way regulation frequently helps incumbent players. Yes, it would have been great for non-coastal America if Amazon had picked Chicago, Detroit, or St. Louis. Hopefully this whole process will alert city officials across America to their strengths and weaknesses in an ever-more tech-driven economy. But if Washington is unwilling to relocate federal agencies to the Midwest, as some have proposed, it\u2019s even more unrealistic to expect a company to do something it doesn\u2019t feel is in its long-term interests.

They should enjoy the win and celebrate the 25,000 jobs headed to each. Of course, there is no guarantee the bet will pay off over the longer term. And the short-term impact surely means tighter housing and worse traffic. </p><p>Citizens in both places should ask hard questions about whether officials overbid, especially given Amazon splitting HQ2. Still, the potential opportunity to firmly anchor and expand positions as technology and entrepreneurial hubs was probably too good to pass up. Behind a \u201cVirginia is for Amazon Lovers\u201d sign, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam speaks at a news conference after the announcement that Crystal City has been selected as home to Amazon\u2019s new headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, November 13, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque There\u2019s also little doubt that giving companies large subsidies to relocate or open new sites is generally a pretty bad idea. An Upjohn Institute study last year looked at the record of economic development incentives from 1990 to 2015. During that period, goodies for business more than tripled, increasing in worth from 9 percent of business taxes to 30 percent. Yet there wasn\u2019t much correlation with \u201ca state\u2019s current or past unemployment or income levels, or with future economic growth.\u201d Nor typically do these packages appear decisive in corporate decisions. But Amazon might be different. Its gravitational pull might be large enough to justify the cities\u2019 investment. What economists typically suggest instead of targeted incentives are broader policies to improve a state\u2019s competitiveness, such as tax and regulatory reform, as well as fashioning an education system that churns out lots of skilled workers. Indeed, Bezos chose to start Amazon in Seattle because it was a tech hub with lots of smart workers and offered a favorable tax environment. But how did Seattle first get a reputation as a good place to start a tech firm? The city can thank Microsoft founders Paul Allen, who died last month, and Bill Gates for relocating their young software firm from Albuquerque some four decades ago. It was a big break after a tough decade for the region. Layoffs at Boeing were devastating, and the Emerald City became a national joke after a couple of real estate agents rented a billboard displaying a plea copied by struggling cities everywhere: \u201cWill the last person leaving Seattle \u2014 Turn out the lights.\u201d Then came Allen and Gates. Although Microsoft was expanding fast in New Mexico, the company headed for Bellevue, just 10 miles from Seattle, on New Year\u2019s Day, 1979. But it wasn\u2019t because of some analytical business decision, such as the one Bezos made. The Seattle natives just wanted to go home. And the decision transformed the city. As economist Enrico Moretti notes, college graduates in Seattle then were making just $4,200 more than those in Albuquerque vs. $14,000 more today. The arrival or emergence of dynamic tech firms can create a powerful entrepreneurial ecosystem that enables a clustering of new firms. This not only attracts knowledge workers but also generates spillover jobs for everyone from lawyers to construction workers to lower-paid service employees. Seattle got lucky, and surely many cities that submitted bids to Amazon were hoping to get lucky, too. You kind of have to. \u201cIf you look at the history of America\u2019s great innovation hubs, they haven\u2019t found one that was directly, explicitly engineered by an explicit policy on the part of the government,\u201d Moretti, author of \u201cThe New Geography of Jobs,\u201d has said. Of course, New York City and Washington are hardly left-behind cities. But the arrival of Amazon should formidably strengthen their already strong tech sectors. It really is a unique opportunity, one that could help recession-proof both regions. And even if Washington follows through with threats to regulate big tech, Amazon should remain a pretty reliable employer in New York and Virginia for years to come due to the way regulation frequently helps incumbent players. Yes, it would have been great for non-coastal America if Amazon had picked Chicago, Detroit, or St. Louis. Hopefully this whole process will alert city officials across America to their strengths and weaknesses in an ever-more tech-driven economy. But if Washington is unwilling to relocate federal agencies to the Midwest, as some have proposed, it\u2019s even more unrealistic to expect a company to do something it doesn\u2019t feel is in its long-term interests. I guess we\u2019ll just have to be satisfied with a super-successful company that spends billions on research, generates gobs of jobs, and delivers cool stuff right to our door.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1870869I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRN-8HB1-JDG9-Y1H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"829\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They should enjoy the win and celebrate the 25,000 jobs headed to each. Of course, there is no guarantee the bet will pay off over the longer term. And the short-term impact surely means tighter housing and worse traffic. </p><p>Citizens in both places should ask hard questions about whether officials overbid, especially given Amazon splitting HQ2. Still, the potential opportunity to firmly anchor and expand positions as technology and entrepreneurial hubs was probably too good to pass up. Behind a \u201cVirginia is for Amazon Lovers\u201d sign, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam speaks at a news conference after the announcement that Crystal City has been selected as home to Amazon\u2019s new headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, November 13, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque There\u2019s also little doubt that giving companies large subsidies to relocate or open new sites is generally a pretty bad idea. An Upjohn Institute study last year looked at the record of economic development incentives from 1990 to 2015. During that period, goodies for business more than tripled, increasing in worth from 9 percent of business taxes to 30 percent. Yet there wasn\u2019t much correlation with \u201ca state\u2019s current or past unemployment or income levels, or with future economic growth.\u201d Nor typically do these packages appear decisive in corporate decisions. But Amazon might be different. Its gravitational pull might be large enough to justify the cities\u2019 investment. What economists typically suggest instead of targeted incentives are broader policies to improve a state\u2019s competitiveness, such as tax and regulatory reform, as well as fashioning an education system that churns out lots of skilled workers. Indeed, Bezos chose to start Amazon in Seattle because it was a tech hub with lots of smart workers and offered a favorable tax environment. But how did Seattle first get a reputation as a good place to start a tech firm? The city can thank Microsoft founders Paul Allen, who died last month, and Bill Gates for relocating their young software firm from Albuquerque some four decades ago. It was a big break after a tough decade for the region. Layoffs at Boeing were devastating, and the Emerald City became a national joke after a couple of real estate agents rented a billboard displaying a plea copied by struggling cities everywhere: \u201cWill the last person leaving Seattle \u2014 Turn out the lights.\u201d Then came Allen and Gates. Although Microsoft was expanding fast in New Mexico, the company headed for Bellevue, just 10 miles from Seattle, on New Year\u2019s Day, 1979. But it wasn\u2019t because of some analytical business decision, such as the one Bezos made. The Seattle natives just wanted to go home. And the decision transformed the city. As economist Enrico Moretti notes, college graduates in Seattle then were making just $4,200 more than those in Albuquerque vs. $14,000 more today. The arrival or emergence of dynamic tech firms can create a powerful entrepreneurial ecosystem that enables a clustering of new firms. This not only attracts knowledge workers but also generates spillover jobs for everyone from lawyers to construction workers to lower-paid service employees. Seattle got lucky, and surely many cities that submitted bids to Amazon were hoping to get lucky, too. You kind of have to. \u201cIf you look at the history of America\u2019s great innovation hubs, they haven\u2019t found one that was directly, explicitly engineered by an explicit policy on the part of the government,\u201d Moretti, author of \u201cThe New Geography of Jobs,\u201d has said. Of course, New York City and Washington are hardly left-behind cities. But the arrival of Amazon should formidably strengthen their already strong tech sectors. It really is a unique opportunity, one that could help recession-proof both regions. And even if Washington follows through with threats to regulate big tech, Amazon should remain a pretty reliable employer in New York and Virginia for years to come due to the way regulation frequently helps incumbent players. Yes, it would have been great for non-coastal America if Amazon had picked Chicago, Detroit, or St. Louis. Hopefully this whole process will alert city officials across America to their strengths and weaknesses in an ever-more tech-driven economy. But if Washington is unwilling to relocate federal agencies to the Midwest, as some have proposed, it\u2019s even more unrealistic to expect a company to do something it doesn\u2019t feel is in its long-term interests. I guess we\u2019ll just have to be satisfied with a super-successful company that spends billions on research, generates gobs of jobs, and delivers cool stuff right to our door.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1870869I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRN-7T21-JDG9-Y2XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"829\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

While big tech companies have already captured most of the larger SaaS verticals, they've left many niche markets untapped, believing the returns won't be lucrative enough[3] to warrant the necessary investment of resources. That forces these niche businesses to piece together a myriad of general-purpose SaaS products to solve their business needs. So there's a huge opportunity to build vertical software services that consolidate the various business functions of companies in these niche markets into one solution.Vertical vs. horizontal softwareHorizontal software is built to perform a specific business or departmental function and can be used by companies across various industries. Because these products address a single function, they lack features that can give you a holistic view of a business. Vertical solutions are tailor made with a specific industry in mind. Industry experts build these tools with nuanced knowledge on how to address various pain points with a unique feature set. For example, management software for gyms and salons will combine schedule management, payment processing, payroll, and marketing all in one place. Vertical software can leverage industry-specific jargon, best practices, and training, and it can deliver new features as market shifts occur, allowing businesses to continuously serve customers at the best of their ability. Needs vary across industries. Fintech and healthcare companies will require more secure and reliable data storage systems. For example, Veeva[4] offers several cloud-based services for life science and pharmaceutical companies. Users love Veeva for being a great platform for recording conversations between marketing teams and health practitioners. Whereas, hospitality businesses with high turnover may need tools with highly streamlined and efficient on-boarding workflows. Vertical SaaS can often be even further customized to better fit a specific company's needs \u2014 including needs that the company may not know it has. Vertical SaaS providers are also well versed on the regulatory needs of the industry they target. In sectors where businesses are heavily monitored, SaaS tools will provide features that optimize compliance and support. The product will incorporate features to streamline the reporting process and ensure that the business is abiding by all rules of law. Lease-administration SaaS provider Lucernex[5], for example, helps companies comply with changing compliance regulations and has excellent customer support. Customer support that understands industry-specific needs, language, laws, and norms can save companies time, effort, and money.Low-touch vs. high-touch salesWhen determining how to distribute SaaS products, providers take either a low-touch or a high-touch sales approach. In low-touch sales, there's very little human interaction with the user organization. User organizations are free to discover the product on their own and the software manages check ins and followups. The vendor may outline specific use cases, reducing the amount of work the user organization has to do when figuring out if the product is best for its needs. On the other hand, in high-touch sales, a human helps the user organization throughout the entire buying and on-boarding process. There's a much higher level of participation, with account managers maintaining personal and frequent contact with customers. In niche vertical markets, a low-touch sales strategy will have greater success than its non-vertical counterparts. When the product is custom-built for its users, it advertises itself to a certain degree, by having a built-in understanding of the user organization's needs and pain points. Vertical SaaS offerings are also designed to have an onboarding flow that fits into the user organization's day-to-day activities. Since they don't have to divert resources to actively manage customer relationships, vertical SaaS companies can invest those resources in further developing the product and managing hyper-unique client needs or situations. Some companies start with low touch and progress to a higher touch model. Zendesk[6], for example, started with a low-touch model and eventually added sales teams to further cater to its users. As products develop and become more complex, the need for a human sales person may become more prevalent.Birds of a feather flock togetherProducts of great value tend to sell themselves. So when marketing vertical SaaS tools in niche markets, your job is much easier. Customers don't have to ask, 'Is this relevant to me?' The more you can reduce friction in the buying decision, the quicker these products are adopted. The more vertical SaaS tools can narrow their focus, the more clear and exact their message becomes. There's a consistent voice and value being presented, and that attracts the right customers. As a vertical SaaS provider, you understand the world in which your customers operate. The conversations are richer, and your advice or recommendations are more precise. This aids in building trust and social currency. When prospective customers see the SaaS tool in use by a similar business, they are more likely to try it themselves. Which makes it easier for vertical SaaS solutions to reach potential new users. TaskRabbit[7] is an example of a company that targeted a specific demographic within a geographic area. By simplifying the life of moms who were typically over-tasked and strapped on time, the company built incredible rapport with its initial users that paid dividends. Those first users started sharing the site with their friends, and through word of mouth the TaskRabbit brand was established. As more companies within an industry integrate a vertical SaaS product into their businesses, the SaaS provider gains a more complete view of the sector and the nuanced needs of certain customers. It can build specific features for one customer that can easily translate to the rest of the industry. These indirect network effects make vertical SaaS products more sticky and defensible from new market entrants.

Atkinson</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For more than a half century, the president of the United States has issued a ritualistic proclamation setting aside a full week to celebrate America's small business owners. This year, National Small Business Week runs from April 29 to May 5. Fine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But if President Trump wants to demonstrate that he thinks and acts outside the box, then he should also issue a second proclamation establishing the following week as National Big Business Week.</p><p>I can already hear howls of protest at the mere suggestion of such an idea. Small businesses are the \"backbone of the economy, aren't they? They are responsible for an overwhelming share of the country's job creation and innovation, right?</p><p>And big, fat corporations with their hordes of Gucci-wearing lobbyists already get all manner of special perks and favors from government! Why in God's name have a special week for Big Business?</p><p>The surprising truth, as Michael Lind and I point out in our new book \"Big is Beautiful: Debunking the Myth of Small Business, is that large businesses are the real engines of the American economy. On virtually every indicator of economic and social performance, including productivity, exports, wages, worker benefits and safety, workforce diversity, unionization, environmental protection, tax compliance, and business social responsibility, the average big firm outperforms the average small firm.</p><p>Even on job creation, the metric on which small business supposedly shines, big firms do better. Sure, small firms create a lot of jobs, but they also destroy a lot of jobs because many small businesses fail in their first five years. As economist Ryan Decker and co-authors found, when you consider continuing firms (that is, firms of any age, leaving out those that start and then die), firms with more than 500 employees created more jobs from 1992 to 2005 than did firms overall.</p><p>Moreover, big firms are the main customers for many small firms. For example, Boeing, the leading aerospace company, spent $5 billion with U.S. small business suppliers in 2016, supporting approximately 50,000 jobs. Without strong and globally competitive large firms, many small firms would go bust.</p><p>OK, you might say, big firms are important - but why do we really need a Big Business Week? These big corporations can take care of themselves, can't they?</p><p>The answer is simple: Public opinion and public policy have gotten dangerously skewed, to the point where the very term \"big is now an epithet to be applied to any industry the labeler doesn't like (e.g., \"big oil, \"big food, \"big tech and even \"big chicken ). In 2016 Gallup found that, while 68 percent of Americans have confidence in small business, only 18 percent felt that way about big business.</p><p>This bias has played out over decades in the halls of Congress and government agencies, as lawmakers and regulators have conferred a slew of valuable benefits and exemptions on small firms for no other reason than the fact that they are small.</p><p>Indeed, in the years since the Small Business Administration's founding in 1953, Congress has passed at least 68 pieces of legislation explicitly favoring small business - from the Small Business Prepayment Penalty Relief Act of 1994 to the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, and the SEC Small Business Advocate Act of 2016.</p><p>As a result, firms with fewer than 11 employees are exempt from most workplace safety requirements. The Family and Medical Leave Act does not apply to small firms. Most shocking of all, many civil rights laws contain exemptions for small firms. For example, a firm with fewer than 20 employees can legally discriminate against workers based on age; if it has fewer than 15 employees, it can discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities.</p><p>The tax code is also stacked in favor of small firms. Profits from publicly traded companies (most of which are large) are typically taxed twice - once at the corporate level and again when shareholders accrue capital gains or dividends.</p><p>In contrast, pass-through firms (such as sole proprietorships, partnerships or LLCs) - the lion's share of which are small - are taxed only once, on the owners' incomes. In addition, many specific tax incentives, such as bonus depreciation, either apply only to small firms or are more generous for small firms.</p><p>To give small businesses an additional leg up, federal agencies are required to buy goods and services from them even when their prices are higher. Federal agencies also subsidize specific types of small firms. For example, the SBA in 2016 provided loans worth $105 million for car dealers, $118 million for residential building construction, $312 million for liquor stores, $742 million for gas stations and $760 million for dentists.</p><p>When one class of business gets its own presidentially designated week on the calendar, it suggests they truly need and deserve special treatment.</p><p>But the reality is that this small-business cronyism leads to lower wages, higher prices and higher taxes than we would have if governments adopted a size-neutral approach. So, if we are going to continue the tradition of National Small Business Week, then please, President Trump, can we also have National Big Business Week?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRGAZ-2018122526</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRGAZ2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7N-WYY1-DYT8-R2DV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146813</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Charleston Newspapers</copyright><publicationName>Charleston Gazette-Mail</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 2, 2018, Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>BOE (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>BA (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Labor &amp;

The market seemed to have agreed at first, as shares spiked in after-hours trading in reaction to the company's all-around beat. But along the good news came concerns over regulatory scrutiny and earnings growth that, upon closer inspection, might have caused investors to scratch their heads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Thursday morning, shares were falling 1.5% to $201.60 although they're still up 54% year to date.</p><p>More specifically, the earnings report informed investors of an antitrust investigation recently launched by the Federal Trade Commission against Facebook, separate from the case it officially settled on Wednesday over the mishandling of user data. The new investigation makes the Menlo Park-based company  into \"market-leading online platforms\" that, in a worst-case scenario, could lead to the dismantling of \"Big Tech\" giants such as Facebook, Amazon  and Alphabet  . In addition, the overhang associated with decelerating ad revenue growth and increased privacy and compliance costs remains, adding uncertainty to Facebook's future bottom line results.</p><p><br/>Pristine Second Quarter Numbers <br/></p><p>On the key operating metrics, Facebook performed as well as it has been for the past several quarters. Daily active users increased by 8% year-over-year, in line with the first quarter growth rate. North America, a more mature market, experienced very little of the upside, while Europe continued to suffer from an unfavorable regulatory environment. Picking up the slack was a strong Asia-Pacific geographic segment, lifted primarily by increased usage in India, Indonesia and the Philippines.</p><p>Worth noting was the robust 18% increase in average revenue per user worldwide, driven primarily by successful monetization efforts in the developed markets. The improvement can be attributed to significantly higher ad impressions, especially as Stories has proven to be a great complement to Facebook and Instagram Feeds as an effective ad platform.</p><p>Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased across the board, even after adjusting for the the $2 billion in legal accruals related to an FTC settlement (Facebook had previously set aside $3 billion toward the potential settlement in the first quarter). The increase in operating expenses seems consistent with Facebook's bloated 2019 budget, inflated by investments in product development as well as in privacy and compliance processes needed to address data handling issues that have recently put Facebook in hot water.</p><p><br/>Big Tech Under Attack <br/></p><p>There is plenty in the second quarter results that will likely please Facebook bulls. User growth remains strong, particularly outside North America and Europe, while these more mature markets have been enjoying a boost in per-user monetization. In addition, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision for the development of payment capabilities within the social media platforms, as well as a product and service marketplace, could develop into growth and revenue diversification opportunities for the tech company.</p><p>However, the upside potential is not without substantial risks. First, ad targeting challenges and lower per-ad revenue generated by Stories create headwinds to revenue growth that the company confirmed in the earnings call will last into 2020. In addition, spending on safety, security and privacy is only likely to increase, as Facebook continues to grapple with scrutiny over data handling -- likely explaining the bump in full-year expense outlook to as much as 61% year-over-year, at the high end of the guidance range. The costs could increase further, assuming the FTC and an eventual Department of Justice investigations into antitrust matters leads to higher legal spending.</p><p>The pros and cons of investing in Facebook could very well balance out <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">if</emphasis> valuations were de-risked enough. However, the stock now trades at the same 27x current-year earnings that it did in mid-July 2018, before growth deceleration and privacy concerns sent shares tumbling 43% over the following five months.</p><p>The landscape in 2019 looks eerily familiar, as Facebook stock inches closer to its all-time high. Because rich valuations do not seem to properly discount the risks associated with placing a bet on this name, I believe now is not the best time to buy shares of Facebook.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Save 76% with our Summer Break Sale.</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Subscribe to our premium site Real Money and become a smarter investor! </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">!</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.

While banks might initially cheer the expansion of these rules, which they say are giving competitors an unfair advantage, some could struggle in the long run to cope with the unleashing of massive amounts of data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is in the midst of a consultation on Open Finance, which looks at whether the principles of national open banking rules should include companies in other areas of financial services such as credit cards, mortgages, consumer credit and pensions, with a view to providing consumers with greater choice and pricing transparency.</p><p>If the consultation, which ends in March, leads to an Open Finance regime in the U.K., the next step could be new standards applied to other sectors to share their data too, according to David Beardmore, commercial director at the Open Data Institute, a London-based nonprofit.</p><p>The U.K. could eventually follow Australia, where the government has begun using open banking as part of a broader approach to consumer data rights, he said.</p><p>Australia passed consumer data rights legislation in August 2019, which requires banks to share their data in a phased rollout in 2020, before extending the law to telecom and energy companies.</p><p>2-way street</p><p>Open banking in the U.K. has steadily gained traction since the rule was launch two years ago. One way to measure its impact is to monitor the number of \"API calls\"   that is, how often third parties request consumer data from a bank account using technology known as an application program interface, or API. Figures from the Open Banking Implementation Entity show that the number of successful API calls stood at 215.3 million in November 2019, up from 1.9 million in June 2018. Meanwhile, more than 1 million customers have now used open banking, the entity said Jan. 20.</p><p>But not everyone is happy about the arrival of open banking and its EU equivalent, the second payment services directive, or PSD2.</p><p>Critics, including a number of incumbent bank executives, say that while open banking may be enabling greater competition in Europe, it is also creating an unfair advantage for newcomers.</p><p>\"We are asked to open up our data to everyone, which is fine, that's the rule, but if one of my clients wants me to have access to his data on Amazon or Google that is not possible,\" UniCredit SpA CEO Jean Pierre Mustier said in a speech in September 2019.</p><p>Mustier vowed to \"push super hard\" during discussions with industry bodies to ensure that banks get a \"level playing field.\"</p><p>\"There is no reason why there should be an asymmetric treatment of banks,\" he said.</p><p>Ana Bot\u00edn, executive chair of Banco Santander SA, has also expressed concern that PSD2 is \"not symmetrical,\" and told the Financial Times that the directive should be \"reviewed for the digital age.\"</p><p>David Birch, an independent expert on digital money and digital identity, sees data sharing as a two-way street.</p><p>\"I agree with the banks. It's not fair,\" he said in an email to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, noting that if Facebook can persuade people to give them access to their bank accounts, he sees no reason why a bank should not be able to ask customers for their Facebook data.</p><p>Singled out?</p><p>However, others argue that banks should continue to be subject to different rules when it comes to data sharing.</p><p>Banks are \"totally and utterly wrong\" if they believe they should have access to data held by Facebook Inc., Google LLC and Amazon.com Inc., said Louise Beaumont, executive chair of Signoi, an artificial intelligence and machine learning-focused startup, and co-chair of the Open Banking and Payments Working Group at industry body techUK.</p><p>\"The data does not belong to the banks. It belongs to the customer. Banks have held customer data for decades but they have done nothing with it, not for the customer's benefit, not even for their own benefit,\" she said in an interview. \"What does Mustier think he can do with all that data from Google anyway, given he's done nothing with the data he has got?\"</p><p>Given the huge amounts of data that banks hold on individuals, Beaumont said it is understandable that regulators have stepped in to address what is essentially a monopolistic hold over information.</p><p>Some banks will thrive and find new opportunities thanks to PSD2 and open banking, while others will struggle with competition from third parties, but they all need to adjust to what she describes as a new reality, she said.</p><p>Elina Mattila, executive director of tech industry body the Mobey Forum, added that the \"data-sharing stakes\" are higher for banks than other industries but that could spur banks into action to think differently about their products and services, she said in an email.</p><p>\"By their nature banks deal with sensitive, critical financial information which, understandably, they have wanted to keep under lock and key. Financial institutions operate under close scrutiny in a tightly regulated environment, which makes them naturally conservative and risk-averse.

(Nasdaq: CMCSA), AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Verizon Communications Corp. (NYSE: VZ).</p><p>Now, customers may have to pay extra to providers to see content or to access higher bandwidth speeds.</p><p>Meanwhile, patent trolling is a concern for businesses that file patents related to the work they do. For example, The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) and Universal Orlando Resort often file patents for new attractions at major theme parks - projects that provide work for metro Orlando firms.</p><p>Both of these actions can have a big local impact because there are more than 57,000 small businesses in metro Orlando that each employ up to 100 workers, according to research from American City Business Journals.</p><p>And Florida is home to more than 405,000 small businesses, or 98.9 percent of all employers, that employ more than 3 million people, the Small Business Development Center of Florida reported.</p><p>Here, Brown and Herbert share more about these trends and how local firms can protect themselves:</p><p>How can net neutrality hurt small businesses?</p><p>Brown: When a small firm is trying to market a product or service, having internet service providers throttle the speed of content can hurt them. However, it allows established players that can afford to pay for faster download speeds to edge out new, innovative companies that can't afford to pay for faster bandwidth.</p><p>What do you predict net neutrality will cause in the marketplace?</p><p>Brown: There probably will be a spike in litigation that may change the course of the law. Instead of being able to rely on the FCC, people will have to take action themselves. Companies will turn to the courts to protect themselves from unfair business practices.</p><p>What is patent trolling?</p><p>Brown: When you have a person or firm in the business of owning patents and suing companies for patent violations</p><p>Why are small companies a target for patent trolls?</p><p>Brown: Imagine you're a startup, you don't have a lot of revenue, you're just starting to get investments and now you have a lawsuit that could cost thousands of dollars a month to defend. You can't afford that. Many who file these claims are looking for a quick payout.</p><p>How does patent trolling hurt innovation?</p><p>Brown: It's a drag on innovation. Granting people patents is something that encourages innovation and allows them to be able to piggyback on ideas. Filing patent violation claims against small firms could cause those firms to shut down when being sued.</p><p>How many patent litigation cases have you seen in Central Florida?</p><p>Herbert: There is a firm here in Orlando that files a lot of these cases, and we are defending one right now. It has filed 10 in Orlando within the past few months.</p><p>How can companies protect themselves from this?\u00a0</p><p>Brown: An early-stage company should file a patent when it has an idea or design.</p><p>Herbert: Get the right insurance, too. Your lawyer can advise you on that.</p><p>\u00a08.1 million: People in Florida who have internet access</p><p>\u00a04.3 million: People who have access to only one internet service provider</p><p>\u00a03.8 million: People who have two options for internet service</p><p>\u00a0860,000: People who do not have internet service</p><p>Why this matters: The Federal Communication Commission canceled the net neutrality rule on Dec. 14, which means internet service providers can control broadband speed and content for their customers. Potentially, providers now can charge their customers, including businesses, an additional fee for faster service and unlimited access. And those additional costs may be too much for some businesses.</p><p>Source: Institute for Local Self-Reliance</p><p>Bitcoin buy-in</p><p>The popular cryptocurrency bitcoin is still hot on the market and will get even bigger this year, experts said.

Users have the right to opt out of consent immediately without losing their service. They have the \"right to be forgotten\" (or expunged from the internet), the right to transfer data to another organization, and the right to transparency regarding use of their data and by whom.</p><p>Europe has essentially shifted control over private data from the tech company harvesters and their advertisers to the users.</p><p>The new laws apply to any company with operations across the 28-member European Union, and if abrogated, can result in immense fines of 20 million euros or up to four per cent of their annual global revenues, whichever is greater. Some companies are blocking their websites from the region so they needn't comply, but multinationals are not.</p><p>France, for instance, was seriously attacked during its presidential election last year and it now has the power to shut down any website guilty of fake news, propaganda, or libelous attacks during elections. Germany, sensitive to ethnic or racial slurs, has the most draconian \"anti-hate\" law in the world and requires that any site transmitting such statements has hours to take it down or face millions of euros in fines.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress is clueless, as is Canada's parliament, as to how to address privacy and other Internet issues, too. But California has jumped the gun, with other states, by proposing laws similar to Europe's.</p><p>The new laws are onerous. Google has 90 per cent of the EU search market, and has been fined 2 billion euros already for anti-competitive behaviour. Already it has been bombarded with 650,000 requests by Europeans to delist data that they find offensive, libelous, or inaccurate about them. The courts have ruled that unless information is in the public interest, it can and should be removed.</p><p>Within days of the roll-out of GDPR, Facebook and Google were hit with US$8.8 billion in lawsuits( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/regulation/2018/facebook-google-gdpr-lawsuits-security-privacy/\">https://www.pymnts.com/news/regulation/2018/facebook-google-gdpr-lawsuits-security-privacy/</url> ) on the basis that their \"consent\" gives users an all or nothing choice, in violation of GDPR.

But in terms of how it might play out, we haven't a clue.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The case,   Cuozzo Speed Technologies v. Lee  , illustrates an important trend in American politics: Congress has a tendency to create extraordinarily ambiguous laws, leaving the courts and executive agencies to fill in the holes. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In the case, the tech firm  Cuozzo Speed Technologies Inc. argues that one of its patents, issued for a GPS system that notifies drivers when they are speeding, was unfairly canceled under a new review process at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, called \"inter partes review.\" A federal appeals court upheld the cancellation, but the decision was split 6-to-5. </p><p> The question in front of the Supreme Court is whether the Patent Office has been too harsh when reviewing patents, and whether it should use standards that more closely resemble what would be used in a trial court. Congress created the process of\u00a0inter partes review in 2011, designed to root out abuse in the patent system by making it easier to challenge patents and cancel those that should never have been issued. The problem is that legislators were remarkably unspecific in how it would be instituted. As Justice Elena Kagan said   during arguments last week  , noting that Congress never made clear what it intended to accomplish though inter partes review:\u00a0\"We're a little bit reading tea leaves, aren't we?\" </p><p> Unsurprisingly, the case hasn't received a lot of attention - it's not a very sexy topic. But there is a lot at stake:   Patents support   an estimated $5 trillion of the nation's gross domestic product and 40 million jobs. They're also the backbone of many innovative companies in the tech sector. </p><p> Historically, when inventors submit a creation to the government to be patented, the Patent Office reviews the technology very broadly to make sure it hasn't already been patented by someone else or that the innovation isn't too obvious to be called intellectual property. Theoretically, that review is enough to make finding a new, patentable idea difficult. </p><p> Once patents are issued, however, they won't face the same harsh scrutiny in courts. During patent litigation, judges generally focus only on the plain meaning of a patent's text without questioning its validity  -  meant to protect intellectual property. </p><p> That's great for inventors, but strong legal protections also create an adverse incentive for patent-holding companies to threaten others with lawsuits in the hope of squeezing out lucrative settlements. In fact, there exists an entire industry of shell companies - often referred to as \"patent trolls\" - whose sole function is to collect patents and   sue other companies with them  . </p><p>Congress attempted to fight off the emerging troll industry by passing the   America Invents Act  , which set up the inter partes review process, to allow people to\u00a0bypass courts and contest silly patents directly through the Patent Office. The idea was to make lawsuits quicker and less costly than traditional trials. </p><p> The problem: Congress never told the agency how it was supposed to review contested patents, so the Patent Office decided to use the same broad standards that it has always used to review applications, not the textual\u00a0standards of the federal courts. This stacked the patent review process against patent-holders, the opposite of what would happen in a court trial. Over the past few years, inter partes review has canceled hundreds of patents, shooting down   more than 80 percent of the existing patents subject to review   in cases that weren't settled. </p><p> Critics of inter partes review - mostly pharmaceutical and software start-up companies that rely heavily on their intellectual property to do business - have   taken to calling the board   governing the review the \"Patent Death Squad.\" They argue that the new system has upended intellectual property rights and stymied innovation in the United States. </p><p> Their opponents - generally bigger tech companies like Google and Apple (the common targets of patent litigation) - defend the Patent Office. For them, the new review process is doing what it was designed to do: weeding out bogus patent claims and offering a more efficient alternative years-long court battles. </p><p> The Supreme Court is now pitted between these two sets of industries and must decide what standards inter partes review should use. Should it act as an extension of the Patent Office's application process, striking down most of the patents with a tough standard? Or should it act as a fast-track replacement for the court system, with a lower standard? </p><p> But beyond the angry rhetoric from the intellectual property crowd rests a frustration with the legislative process that caused the problem in the first place. Many legal commentators   have criticized   Congress for leaving the tough decision up to the courts. How could lawmakers pass patent reform without spelling out how to, well, reform the patent system? Chief Justice John Roberts seemed especially irked by the situation during arguments last week, criticizing the lack of clarity on standards as \"bizarre.\" </p><p> Still, the situation shouldn't be too surprising. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were under a lot of pressure to act in 2011 - including   from the president  , who has long been a proponent of tough patent reform. At the same time, though, the tech industry was - and continues to be - bitterly divided on what that reform should look like. Remember: The issue is driven mostly by corporate lawyers whose companies have huge stakes in how the government will manage intellectual property. </p><p> As a result, reform is situated between two hornet nests - with big pharmaceuticals on one side and big tech firms such as Google on the other. Health care, legal rights, business development, jobs and innovation are all major players\u00a0in the intricate patent system, and that translates to a swarm\u00a0of angry lobbyists and constituents calling congressional offices. </p><p> In Theory  published a symposium   on patent reform in November, and the big takeaway was that deciding on a new direction remains extremely divisive. The fact that Congress punted on the hard questions with ambiguous language shouldn't come as a shock, especially in an already strained political climate. </p><p> Yet Congress has been doing this for decades. It has passed a number of \u00a0extraordinarily vague laws - from the Civil Rights Act to the Americans With Disabilities Act - and for better or worse, lawmaking has increasingly fallen under the purview of executive action and judicial review. While the president attempts to\u00a0  make policy without the help of Congress   by finding wiggle room in already existing laws, the Supreme Court   has pushed for greater regulation   of greenhouse gases by reinterpreting the Clean Air Act to include carbon dioxide. </p><p> The   Cuozzo   case may be a siloed topic, but it illustrates a lot about American politics. We can criticize our legislative process for relying too much on litigation to develop policy, but there's a reason it looks the way it does. Lawmakers increasingly see the judicial branch as another policymaking tool, especially when they want to shove the tough questions off to someone else. </p><p>              Read more:           </p><p> Abraham Lincoln loved\u00a0our patent system. Let's not tear it down. </p><p> Patent infringement is theft, plain and simple </p><p> A third of the economy is at stake - and trolls are to blame </p><p> Don't let hedge funds undermine public health </p><p> Patents are supposed to encourage innovation. Without reform, they'll do the opposite. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-417753e1977341a4b817281715c612d8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JNT-CVB1-JB4M-V3VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1277\"/><timeReceived>7:16 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 2, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Complaints</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjE5NkU3QTg0MjkzNEE2QUIxMkQ0Qjk2N0JGREFDNUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVEMjA3RkFDQTBGNDA5Njg2MjA2QjZBQjlBMjUxQTg</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEZDMkM1RDhDMkI2NDU1RUEyQUY0OEE2QkE2RjQ2NUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODU3Q0NBNUNGRjIzNDcyQ0FDMkY1M0I4NUZENjE0MDY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001301</classCode><className>PATENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp;

Political figures across the ideological spectrum, from Elizabeth Warren to Stephen K. Bannon, have criticized the power players of Silicon Valley for threatening free competition and other American values. Meanwhile, over the past several months the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, which commits the United States to monitoring civil liberties in the semiautonomous Chinese city, sailed through a bitterly divided Congress and was signed into law by President Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the surface these two issues have little in common other than being rare displays of bipartisanship. But, in fact, they reveal a genuine consensus that lawmakers must act to preserve information freedom in an age of renascent monopoly capitalism and digitally abetted authoritarianism.</p><p>The tech industry also recognizes these issues as related, but disagrees on the solution. Mark Zuckerberg and others have argued that greater regulation at home - whether regarding cryptocurrencies or the content of deceptive political advertisements - would undermine the free-speech ideals of the United States. In this view, domestic regulation would undermine U.S. foreign policy goals, including its support of civil liberties in places like Hong Kong. This reasoning echoes that employed by American corporations during the Cold War, when U.S.-Soviet tensions gave them a convenient means of opposing regulation: by treating it as an un-American form of government control.</p><p>But for policymakers inclined to take Big Tech's antiregulatory bromides with a grain of salt, the history of Cold War information policy reveals that regulation did happen, even in that climate, including provisions that demonstrated how regulation might enhance rather than threaten individual freedoms.</p><p>Information has long played a part in foreign-policy debates - with the U.S. government typically opposing foreign interventions in the media business. In the austere decade after World War II, Washington rejected European proposals to regulate the market in scarce press materials like newsprint, painting the multilateral redistribution of these commodities as a threat to capitalism. Later, in the 1970s and early 1980s, Americans framed international support for the regulation of satellite transmissions as part of a Soviet-Third World attack on the free flow of information.</p><p>When foreign laws threatened their access to foreign markets, American cold warriors were quick to deride them in the ideological terms of freedom versus statism - just as Zuckerberg has done in the wake of his unsuccessful efforts to court the Chinese market.</p><p>During the Cold War, the case for press and media regulation and government intervention was often an easier sell abroad than at home. The French legal scholar Fernand Terrou argued in the early 1950s that the public interest might best be served by limited forms of government engagement in the media. For instance, severe newsprint shortages roiled Europe in the postwar years, causing many newspapers to shutter. Terrou contended that the solutions adopted by the French government - notably newsprint subsidies - did not mean it had abandoned the principle of press freedom. Rather, the regulations helped the French press remain viable in a time of economic turmoil.</p><p>And despite efforts to paint such legislation as a dangerous imposition, information was regulated in the Cold War United States, too. In the field of broadcasting, the Fairness Doctrine - instituted in 1949, at the nadir of U.S.-Soviet hostilities - gave the Federal Communications Commission a mandate to ensure the balanced presentation of political issues on radio and television. The federal government also pursued anti-monopoly action in the film and telecommunications industries and subsidies for public-interest media through the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.</p><p>In short, regulation has never been a bipolar issue of capitalism and democracy versus totalitarianism and state control. In 1951, Terrou, seeking to inject nuance into the Cold War dichotomy of free enterprise versus communism, pointed out that when one took a global perspective there was \"great variety\" in how broadcasting was regulated and \"shades of meaning\" in the jurisprudence around freedom of expression. This nuance was motivated by a sense that regulation could be in the public interest, and could enhance freedoms, as well as constricting them.</p><p>Likewise, present-day discussions of the regulation of social media in many countries - including the United States - are animated not by the desire to stifle freedom, but by a common concern for public goods including individual privacy and secure elections. There is a sense that regulation of social media is actually necessary to preserve freedom. After all, if these platforms are left unregulated, they will continue to be weaponized for illiberal ends, as Facebook was by the Russian government in the 2016 U.S. election or by Myanmar's military in the recent ethnic cleansing of the country's predominantly Muslim Rohingya population. These challenges are shared by liberal democracies around the world and suggest the value of dialogue around information issues, if not completely identical solutions.</p><p>Failing to engage in such dialogue may prove costly in the long run. Already, the United States has lost a step when it comes to defining the rules of the road on the use of personal data: E.U. privacy regulations have shaped similar legislation in countries as far off as South Africa and Japan, despite vigorous lobbying by Silicon Valley. Indeed, not only does the refusal to regulate social media actually threaten freedom at home, it may isolate us from our allies, in addition to obscuring potential approaches to our own information conundrums. Abroad as well as at home, what's good for Facebook may not be what's good for America.</p><p>Many tech leaders and China hawks today endorse the view that Washington is in a new cold war with Beijing. Whether this is a wise framework for contemporary Sino-U. S. relations, we should be leery of a return to the old Cold War playbook, by which American corporations battled domestic regulation in the name of free enterprise, and the United States government adopted this position in its foreign policy, opposing regulation abroad.</p><p>Washington should support the universal protection of information freedom and other civil liberties, at home as well as in Hong Kong and elsewhere. But policymakers should also remember how the U.S. used regulation to advance the public good during the Cold War, despite corporate resistance. The tech leadership of the future may entail greater dialogue and coordination across borders than is presently the case. The United States needs allies if it wishes to retain this leadership.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-8ad32ed026ed4d9a9e411e7b8f7196ca</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXC-28V1-DXKP-J3VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1156\"/><timeReceived>11:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 5, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009J49</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS &amp;
