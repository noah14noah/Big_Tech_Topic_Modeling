Play Video[1]USA - -(AmmoLand.com[2])- Thank you, Mr. President. Very cool. But wild tweets are nice. We need action. </p><p>A handful of giant corporations have seized control of the new public square and are digitally disappearing dissidents. The first rule of Facebook is don't talk about anyone who Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like. Otherwise, you'll be banned by Facebook. This isn't a joke. It's literally their new policy. They're not just banning people they're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have. Merely appearing in a photo or a video with someone who Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like is now enough to get you banned. This is virtually identical to the communist Chinese social credit score system. But instead, it's controlled by giant corporations with more power than some countries accept at least in China it's written down, so you know how to stay in compliance. Tucker Carlson reports 'How dangerous is Infowars. Well Facebook believes it's so dangerous that you can be banned from using the platform. Facebook just for sharing its content unless you simultaneously denounce it. But let that penetrate for just one moment think about it just for a second. Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions he's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have. Which conversations all of us in this country can have about America. Keep in mind that nobody voted for Mark Zuckerberg. He's 34 years old. He's completely cut off from reality. He's worth 72 billion dollars and yet he can single-handedly make our First Amendment irrelevant after 250 years.' I mean how tragic is it that Snoop Dogg who encouraged his 32 million followers to float Facebook and Instagram with Lewis Farrakhan videos has a better grasp of the principle of freedom of speech than 90 percent of journalists. The same journalists who whine about Trump targeting the media then pop champagne corks when anyone on the right gets silence. This has nothing to do with hate. Whatever that means. This is about you beginning to lose the argument culturally and politically. So instead of trying to engage on a level playing field and I don't know actually doing some work you merely silence the dissent. This is classic authoritarianism. 'I want them shut down I want them silenced I want them muted' screeched Ana Navarro recently on ABC's the View. I want them to shut down; I want them silenced. This is the rhetoric of authoritarian tyrants, yet we are the dangerous ones. Really. This isn't a private company and enforcing it's arbitrary and ever-changing rules. Virtually every prominent online personality who helped get Trump elected has now been banned on some or all social media platforms. Do you think that's a coincidence or is it a political purge? Oh and isn't it great how Facebook has banned all these dangerous extremists while still leaving people free to surf Hamas and Hezbollah pages. Facebook is the establishment and knows popular dissent is keeping establishment candidates out of office. 2016 was the turning point and showed that an anti-establishment figure like Trump could win. So they are silencing populist voices ahead of the 2020 [election]. Here's what needs to happen. Platform access should be a civil right for all citizens in all countries.Digital Bill Of Rights Digital Bill Of RightsWe need a digital bill of rights. Social media is the digital public square. The only circumstance for banning someone from the digital public square should be if they abuse that public square to post something criminal or an immediate incitement to violence. In coordination with this Facebook and every other big tech firm which fails to live up to this new standard should have its legal immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Act stripped. Facebook no longer acts as a platform. It acts as a publisher. If Facebook wants to be a publisher, it can be a publisher. Which would mean that Facebook would be personally and legally liable for everything posted on their website. Facebook is clearly putting themselves on one side of the political debate. They're entitled to do that as a private company, but if they do want to do that, then they need to be regulated as a political actor. If you ban a bunch of people for partisan reasons in the midst of a presidential campaign season that is election meddling. I'm sorry I forgot. We're only supposed to care about election meddling when a few Russians buy some Facebook ads. And please just shut up with the 'no a private company can do what it likes' crap. When people start losing their bank accounts and credit cards because they had the wrong political opinions, which is already happening when people cannot buy and sell because they have the wrong political opinions. Sorry. Your Amazon smart refrigerator has denied you access to your groceries due to you visiting Infowars.com. When people are homeless and destitute because they can't get mortgages and they can't get loans because they have the wrong political opinions are you still going to gleefully repeat the mantra more private company. How about medical care. That's a private practice. Should we deny people medical care because they have the wrong political opinions. It was wrong for black people to be denied services by businesses and it's wrong for everyone to be denied service by social media companies under the law. Businesses don't have the right to discriminate against people's political views. They don't have the right to deny service. As the ACLU points out once the business decides to advertise its services to the public at large, it gives up the prerogative to pick and choose which customers to serve. Even when that commercial service involves some form of speech or expression, that's already the law. So why is it not being applied to Silicon Valley giants? As Wilt Chamberlain writes. 'When private companies violate civil rights we pass laws to stop them from doing so.' So while the tweets are nice and the support has been incredible, we need action. And it really does seem like this is our last chance It's absolutely crucial for us to stay in touch.

Going digital, getting rid of branches, becoming cashless seem to be the main themes, and yet this ignores that every part of the world is different. It's hard to go digital if the country has little infrastructure; it doesn't make sense to get rid of branches if people like them and the country is under-served financially; and it doesn't make sense to go cashless, if the culture is a cash-based culture. </p><p>There are no homogenies here. Everywhere is different. For example, digital finance is rising fast in all economies but fastest in those historically suffering financial exclusion. The annual Findex data set[1]from the World Bank shows over 500 million more adults have a financial account in 2017 compared with 2014. India was a star performer in 2017 where 80% of the country's population now has a financial institution account, jumping from 53% in 2014. Sub-Saharan Africa also continues to make remarkable progress, with ten countries reaching at least 50% access and four reaching beyond 65%. Colombia has 256 bank branches[2] per 100,000 people on average, compared to 32 per 100,000 in the USA and only 1 bank branch per 200,000 in the Ukraine. Whatever you read, you probably are aware that China, India and Asia is moving to cashlessness[3] far faster than America and Europe. So, there is no homogeneity. Nevertheless, I find it interesting that we are now dealing with global finance on global platforms like Apple and Alibaba. Sure, these platforms may have bias towards consumers in the East and West, but their rise to global status is notable. Amazon is one of the two dominant online retailers in India[4]; and India, Brazil and Indonesia are the largest markets for Facebook[5], along with the USA of course. The reason I write this is that there are two big forces battling away behind the scenes of FinTech: globalisation and localisation. By way of example, I was asked the other day where I see FinTech start-ups like Bunq, N26 and Monzo going next. My answer was that they must first prove themselves in Europe. It is likely that they may then look to American ambitions, but America is tough when you have to deal with 50 state regulators with 50 different agendas. It may be easy to look towards Asia, but China and India are already well served by Alipay, WeChat Pay, PayTM, Amazon Pay and Google Pay[6]. My recommendation is that there's still no dominant European FinTech financial firm, and so Monzo, Revolut, N26 and Bunq should focus there first, even though Monzo is already working on a US launch[7] as are N26[8]. Long-term, bearing in mind that all of these firms will need to deal with localisation requirements, I do believe there will be global FinTech and financial platforms. The announcement of Apple Card[9] and work of the Big Tech giants are driving towards this, as are the works of the FinTech unicorns and the big banks (don't forget them!). The main issue in achieving such ambitions is language, culture, engagement and experience. Watch this space.

There were some interesting reflections in that dialogue, however. I guess it falls into three categories: the way regulations used to be; the way they are; the way they should be. </p><p>Regulations used to be all about stability and resilience, compliance and audit. For most banks, regulations are a huge overhead of work. That work is done to keep the licence to trade. Like a licence to kill, the banking licence is the key to operations. On the one hand, it is a huge overhead; on the other hand, it acts as a huge protection. The banking licence is hard to get, difficult to keep and death if lost. It is the key. It acts as the biggest barrier to new competition, because hardly anyone can get a banking licence that easily. As a start-up, it used to be that you would need a minimum $30 million just to get a licence, let alone start operations. Typically, you'd need $100 million to launch a bank, and that would just cover the first year. The regulatory structure is a massive barrier to entry and that's why banks exist in their own world, with little new competition and stable operations measured by market share. Who needs to innovate? Nothing changes. The way regulations are now is different. Today's regulations are designed to stimulate innovation and new competition. This is why fintech startups are doing well, because the regulators have changed. The regulators are offering fast-track licences to market based upon light regulation for lighter products. Rather than launching a full banking service with a full banking licence, you can launch a prepaid card, a prepaid wallet or a payments service with just an emoney licence. Then, as traction grows, brand gains recognition, customers join and trust increases, you then apply for the full bank licence. By that time, you have the $30 million in capital needed and the vision to succeed. You have success and some customers. You can grow and offer richer services and more capabilities. This is why Monzo, Revolut and Zopa have moved from narrow offers towards more full banking. New competition has arrived, and banks need to wake up to this, albeit slowly. Because banks are still protected by regulations with their full banking licences and, by the time these new guys widen their products and services to recognise full-service banking, banks have adapted to survive. The way regulation will be needs to change again however, according to the bankers. Regulators regulate what they can see. They often regulate based upon past performance, past experiences, past activities and past events. They cannot regulate for what they cannot see which are future performance, future experiences, future activities and future events. Hence, they often get it wrong. In particular what they are getting wrong today is regulating by state, by country and by region. The world has moved from a physical structure with localised activity to a globalised structure with networked activity, and the Big Tech giants are exploiting this. The global internet giants act globally and have no global regulations. This means they get away with a lot more than banks do, who grew up locally with local regulations. What is needed today is global financial markets regulations set by the G20 or similar, and managed on a global basis. A standard across all markets like Basel IV but widened into all aspects of bank and financial activity. I agreed with the first two points, but the last is too difficult. A global regulator? A global standard across all financial markets? I doubt that would happen. However, on the converse, a global standard across all internet giants to adhere to? That makes more sense. The internet giants are currently very lightly regulated compared to banks. They deal with far less regulatory overhead than almost every other industry in fact. The move towards regulating the internet giants is starting, bearing in mind that many of these giants are less than a quarter century old. Give it another quarter century and a global internet regulatory structure may be something the G20 and their brethren could implement. It will be interesting to watch. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-FSCB1079981554363356603251766500070</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCB-6705</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT9-14M1-F03R-N00J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><timeReceived>7:35 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Finanser by Chris Skinner</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 4, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Regulation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Future</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Grid</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Digital Bank</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001211</classCode><className>NEW PRODUCTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOQM</classCode><className>DIGITAL ONLY BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001211</classCode><className>NEW PRODUCTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001080</classCode><className>MARKET SHARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000959L</classCode><className>PREPAID CARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

A new coalition and a report unveiled Tuesday make clear that era is over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The coalition, Athena, comprises three dozen grassroots groups involved in issues like digital surveillance, antitrust and working conditions in warehouses. The goal is to encourage and unify the resistance to Amazon that is beginning to form.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report, from the Economic Roundtable, a non-profit that focuses on social and economic issues in Southern California, delves into the topic of what Amazon is costing the communities where it has warehouses. The short answer: a lot.</p><p>While the simultaneous arrival of Athena and the report are a coincidence, they are linked by their attempts to understand and ultimately influence Amazon's push into almost every aspect of modern life. The internet conglomerate hired 97,000 employees over the summer, nearly the total employment of Google. The report is bluntly titled \"Too Big to Govern.\"</p><p>\"This is a company functioning at a scale that was previously left to government,\" said Tom Perriello of the Open Society Foundations. Founded by billionaire George Soros, Open Society is providing some of the seed funding for Athena. The coalition is raising $15 million to cover its first three years.</p><p>Amazon, like Facebook, Apple and Google, has drawn the attention of Washington regulators, state attorneys general and at least a few politicians. The central question being asked about all of the companies: when does a tech platform become too big and powerful, ultimately hurting the society it once dazzled?</p><p>In Amazon's case, the situation is complicated. Its aspirations long ago exceeded online retail to encompass fresh groceries, devices that connect your home to the internet, front-door and neighbourhood surveillance, professional services like plumbing and contracting, health care, government procurement, internet infrastructure and Hollywood entertainment.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Last fall, the retailer was forced to begin paying a $15 (U.S.) hourly minimum wage across the country. In February, it abandoned plans to establish a new headquarters in New York after opponents mobilized against Amazon and the politicians who had approved the deal. This month, an attempt to stack the city council in Seattle, the company's hometown, with members more acceptable to Amazon backfired with voters.</p><p>These setbacks could be attributed to many factors, but one of them was the influence of labour and immigrant organizations. Now some of those groups are joining together under Athena.</p><p>\"We're learning from what makes Amazon back down, and looking to replicate that as much as possible with as many people as possible,\" said Dania Rajendra, the Athena director.</p><p>Athena will be run from New York, but the real work will be done out in the field where most of the member organizations are. They include the Awood Center, a Minneapolis non-profit that has organized Amazon workers from East Africa; Warehouse Workers for Justice, which is based in Chicago; and Fight for the Future, a group that focuses on digital issues, in Massachusetts.</p><p>In a separate move on Monday, Fight for the Future and other groups called on Congress to investigate Amazon's surveillance products, including the Ring front-door monitor and Rekognition facial tracking software. The products threaten \"our privacy and civil liberties, especially in brown and Black communities,\" the groups said.</p><p>The effort against Amazon will not be easy, said Lauren Jacobs of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition member in Oakland. Amazon is projected to have $238 billion in sales this year with 750,000 employees.</p><p>\"This is a David and Goliath story,\" she said. \"David took what he had and turned it into a winning strategy. We're taking what we have - the voices of the members of our various organizations, our collective knowledge and experience and deep understanding of the economy around Big Tech, and the experience we've had with making this company shift its behaviour - and trying to build a more humane economy.\"</p><p>Athena's $15-million budget is modest for the scale of change.</p><p>\"This is grassroots democracy,\" said Barry Lynn of Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank and coalition member focused on antitrust issues. \"There's no money in it. Just people.\"</p><p>The name Athena is associated with democracy, freedom and wisdom. But it has another advantage for the coalition.</p><p>\"We didn't want to have Amazon in the name - People Against Amazon or whatever - because part of the strategy is to offer a better vision for how the economy could work,\" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a non-profit in Maine that opposes corporate concentration and advocates local community development.</p><p>Amazon workers and Amazon customers exist in two different worlds, the Economic Roundtable said. The report calculates that a little more than half of Amazon warehouse workers in Southern California live in substandard housing. And for every $1 in wages, they receive 24 cents in public assistance.</p><p>Among the report's suggestions: that Amazon raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour, that it require its logistics subcontractors to do the same, that it provide child care at its warehouses and that it build affordable housing in its logistics communities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2019113056487400</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMF-RR61-F103-30R0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

A new coalition and a report unveiled Tuesday make clear that era is over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The coalition, Athena, comprises three dozen grassroots groups involved in issues like digital surveillance, antitrust and working conditions in warehouses. The goal is to encourage and unify the resistance to Amazon that is beginning to form.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report, from the Economic Roundtable, a non-profit research group that focuses on social and economic issues in Southern California, delves into the largely unexplored topic of what Amazon is costing the communities where it has warehouses. The short answer: a lot.</p><p>While the simultaneous arrival of Athena and the report are a coincidence, they are linked by their attempts to understand and ultimately influence Amazon's push into almost every aspect of modern life. The internet conglomerate hired 97,000 employees over the summer, nearly the total employment of Google. The report is bluntly titled \"Too Big to Govern.\"</p><p>\"This is a company functioning at a scale that was previously left to government,\" said Tom Perriello of the Open Society Foundations. Founded by billionaire George Soros, Open Society is providing some of the seed funding for Athena. The coalition is raising $15 million to cover its first three years.</p><p>\"It has incredible impact,\" Perriello said of Amazon. \"Who could possibly shape its future and direction?\"</p><p>Amazon, like Facebook, Apple and Google, has drawn the attention of Washington regulators, state attorneys general and at least a few politicians in the past year. The central question being asked about all of the companies: when does a tech platform become too big and powerful, ultimately hurting the society it once dazzled?</p><p>In Amazon's case, the situation is particularly complicated. Its aspirations long ago exceeded online retail to encompass fresh groceries, devices that connect your home to the internet, front-door and neighbourhood surveillance, professional services like plumbing and contracting, health care, government procurement, internet infrastructure and Hollywood entertainment. Just about everything, really.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this article. Athena springs out of several unexpectedly successful grassroots efforts to rein in Amazon's power.</p><p>Last fall, the retailer was forced to begin paying a $15 (U.S.) hourly minimum wage across the country. In February, it abandoned plans to establish a new headquarters in New York after opponents mobilized against Amazon and the politicians who had approved the deal. This month, an attempt to stack the city council in Seattle, the company's hometown, with members more acceptable to Amazon backfired with voters.</p><p>These setbacks could be attributed to many factors, but one of them was the influence of labour and immigrant organizations. Now some of those groups are joining together under Athena.</p><p>\"We're learning from what makes Amazon back down, and looking to replicate that as much as possible with as many people as possible,\" said Dania Rajendra, the Athena director.</p><p>Athena will be run from New York, but the real work will be done out in the field where most of the member organizations are. They include the Awood Center, a Minneapolis non-profit that has organized Amazon workers from East Africa; Warehouse Workers for Justice, which is based in Chicago; and Fight for the Future, a group that focuses on digital issues, in Massachusetts.</p><p>In a separate move on Monday, Fight for the Future and other groups called on Congress to investigate Amazon's surveillance products, including the Ring front-door monitor and Rekognition facial tracking software. The products threaten \"our privacy and civil liberties, especially in brown and Black communities,\" the groups said.</p><p>The effort against Amazon will not be easy, said Lauren Jacobs of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition member in Oakland. Amazon is projected to have $238 billion in sales this year with 750,000 employees.</p><p>\"This is a David and Goliath story,\" she said. \"David took what he had and turned it into a winning strategy. We're taking what we have - the voices of the members of our various organizations, our collective knowledge and experience and deep understanding of the economy around Big Tech, and the experience we've had with making this company shift its behaviour - and trying to build a more humane economy.\"</p><p>Athena's $15-million budget is modest.</p><p>\"This is grassroots democracy,\" said Barry Lynn of Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank and coalition member focused on antitrust issues. \"There's no money in it. Just people.\"</p><p>The name Athena is associated with democracy, freedom and wisdom. But it has another advantage for the coalition.</p><p>\"We didn't want to have Amazon in the name - People Against Amazon or whatever - because part of the strategy is to offer a better vision for how the economy could work,\" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a non-profit in Maine that opposes corporate concentration and advocates local community development.</p><p>Amazon workers and Amazon customers exist in two different worlds, the Economic Roundtable said. The report calculates that a little more than half of Amazon warehouse workers in Southern California live in substandard housing. And for every $1 in wages, they receive 24 cents in public assistance.</p><p>\"Every day, ships, trucks, trains and airplanes bring an estimated 21,500 diesel truckloads of merchandise to 21 Amazon warehouses in the four-county region,\" the Economic Roundtable report said. It calculated that Amazon trucks last year created $642 million in \"uncompensated public costs\" for noise, road wear, accidents and harmful emissions. Among the report's suggestions: that Amazon raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour, that it require its logistics subcontractors to do the same, that it provide child care at its warehouses and that it build affordable housing in its logistics communities.</p><p>The report draws on California Public Records Act requests filed with communities with Amazon facilities. Many of them nevertheless came up empty. The report noted that very little of Amazon's business was known to anyone but Amazon. Communities are in the dark.</p><p>\"Our conclusion is that it's time for Amazon to come of age and pay its own way,\" said Daniel Flaming, a co-author of the report. \"This means paying its full costs to the communities that host it and the workers who create its profits.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019113056488139</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMF-NS31-JBTY-W3SM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 30, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The goal is to encourage and unify the resistance to Amazon that is beginning to form.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report, from the Economic Roundtable, a non-profit research group that focuses on social and economic issues in Southern California, delves into the largely unexplored topic of what Amazon is costing the communities where it has warehouses. The short answer: a lot.</p><p>While the simultaneous arrival of Athena and the report are a coincidence, they are linked by their attempts to understand and ultimately influence Amazon's push into almost every aspect of modern life. The internet conglomerate hired 97,000 employees over the summer, nearly the total employment of Google. The report is bluntly titled \"Too Big to Govern.\"</p><p>\"This is a company functioning at a scale that was previously left to government,\" said Tom Perriello of the Open Society Foundations. Founded by billionaire George Soros, Open Society is providing some of the seed funding for Athena. The coalition is raising $15 million to cover its first three years.</p><p>Amazon, like Facebook, Apple and Google, has drawn the attention of Washington regulators, state attorneys general and at least a few politicians in the past year. The central question being asked about all of the companies: when does a tech platform become too big and powerful, ultimately hurting the society it once dazzled?</p><p>In Amazon's case, the situation is particularly complicated. Its aspirations long ago exceeded online retail to encompass fresh groceries, devices that connect your home to the internet, front-door and neighbourhood surveillance, professional services like plumbing and contracting, health care, government procurement, internet infrastructure and Hollywood entertainment.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this article. Athena springs out of several unexpectedly successful grassroots efforts to rein in Amazon's power.</p><p>Last fall, the retailer was forced to begin paying a $15 (U.S.) hourly minimum wage across the country. In February, it abandoned plans to establish a new headquarters in New York after opponents mobilized against Amazon and the politicians who had approved the deal. This month, an attempt to stack the city council in Seattle, the company's hometown, with members more acceptable to Amazon backfired with voters.</p><p>These setbacks could be attributed to many factors, but one of them was the influence of labour and immigrant organizations. Now some of those groups are joining together under Athena.</p><p>\"We're learning from what makes Amazon back down, and looking to replicate that as much as possible with as many people as possible,\" said Dania Rajendra, the Athena director.</p><p>Athena will be run from New York, but the real work will be done out in the field where most of the member organizations are. They include the Awood Center, a Minneapolis non-profit that has organized Amazon workers from East Africa; Warehouse Workers for Justice, which is based in Chicago; and Fight for the Future, a group that focuses on digital issues, in Massachusetts.</p><p>In a separate move on Monday, Fight for the Future and other groups called on Congress to investigate Amazon's surveillance products, including the Ring front-door monitor and Rekognition facial tracking software. The products threaten \"our privacy and civil liberties, especially in brown and Black communities,\" the groups said.</p><p>The effort against Amazon will not be easy, said Lauren Jacobs of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition member in Oakland. Amazon is projected to have $238 billion in sales this year with 750,000 employees.</p><p>\"This is a David and Goliath story,\" she said. \"David took what he had and turned it into a winning strategy. We're taking what we have - the voices of the members of our various organizations, our collective knowledge and experience and deep understanding of the economy around Big Tech, and the experience we've had with making this company shift its behaviour - and trying to build a more humane economy.\"</p><p>Athena's $15-million budget is modest.</p><p>\"This is grassroots democracy,\" said Barry Lynn of Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank and coalition member focused on antitrust issues. \"There's no money in it. Just people.\"</p><p>The name Athena is associated with democracy, freedom and wisdom. But it has another advantage for the coalition.</p><p>\"We didn't want to have Amazon in the name - People Against Amazon or whatever - because part of the strategy is to offer a better vision for how the economy could work,\" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a non-profit in Maine that opposes corporate concentration and advocates local community development.</p><p>Amazon workers and Amazon customers exist in two different worlds, the Economic Roundtable said. The report calculates that a little more than half of Amazon warehouse workers in Southern California live in substandard housing. And for every $1 in wages, they receive 24 cents in public assistance.</p><p>Among the report's suggestions: that Amazon raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour, require its logistics subcontractors to do the same, provide child care at its warehouses and build affordable housing in its logistics communities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2019113056487640</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMF-RR61-F103-30MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"913\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Faced with widespread community outrage, the government has been forced to take action and the overall tone of the meeting is likely to be terse. But whether another robust conversation will convince the tech giants to become more responsible remains to be seen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regulatory overreach isn't on the government's agenda but one message should ring loud and clear - the status quo on how the tech giants self-regulate platforms will no longer be tolerated. So a big part of the conversation is likely to revolve around what extra measures the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter will be willing to undertake to police their platforms more effectively.</p><p>Self-regulation has been the mantra for technology businesses but that hangs in the balance in the current environment, especially as the public starts to question their motives.</p><p>The alternative - and this is something the government will have to think about carefully - is a direct intervention. Shutting down Facebook and Twitter is a nuclear option no government will be looking to exercise, but the current public sentiment will embolden regulators to raise the bar on accountability.</p><p>Accountability is a subject that technology companies tend not to consider too deeply; there's always a boilerplate espousing worthwhile values but they are seldom translated in real life. While the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica controversy has shed light on how valuable user data is for the tech companies, the Christchurch attack highlights that our attention is just as valuable as our personal information and tech companies have been reluctant to rock the boat.</p><p>This benign neglect of the -hijacking of platforms by trolls, fomenting lies and hatred, highlights that while tech companies are ever ready to maintain community standards, they don't want a mass exodus of users.</p><p>And this is just the well-established players like Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter because regulating hate speech on the internet means governments will have to find a way to shut down loathsome messaging boards like 8Chan and 4Chan.</p><p>Livestreaming, a disconcerting feature of the Christchurch attack, poses an even knottier question. How do you police a service whose entire pitch is giving users unfettered capability to distribute content live?</p><p>One potential solution could be to put delays on the streams, another is to invest in more targeted moderation, but every measure taken to contain the service compromises it and diminishes its value to users. That boils down to a loss of users, a loss of revenue for the companies and, in the long run, demands that everyday consumers miss out on some of the purported joys of digital connectivity.

The article questioned whether sites like Googlethat use advertising models have the correct strategy and whether internet companies like China\u2019s Tencent, which derive revenue from transactions, might be in better position for growth, given today\u2019s online user habits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Googlewas a huge U.S. antitrust case that never happened. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission staff produced a 160-page critique of the company\u2019s competitive practices, along with a recommendation to proceed with antitrust action. However, the commissioners declined to prosecute and used the report to pressure the company for changes in certain business practices.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The European Union, for its part, has not given up, and is pushing its case against the company on a number of fronts.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing on AT&amp;T and Time Warner came in response to concerns about industry consolidation in broadband and home entertainment. To <person><nameText>Sen. Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person>D-Vt., the merger is anti-consumer and should be blocked. President-elect Donald Trump also criticized the merger while on the campaign trail this fall, although more recently, his transition team said the deal would be reviewed \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> If cooler heads prevail on AT&amp;T-Time Warner, as they did with Google, maybe we can hope that policymakers have at last accepted the reality that, in technology, no one stays on top forever \u2013 or even for very long.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The crux of the Googlecomplaint wasn\u2019t so much its status as the de facto search site. It was whether Googlecould leverage its search dominance to the point that no other web-based ad delivery platform could be viable. The fact that more consumers now use Amazon for product searches\u2014the searches easiest to monetize\u2014completely upends this premise.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The antitrust rumblings about Google, of course, were just the most recent in a long history of government attacks on big tech platforms that were feared as unstoppable, but ultimately proved ephemeral. The Department of Justice spent 11 years prosecuting IBM for monopolizing the computer market. The suit lasted not only through the rise of distributed computing and data networking (think Digital Equipment Corp.and Hewlett-Packard) and into the early days of personal computers. Only then did the U.S. government decide that IBM, a maker of stand-alone million-dollar mainframes, did not illegally control the computer market after all.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Later came Microsoft, which was sued because the government (don\u2019t laugh, kids) thought that its bundling of a browser with an operating system would give the company complete control of the internet. Then there was the FTC\u2019s decision to halt Blockbuster Video\u2019s merger with Hollywood Video because, if permitted, Blockbuster would end up dominating home video distribution and rental for decades (stop laughing, I mean it!). Finally, there was the fuss over the Sirius-XM satellite radio merger. The Justice Department dragged its feet for more than a year over fears that the combination would close off all future consumer options for streaming music and audio entertainment. (Cut it out, already! Don\u2019t make me come over there!).<br/><br/><br/><br/> Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed the same basic thoughts on AT&amp;T and Time Warner at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R, Iowa, raised \u201cconcern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate [and] concern about the merger\u2019s implications for a free and diverse press.\u201d Yet cable TV giant Comcast has owned NBC Universal since 2011 and appears to have done nothing to rein in the pro-regulatory, anti-business editorial sentiment regularly heard on programming outlets such as MSNBC, or shut down production of such films such as \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which, in chronicling the rise urban gangster rap, actually confronts issues of free expression and boasts a largely nonwhite cast.<br/><br/><br/><br/> No industry is in as much flux right now as television and video distribution. To say that a merger of a studio and a broadband provider would endanger competition and choice in home entertainment delivery is risible. Viewer habits are changing. Following the lead of Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, virtually all the major TV and cable networks now offer streaming options independent of their cable channels. A la carte programming, so long unfeasible for cable companies because of their business model, has come about via over-the-top mechanisms. Regulators need to make decisions based on present market realities. Companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast can\u2019t count on once-predictable revenues from multichannel cable TV to fund broadband infrastructure.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Yet if consumers can cut the cord, it means content providers like Time Warner must lay down new avenues to reach them. That\u2019s why the AT&amp;T deal, like the Comcast acquisition of NBCU, stands to benefit consumers rather than hurt them. Would there me as much outcry if Time Warner, rather than AT&amp;T, initiated the deal, or would it be seen as a savvy studio staking out the latest means to audience connection? We could see something like that next. Don\u2019t be surprised if another major studio soon makes a bid for Verizon, or vice versa.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The government\u2019s record on tech antitrust is poor because lawmakers and regulators fail to look past market conditions of the moment nor appreciate that tech companies can\u2019t fit into silos. IBM wasn\u2019t upended by Sperry or Amdahl, its principal competitors back in the 1960s, it was undone by new companies with completely different product and technology approaches. Google\u2019s greatest competitive threat isn\u2019t Microsoft\u2019s Bing, it\u2019s Tencent, with a completely different business model. Likewise, it\u2019s doubtful that multichannel cable will be the prevailing choice for home entertainment delivery the next decade. In this time of flux, where consumers stand to gain from more choice than ever, the government should step back and let market forces play out.<br/><br/><br/><br/> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-PMN811887120161215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MDB-CN21-J9XT-P36R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1094\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 15, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The article questioned whether sites like Googlethat use advertising models have the correct strategy and whether internet companies like China\u2019s Tencent, which derive revenue from transactions, might be in better position for growth, given today\u2019s online user habits.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Googlewas a huge U.S. antitrust case that never happened. In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission staff produced a 160-page critique of the company\u2019s competitive practices, along with a recommendation to proceed with antitrust action. However, the commissioners declined to prosecute and used the report to pressure the company for changes in certain business practices.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The European Union, for its part, has not given up, and is pushing its case against the company on a number of fronts.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s hearing on AT&amp;T and Time Warner came in response to concerns about industry consolidation in broadband and home entertainment. To <person><nameText>Sen. Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person>D-Vt., the merger is anti-consumer and should be blocked. President-elect Donald Trump also criticized the merger while on the campaign trail this fall, although more recently, his transition team said the deal would be reviewed \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/> If cooler heads prevail on AT&amp;T-Time Warner, as they did with Google, maybe we can hope that policymakers have at last accepted the reality that, in technology, no one stays on top forever \u2013 or even for very long.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The crux of the Googlecomplaint wasn\u2019t so much its status as the de facto search site. It was whether Googlecould leverage its search dominance to the point that no other web-based ad delivery platform could be viable. The fact that more consumers now use Amazon for product searches\u2014the searches easiest to monetize\u2014completely upends this premise.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The antitrust rumblings about Google, of course, were just the most recent in a long history of government attacks on big tech platforms that were feared as unstoppable, but ultimately proved ephemeral. The Department of Justice spent 11 years prosecuting IBM for monopolizing the computer market. The suit lasted not only through the rise of distributed computing and data networking (think Digital Equipment Corp.and Hewlett-Packard) and into the early days of personal computers. Only then did the U.S. government decide that IBM, a maker of stand-alone million-dollar mainframes, did not illegally control the computer market after all.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Later came Microsoft, which was sued because the government (don\u2019t laugh, kids) thought that its bundling of a browser with an operating system would give the company complete control of the internet. Then there was the FTC\u2019s decision to halt Blockbuster Video\u2019s merger with Hollywood Video because, if permitted, Blockbuster would end up dominating home video distribution and rental for decades (stop laughing, I mean it!). Finally, there was the fuss over the Sirius-XM satellite radio merger. The Justice Department dragged its feet for more than a year over fears that the combination would close off all future consumer options for streaming music and audio entertainment. (Cut it out, already! Don\u2019t make me come over there!).<br/><br/><br/><br/> Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed the same basic thoughts on AT&amp;T and Time Warner at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R, Iowa, raised \u201cconcern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate [and] concern about the merger\u2019s implications for a free and diverse press.\u201d Yet cable TV giant Comcast has owned NBC Universal since 2011 and appears to have done nothing to rein in the pro-regulatory, anti-business editorial sentiment regularly heard on programming outlets such as MSNBC, or shut down production of such films such as \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which, in chronicling the rise urban gangster rap, actually confronts issues of free expression and boasts a largely nonwhite cast.<br/><br/><br/><br/> No industry is in as much flux right now as television and video distribution. To say that a merger of a studio and a broadband provider would endanger competition and choice in home entertainment delivery is risible. Viewer habits are changing. Following the lead of Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, virtually all the major TV and cable networks now offer streaming options independent of their cable channels. A la carte programming, so long unfeasible for cable companies because of their business model, has come about via over-the-top mechanisms. Regulators need to make decisions based on present market realities. Companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast can\u2019t count on once-predictable revenues from multichannel cable TV to fund broadband infrastructure.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Yet if consumers can cut the cord, it means content providers like Time Warner must lay down new avenues to reach them. That\u2019s why the AT&amp;T deal, like the Comcast acquisition of NBCU, stands to benefit consumers rather than hurt them. Would there me as much outcry if Time Warner, rather than AT&amp;T, initiated the deal, or would it be seen as a savvy studio staking out the latest means to audience connection? We could see something like that next. Don\u2019t be surprised if another major studio soon makes a bid for Verizon, or vice versa.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The government\u2019s record on tech antitrust is poor because lawmakers and regulators fail to look past market conditions of the moment nor appreciate that tech companies can\u2019t fit into silos. IBM wasn\u2019t upended by Sperry or Amdahl, its principal competitors back in the 1960s, it was undone by new companies with completely different product and technology approaches. Google\u2019s greatest competitive threat isn\u2019t Microsoft\u2019s Bing, it\u2019s Tencent, with a completely different business model. Likewise, it\u2019s doubtful that multichannel cable will be the prevailing choice for home entertainment delivery the next decade. In this time of flux, where consumers stand to gain from more choice than ever, the government should step back and let market forces play out.<br/><br/><br/><br/> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-PMN811887120161215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MD6-WTB1-J9XT-P24P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1094\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 15, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Sales surged 166pc in the UK and Ireland during the first few weeks as laptops and bread makers flew out of the warehouse, leaving digital turnover up 22pc for the year.</p><p>If only there was something positive to say about selling mobile phones where turnover tumbled 20pc and the unit swung from a \u00a350m profit to a worse than expected \u00a3104m loss.</p><p>Throw in nearly \u00a3150m of costs from closing 531 stand-alone Carphone Warehouse stores and total losses came in at \u00a3282m. Yet that's actually a relative improvement on the \u00a3438m of losses chalked up the previous year.</p><p>Baldock is convinced that with the Carphone stores out of the way and customers soon able to take up less punitive contracts, the unit will come good. After all, it dominates the intermediary market.</p><p>But that won't be for at least another three years. The company is now warning that the pandemic is likely to delay the return of the mobile phone arm to profitability, meaning it is not expected to break even until 2023 at the earliest.</p><p>By then, almost a decade will have passed since the \u00a33.8bn merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse, a deal that the City was assured would create \"a new retailer for the digital age\".</p><p>Baldock should seize the moment and jettison the entire mobile phone operation. After all, the mess isn't his, it was inherited, and every other major company is using the cover of the pandemic to make decisions that would have seemed too drastic, painful, or costly before the crisis.</p><p>Even he admits that the outlook will be highly uncertain for the foreseeable future, and thanks to lockdown he's already discovered that phones don't sell nearly as well online as electrical goods.</p><p>There might be a slight disturbance in the force when it happens but the retailer would be better off for it.</p><p>                     One final reversal is needed                   </p><p>U-turns are common. People change their mind all the time. But a U-turn on a U-turn? A recipe for getting lost.</p><p>Still, that hasn't stopped it happening at the Competition and Markets Authority, where its boffins seem thoroughly befuddled by Amazon's<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/07/15/dixons-carphone-slumps-mobile-phone-sales-slide/\">attempts to buy a 16pc stake in food delivery specialists Deliveroo</url>.</p><p>Having initially blocked the deal last year, the watchdog changed its mind in April, on the highly dubious basis that without Amazon's investment, Deliveroo would collapse because of coronavirus, thereby reducing competition. The ruling promised to provide something of a first: Big Tech as a defender of consumer choice. Then in June, the regulator admitted that with hindsight such a scenario was probably a bit of a stretch, but the deal would be allowed to happen anyway.</p><p>Understandably the decision has caused some consternation among rival firms. Domino's Pizza points out that there is nothing to stop Amazon upping its stake up to 49pc without triggering another CMA probe because it wouldn't have taken control.</p><p>Yet, obviously when any investor increases its stake in a company to those sort of levels, it makes it easier to exert an influence. In Amazon's case that would mean more clout in an entirely new market and we know how that usually ends up.</p><p>The giants of Silicon Valley are well-versed in quickly crushing competition with bargain basement prices.</p><p>The CMA has tied itself in knots but that shouldn't stop it from making one final reversal.</p><p>                     Rubbish rebrand                   </p><p>A new contender for worst rebranding ever: Stellantis, the name for the merged Fiat and Peugeot carmaking giants.</p><p>Apparently it comes from the Latin verb \"stello\" meaning \"to brighten with stars\". &amp;#x2028;Irony is dead.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-64460246</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C4-GW71-JCJY-G45T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><timeReceived>7:21 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 15, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

For Facebook.</p><p>Compared with Mark Zuckerberg's social-media monster, the beast of Redmond - which today is the one member of Big Tech to have achieved respectability among former critics - was a mere lamb.</p><p>A time not so long ago would also have seen the recent 6,000-word, New York Times investigative article on Facebook produce severe consequences. Congressional hearings, regulatory action, an embarrassed board of directors ousting the chairman and chief executive.</p><p>Not now; at least, not yet. Zuckerberg is especially protected by being Facebook's majority shareholder. As a result, he has refused calls to step aside as chairman, separating the job from CEO, so that even minimal corporate governance could be implemented.</p><p>Among The New York Times' revelations were top executives' downplaying and looking aside regarding Russian interference, and working with an opposition-research firm to discredit critics. The firm, Definers Public Affairs, also tried to link anti-Facebook activists to George Soros, longtime bugbear of conservatives.</p><p>Facebook pushed back against the thrust of the article and fired Definers. This does little to diminish the credibility of the deep reporting that went into The New York Times piece - for anyone paying attention.</p><p>Yet in the minute-by-minute flood of information facing Americans - including real political scandals and the existential threat of climate change - Zuckerberg must assume he can ride it out with his boyish appearance and public face of concern. One of the Mississippis of that flood is Facebook itself.</p><p>This is a person who has essentially likened himself to Caesar Augustus.</p><p>If we continue on this trajectory, both gave the coup de grace to republics. But any resemblance stops there. The first Roman emperor was a soldier, statesman and won a cameo appearance in the Bible.</p><p>Zuckerberg was a clever hacker at the right time to be wildly compensated by the Digital Gilded Age's distorted system of market rewards. Being a ruthless empire-builder in corporate America isn't the same as in sword-and-shield antiquity.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sheryl Sandberg exposes how the mere presence of women at the top of corporations won't lead to a new age of decency and integrity. In The New York Times story, the Facebook chief operating officer comes off like any swell with power. Lean in, sure.</p><p>Facebook's role in the Russia election scandal alone should make it the first target for new regulation. It's too big, like so many companies hurting our economy now, but its bigness has an especially sinister quality. That springs from its ability to mine the information on a huge user base and, apparently, manipulate them.</p><p>No wonder Rep. David Cicilline tweeted that \"Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself.\" He might lead the House subcommittee dealing with antitrust issues in the new Congress.</p><p>The European Union's landmark General Data Protection Regulation is a good template for limiting how digital giants employ users' data, even if American lawmakers are unlikely to go this far.</p><p>But we also must look in a mirror. Nobody put a gun to our heads and forced us to spend hours on social media.</p><p>My Facebook experience has been mostly good (Seattle Times journalists are encouraged to be on Facebook and Twitter). Here's why: I use it to promote my columns and author events. The network has also allowed me to reconnect with friends from grade school and high school.</p><p>Otherwise, I try to avoid the time-suck. Being a lifelong newspaper reader, I would never rely on Facebook for \"news.\" Apparently I am in the minority there.</p><p>George Orwell never anticipated how the devils of the internet would make Big Brother almost unnecessary.</p><p>But Neil Postman did, in his prescient 1985 book, \"Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.\" He was writing about television, but its wasteland was nothing compared with addictive social media.</p><p>\"Disinformation does not mean false information,\" Postman wrote. \"It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing.\"</p><p>This is part of the Facebook problem. The other is the feral greed of top executives in stoking it, even if part of the bargain smells very close to being accessory to treason, at least to me.</p><p>When I was an editor, I had a ready response for people who said, \"My kids don't read newspapers.\" I replied, \"But the people who will run your kids' lives do read them.\"</p><p>Indeed, the tech elite severely limits or outright bans screen time for their children.</p><p>But most Americans, it seems, are happy to amuse themselves to the death of self-governance and civilization. It's bread and circuses that would have made Augustus envious.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-0135c538ede911e898dea98fec699288</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTJ-Y6H1-JBKM-D3T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 25, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You could tell because their chief executives wore T-shirts rather than business suits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's report into digital media platforms brings home to Australia that, however they dress, the former upstarts now have so much power they can dictate how society, the media and even democracy works. They are the gateway for about half of the news content we read online and they cream off an even bigger share of advertising revenue. Google just announced its profit tripled over the past year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dominant role of Google and Facebook is not a bad thing. They have won it by providing services that people like using. But their dominance gives them power that can be abused. Facebook inadvertently allowed the appalling images of the Christchurch mosque shooting to be streamed on its website. It also improperly handed over personal data to Cambridge Analytica, a consultancy that used it to tailor ads during the US and Brexit referendum campaigns to individual voters.</p><p>The mood is now swinging against Facebook and Google. The whole world is grappling with the puzzle of how to keep the good bits of the digital world while imposing enough regulation to avoid abuses like these. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in commenting on the report: \"Make no mistake, these companies are among the most powerful and valuable in the world and they need to be held to account and their activities need to be more transparent.\"</p><p>First, the ACCC has argued that something must be done to curb Google and Facebook's power to dictate their own privacy rules. Currently, either users accept Google and Facebook's rules or they have to look for some other, probably less-effective platform. The result is Facebook and Google collect information about their users which could be sold and used to discriminate against certain vulnerable users on the basis of gender or race, or to target vulnerable groups for ads and scams.</p><p>The ACCC says Australia should introduce laws similar to those that already apply in the European Union, which give users of Facebook and Google more power to make an informed and free choice. The presumption should be that users must opt-in before their information becomes Google's and Facebook's property.</p><p>The downside will be lots more disclosure statements to read and more boxes to tick and untick but that is the minimum needed to protect people concerned about privacy.</p><p>The laws must have teeth because both companies have a bad record of sticking to the rules that already exist. Facebook has just paid a $5 billion fine in the US for breaking privacy laws.</p><p>The ACCCs report also breaks new ground by addressing the obvious inconsistency between the codes of conduct imposed on conventional news media such as the Herald and the free-for-all for Facebook and Google which can publish \"fake news\" and objectionable material such as the Christchurch shootings.</p><p>The Herald and other newspapers are subject to the judgment of the Press Council, an industry self-regulator, and radio and television broadcasters are subject to Australian Communications and Media Authority standards.</p><p>Fake news and inaccurate reporting were certainly not invented by Facebook and Google, but there is no reason why they should be given less scrutiny than other media.</p><p>The raids on News Corp and the ABC have underlined how tight the controls are for mainstream media even in publishing true information in the public interest.</p><p>In the interest of levelling the playing field, the two tech giants should face guidelines, although they must be consistent with the protection of free speech. It may also be necessary to make adjustments because they are platforms for information rather than producers of news.</p><p>The ACCC suggests, as a minimum, Facebook and Google should develop their own codes of conduct and crucially some independent regulator such as ACMA should be tasked with policing them. The regulator should be given access to information about how Facebook and Google enforce their codes and make public reports about how they perform.</p><p>In addition, the two firms should have clear procedures for resolving disputes over issues such as demands to take down fake or defamatory material. With so much data online, it will be hard to draw the line but the ACCC says the big tech firms should face a responsibility to take down fake news that is so bad it causes \"serious public detriment\".</p><p>The ACCC's recommendations will disappoint some and it remains to be seen whether the government will implement all of them. But at least a consensus is building about the principle of bringing the digital giants into line.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc76dwqpmyb511i0rhvbix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WND-33N1-JD34-V054-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"796\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

You could tell because their chief executives wore T-shirts rather than business suits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's report into digital media platforms brings home to Australia that however they dress, the former upstarts now have so much power that they can dictate how society, the media and even democracy works.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They are the gateway for about half of the news content we read online and they cream off an even bigger share of advertising revenue. Google just announced its profit tripled over the past year.</p><p>The dominant role of Google and Facebook is not a bad thing. They have won it by providing services that people like using.</p><p>But their dominance gives them power that can be abused. Facebook inadvertently allowed the appalling images of the Christchurch mosque shooting to be streamed on its website. It also improperly handed over personal data to Cambridge Analytica, a consultancy that used it to tailor ads during the US and Brexit referendum campaigns to individual voters.</p><p>The mood is now swinging against Facebook and Google. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/the-big-tech-backlash-is-here-but-australia-is-no-longer-leading-the-charge-20190726-p52b4p.html\">The whole world is grappling with the puzzle of how to keep the good bits of the digital world while imposing enough regulation to avoid abuses like these.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/need-to-be-held-to-account-government-backs-sweeping-crackdown-on-tech-giants-20190726-p52azl.html\">Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in commenting on the report:</url> \"Make no mistake, these companies are among the most powerful and valuable in the world and they need to be held to account and their activities need to be more transparent.\"</p><p>First, the ACCC has argued that something must be done to curb Google and Facebook's power to dictate their own privacy rules.</p><p>Currently, either users accept Google and Facebook's rules or they have to look for some other, probably less-effective platform.</p><p>The result is Facebook and Google collect information about their users which could be sold and used to discriminate against certain vulnerable users on the basis of gender or race, or to target vulnerable groups for ads and scams.</p><p>The ACCC says Australia should introduce laws similar to those that already apply in the European Union, which give users of Facebook and Google more power to make an informed and free choice.</p><p>The presumption should be that users must opt-in before their information becomes Google's and Facebook's property.</p><p>The downside will be lots more disclosure statements to read and more boxes to tick and untick but that is the minimum needed to protect people concerned about privacy.</p><p>The laws must have teeth because both companies have a bad record of sticking to the rules that already exist. Facebook has just paid a $5 billion fine in the US for breaking privacy laws.</p><p>The ACCCs report also breaks new ground by addressing the obvious inconsistency between the codes of conduct imposed on conventional news media such as the Herald and the free-for-all for Facebook and Google which can publish \"fake news\" and objectionable material such as the Christchurch shootings.</p><p>The Herald and other newspapers are subject to the judgment of the Press Council, an industry self-regulator, and radio and television broadcasters are subject to Australian Communications and Media Authority standards.</p><p>Fake news and inaccurate reporting were certainly not invented by Facebook and Google, but there is no reason why they should be given less scrutiny than other media.</p><p>The raids on News Corp and the ABC have underlined how tight the controls are for mainstream media even in publishing true information in the public interest.</p><p>In the interest of leveling the playing field, the two tech giants should face guidelines, although they must be consistent with the protection of free speech. It may also be necessary to make adjustments because they are platforms for information rather than producers of news.</p><p>The ACCC suggests, as a minimum, Facebook and Google should develop their own codes of conduct and crucially some independent regulator such as ACMA should be tasked with policing them.</p><p>The regulator should be given access to information about how Facebook and Google enforce their codes and make public reports about how they perform.</p><p>In addition, the two firms should have clear procedures for resolving disputes over issues such as demands to take down fake or defamatory material. With so much data online, it will be hard to draw the line but the ACCC says the big tech firms should face a responsibility to take down fake news that is so bad it causes \"serious public detriment\".</p><p>The ACCC's recommendations will disappoint some and it remains to be seen whether the government will implement all of them.</p><p>But at least a consensus is building about the principle of bringing the digital giants into line.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520160291</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-XRH1-JBJ7-N2RJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><timeReceived>05:25 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Many don\u2019t stop and think about disastrous long-term effects that knee-jerk reactions may have and forget that government solutions are always worse than the problem. Stubborn politicians should look in the mirror and ask themselves \u201cWould I want an unelected, leftist, deep state bureaucrat to have this power over online speech?\u201d Instead of running to the federal government to impose online speech regulation, conservatives should be exploring the free market for an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for a new platform isn\u2019t limited to censorship. Twitter recently deleted 174,000 Chinese government-linked accounts it concluded were fake and operated by the Chinese government to spread propaganda on topics ranging from its handling of the coronavirus pandemic to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. It is estimated that 40-50% of Twitter users could be inactive or bots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody is expecting to immediately, or completely leave Facebook or Twitter, but imagine if President Trump took his image, and lively voter base, elsewhere and started using a different platform. It would not only spark a massive trend and jumpstart the already-moving, free-market movement toward a better platform, but curb the influence of propaganda from fake/inactive accounts, bots, and \u201cRussian trolls.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, FreedomWorks, along with major news publications like The Washington Times, prominent U.S. Reps like House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and Senators like Rand Paul (R-KY) have started using the new, censorship-free platform \u201cParler.\u201d Positioning themselves as a truly free-speech platform, Parler is a free-market alternative to Twitter, even coining the hashtag #Twexit and partnering with political commentator Dan Bongino. They also set themselves apart because they do not mine or sell user data (but will pay users for their data!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like Trump economic advisor Stephen Moore said recently in Fox Business, \u201cIt\u2019s the oddest thing. The more America\u2019s Big Tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have contributed to keeping America\u2019s economy afloat during the coronavirus lockdown, the louder the voices to break them up or to tie them up into regulatory knots.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we wise up and listen to conservatives like him and Grover Norquist and keep the internet tax- and regulation-free.&lt;/p&gt;

Trump promptly clapped back with an executive order, but due to legality issues it remains unclear how it or if it will be enforced.</p><p>This is a blessing! Many don't stop and think about disastrous long-term effects that knee-jerk reactions may have and forget that government solutions are always worse than the problem. Stubborn politicians should look in the mirror and ask themselves \"Would I want an unelected, leftist, deep state bureaucrat to have this power over online speech?\" Instead of running to the federal government to impose online speech regulation, conservatives should be exploring the free market for an alternative.</p><p>The need for a new platform isn't limited to censorship. Twitter recently deleted 174,000 Chinese government-linked accounts it concluded were fake and operated by the Chinese government to spread propaganda on topics ranging from its handling of the coronavirus pandemic to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. It is estimated that 40-50% of Twitter users could be inactive or bots.</p><p>Nobody is expecting to immediately, or completely leave Facebook or Twitter, but imagine if President Trump took his image, and lively voter base, elsewhere and started using a different platform. It would not only spark a massive trend and jumpstart the already-moving, free-market movement toward a better platform, but curb the influence of propaganda from fake/inactive accounts, bots, and \"Russian trolls.\"</p><p>For instance, FreedomWorks, along with major news publications like The Washington Times, prominent U.S. Reps like House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and Senators like Rand Paul (R-KY) have started using the new, censorship-free platform \"Parler.\" Positioning themselves as a truly free-speech platform, Parler is a free-market alternative to Twitter, even coining the hashtag #Twexit and partnering with political commentator Dan Bongino. They also set themselves apart because they do not mine or sell user data (but will pay users for their data!)</p><p>But like Trump economic advisor Stephen Moore said recently in Fox Business, \"It's the oddest thing. The more America's Big Tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have contributed to keeping America's economy afloat during the coronavirus lockdown, the louder the voices to break them up or to tie them up into regulatory knots.\"</p><p>Hopefully we wise up and listen to conservatives like him and Grover Norquist and keep the internet tax- and regulation-free</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123766168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605C-4191-DYTH-G2B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Thankfully, Rep. Jim Jordan is on the job. On Wednesday, the ranking member of the House Judiciary sent a letter to Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., requesting Dorsey\u2019s presence along with other big tech CEOs at an upcoming antitrust hearing Monday. Not a minute too soon. The American people deserve an explanation of how presidential hopeful Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other high-profile Twitter accounts were breached by hackers recently threatening our national security especially in the run-up to the election. Lawmakers must also address Twitter\u2019s extreme bias and rampant censorship of conservatives spanning years now which warrants immediate congressional action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There\u2019s hardly a week that goes by where Twitter doesn\u2019t censor or shadowban scores of conservatives on its platform  including the president  while allowing far-left and radical  accounts to stand that flagrantly violate its code of conduct.  Some of these controversial accounts include Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who on Tuesday tweeted, \"The Islamic Republic of Iran will never forget the martyrdom of Hajj Qasem Soleimani and will definitely strike a reciprocal blow to the US.\"</p><p>   In Twitter\u2019s twisted worldview, it\u2019s acceptable for the sharia ruler of Iran, a nation designated by the U.S. State Department  as \"the world\u2019s worst state sponsor of terrorism\" to have a Twitter account and to celebrate a mass murderer like Qassem Soleimani, who was responsible for the killing of at least 600 Americans  including U.S. soldiers  while the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Apparently, it is also acceptable to threaten an attack on the United States. But if Americans dare to support President Trump or espouse conservative viewpoints the liberal elites at Twitter disagree with, they risk being \"downranked\" or purged from the platform.</p><p>   This topsy-turvy political discrimination is revolting, anti-American and cannot stand in a democracy.</p><p>   \"Americans are tired of the double standard when it comes to Twitter\u2019s regulation of speech,\" Jordan told me via a statement  on Wednesday. \"No matter how you spin it, there seems to be different rules for Conservatives and liberals on the platform.  Twitter recently \u2018fact checked\u2019 President Trump\u2019s tweets. Did Twitter ever fact check Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s tweets on Russia? Did Twitter ever fact check China\u2019s lies about the coronavirus? Did Twitter ever fact check the WHO (World Health Organization)? No, they didn\u2019t.\"</p><p>   Jordan warned: \"It\u2019s time for Twitter to stop the bias, and stop targeting Conservatives on their site. If not, they\u2019ll face the consequences.\"</p><p>   Deservedly. Twitter allows Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on its platform despite his long history of anti-Semitism, as well as many other controversial figures and groups. Yet, it proactively targets those on the right.</p><p>   This week, Twitter announced its removal of QAnon, a farright  group known for spreading conspiracy theories, along with its reported 150,000 followers and/or affiliates. Yet, for the past four years, Twitter permitted Democrats, the media and blue-check-marked \"journalists\" free rein on its network to spread the \"Russia collusion\" hoax against Trump  possibly  the biggest conspiracy theory and disinformation campaign  in modern history.</p><p>   Never mind that Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice  conducted multiple investigations into the left\u2019s manufactured  \"Russia collusion\" myth  including a 22-month special counsel investigation  which found no such evidence.  Yet, Dorsey and his far-left activist employees still allow Schiff, complicit media and co-conspirators of the debunked conspiracy to remain on its platform  no questions  asked.</p><p>   These disgusting double standards must end.</p><p>  (Adriana Cohen is a nationally syndicated columnist with Creators Syndicate.

For Facebook.</p><p>Compared with Mark Zuckerberg's social-media monster, the beast of Redmond - which today is the one member of Big Tech to have achieved respectability among former critics - was a mere lamb.</p><p>A time not so long ago would also have seen the recent 6,000-word, New York Times investigative article on Facebook produce severe consequences. Congressional hearings, regulatory action, an embarrassed board of directors ousting the chairman and chief executive.</p><p>Not now; at least, not yet. Zuckerberg is especially protected by being Facebook's majority shareholder. As a result, he has refused calls to step aside as chairman, separating the job from CEO, so that even minimal corporate governance could be implemented.</p><p>Among the NYT's revelations were top executives' downplaying and looking aside regarding Russian interference, and working with an opposition-research firm to discredit critics. The firm, Definers Public Affairs, also tried to link anti-Facebook activists to George Soros, longtime bugbear of conservatives.</p><p>Facebook pushed back against the thrust of the article and fired Definers. This does little to diminish the credibility of the deep reporting that went into the NYT piece - for anyone paying attention.</p><p>Yet in the minute-by-minute flood of information facing Americans - including real political scandals and the existential threat of climate change - Zuckerberg must assume he can ride it out with his boyish appearance and public face of concern. One of the Mississippis of that flood is Facebook itself.</p><p>This is a person who has essentially likened himself to Caesar Augustus.</p><p>If we continue on this trajectory, both gave the coup de grace to republics. But any resemblance stops there.

Faced with an uproar from its staff over a Pentagon drone image analysis project, it came out on Thursday with a set of principles, promising not to allow its AI to be used in weapons, illegal surveillance and technologies that cause \"overall harm\". \"How AI is developed and used will have a significant impact on society for many years to come,\" its CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in his blog. \"As a leader in AI, we feel a special responsibility to get this right.\" Google's response is significant on several counts. It is the strongest stance so far from Big Tech on tackling the potential harm from a new and powerful technology with wide-ranging applications. The initial response to Google's move is also instructive. Some fear the US could lose out to China, where AI is undergoing unfettered development. Others think it has not gone far enough. But above all, the reactions point to the pressing need for guard-rails in a field where many legal and ethical issues have been raised. There are none at the moment.</p><p> So it is timely that Singapore announced last week that it will explore some of the thorny issues arising from the increasing use of AI. The effort is crucial because AI is advancing rapidly but lacks the equivalent of the physicians' Hippocratic Oath of doing no harm. Also, it is not just about arms research. If we are increasingly allowing machines to make important decisions on crime fighting, mortgage approvals and staff recruitment, how do we ensure that these decisions are bias-free? And yet proprietary algorithms give companies a competitive edge in the marketplace. How do regulators ensure a balance between oversight and corporate interests? Then there are issues of legal accountability - who is responsible if a driverless car kills someone, for instance - and ethical ones that techies must face up to in an age of data manipulation and \"deepfake\" videos. Patent laws, too, have to consider robot \"inventors\" and AI-generated innovations. There is also much to be gained in this burgeoning field that has AI providing medical diagnoses and chatbots offering legal advice. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat observed recently that AI could create US$3.5 trillion (S$4.7 trillion) to US$5.8 trillion in annual value for the global economy. Having rules of the road will encourage public acceptance and allow the technology to flourish. It is an endeavour that others, like the UK, are pursuing as well. Lord Clement-Jones, chair of the House of Lords Select Committee on AI, said taking an ethical approach ensures the public will trust the technology and see its benefits. This is where Singapore can weigh in. The Republic may not be at the cutting edge of AI development, but it can play to its strength and reputation in the regulatory sphere to shape a much needed international framework of rules in this area.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-491554</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SHC-N461-JCF2-84BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 9, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001141</classCode><className>MILITARY WEAPONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097YK</classCode><className>RECRUITMENT &amp;

Take a wild guess who took the crown.   Libertarian-minded Congressman Thomas Massie is here to explain what Trump  can do to earn it.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, those pesky rogue electors are at it again, some have lawyered (ph)  up, others switching sides.  We've got Texas elector Chris Suprun who says  that he just cannot vote for Donald Trump.  And is the two-party system a  brainless zombie that's barely hanging on?  And if so, would a third party  pump life back into it?  Grab a scalpel, it's time to operate.   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's like election night all over again.  The kind of display that has Lena  Dunham packing her woolens for a four-year Canadian sabbatical and Antonio  Sabato Jr. crying tears of manjoy (ph) and a polarizing movement to sell  magazines and get foamy tongue swagging.  \"Time\" Magazine has declared  Donald Trump its 'Person Of The Year'.   </p><p>Last year, the Donald was simply a dark horse candidate, a rabble-rouser in  a crowded field who in the minds of many skeptics didn't have a shot at a  heck (ph) at winning the whitey house.  \"Time\" snubbed him in 2015 and the  soon-to-be nominee was not a happy billionaire tweeting back then, I told  you @TIMEMagazine would never picked me as person of the year despite being  the big favorite; they picked person who is ruining Germany.   </p><p>That's right.  Last year, \"Time's\" 'Person Of The Year' was David  Hasselhoff.  Actually, controversial Germans have in fact made the list in  the past.  When he was just a gay painter, Adolph Hitler was the Man of the  Year in 1938.  \"Time\" of course fell all over themselves noting the  distinction is not necessarily a positive one rather, it goes to, \"The  person who have the greatest influence for better or worse on the events of  the year.\"  </p><p>Last year, Donald actually landed in third place and share the podium with  ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Angela Merkel who won, the two who  sit on very opposite ends of the burqa issue.   </p><p>Now this year, Hillary Clinton came in second.  At least that's what \"Time\"  says now.  But here's a look at the cover.  They are going to run calling  her president of the year, you wishful thinking, as they mop up their  liberal tears with the dying pages of a magazine now forced to put  president lightning rod on its cover.  \"Time\" of course has made some lazy  choices in the past.   </p><p>In 2006, 'You' were person of the year.  Meaning, internet users tickling  digital keys with abandon.  The earth was planet of the year in 1988.  The  first time plucky planetary fedacious (ph) Albert Gore ran for president  and the mag crowned, the computer, the king of the hill back in 1982, pick  a human people.   </p><p>Well, this year they did with a resigned sigh, knowing one of the  conventions torched by an unlikely Trump presidency is, of course, old  establishment media.  It's really the only time of year people talk about  \"Time\" but my guess is, for better or worse, this issue will sell well --  so well in fact, they might have to dust off the honor for Donald once  again next year.  Oh, Donald.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Oh, Donald, even in these desperate times, you still  retain that dry sense of humor.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KENNEDY:  I love his supporters.  I'm glad you're here, sit on my arm.  I'm  Kennedy.   </p><p>There it is.  So Donald Trump is \"Time's\" 'Person Of The Year' but what  libertarian ideals can he follow to actually live up to that title?  And  what policy should he enact once he get into the oval office?   </p><p>Well here, tonight, it's Libertarian-leaning Republican congressman from  the great State of Kentucky, it's Thomas Massie, joining me now.  Welcome  back, Congressman.   </p><p>REP. THOMAS MASSIE (R), KENTUCKY:  Hey.  Thank you for having me, Kennedy.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Indeed.  This is quite an honor for you (inaudible), I'm just  kidding.  So -- </p><p>MASSIE:  It is. </p><p>KENNEDY:  -- \"Time\" Magazine's 'Person Of The Year', you are a limited  government Libertarian-leaning Republican.  What does Donald Trump have to  do in your mind to earn that distinction?   </p><p>MASSIE:  You know, at the heart of Libertarian principles is a non- aggression policy principle, which means that you don't attack somebody if  they don't attack you.  So the thing I'm most optimistic about is we're not  going to war with Russia, which may have been the case with Hillary, I  mean, whether it's in the Ukraine or Syria or even Georgia.   </p><p>Donald Trump has not expressed a willingness to agitate Russia.  And I  think that's a good move.  So I'm optimistic about that.  I'm optimistic  about some of these cabinet appointments.  You know, I wouldn't call any of  them Libertarian yet but, you know, on the spectrum of smaller government  or bigger government, I personally know some of them and they're definitely  small government type people and Trump's promise to roll back regulations.   </p><p>And then, you know, when I saw you at the RNC, I'm sure you listen to  Trump's riveting speech there.  I was there on the floor listening to it.   He took a swipe at the World Trade Organization which sort of warmed my  heart.  You know, Libertarians are for sovereignty and sovereign nations  and we don't think we should subject U.S. citizens to a world government.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  No.  I mean, I would like to see a few more liberty-minded people  considered for some of these positions as John Allison was, formerly run  the Cato Institute, he was being considered for treasury secretary that  obviously did not go his way and a reason is reporting that you are being  considered for two possible post including energy secretary.  What do you  think about that?   </p><p>MASSIE:  Well, I haven't been contacted about that or the other rumor from  the Trump campaign which is the science policy advisor.   </p><p>But honestly, Kennedy, if I were, you know, contacted about that, I would  consider it seriously.  I think they need some common sense in the White  House as well as in congress so I think I can provide that.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, I think you could, too.  I would love to see a voice like  yours in that administration.  I know that they are filling some of those  posts rapidly.  And one of the things that is something we're all going to  be watching is the meeting next week with tech titans who have been invited  to Trump Tower for a meeting with the president-elect.   </p><p>Now, if you were in fact a science and technology policy advisor, what  would you tell Donald Trump to ask some of the people from Silicon Valley  who were pretty much disinterested in a successful campaign of his?   </p><p>MASSIE:  Well, I don't know what he needs to ask them.  I think they're  sort of coming hat in hand because none of them were for him.  In fact, I  think some of them worked on Hillary's campaign.   </p><p>You know, there's more to tech than than just Silicon Valley.  There's a  lot of tech in manufacturing, there's a lot of tech in a bunch of different  sectors.  And I think the presumption in the previous White House was as  long as you had Google people around you and Google is a fine company, but  as long as you had Google people around you that you were tech and that's  not necessarily true.  There's a lot more to technology than just a few  companies on the west coast.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right.  So where do you stand?  Should the government force  tech companies to comply with some of their orders particularly when it  comes to certain types of speech on social media platforms?   </p><p>MASSIE:  The government shouldn't be forcing anybody to do anything.  We're  getting back to the Libertarian principles here.   </p><p>But, you know, one issue that's come up in congress is the subject of  intellectual property and that's debated among Libertarians whether there  should be patents or not.  And, you know, I hold 29 patents and I'm one of  those Libertarians that says their property rights, patents are property  rights.  And that's what makes this country better than other countries as  we honor property rights.   </p><p>So, you know, you've got some companies on the west coast that aren't keen  on patents and I think that's going to be an interesting to see where  Donald Trump comes down on that.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right.  Well, we will be keeping an eye on you and, you know,  see if you, in fact, do get the nod to go to Trump Tower.  If you do, swing  by here in person, OK, Congressman? </p><p>MASSIE:  All right.  And I'm going to personally invite you to the  inauguration, Kennedy.  I've got a ticket with your name on it.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Consider it done.  I will absolutely go.  I'm going to start  dress shopping tomorrow, not even lying.   </p><p>MASSIE:  All right.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Congressman Massie, thank you so much.   </p><p>MASSIE:  Get a warm one.  OK. </p><p>KENNEDY:  Thank you.  All right.  Well, let me welcome the party panel into  this discussion.  Tonight, it's Dagen McDowell from the Fox Business  Network.  Metal.  Dave Smith is also here.  He's a comedian and host of the  \"Part of the Problem\" podcast.  A lot of alliteration there.  And Tom  Shillue, the venerable host of \"Red Eye\", also feeling very metal tonight.   That's become (inaudible).   </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Welcome, everyone.   </p><p>DAVE SMITH, COMEDIAN AND HOST, PART OF THE PROBLEM:  Hello. </p><p>TOM SHILLUE, FOX HOST:  Thank you.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  So we just heard Congressman Massie talk a little bit about  Donald Trump, person of the year.  And I want to talk about the titans of  tech and this upcoming meeting with Donald Trump -- </p><p>SHILLUE:  At the Trump Tower? </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  What do you think about that?  What do you think the  conversation is going to go like?  I mean, a lot of people who emerge from  those meetings, they are star struck by President-elect Trump and they have  nothing but glowing things to say.  Do you anticipate that is going to  happen? </p><p>SHILLUE:  Well, everybody is turning on Trump -- I mean, turning back.  The  people who were, you know, talking about Armageddon are, you know, they are  now embracing him.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  They're appearing the gulag (ph).   </p><p>SHILLUE:  I mean, why not, right?  The congressman made some great points  though.  If we think of tech as Silicon Valley -- I mean, the entire  country is tech.  Every company is a tech company now.  So we should stop  thinking of Google and everybody in Northern California as being the tech  industry.  I mean, that's a smart guy.  I mean, I love listening to that  interview.   </p><p>SMITH:  Yes, Tom, that's what Libertarians do, it makes sense. </p><p>SHILLUE:  I know.  It really is amazing. </p><p>KENNEDY:  No.  He's really bright and he's very much -- his heart is in the  right place when it comes to limited government and I hope there are people  like that who are welcomed into the administration.  But I do have  concerns, you know, and I shared the same concerns over Hillary Clinton  than I do with the Trump administration.  What is the government going to  do in terms of some of these big tech companies and our privacy?   </p><p>SMITH:  Well, right in Trump hasn't -- from our perspective, I don't think  hasn't really been on the right side of that issue, whether it was with the  Apple and the FBI stuff.  I don't know.  I do think it's interesting.  As  you were saying, we don't really know what Trump is going to do.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes. </p><p>SMITH:  Trump is like door number three president, you know.  It's like, do  you want Hillary Clinton or what's behind door number three?  And we all  look at Hillary Clinton and we were like, we will take that door.  And now  we're going to find out.   </p><p>I don't know.  I mean, I'm a little bit concern about privacy issues of  that.  I don't think Sessions is exactly a friend of civil liberties and  the (inaudible). </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  And it's the Apple case.  And we're talking about the  government trying to force Apple to open that iPhone of the San Bernardino  terrorists.  Mike Pompeo also lame (ph) it on the wrong side of that issue.   I think Tim Cook, I made this groove (ph) in my life (ph) but he was  absolutely right about that, protecting the companies.   </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX HOST:  Silicon Valley hates Donald Trump.   </p><p>SMITH:  Yes, they do. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And so it's going to be hard for them to mask their loathing of  him.  You think that New York City is progressive and left wing and liberal  and still crying over Hillary?  Silicon Valley is a cauldron of anti-Trump  sentiment.   </p><p>I had people on my Facebook wall during the election cycle literally saying  you're killing my children if you vote for Trump.  He's going to destroy  the future of America.  So they've been living in this bubble. </p><p>And the irony of ironies is that these tech companies make money on  disruption, on disrupting the future and building a better life for  everyone.  Well, who's the greatest disruptor of all, Donald Trump, the  fact that he won the presidency.   </p><p>What's very interesting is Google actually put out a want ad, looking for  someone to do conservative outreach in Washington, D.C., the job title is  conservative outreach and public policy partnerships.  Because these  technology companies have had a free ride and open road -- an open-door  policy to the White House for eight years and they got whatever they  wanted, privacy.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  And again, they're all part of the same bubble and they don't  realize that there are a lot of people out there who perhaps think  differently or they're no longer able to share their frustration and their  day-to-day concerns.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's see if they show up.  And by the way, Uber now tracking  you five minutes after you get out of the car, after your ride (ph),  speaking of privacy, yes.   </p><p>SHILLUE:  That's just when I get into trouble.  It said five minutes.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  It's that five-minute window, a very precious time.  We will fear  sneaking in to holiday cheer.  And the House Homeland Security Committee  released a terror threat snapshot today.  And according to the report, the  United States is facing its highest threat from Islamic terrorists since  9/11, stemming from radicalization from within the country while ISIS  conduct its own attacks worldwide.  Now meanwhile, the president is  downplaying the threats.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've attacked ISIL's  financial lifeline, destroying hundreds of millions of dollars of oil and  cash reserves.  The bottom line is, we are breaking the back of ISIL.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right.  So if the back is broken, why is the terror threat so  high?   </p><p>SHILLUE:  I mean, obviously, he's not breaking the back.  You hear a lot of  commentary though that he's done nothing to fight ISIL.  I mean, he's done  something.  He's doing something.  He's droning people.  He's killing  people.  But, you know, I think he's not doing enough or I don't know what  his approach is.   </p><p>I don't know.  I don't know what to do to deal with ISIS.  I don't know  with Trump's idea, you know.  I don't know if the 'Mad Dog' is going to  have an idea.  But I think that obviously -- the thing where Obama is wrong  is he's saying that we're breaking their back, they're on the run, they're  not. </p><p>They're growing.  They're going into many different countries.  So you  can't say they're not metastasizing and growing very well in many  countries.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, and he's also just protecting himself and his legacy.  And,  you know, all he's hoping to do is say a bunch of stuff to keep people  distracted so there's not a terrorist attack on his watch before Donald  Trump takes the oath of office.   </p><p>SMITH:  Sure.  And like you said, he's concerned about his legacy right now  which is why he's lying through his teeth about, you know, hurting ISIS or  whatever.   </p><p>Look, Tom is absolutely right.  I actually think a lot of Republicans give  Obama cover for this.  The truth is that Obama expanded the war on terror,  OK?  He continued the Bush wars and added new ones that expanded the drone  program.   </p><p>Here's the truth, OK, and this is what is amazing about the Trump moment.   You actually have an opportunity for conservatives to returns where they've  always been, the conservative wing of the Republican party always advocated  for a non-interventionist foreign policy.  We have dismissed people like  Ron Pollen (ph), Pat Buchanan and Russell Kirk who warned us to not pursue.   </p><p>Look what we have to show for this war on terror, it's hundreds of  thousands of dead people, trillions of dollars wasted and destroyed  nations.  It's the most failed policy in modern American history.  Maybe we  can look at this.  For once, where is the one victory in this war on  terror?   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  And you're just creating those environments where  terrorists flourish.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there's a blindness and deafness on the part of President  Obama to the ideological threat.  Yesterday, one of the quotes was, over  the last eight years no foreign terrorist organization has successfully  planned or executed an attack on our homeland.   </p><p>As Bret Stephens at the \"Journal\" pointed out, what about the 18 e-mails  between Anwar al-Awlaki and the Fort Hood shooter?  But that was workplace  violence.  Again, if the -- </p><p>KENNEDY:  No.  They couldn't even call that terrorism.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If the president dismisses it, it doesn't -- </p><p>KENNEDY:  The same with Benghazi, they didn't want to call that terrorism.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I always look back to -- because he's always been so concerned  about optics and the way things look.  Well, you have a NATO ally, Belgium,  being attacked by radical Islamic terrorists and he's at a baseball game in  Cuba doing the wave, doing an interview with ESPN.  I think that that kind  of thumbs up his connection to the threaten to fight.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  And, you know, for him, it is about perception, it's not  about reality.  And, you know, the reality is, yes, he has been a  warmonger; he has expanded this.   </p><p>And, you know, his carelessness in trying to empty out Guantanamo, he was  never going to get it closed but instead of giving people due process and  trying them and holding them in this country, he let them go and they've  returned to the battlefield.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And killed Americans which we know from people in government, in  testimony, they have been released from Guantanamo Bay and returned to the  battlefield and Americans have been killed in the process. </p><p>SMITH:  Yes.  The only two groups we've had a real problem with is Al-Qaeda  and ISIS who we both armed and funded.  All of this is our bad policies  coming back to haunt us.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  Well, Thomas Massie is right when he talks about the  incoming president being being more of a non-interventionist.  That's  coming from someone like Thomas Massie to whom that is very, very  important.   </p><p>The panel returns later.  Thank goodness because the fundraising levels are  of any indication, Donald Trump's inaugural party is shaping up to be a  cosmic shindig, even by company standards (ph). </p><p>And the electoral college, back to actually select the president but some  electors bolting from Trump even though there state went Republican.  I'm  going to talk to one of the rogue electors.  That's happening next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>KENNEDY:  They've gone rogue, some of them -- very few of them.  But let  the legal battle over the presidency begin.  Two rogue electors in Colorado  have now filed a federal lawsuit challenging that state's law requiring  them to vote for the winner of the state's popular vote is illegal and  unconstitutional.   </p><p>Now here's where it gets weird.  Hillary won Colorado as you remember.  But  the plan is to undermine similar laws in 28 other states in an attempt to  free up electors to switch from Trump to Clinton or even John Kasich.  Now  at the same time, two republican electors in Texas have said they will not  cast their vote for Donald Trump when the electors meet up in just two  weeks.   </p><p>With us now is one of those Texas electors, Chris Suprun.  How are you,  Chris?   </p><p>CHRIS SUPRUN, ELECTOR, TEXAS:  Good evening, I'm well.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  So, Chris, let's talk a little bit with some of the issues you  have with Donald Trump personally and politically.  I know that you have  some objections.  Is that what's driving your defection?   </p><p>SUPRUN:  Well, they're not personal issues or not professional issues or  political even, they're constitutional.  During the campaign, we had more  than 50 Republicans who are experts in foreign policy and national defense  said that Donald Trump would be dangerous if he were president.  And we've  seen his foreign policy acumen tested already by his acceptance of a call  or making a call to Taiwan.   </p><p>Second, he was hopefully have been -- </p><p>KENNEDY:  How is a call to Taiwan unconstitutional?  Like I understand some  of the other challenges you have maybe with divesting from his businesses  and the opinion of certain people.  I don't think personal opinion  necessarily disqualifies someone from the presidency, certainly not  constitutionally.   </p><p>But you have a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who say, you know  what, breaking protocol with Taiwan not necessarily a bad thing when you're  talking about a democratically elected president.   </p><p>SUPRUN:  And point of fact, I'm not sure I'm opposed to a China policy.   What I'm opposed to is having someone who's not capable of executing that  correctly in office.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  You know, Donald Trump won enough votes to win the presidency.   The electoral college gave him 306 electoral votes.  Do you think that we  should disband the electoral college and amended the constitution?   </p><p>SUPRUN:  No, I do not.  I am a huge fan of the electoral college.  I think  it protects smaller states and states' rights but I also think the  electoral college was not devised under any circumstance to simply be a  rubber stamp.   </p><p>When you read Federalist 68, Alexander Hamilton is clear that he thinks  that the electoral college should be empowered to stop people they feel  dangerous.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right.  Let's talk about Hamilton a little bit.  He certainly  didn't want any of those electors to be pre-pledged (ph) and that is not  what is being asked of you.  However, you and I both know that Alexander  Hamilton -- if we are playing WWAHD, Alexander Hamilton would be disgusted  at the kind of chaos that would follow from a presidency being overturned  by rogue electors, he would not approve of this system.   </p><p>SUPRUN:  I'm not sure that that would be his position but certainly the  constitutions -- </p><p>KENNEDY:  It would absolutely be his position.  I contacted a Hamiltonian  scholar on this very issue and I was assured by someone who has a great  deal and who has spent their life's work learning from Alexander Hamilton  that that would in fact be his position that he was all in favor of a  stable government.   </p><p>SUPRUN:  I'm all in favor of a stable government.  However, our  constitution is clear that the presidential election happens through the  electoral college of December 19th.  And if one of the two persons in our  system right now don't get 270 votes, the top three vote-getters are  considered by the house of representatives.   </p><p>We have a system in place.  I'm not sure why it's quite so scary to all the  people who are out there screaming but there's a system in place for this  and it's still a smooth transition.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  To what though?  I mean, you're trying to get enough electors to  lose their faith as you have to overturn the results of the election and  then what?  You're hoping that it goes to the house of representatives and  the house votes for John Kasich?  Is that the ultimate outcome? </p><p>SUPRUN:  No.  The ultimate outcome for me is to vote for someone who I'm  comfortable is qualified to be president that doesn't invite foreign  governments to engage in espionage against our country, who doesn't  demagogue certain races and ethnic groups here in the country and who  doesn't have a financial conflict of interest across the board.  Someone  who's not playing (inaudible) with the law. </p><p>KENNEDY:  OK.  I understand that.  I didn't vote for Donald Trump for what  it's worth and it may be worth nothing and that's fine.   </p><p>Next week he's going to hold a press conference where he's talking about  essentially divesting himself from his businesses and putting all of that  into a blind trust.  But the other questions that you raised, these are  questions that should've been sold more forcefully to voters in this  country and they're not necessarily a question of constitutionality or  whether or not this person is qualified for the presidency.   </p><p>The notion of qualification is in and of itself and incredibly subjective  thing and treating it as though it is some objective set of criteria is  doing a disservice not only to the position that you have sworn to uphold  but also to the voters that have placed faith in the system.   </p><p>SUPRUN:  Well, we're going to disagree on that part.  Again, I'm going to  deliver the process.  I didn't take this on lightly.  If you look at  backlash I've received, obviously, no one would walk into that willingly if  their convictions weren't strong.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right.  Well, if it is, in fact, Hamilton you're following, I  suggest that you buy a couple of tickets to the musical because that might  do you more good than barking up this tree.  Chris, thank you very much.   </p><p>SUPRUN:  I appreciate it.  I couldn't afford Hamilton but thanks.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Nor could I but I hear it's wonderful.  All right.  Coming up.   Is Donald Trump's Twitter account a direct line to the people or just a  shovel use just to stir up trouble?  Kimberly Guilfoyle joins me in  moments.  Hot pot (ph) of coffee.  Please stay here.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>KENNEDY:  Oh, Gwen.  Welcome you.  It is Wednesday and that means Donald  Trump is still mad at \"Saturday Night Live\".  In an interview on NBC's  \"Today\" show, the president-elect said the skits (ph) are terrible and it  hasn't been good years.   </p><p>Now, of course, Trump has been waging war on Twitter for years as well.   This morning, Matt Lauer asked if he plan to lay off the social medium a  little bit.  Donald response -- </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES (voice over):  I think I  am very restrained.  And I talked about important things and I get it out  much faster than a press release.  I get it out much more honestly than  dealing with dishonest reporters.  Because so many reporters are dishonest. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KENNEDY:  So dishonest.  In other words, he's not going to quit Twitter.   Why should he?  Joining me now, it's Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host of \"The  Five\" on the Fox News Channel.  Hi. </p><p>KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, FOX CO-HOST:  Hello, Miss Kennedy.  How's it going? </p><p>KENNEDY:  So let's talk about Donald Trump a little bit.  He has taken  issue with SNL and Alec Baldwin in particular.  He says that the impression  is mean and it's not accurate.  And he likes Alec Baldwin as an actor but  thinks he's doing a horrible job here.  Do you think Donald Trump is going  to use the office of the presidency to ban SNL?   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  Yes, exactly, immediately.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  Done.   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  They're not going to get any good ambassadors whatsoever, none  of that.  Look, at first, he didn't like lay on that Alec Baldwin, he  didn't kind of touched it.  Then he started saying this isn't any good.   It's terrible.  It's not funny.  And he says it hasn't been good in years.   </p><p>However, it was supposedly amazing because he was on at that time and the  ratings were very good.  So maybe he needs to go back and reprise his role  and play himself so that's what I think.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  I think you're absolutely right.  And I think as we get closer to  inauguration day, that's what he's going to do.   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  I don't think he should.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  I mean, he almost has to at this point.  He have to go on with  Alec Baldwin.  I think the writers would have a field day.   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  Yes.  And he actually is very good at it.  He was super  talented and funny when he was on there; everybody loved it.  So why not go  on and do it again, even the little (inaudible) call you on the cell phone,  very cute.   </p><p>So go on, show them who's boss.  Show them who's the best Donald Trump,  right?  And I think it would be ratings bonanza and good for kind of the  demographic that he's also looking to reach out to and the millennials. </p><p>KENNEDY:  And it's interesting because when Tina Fey was playing Sarah  Palin and Governor Palin actually went on, Tina Fey didn't like that  moment.  And I know Alec Baldwin is a much bigger primadonna and the future  (inaudible) and refuses to be on with Donald Trump, that's not going to  happen.  When does it become a legal issue?  When does parody turn into  slander?   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  You know, that's really interesting.  I mean they have such  creative license because it is well-known as a comedy show, that they've  been able to get away with tons of things for years to say in the interest  of parody.  So I think they're in really good legal standing.  I don't  think he's going to be able to, you know, release the hounds --  </p><p>KENNEDY:  By executive order.   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  -- by executive order, ban it or, you know, to somewhere to  send it to North Korea -- to \"Saturday Night Live\" in North Korea. </p><p>KENNEDY:  Maybe Alec Baldwin will be the U.S. Ambassador to North Korea  Pyongyang.   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  Can you even imagine?   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, I can.   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  They'd be like best friends.  And he'd become -- get  citizenship.  He's new BFF besides Dennis Rodman.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  He (inaudible) Dennis Rodman.   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  But, look, you know, Donald Trump has a good sense of humor.   Obviously, he probably doesn't like some of this that Alec Baldwin -- I  don't think Alec Baldwin doing a bad job in it.  But I think the best way  is to just, if you can't beat them, join them.  Go on there.  Show them how  awesome and fun you are, talented.  Outshine, you know, Alec Baldwin  playing Donald J. Trump. </p><p>KENNEDY:  It would be one of the biggest moments of the un-politics and  entertainment.  We will see if those two storms can collide to perfection. </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  He should take your advice and go do it, I think so. </p><p>KENNEDY:  Kimberly, thank you for coming by.   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  So good to see you.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Merry Christmas if don't see you before.   </p><p>GUILFOYLE:  You as well.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Thank you.  All right.  Coming up, the party panel returns.   Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration was the biggest and most expensive ever.   Can Donald Trump top that next month?  Yes.  Stay here.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>KENNEDY:  Hi, there and welcome back.  Donald Trump has a healthy budget  for his inauguration party after securing $50 million in pledged party cash  already.  He's got a goal of $65 to 75 million that would put him well  ahead of President Obama's 2009 inauguration festivities.  That cost about  $53 million.  But will record numbers turnout for Mr.  Trump?  And which  celebrities, if any, will rub elbows?  The party panel is back to discuss:  Dagen McDowell, Dave Smith and Tom Shillue.   </p><p>So Dagen, I was there for a big changing of the guard in 1992, it's the end  of the Reagan-Bush era.  It ushered in the Clinton era.  And it was quite a  shindig.  I think that was the most celebrity-packed room I've ever been  in: Robert De Niro, U2, Tom Brokaw, Sarah Jessica Parker, Martha Stewart.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Were you bored to death?   </p><p>KENNEDY:  I was so sick of listening to people celebrate.  I knew it was  just (inaudible) --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's the thing, celebrities are overrated.  And most of them  are either boring or drunk or both.  And they always -- even the most  famous people always try to better deal you.   </p><p>And better dealing you is when they look past your ear, when you're talking  to them or right over the top of your head, looking for somebody more  important than you are because they just aren't interested in what you have  to say.  That's why celebrities stuck (ph).   </p><p>And if there are no celebrities at the inauguration then so be it because,  you know what, those people have something to celebrate because they beat  Hillary Clinton who's been running for the presidency for the last 25  years.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Don't even look (ph) her. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And, you know what, even if Donald Trump doesn't drink, I  guarantee you, everybody else there will be.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  And what do you think the hangover is going to be the day after  the inauguration?   </p><p>SMITH:  Yes.  Donald Trump is going to have a hangover on day one.  That's  where everybody would start from.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  A political hangover.  We know that's not -- </p><p>SMITH:  I mean this is just -- between this thank you tour and this -- I  mean, he's just having the party of a lifetime.  I think it's -- but I  agree with Dagen, I mean, he kind of -- look, I don't know if Trump is  going to be a good president or not but he stopped an evil presidency from  happening.  So he deserves to party.  They all deserve to party. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He celebrates with Wendy's or Jimmy John's or maybe both.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Could you imagine this if the festivities were actually catered?   </p><p>SHILLUE:  They should've done it.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  (Inaudible).   </p><p>SHILLUE:  I'm ashamed of what he's doing.  I think it's terrible.  I don't  like inauguration.  He should've tweeted out inaugurations are too  expensive, cancel order, boom.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  No.  He wants to go big or go home; he's a showman.  Melania is  going to wear some insane gown by the designer who's smart enough to say  like Diane von Furstenberg and the Spanish designer, the lady who just said  --  </p><p>SHILLUE:  Not the 1,700s.  I don't think we should have an inaugurations  anymore.   </p><p>SMITH:  Did you see that they have the inside of Donald Trump's apartment,  everything is like gold plated, his names on the outside is gold. </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  He's going to have a gold name and it's going to be all  Washington, D.C.  and he's going to be wearing a neon gold hat.  Because  I'm president. </p><p>SHILLUE:  He should go the other way. </p><p>KENNEDY:  I'm me.  You picked me.  I am me, me.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I hope Melania goes out and buys her dress.  Buys it on -- just  like she did the dress she wore at the RNC.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.  And you know what, I hope she buys the Tom Ford dress and  takes a pair of scissors to it like Molly Ringwald in 'Pretty in Pink'.   And just sort of MacGyvers her own dress.  That would be awesome.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kerry Modler (ph) shoulder pads are back.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  Thank goodness.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right?  Eighties.   </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right.  Guys, thank you so much, Tom, Dave and Dagen.  It's  always a party on a Wednesday night when we got this grooving house (ph).   </p><p>Coming up.  If you think the two-party system is self-serving and a two- headed monster, well, you're going to love my next guest.  We will tell you  some ways Americans can rattle the two-party system and what we're going to  end up with.  Coming up.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Third-party candidates, we had such high hope for you but they  really didn't do well last month.  That doesn't mean the current two-party  system should continue to dominate and could've been doing more harm than  good.   </p><p>Well, according to a recent Gallup poll, 57 percent of Americans think a  major third party should exist, only 37 percent believe Republicans and  Democrats are handling the country well.   </p><p>So what is wrong with a two-party system?  And more importantly, how can we  possibly fix it?  Here now, it's Terry Michael, director of the Washington  Center for Politics and Journalism.  He's also a reason.com contributor.   Terry, welcome.   </p><p>TERRY MICHAEL, DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON CENTER FOR POLITICS AND JOURNALISM:   Thank you very much. </p><p>KENNEDY:  So you have sort of laid it out in different categories, the  various branches of the two parties.  And in the Republican party, say  there are Wall Street conservatives, social cons, neocons, economic  libertarians and the white nationalist alt-right.  Where would you put  Donald Trump in those categories?   </p><p>MICHAEL:  Well, he's really not a party person.  It's kind of hard to  position him any place in the Republican party.  In fact, that's why a lot  of Republicans have a lot of problems with him.  They don't know what he  is.  He's not a conservative, he's not a Republican.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right.  So you consider yourself to be Libertarian-Democrat.   And, you know, I think there are all sorts of new and interesting  distinctions now.  Last time, we talked about a post-ideological world that  Donald Trump is inhabiting and creating for himself.  I mean, couldn't you  argue that he is in essence the first third party president we've had?   </p><p>MICHAEL:  Well, he really is cannot be positioned on an ideological  continuum, on a political party continuum.  He's extremely independent.  He  doesn't really have a core of beliefs.  You can't position him any place.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right.  But is that problematic?  And do you have to have a  core set of beliefs?  Is that necessary for having a viable third party?   </p><p>MICHAEL:  No.  I think those are separate questions.  I think to have a  third party, there has to be some sort of a reason for the third party to  exist.  It has to elect people to various offices.  I don't really think  he's interested in being a third party.  I think he's just interested in  being Donald Trump. </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right.  So let's talk about the third party a little bit  because you've sort of sliced and diced the two main parties that we have.   And I know you have an issue with those.  You are a former Democratic  National Committee spokesperson, so you've seen the party system from the  inside out and it has left you disillusioned.   </p><p>What do you think a third party in this country looks like, is it more  progressive, is it more Libertarian, is it some weird moderate mash-up  where a lot of the parties meet?  What do you see? </p><p>MICHAEL:  Well, I think it really is much more Libertarian.  I think right  now, the Democratic party is almost two-thirds of the way there.  The  Democrats are left on the social (inaudible) issues, they're left on  foreign policy issues but very retro on economic issues.   </p><p>The Republican party is conservative on social issues, conservative on  foreign policy, at least the neocons are.  And they talk a good game on  free markets but really are crony capitalists.  So neither party is a good  fit for people with Libertarian ideas.  But I think that the upcoming  generation that's going to decide the balance of power of politics, the  millennials, want choices.  The don't want one size, fits all government in  a one -- </p><p>KENNEDY:  I agree.  And that maybe one of the best legacies we have from  millennials.  But you had a high profile Libertarian person running for  president who only got three percent of the vote.  And he tried to position  himself and his ticket as being the most enticing option of all the people  running for president and it just didn't get any traction.  What does a  Libertarian-tinge third party have to look like in order to attract more  people?   </p><p>MICHAEL:  Well, first of all, it has to be looked at.  The American people  have to see the third party and our mainstream media didn't allow that.   They basically said this is a duopoly situation.  That's why I call myself  a Libertarian-Democratic.  I want to insinuate Libertarian ideas into the  Democratic party because it's very hard for a third party to be heard in  our media politics.   </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right.  Well, you know, I don't see the Democratic party  being as Libertarian as you do.  I think, you know, in some respect, that's  wishful thinking.   </p><p>I think a lot of people who are in power right now, particularly in the  senate, the senate Democrats, are incredibly pro-government and controlling  and they would do whatever they can to increase the size and scope of  government and control our lives but I do think it's worth continuing this  discussion to see how we can finally end up with more choices in this  country.  Thank you so much for being here, Terry, appreciate it.   </p><p>MICHAEL:  Thank you. </p><p>KENNEDY:  All right, very good.  Coming up, there's a secret to hyper  flexibility, drinking three to five ounces of ketchup a day.  God, I hope  so.  Find out how this guy got to be so bended (ph), 'Topical Storm' is  next.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>KENNEDY:  Like a jet-fueled Christmas sled on a field of neon snow.  This  is the 'Topical storm' topic number one.   </p><p>I believe it was Socrates who said flexibility is next to godliness.  He  was a bit of a dirty-old man.  I like the hemlock (ph).  But if he's  correct, this guy is about to join the pantheon of gods and sip Ambrosia  with them.   </p><p>Sweet lord in heaven.  That is some limberness.  My garden.  Usually to get  that rubbery (ph), you need a surgeon to remove one of ribs.  That's a  legend (ph) (inaudible), sure did.  Or spend a decade training for a  Guatemalan freak show.   </p><p>That's got to hurt the tweaking (ph) berries.  I bet that guy can squeeze  through a rusty keyhole.  No, that's not a euphemism.  Man, how is he not  yet in Cirque du Soleil?   </p><p>If you want to get that supple, you need to start doing yoga, pronto, like  this gal.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Maybe the straight legs a bit more of a challenge.  I'm  just thinking about the (inaudible) --  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KENNEDY:  It broke the glass table and scared the cats and the woman bled  to death and the cat slap (ph) up her blood (ph) like it was strawberry  milk.  Topic number two.   </p><p>It's not enough for robots to take our awesome manufacturing jobs and sleep  with our women.  Now they're trying to replace our insects.  Well, they  stop at nothing.   </p><p>Look at that.  Meet Salto (ph), a wee tiny robot who can jump at a rate of  nearly six feet a second.  Weighs a little over three ounces.  So skinny,  you guys.   </p><p>Its builders modeled it after the African bush baby or Galago.  Like the  idea of using its versatility and tiny size to help locate survivors after  buildings collapse. </p><p>You're few years behind if you ask me.  Amateur inventor Simone Giertz  built the far superior robot using only her iPhone. </p><p>Those are like peanut gels.  It makes me hungry for five guys.  That iPhone  is an international hero.  Take that Tim Cook.  Man, why that would be a  burn?  Topic number three. </p><p>OK.  I have a riddle for you.  How can a white ball make a blue ball?  No,  not by visiting me on my honeymoon.  The answer is, by using a tree.   Watch. </p><p>Yes, lining up the shot.  It swing.  Hit the tree and -- oh, no, Jeremy.   You got to get out of the way, buddy.  Look at that.  Jeremy.  Why weren't  you wearing a cap that day, son, like cameo (ph).  That rogue (inaudible)  just obliterated six generations of would-be children. </p><p>Gentlemen, you might feel a little uncomfortable right now and there's good  reason for that.  Take it away science. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As an innocent bystander, you may flinch or even have  phantom reactions even if you're not the victim.  It is believed to be a  result of mirror neurons which are thought to trigger minor reactions to  others' pain.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>Topic four.  Do you wear your seat belt when you're in the car?  Well,  guess what, Libertarians actually torn on this issue.  Some feel it is not  the governments' role to tell them when to be safe.  Others say there's an  update that show that seat belts do more harm than good and unnecessarily  restrain us.  I think this guy would fall into the ladder (ph) camp.  Check  out our lucky bastard of the day.   </p><p>He's in China.  His car tire exploded -- truck tire rather.  Had he left  out of the car when the wave his truck luckily jack and unstrap -- wait,  what?  No.  He was very muscular, he unstrap himself from the vehicle that  was careening off a cliff and he was able to leap out of that tethering  death mask (ph) before it sent him crashing to his certain death. </p><p>Wait, where was he again? </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  China.  China.  It's pronounced Jina (ph). </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KENNEDY:  Who knew.  Fun.  Topic number five.   </p><p>Are you missing Christmas lights especially outside?  Well, it solve the  problem, might be squirrels, not hobos.  Check out this devious squirrel,  pilfering bulbs like crazy.  Yes, watch.  He just nibbles through the wires  and then, whoa, grab the bulb, leaps into a nearby tree and he's off.   There he goes.  Like a Galago. </p><p>According to bulb's human owner, Mr.  Squirrel stolen over 150 outdoor  Christmas bulbs in just 24 hours.  Now, does the little guy think our deco  acorns or is the squirrel just (inaudible) his soon-to-be brightly liten  nest.  Let's see. </p><p>It's the squirrel griswold (ph).  it's a Christmas miracle.  Thank you so  much for watching the show tonight.  Please follow me on Twitter and  Instagram @kennedynation.

Take a wild guess who took the crown. Libertarian-minded <person><nameText>Congressman Thomas Massie </nameText></person>is here to explain what Trump can do to earn it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, those pesky rogue electors are at it again, some have lawyered (ph) up, others switching sides. We've got Texas elector Chris Suprun who says that he just cannot vote for <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>And is the two-party system a brainless zombie that's barely hanging on? And if so, would a third party pump life back into it? Grab a scalpel, it's time to operate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's like election night all over again. The kind of display that has Lena Dunham packing her woolens for a four-year Canadian sabbatical and Antonio Sabato Jr. crying tears of manjoy (ph) and a polarizing movement to sell magazines and get foamy tongue swagging. \"Time\" Magazine has declared <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>its `Person Of The Year'.</p><p>Last year, the Donald was simply a dark horse candidate, a rabble-rouser in a crowded field who in the minds of many skeptics didn't have a shot at a heck (ph) at winning the whitey house. \"Time\" snubbed him in 2015 and the soon-to-be nominee was not a happy billionaire tweeting back then, I told you @TIMEMagazine would never picked me as person of the year despite being the big favorite; they picked person who is ruining Germany.</p><p>That's right. Last year, \"Time's\" `Person Of The Year' was David Hasselhoff. Actually, controversial Germans have in fact made the list in the past. When he was just a gay painter, Adolph Hitler was the Man of the Year in 1938. \"Time\" of course fell all over themselves noting the distinction is not necessarily a positive one rather, it goes to, \"The person who have the greatest influence for better or worse on the events of the year.\"</p><p>Last year, Donald actually landed in third place and share the podium with ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Angela Merkel who won, the two who sit on very opposite ends of the burqa issue.</p><p>Now this year, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>came in second. At least that's what \"Time\" says now. But here's a look at the cover. They are going to run calling her president of the year, you wishful thinking, as they mop up their liberal tears with the dying pages of a magazine now forced to put president lightning rod on its cover. \"Time\" of course has made some lazy choices in the past.</p><p>In 2006, `You' were person of the year. Meaning, internet users tickling digital keys with abandon. The earth was planet of the year in 1988. The first time plucky planetary fedacious (ph) Albert Gore ran for president and the mag crowned, the computer, the king of the hill back in 1982, pick a human people.</p><p>Well, this year they did with a resigned sigh, knowing one of the conventions torched by an unlikely Trump presidency is, of course, old establishment media. It's really the only time of year people talk about \"Time\" but my guess is, for better or worse, this issue will sell well -- so well in fact, they might have to dust off the honor for Donald once again next year. Oh, Donald.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, Donald, even in these desperate times, you still retain that dry sense of humor.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: I love his supporters. I'm glad you're here, sit on my arm. I'm Kennedy.</p><p>There it is. So <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is \"Time's\" `Person Of The Year' but what libertarian ideals can he follow to actually live up to that title? And what policy should he enact once he get into the oval office?</p><p>Well here, tonight, it's Libertarian-leaning Republican congressman from the great State of Kentucky, it's Thomas Massie, joining me now. Welcome back, Congressman.</p><p>REP. THOMAS MASSIE (R), KENTUCKY: Hey. Thank you for having me, Kennedy.</p><p>KENNEDY: Indeed. This is quite an honor for you (inaudible), I'm just kidding. So --</p><p>MASSIE: It is.</p><p>KENNEDY: -- \"Time\" Magazine's `Person Of The Year', you are a limited government Libertarian-leaning Republican. What does <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>have to do in your mind to earn that distinction?</p><p>MASSIE: You know, at the heart of Libertarian principles is a non- aggression policy principle, which means that you don't attack somebody if they don't attack you. So the thing I'm most optimistic about is we're not going to war with Russia, which may have been the case with Hillary, I mean, whether it's in the Ukraine or Syria or even Georgia.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has not expressed a willingness to agitate Russia. And I think that's a good move. So I'm optimistic about that. I'm optimistic about some of these cabinet appointments. You know, I wouldn't call any of them Libertarian yet but, you know, on the spectrum of smaller government or bigger government, I personally know some of them and they're definitely small government type people and Trump's promise to roll back regulations.</p><p>And then, you know, when I saw you at the RNC, I'm sure you listen to Trump's riveting speech there. I was there on the floor listening to it. He took a swipe at the World Trade Organization which sort of warmed my heart. You know, Libertarians are for sovereignty and sovereign nations and we don't think we should subject U.S. citizens to a world government.</p><p>KENNEDY: No. I mean, I would like to see a few more liberty-minded people considered for some of these positions as John Allison was, formerly run the Cato Institute, he was being considered for treasury secretary that obviously did not go his way and a reason is reporting that you are being considered for two possible post including energy secretary. What do you think about that?</p><p>MASSIE: Well, I haven't been contacted about that or the other rumor from the Trump campaign which is the science policy advisor.</p><p>But honestly, Kennedy, if I were, you know, contacted about that, I would consider it seriously. I think they need some common sense in the White House as well as in congress so I think I can provide that.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, I think you could, too. I would love to see a voice like yours in that administration. I know that they are filling some of those posts rapidly. And one of the things that is something we're all going to be watching is the meeting next week with tech titans who have been invited to Trump Tower for a meeting with the president-elect.</p><p>Now, if you were in fact a science and technology policy advisor, what would you tell <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to ask some of the people from Silicon Valley who were pretty much disinterested in a successful campaign of his?</p><p>MASSIE: Well, I don't know what he needs to ask them. I think they're sort of coming hat in hand because none of them were for him. In fact, I think some of them worked on Hillary's campaign.</p><p>You know, there's more to tech than than just Silicon Valley. There's a lot of tech in manufacturing, there's a lot of tech in a bunch of different sectors. And I think the presumption in the previous White House was as long as you had Google people around you and Google is a fine company, but as long as you had Google people around you that you were tech and that's not necessarily true. There's a lot more to technology than just a few companies on the west coast.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. So where do you stand? Should the government force tech companies to comply with some of their orders particularly when it comes to certain types of speech on social media platforms?</p><p>MASSIE: The government shouldn't be forcing anybody to do anything. We're getting back to the Libertarian principles here.</p><p>But, you know, one issue that's come up in congress is the subject of intellectual property and that's debated among Libertarians whether there should be patents or not. And, you know, I hold 29 patents and I'm one of those Libertarians that says their property rights, patents are property rights. And that's what makes this country better than other countries as we honor property rights.</p><p>So, you know, you've got some companies on the west coast that aren't keen on patents and I think that's going to be an interesting to see where <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>comes down on that.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. Well, we will be keeping an eye on you and, you know, see if you, in fact, do get the nod to go to Trump Tower. If you do, swing by here in person, OK, Congressman?</p><p>MASSIE: All right. And I'm going to personally invite you to the inauguration, Kennedy. I've got a ticket with your name on it.</p><p>KENNEDY: Consider it done. I will absolutely go. I'm going to start dress shopping tomorrow, not even lying.</p><p>MASSIE: All right.</p><p>KENNEDY: Congressman Massie, thank you so much.</p><p>MASSIE: Get a warm one. OK.</p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you. All right. Well, let me welcome the party panel into this discussion. Tonight, it's Dagen McDowell from the Fox Business Network. Metal. Dave Smith is also here. He's a comedian and host of the \"Part of the Problem\" podcast. A lot of alliteration there. And Tom Shillue, the venerable host of \"Red Eye\", also feeling very metal tonight. That's become (inaudible).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Welcome, everyone.</p><p>DAVE SMITH, COMEDIAN AND HOST, PART OF THE PROBLEM: Hello.</p><p>TOM SHILLUE, FOX HOST: Thank you.</p><p>KENNEDY: So we just heard Congressman Massie talk a little bit about <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>person of the year. And I want to talk about the titans of tech and this upcoming meeting with <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>--</p><p>SHILLUE: At the Trump Tower?</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. What do you think about that? What do you think the conversation is going to go like? I mean, a lot of people who emerge from those meetings, they are star struck by President-elect Trump and they have nothing but glowing things to say. Do you anticipate that is going to happen?</p><p>SHILLUE: Well, everybody is turning on Trump -- I mean, turning back. The people who were, you know, talking about Armageddon are, you know, they are now embracing him.</p><p>KENNEDY: They're appearing the gulag (ph).</p><p>SHILLUE: I mean, why not, right? The congressman made some great points though. If we think of tech as Silicon Valley -- I mean, the entire country is tech. Every company is a tech company now. So we should stop thinking of Google and everybody in Northern California as being the tech industry. I mean, that's a smart guy. I mean, I love listening to that interview.</p><p>SMITH: Yes, Tom, that's what Libertarians do, it makes sense.</p><p>SHILLUE: I know. It really is amazing.</p><p>KENNEDY: No. He's really bright and he's very much -- his heart is in the right place when it comes to limited government and I hope there are people like that who are welcomed into the administration. But I do have concerns, you know, and I shared the same concerns over <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>than I do with the Trump administration. What is the government going to do in terms of some of these big tech companies and our privacy?</p><p>SMITH: Well, right in Trump hasn't -- from our perspective, I don't think hasn't really been on the right side of that issue, whether it was with the Apple and the FBI stuff. I don't know. I do think it's interesting. As you were saying, we don't really know what Trump is going to do.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p><p>SMITH: Trump is like door number three president, you know. It's like, do you want <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>or what's behind door number three? And we all look at <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>and we were like, we will take that door. And now we're going to find out.</p><p>I don't know. I mean, I'm a little bit concern about privacy issues of that. I don't think Sessions is exactly a friend of civil liberties and the (inaudible).</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. And it's the Apple case. And we're talking about the government trying to force Apple to open that iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorists. Mike Pompeo also lame (ph) it on the wrong side of that issue. I think Tim Cook, I made this groove (ph) in my life (ph) but he was absolutely right about that, protecting the companies.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX HOST: Silicon Valley hates <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>SMITH: Yes, they do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And so it's going to be hard for them to mask their loathing of him. You think that New York City is progressive and left wing and liberal and still crying over Hillary? Silicon Valley is a cauldron of anti-Trump sentiment.</p><p>I had people on my Facebook wall during the election cycle literally saying you're killing my children if you vote for Trump. He's going to destroy the future of America. So they've been living in this bubble.</p><p>And the irony of ironies is that these tech companies make money on disruption, on disrupting the future and building a better life for everyone. Well, who's the greatest disruptor of all, <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>the fact that he won the presidency.</p><p>What's very interesting is Google actually put out a want ad, looking for someone to do conservative outreach in Washington, D.C., the job title is conservative outreach and public policy partnerships. Because these technology companies have had a free ride and open road -- an open-door policy to the White House for eight years and they got whatever they wanted, privacy.</p><p>KENNEDY: And again, they're all part of the same bubble and they don't realize that there are a lot of people out there who perhaps think differently or they're no longer able to share their frustration and their day-to-day concerns.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's see if they show up. And by the way, Uber now tracking you five minutes after you get out of the car, after your ride (ph), speaking of privacy, yes.</p><p>SHILLUE: That's just when I get into trouble. It said five minutes.</p><p>KENNEDY: It's that five-minute window, a very precious time. We will fear sneaking in to holiday cheer. And the House Homeland Security Committee released a terror threat snapshot today. And according to the report, the United States is facing its highest threat from Islamic terrorists since 9/11, stemming from radicalization from within the country while ISIS conduct its own attacks worldwide. Now meanwhile, the president is downplaying the threats.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've attacked ISIL's financial lifeline, destroying hundreds of millions of dollars of oil and cash reserves. The bottom line is, we are breaking the back of ISIL.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. So if the back is broken, why is the terror threat so high?</p><p>SHILLUE: I mean, obviously, he's not breaking the back. You hear a lot of commentary though that he's done nothing to fight ISIL. I mean, he's done something. He's doing something. He's droning people. He's killing people. But, you know, I think he's not doing enough or I don't know what his approach is.</p><p>I don't know. I don't know what to do to deal with ISIS. I don't know with Trump's idea, you know. I don't know if the `Mad Dog' is going to have an idea. But I think that obviously -- the thing where Obama is wrong is he's saying that we're breaking their back, they're on the run, they're not.</p><p>They're growing. They're going into many different countries. So you can't say they're not metastasizing and growing very well in many countries.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, and he's also just protecting himself and his legacy. And, you know, all he's hoping to do is say a bunch of stuff to keep people distracted so there's not a terrorist attack on his watch before <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>takes the oath of office.</p><p>SMITH: Sure. And like you said, he's concerned about his legacy right now which is why he's lying through his teeth about, you know, hurting ISIS or whatever.</p><p>Look, Tom is absolutely right. I actually think a lot of Republicans give Obama cover for this. The truth is that Obama expanded the war on terror, OK? He continued the Bush wars and added new ones that expanded the drone program.</p><p>Here's the truth, OK, and this is what is amazing about the Trump moment. You actually have an opportunity for conservatives to returns where they've always been, the conservative wing of the Republican party always advocated for a non-interventionist foreign policy. We have dismissed people like Ron Pollen (ph), Pat Buchanan and Russell Kirk who warned us to not pursue.</p><p>Look what we have to show for this war on terror, it's hundreds of thousands of dead people, trillions of dollars wasted and destroyed nations. It's the most failed policy in modern American history. Maybe we can look at this. For once, where is the one victory in this war on terror?</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. And you're just creating those environments where terrorists flourish.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And there's a blindness and deafness on the part of President Obama to the ideological threat. Yesterday, one of the quotes was, over the last eight years no foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned or executed an attack on our homeland.</p><p>As Bret Stephens at the \"Journal\" pointed out, what about the 18 e-mails between Anwar al-Awlaki and the Fort Hood shooter? But that was workplace violence. Again, if the --</p><p>KENNEDY: No. They couldn't even call that terrorism.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If the president dismisses it, it doesn't --</p><p>KENNEDY: The same with Benghazi, they didn't want to call that terrorism.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I always look back to -- because he's always been so concerned about optics and the way things look. Well, you have a NATO ally, Belgium, being attacked by radical Islamic terrorists and he's at a baseball game in Cuba doing the wave, doing an interview with ESPN. I think that that kind of thumbs up his connection to the threaten to fight.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. And, you know, for him, it is about perception, it's not about reality. And, you know, the reality is, yes, he has been a warmonger; he has expanded this.</p><p>And, you know, his carelessness in trying to empty out Guantanamo, he was never going to get it closed but instead of giving people due process and trying them and holding them in this country, he let them go and they've returned to the battlefield.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And killed Americans which we know from people in government, in testimony, they have been released from Guantanamo Bay and returned to the battlefield and Americans have been killed in the process.</p><p>SMITH: Yes. The only two groups we've had a real problem with is Al-Qaeda and ISIS who we both armed and funded. All of this is our bad policies coming back to haunt us.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. Well, Thomas Massie is right when he talks about the incoming president being being more of a non-interventionist. That's coming from someone like Thomas Massie to whom that is very, very important.</p><p>The panel returns later. Thank goodness because the fundraising levels are of any indication, <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>inaugural party is shaping up to be a cosmic shindig, even by company standards (ph).</p><p>And the electoral college, back to actually select the president but some electors bolting from Trump even though there state went Republican. I'm going to talk to one of the rogue electors. That's happening next.</p><p>KENNEDY: They've gone rogue, some of them -- very few of them. But let the legal battle over the presidency begin. Two rogue electors in Colorado have now filed a federal lawsuit challenging that state's law requiring them to vote for the winner of the state's popular vote is illegal and unconstitutional.</p><p>Now here's where it gets weird. Hillary won Colorado as you remember. But the plan is to undermine similar laws in 28 other states in an attempt to free up electors to switch from Trump to Clinton or even John Kasich. Now at the same time, two republican electors in Texas have said they will not cast their vote for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>when the electors meet up in just two weeks.</p><p>With us now is one of those Texas electors, Chris Suprun. How are you, Chris?</p><p>CHRIS SUPRUN, ELECTOR, TEXAS: Good evening, I'm well.</p><p>KENNEDY: So, Chris, let's talk a little bit with some of the issues you have with <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>personally and politically. I know that you have some objections. Is that what's driving your defection?</p><p>SUPRUN: Well, they're not personal issues or not professional issues or political even, they're constitutional. During the campaign, we had more than 50 Republicans who are experts in foreign policy and national defense said that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>would be dangerous if he were president. And we've seen his foreign policy acumen tested already by his acceptance of a call or making a call to Taiwan.</p><p>Second, he was hopefully have been --</p><p>KENNEDY: How is a call to Taiwan unconstitutional? Like I understand some of the other challenges you have maybe with divesting from his businesses and the opinion of certain people. I don't think personal opinion necessarily disqualifies someone from the presidency, certainly not constitutionally.</p><p>But you have a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who say, you know what, breaking protocol with Taiwan not necessarily a bad thing when you're talking about a democratically elected president.</p><p>SUPRUN: And point of fact, I'm not sure I'm opposed to a China policy. What I'm opposed to is having someone who's not capable of executing that correctly in office.</p><p>KENNEDY: You know, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>won enough votes to win the presidency. The electoral college gave him 306 electoral votes. Do you think that we should disband the electoral college and amended the constitution?</p><p>SUPRUN: No, I do not. I am a huge fan of the electoral college. I think it protects smaller states and states' rights but I also think the electoral college was not devised under any circumstance to simply be a rubber stamp.</p><p>When you read Federalist 68, Alexander Hamilton is clear that he thinks that the electoral college should be empowered to stop people they feel dangerous.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. Let's talk about Hamilton a little bit. He certainly didn't want any of those electors to be pre-pledged (ph) and that is not what is being asked of you. However, you and I both know that Alexander Hamilton -- if we are playing WWAHD, Alexander Hamilton would be disgusted at the kind of chaos that would follow from a presidency being overturned by rogue electors, he would not approve of this system.</p><p>SUPRUN: I'm not sure that that would be his position but certainly the constitutions --</p><p>KENNEDY: It would absolutely be his position. I contacted a Hamiltonian scholar on this very issue and I was assured by someone who has a great deal and who has spent their life's work learning from Alexander Hamilton that that would in fact be his position that he was all in favor of a stable government.</p><p>SUPRUN: I'm all in favor of a stable government. However, our constitution is clear that the presidential election happens through the electoral college of December 19th. And if one of the two persons in our system right now don't get 270 votes, the top three vote-getters are considered by the house of representatives.</p><p>We have a system in place. I'm not sure why it's quite so scary to all the people who are out there screaming but there's a system in place for this and it's still a smooth transition.</p><p>KENNEDY: To what though? I mean, you're trying to get enough electors to lose their faith as you have to overturn the results of the election and then what? You're hoping that it goes to the house of representatives and the house votes for John Kasich? Is that the ultimate outcome?</p><p>SUPRUN: No. The ultimate outcome for me is to vote for someone who I'm comfortable is qualified to be president that doesn't invite foreign governments to engage in espionage against our country, who doesn't demagogue certain races and ethnic groups here in the country and who doesn't have a financial conflict of interest across the board. Someone who's not playing (inaudible) with the law.</p><p>KENNEDY: OK. I understand that. I didn't vote for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>for what it's worth and it may be worth nothing and that's fine.</p><p>Next week he's going to hold a press conference where he's talking about essentially divesting himself from his businesses and putting all of that into a blind trust. But the other questions that you raised, these are questions that should've been sold more forcefully to voters in this country and they're not necessarily a question of constitutionality or whether or not this person is qualified for the presidency.</p><p>The notion of qualification is in and of itself and incredibly subjective thing and treating it as though it is some objective set of criteria is doing a disservice not only to the position that you have sworn to uphold but also to the voters that have placed faith in the system.</p><p>SUPRUN: Well, we're going to disagree on that part. Again, I'm going to deliver the process. I didn't take this on lightly. If you look at backlash I've received, obviously, no one would walk into that willingly if their convictions weren't strong.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. Well, if it is, in fact, Hamilton you're following, I suggest that you buy a couple of tickets to the musical because that might do you more good than barking up this tree. Chris, thank you very much.</p><p>SUPRUN: I appreciate it. I couldn't afford Hamilton but thanks.</p><p>KENNEDY: Nor could I but I hear it's wonderful. All right. Coming up. Is <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>Twitter account a direct line to the people or just a shovel use just to stir up trouble? Kimberly Guilfoyle joins me in moments. Hot pot (ph) of coffee. Please stay here.</p><p>KENNEDY: Oh, Gwen. Welcome you. It is Wednesday and that means <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is still mad at \"Saturday Night Live\". In an interview on NBC's \"Today\" show, the president-elect said the skits (ph) are terrible and it hasn't been good years.</p><p>Now, of course, Trump has been waging war on Twitter for years as well. This morning, Matt Lauer asked if he plan to lay off the social medium a little bit. Donald response --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES (voice over): I think I am very restrained. And I talked about important things and I get it out much faster than a press release. I get it out much more honestly than dealing with dishonest reporters. Because so many reporters are dishonest.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: So dishonest. In other words, he's not going to quit Twitter. Why should he? Joining me now, it's Kimberly Guilfoyle, co-host of \"The Five\" on the Fox News Channel. Hi.</p><p>KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, FOX CO-HOST: Hello, Miss Kennedy. How's it going?</p><p>KENNEDY: So let's talk about <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>a little bit. He has taken issue with SNL and Alec Baldwin in particular. He says that the impression is mean and it's not accurate. And he likes Alec Baldwin as an actor but thinks he's doing a horrible job here. Do you think <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is going to use the office of the presidency to ban SNL?</p><p>GUILFOYLE: Yes, exactly, immediately.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. Done.</p><p>GUILFOYLE: They're not going to get any good ambassadors whatsoever, none of that. Look, at first, he didn't like lay on that Alec Baldwin, he didn't kind of touched it. Then he started saying this isn't any good. It's terrible. It's not funny. And he says it hasn't been good in years.</p><p>However, it was supposedly amazing because he was on at that time and the ratings were very good. So maybe he needs to go back and reprise his role and play himself so that's what I think.</p><p>KENNEDY: I think you're absolutely right. And I think as we get closer to inauguration day, that's what he's going to do.</p><p>GUILFOYLE: I don't think he should.</p><p>KENNEDY: I mean, he almost has to at this point. He have to go on with Alec Baldwin. I think the writers would have a field day.</p><p>GUILFOYLE: Yes. And he actually is very good at it. He was super talented and funny when he was on there; everybody loved it. So why not go on and do it again, even the little (inaudible) call you on the cell phone, very cute.</p><p>So go on, show them who's boss. Show them who's the best <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>right? And I think it would be ratings bonanza and good for kind of the demographic that he's also looking to reach out to and the millennials.</p><p>KENNEDY: And it's interesting because when Tina Fey was playing Sarah Palin and Governor Palin actually went on, Tina Fey didn't like that moment. And I know Alec Baldwin is a much bigger primadonna and the future (inaudible) and refuses to be on with <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>that's not going to happen. When does it become a legal issue? When does parody turn into slander?</p><p>GUILFOYLE: You know, that's really interesting. I mean they have such creative license because it is well-known as a comedy show, that they've been able to get away with tons of things for years to say in the interest of parody. So I think they're in really good legal standing. I don't think he's going to be able to, you know, release the hounds --</p><p>KENNEDY: By executive order.</p><p>GUILFOYLE: -- by executive order, ban it or, you know, to somewhere to send it to North Korea -- to \"Saturday Night Live\" in North Korea.</p><p>KENNEDY: Maybe Alec Baldwin will be the U.S. Ambassador to North Korea Pyongyang.</p><p>GUILFOYLE: Can you even imagine?</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, I can.</p><p>GUILFOYLE: They'd be like best friends. And he'd become -- get citizenship. He's new BFF besides Dennis Rodman.</p><p>KENNEDY: He (inaudible) Dennis Rodman.</p><p>GUILFOYLE: But, look, you know, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has a good sense of humor. Obviously, he probably doesn't like some of this that Alec Baldwin -- I don't think Alec Baldwin doing a bad job in it. But I think the best way is to just, if you can't beat them, join them. Go on there. Show them how awesome and fun you are, talented. Outshine, you know, Alec Baldwin playing Donald J. Trump.</p><p>KENNEDY: It would be one of the biggest moments of the un-politics and entertainment. We will see if those two storms can collide to perfection.</p><p>GUILFOYLE: He should take your advice and go do it, I think so.</p><p>KENNEDY: Kimberly, thank you for coming by.</p><p>GUILFOYLE: So good to see you.</p><p>KENNEDY: Merry Christmas if don't see you before.</p><p>GUILFOYLE: You as well.</p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you. All right. Coming up, the party panel returns. Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration was the biggest and most expensive ever. Can <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>top that next month? Yes. Stay here.</p><p>KENNEDY: Hi, there and welcome back. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has a healthy budget for his inauguration party after securing $50 million in pledged party cash already. He's got a goal of $65 to 75 million that would put him well ahead of President Obama's 2009 inauguration festivities. That cost about $53 million. But will record numbers turnout for Mr. Trump? And which celebrities, if any, will rub elbows? The party panel is back to discuss: Dagen McDowell, Dave Smith and Tom Shillue.</p><p>So Dagen, I was there for a big changing of the guard in 1992, it's the end of the Reagan-Bush era. It ushered in the Clinton era. And it was quite a shindig. I think that was the most celebrity-packed room I've ever been in: Robert De Niro, U2, Tom Brokaw, Sarah Jessica Parker, Martha Stewart.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Were you bored to death?</p><p>KENNEDY: I was so sick of listening to people celebrate. I knew it was just (inaudible) --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's the thing, celebrities are overrated. And most of them are either boring or drunk or both. And they always -- even the most famous people always try to better deal you.</p><p>And better dealing you is when they look past your ear, when you're talking to them or right over the top of your head, looking for somebody more important than you are because they just aren't interested in what you have to say. That's why celebrities stuck (ph).</p><p>And if there are no celebrities at the inauguration then so be it because, you know what, those people have something to celebrate because they beat <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>who's been running for the presidency for the last 25 years.</p><p>KENNEDY: Don't even look (ph) her.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And, you know what, even if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>doesn't drink, I guarantee you, everybody else there will be.</p><p>KENNEDY: And what do you think the hangover is going to be the day after the inauguration?</p><p>SMITH: Yes. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is going to have a hangover on day one. That's where everybody would start from.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. A political hangover. We know that's not --</p><p>SMITH: I mean this is just -- between this thank you tour and this -- I mean, he's just having the party of a lifetime. I think it's -- but I agree with Dagen, I mean, he kind of -- look, I don't know if Trump is going to be a good president or not but he stopped an evil presidency from happening. So he deserves to party. They all deserve to party.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He celebrates with Wendy's or Jimmy John's or maybe both.</p><p>KENNEDY: Could you imagine this if the festivities were actually catered?</p><p>SHILLUE: They should've done it.</p><p>KENNEDY: (Inaudible).</p><p>SHILLUE: I'm ashamed of what he's doing. I think it's terrible. I don't like inauguration. He should've tweeted out inaugurations are too expensive, cancel order, boom.</p><p>KENNEDY: No. He wants to go big or go home; he's a showman. Melania is going to wear some insane gown by the designer who's smart enough to say like Diane von Furstenberg and the Spanish designer, the lady who just said --</p><p>SHILLUE: Not the 1,700s. I don't think we should have an inaugurations anymore.</p><p>SMITH: Did you see that they have the inside of <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>apartment, everything is like gold plated, his names on the outside is gold.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. He's going to have a gold name and it's going to be all Washington, D.C. and he's going to be wearing a neon gold hat. Because I'm president.</p><p>SHILLUE: He should go the other way.</p><p>KENNEDY: I'm me. You picked me. I am me, me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I hope Melania goes out and buys her dress. Buys it on -- just like she did the dress she wore at the RNC.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes. And you know what, I hope she buys the Tom Ford dress and takes a pair of scissors to it like Molly Ringwald in `Pretty in Pink'. And just sort of MacGyvers her own dress. That would be awesome.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kerry Modler (ph) shoulder pads are back.</p><p>KENNEDY: Thank goodness.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right? Eighties.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. Guys, thank you so much, Tom, Dave and Dagen. It's always a party on a Wednesday night when we got this grooving house (ph).</p><p>Coming up. If you think the two-party system is self-serving and a two- headed monster, well, you're going to love my next guest. We will tell you some ways Americans can rattle the two-party system and what we're going to end up with. Coming up.</p><p>KENNEDY: Third-party candidates, we had such high hope for you but they really didn't do well last month. That doesn't mean the current two-party system should continue to dominate and could've been doing more harm than good.</p><p>Well, according to a recent Gallup poll, 57 percent of Americans think a major third party should exist, only 37 percent believe Republicans and Democrats are handling the country well.</p><p>So what is wrong with a two-party system? And more importantly, how can we possibly fix it? Here now, it's Terry Michael, director of the Washington Center for Politics and Journalism. He's also a reason.com contributor. Terry, welcome.</p><p>TERRY MICHAEL, DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON CENTER FOR POLITICS AND JOURNALISM: Thank you very much.</p><p>KENNEDY: So you have sort of laid it out in different categories, the various branches of the two parties. And in the Republican party, say there are Wall Street conservatives, social cons, neocons, economic libertarians and the white nationalist alt-right. Where would you put <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in those categories?</p><p>MICHAEL: Well, he's really not a party person. It's kind of hard to position him any place in the Republican party. In fact, that's why a lot of Republicans have a lot of problems with him. They don't know what he is. He's not a conservative, he's not a Republican.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. So you consider yourself to be Libertarian-Democrat. And, you know, I think there are all sorts of new and interesting distinctions now. Last time, we talked about a post-ideological world that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is inhabiting and creating for himself. I mean, couldn't you argue that he is in essence the first third party president we've had?</p><p>MICHAEL: Well, he really is cannot be positioned on an ideological continuum, on a political party continuum. He's extremely independent. He doesn't really have a core of beliefs. You can't position him any place.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. But is that problematic? And do you have to have a core set of beliefs? Is that necessary for having a viable third party?</p><p>MICHAEL: No. I think those are separate questions. I think to have a third party, there has to be some sort of a reason for the third party to exist. It has to elect people to various offices. I don't really think he's interested in being a third party. I think he's just interested in being <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>KENNEDY: All right. So let's talk about the third party a little bit because you've sort of sliced and diced the two main parties that we have. And I know you have an issue with those. You are a former Democratic National Committee spokesperson, so you've seen the party system from the inside out and it has left you disillusioned.</p><p>What do you think a third party in this country looks like, is it more progressive, is it more Libertarian, is it some weird moderate mash-up where a lot of the parties meet? What do you see?</p><p>MICHAEL: Well, I think it really is much more Libertarian. I think right now, the Democratic party is almost two-thirds of the way there. The Democrats are left on the social (inaudible) issues, they're left on foreign policy issues but very retro on economic issues.</p><p>The Republican party is conservative on social issues, conservative on foreign policy, at least the neocons are. And they talk a good game on free markets but really are crony capitalists. So neither party is a good fit for people with Libertarian ideas. But I think that the upcoming generation that's going to decide the balance of power of politics, the millennials, want choices. The don't want one size, fits all government in a one --</p><p>KENNEDY: I agree. And that maybe one of the best legacies we have from millennials. But you had a high profile Libertarian person running for president who only got three percent of the vote. And he tried to position himself and his ticket as being the most enticing option of all the people running for president and it just didn't get any traction. What does a Libertarian-tinge third party have to look like in order to attract more people?</p><p>MICHAEL: Well, first of all, it has to be looked at. The American people have to see the third party and our mainstream media didn't allow that. They basically said this is a duopoly situation. That's why I call myself a Libertarian-Democratic. I want to insinuate Libertarian ideas into the Democratic party because it's very hard for a third party to be heard in our media politics.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. Well, you know, I don't see the Democratic party being as Libertarian as you do. I think, you know, in some respect, that's wishful thinking.</p><p>I think a lot of people who are in power right now, particularly in the senate, the senate Democrats, are incredibly pro-government and controlling and they would do whatever they can to increase the size and scope of government and control our lives but I do think it's worth continuing this discussion to see how we can finally end up with more choices in this country. Thank you so much for being here, Terry, appreciate it.</p><p>MICHAEL: Thank you.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right, very good. Coming up, there's a secret to hyper flexibility, drinking three to five ounces of ketchup a day. God, I hope so. Find out how this guy got to be so bended (ph), `Topical Storm' is next.</p><p>KENNEDY: Like a jet-fueled Christmas sled on a field of neon snow. This is the `Topical storm' topic number one.</p><p>I believe it was Socrates who said flexibility is next to godliness. He was a bit of a dirty-old man. I like the hemlock (ph). But if he's correct, this guy is about to join the pantheon of gods and sip Ambrosia with them.</p><p>Sweet lord in heaven. That is some limberness. My garden. Usually to get that rubbery (ph), you need a surgeon to remove one of ribs. That's a legend (ph) (inaudible), sure did. Or spend a decade training for a Guatemalan freak show.</p><p>That's got to hurt the tweaking (ph) berries. I bet that guy can squeeze through a rusty keyhole. No, that's not a euphemism. Man, how is he not yet in Cirque du Soleil?</p><p>If you want to get that supple, you need to start doing yoga, pronto, like this gal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe the straight legs a bit more of a challenge. I'm just thinking about the (inaudible) --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: It broke the glass table and scared the cats and the woman bled to death and the cat slap (ph) up her blood (ph) like it was strawberry milk. Topic number two.</p><p>It's not enough for robots to take our awesome manufacturing jobs and sleep with our women. Now they're trying to replace our insects. Well, they stop at nothing.</p><p>Look at that. Meet Salto (ph), a wee tiny robot who can jump at a rate of nearly six feet a second. Weighs a little over three ounces. So skinny, you guys.</p><p>Its builders modeled it after the African bush baby or Galago. Like the idea of using its versatility and tiny size to help locate survivors after buildings collapse.</p><p>You're few years behind if you ask me. Amateur inventor Simone Giertz built the far superior robot using only her iPhone.</p><p>Those are like peanut gels. It makes me hungry for five guys. That iPhone is an international hero. Take that Tim Cook. Man, why that would be a burn? Topic number three.</p><p>OK. I have a riddle for you. How can a white ball make a blue ball? No, not by visiting me on my honeymoon. The answer is, by using a tree. Watch.</p><p>Yes, lining up the shot. It swing. Hit the tree and -- oh, no, Jeremy. You got to get out of the way, buddy. Look at that. Jeremy. Why weren't you wearing a cap that day, son, like cameo (ph). That rogue (inaudible) just obliterated six generations of would-be children.</p><p>Gentlemen, you might feel a little uncomfortable right now and there's good reason for that. Take it away science.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As an innocent bystander, you may flinch or even have phantom reactions even if you're not the victim. It is believed to be a result of mirror neurons which are thought to trigger minor reactions to others' pain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Topic four. Do you wear your seat belt when you're in the car? Well, guess what, Libertarians actually torn on this issue. Some feel it is not the governments' role to tell them when to be safe. Others say there's an update that show that seat belts do more harm than good and unnecessarily restrain us. I think this guy would fall into the ladder (ph) camp. Check out our lucky bastard of the day.</p><p>He's in China. His car tire exploded -- truck tire rather. Had he left out of the car when the wave his truck luckily jack and unstrap -- wait, what? No. He was very muscular, he unstrap himself from the vehicle that was careening off a cliff and he was able to leap out of that tethering death mask (ph) before it sent him crashing to his certain death.</p><p>Wait, where was he again?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: China. China. It's pronounced Jina (ph).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: Who knew. Fun. Topic number five.</p><p>Are you missing Christmas lights especially outside? Well, it solve the problem, might be squirrels, not hobos. Check out this devious squirrel, pilfering bulbs like crazy. Yes, watch. He just nibbles through the wires and then, whoa, grab the bulb, leaps into a nearby tree and he's off. There he goes. Like a Galago.</p><p>According to bulb's human owner, Mr. Squirrel stolen over 150 outdoor Christmas bulbs in just 24 hours. Now, does the little guy think our deco acorns or is the squirrel just (inaudible) his soon-to-be brightly liten nest. Let's see.</p><p>It's the squirrel griswold (ph). it's a Christmas miracle.

He's gone.Volodmyr Zelensky is in power along with Zelensky's political party which won close to a clear majority in Verkovna Rada elections recently. Zelensky's Servent of the People party won 253 seats out of 450[2], giving him not only the presidency but no need to build a coalition government with smaller parties of known foreign-controlled players, like Yulia Tymoshenko (Fatherland) or from Poroshenko's party itself, European Solidarity.Source: WikipediaThis was the biggest fear coming into these elections. Ukraine's system is mixed using both proportional allocation (225 seats) and majoritarian allocation (225). Zelensky has a mandate now to begin the process of tearing down the barriers to sanity Poroshenko left in his wake. </p><p>The big one being, of course, the war against separatists in the Donbass. For the first few months of his presidency Zelensky has sent mixed signals as to what he intends to do on the world stage. He's offered to meet with Putin, who then asked saliently, 'to what end?' He's tried to pull back on the conflict only to see theshelling continue and, at times, intensify[3]. Zelensky is dealing with the same kind of bureaucratic revolt against change that Donald Trump has dealt with. In fact, it's thesame people running the both shows[4]. If there was one thing that has become glaringly obvious over the past three years it is that the coup attempt by the bureaucracy against Trump it is that much of it was cooked up in Ukraine under the dutiful eye of former President Poroshenko. With Poroshenko out of the way, there is still the inertia of those he put in important positions. Ukraine is practically a failed state so don't expect good news. If anything it's become a playground for outside forces to start more fires as Zelensky tries to stamp out the ones currently burning. All of these fires have one goal in mind, keep Ukraine and Russia separated and in conflict. This is being directed by both U.S. and British interests, if the Steele Dossier tells us anything. That is the way these things go. But, that said, what Zelensky can have control over are the big issues setting Russia and Ukraine at odds. Obviously the Donbass is the big one. But what's really pressing is the gas supply contract between Gazprom and Naftogaz. It's due to expire in December.I've written extensively about the machinations surrounding this and it's worth your review.[5] The U.S. is trying to run out the clock on these negotiations by slowing down completion of Nordstream 2 and put Gazprom in the position of not supplying its written contracts with Europe. If Nordstream 2 can't deliver and there is no supply agreement with Naftogaz then Gazprom can't deliver contracted gas for the first time ever. So I found it very interesting thatZelensky is now openly asking for talks with Gazprom and Naftogaz about the supply contract[6]. This is not a difficult deal to get done. But, it has some outstanding issues. From TASS: After securing control over the Verkhovna Rada, the team of Vladimir Zelensky indicated that it is ready for new gas negotiations with Russia.According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta's experts, Kiev's decisiveness is explained by the pressure from the European Union and Ukraine's interest in receiving transit revenues from Russia. Meanwhile, the real chances of a new transit agreement have grown, the newspaper wrote. Ukrtransgas has not paid for services since March and its debts threaten the company's stability and question the reliability of its supplies, the European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET) said. But none of these issues will be difficult to resolve. Poroshenko left Ukraine at the mercy of Putin and Gazprom because they need the gas and the transit fees while Russia has Nordstream 2 and Turkstream coming on line next year.

At the end of the day, however, Putin and Gazprom will negotiate a deal quickly that will pay Ukraine based on market demand for that gas to satisfy European regulators allaying worries over Ukraine's finances. Europe has made it clear it is no longer interested in paying for its failed Ukrainian project.Europe's gas demand is rising so quickly that there will be room for everyone in the market. The only thing holding up completion of Nordstream 2 is a final permit from Denmark, which Gazprom expects to finally receive in October. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller is not sanguine about the prospects of a deal as there are outstanding court cases involved, but the long-term political dividends of signing some kind of deal, even an extension of the existing one pending a more thorough overhaul, would be immense. Getting that problem solved would build trust between Putin and Zelensky and could lead to unwinding the problems downstream of 2014's U.S. sponsored coup against Viktor Yanukovich. There are so many forces arrayed within the U.S., UK, northern European and Israeli governments against reconciliation between Ukraine and Russia that it will be difficult for Zelensky and Putin to achieve much. Europe's new leadership, under Ursula von der Leyen, will be more confrontational with Russia while the jury is out on Boris Johnson's new UK government and whether he can even remain in power for long. But it is clear that the people of Europe are tired of these games and want change. The Ukrainian elections are proof of this. And that, by itself, is something worth cheering.Join my Patreon[7]if you agree shadow governments are a blight on humanity.Install Brave[8]to help break the control by big tech and its friends in big government.Liked it?

The reflex reaction to the infodemic of COVID-19-related fakes - from bogus garlic-based cures to toxic 5G conspiracies - is to deploy vast armies of enforcers online and requisition infinite data sets from platforms, and to hope it works better this time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The instinct of regulators and policymakers worldwide to hold large platforms like Facebook and Google to account for their role in the proliferation of online disinformation is right. But the temptation to focus on quick fixes poses stark risks.\u00a0 With the necessary political will, better solutions exist on national, EU and international levels that will help rein in the epidemic of disinformation that is sweeping away trust in established facts, in scientific method and in democratic institutions designed to protect us.</p><p>The European Commission's recent Joint Communication on how to tackle COVID-19 disinformation is a perfect example of the problem. It bears strong resemblances to Brussels' largely unsuccessful efforts two years ago to tackle disinformation. The EU, emerging from lockdown, is starting the long hard sprint to keystone regulatory proposals due at the end of the year.\u00a0 But it has set off in the wrong direction.</p><p>The Commission's strategy, created in 2018, instituted a voluntary code of conduct by the platforms, relying on them to counter the surge in disinformation and fake news. It focused on content moderation and platform transparency via the handover of data and allocated resources to pro-EU messaging. But disinformation has continued to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/encrypted-messaging-apps-are-the-future-of-propaganda/\">adapt, proliferate</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21254184/how-plandemic-went-viral-facebook-youtube\">confound enforcers</url>. Even if the big platforms had complied fully with the spirit of that initiative - and the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_19_6166\">Commission</url> itself rebuked them for failing to do so - it still wouldn't be enough.</p><p>To demand that Facebook increases its army of fact-checkers and Youtube stops recommending conspiracy theories, and to promise to pursue Chinese and Russian trolls, makes good headlines. But in the multi-faceted world of disinformation, a narrow focus on foreign actors leaves us exposed while a pro-EU PR campaign risks simply adding white noise. And Facebook and Google cannot delete their way out of this problem. Moderation and fact-checking can only ever achieve so much given the speed and sophistication with which disinformation travels and the ever-changing platforms used to circulate it. News consumption is increasingly visual and increasingly private. Young people in particular <url normalizedValue=\"https://lie-detectors.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/JournalistsFindings_final.pdf\">shun regularly moderated spaces</url> such as Facebook and Twitter in favour of the likes of WhatsApp, Instagram, Youtube, TikTok, Twitch and even gaming platforms. So whatever information the big platforms hand over, academic study of large but shallow data dumps will always risk lagging behind what is happening online.</p><p>Instead, policymakers should take on the attention economy on two fronts: the supply side and the demand side.\u00a0 Tackling the supply-side - addressing content liability and particularly the \"monetising of lies\" as the European Commission has called it - would aim to disrupt the model of dominant market players stoking outrage for revenue. The Commission's COVID strategy asks platforms to come up with their own plan on this, but that risks yet more years passing with no action. Following the money and applying antitrust principles as they develop is a more certain avenue to ensuring this happens. The media industry too, as it has in Australia, needs to be prepared to challenge the platforms in disseminating news.</p><p>An obvious vehicle will be this year's upcoming EU digital services legislation. Let us be clear: this is fruit at the very top of the tree. It will hurt platforms' bottom line and be hard to get past their legal and lobbying muscle.\u00a0 But a fully comprehensive anti-disinformation strategy must at least attempt to reform the outrage industry at source.</p><p>In any case, whatever regulators do on the supply side must be met by at least as much attention on the demand side - the active consumption and sharing of harmful and fake content. Citizens must be equipped with critical media literacy skills to enable them to recognise and resist manipulative content.</p><p>Our work aims to build such resilience in Europe by sending journalists into schools - using videoconferencing during the pandemic - to educate schoolchildren and their teachers, and we are planning a project with senior citizens. Many students we meet have a natural grasp of the dynamics of online information. In these days of pandemic, interest\u00a0 in learning critical skills to tell apart facts, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencepresse.qc.ca/actualite/2019/12/17/pisa-test-differentiating-fact-opinion-key-challenge\">opinions</url> and lies is particularly intense - among both the students and their teachers. Did Putin really release lions in Moscow to enforce lockdown, as shown in a Facebook photo now circulating on TikTok? Can I cure myself with bleach? These are questions that students line up to ask journalists via videoconference. There is also a keen interest in the motives behind disinformation. \"Why would this unnamed nurse send me a WhatsApp chain letter if it's not true?\" or \"How do I know whether a fact-checker is truthful?\" What interests children eventually interests teachers and time must be spent capturing this momentum. Equally, older people in care homes are particularly susceptible to disinformation about COVID - fake news that could cost lives.</p><p>This is long-term work to address a long-term problem. Given current momentum, policymakers will be thanked for taking sustainable action. And this needs to be expanded into nationwide - in fact Europe-wide - changes to the education system. Critical media literacy needs to be integrated into school curricula, OECD school rankings gauges and teacher training curricula, and it must remain strictly independent from political and commercial interests. Platforms may have funds for corporate social responsibility,\u00a0 but the education that safeguards our democracy is too important a responsibility to be outsourced to profit-driven companies.</p><p>The EU needs a course correction in its approach to disinformation and fake news. The repetition of mistakes it made in the past risks both squandering political energy and capital, and driving democratic institutions further into a supplicant relationship to Big Tech. Deleting and data dumps will only take us so far. Combating fake news means trying to disrupt the industry and educating its consumers. There is still time for the Commission to increase its ambition. But it needs to start now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1479819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605B-VDH1-DYXB-V2DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1113\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Google, the top search engine on the Internet, charges nothing either, and e-retailer Amazon grew to its huge size by charging less for its wares than many brick-and-mortar companies.But that won't be enough to stop Congress from turning a scrutinizing eye on these icons of American innovation. Lawmakers grilled Mark Zuckerberg, the multibillionaire founder of Facebook, in two high-profile Capitol Hill hearings last week. That was mostly about privacy, although antitrust concerns were raised. And lawmakers, the Trump administration, and free-market advocates who see the power of the tech giants are increasingly considering moves on that front.Such advocates, including the so-called hipster antitrust movement who want to break up the companies, don\u2019t cite the companies' mammoth size as the driving reason to break them up, even though Google\u2019s $718 billion market value makes it the largest publicly traded company in the U.S., and Amazon and Facebook are comfortably in the top 10.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Related: Bernie Sanders: Trump is right, Amazon has gotten too big]</emphasis>For the Open Markets Institute, which is fighting what it views as a growing trend toward monopolization in corporate America, the critical question is the tech giants' control of platforms that give them a powerful advantage over business customers who are, at times, competitors. Facebook\u2019s social media apps and Amazon\u2019s e-commerce site are prime examples.\u201cWe identify that as a conflict of interest,\u201d said Kevin Carty, a researcher with the Open Markets Institute. \u201cThese tech companies own the platform at the same time that they have an interest\" in beating competitors who also use that platform.Addressing such issues may mean a change in how America defines anticompetitive behavior, an issue at the heart of laws intended to ensure that the country\u2019s capitalist economy continues to run smoothly for the benefit of consumers. Such changes could well reverberate in industries far beyond technology and carry consequences of their own, especially as the Justice Department under President Trump moves to block problematic mergers rather than approve them with complicated restrictions on business dealings that are difficult to enforce.  Winning at MonopolyThe agency's antitrust division in recent years \"has investigated a number of behavioral decree violations, but has found it onerous to collect information or satisfy the exacting standards of proving contempt and seeking relief,\" said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who heads the unit. \"We have a limited window into the day-to-day operations of business, and it is difficult to monitor and enforce granular commitments like nondiscrimination and information firewalls.\"Gauging the potential effects such shifts requires an understanding of the pivotal role that competition plays in market capitalism, ensuring that buyers are provided with the best possible goods at the lowest prices and that the producers who deliver them are rewarded.Theoretically, as a competitive market\u2019s efficiency increases, marginal revenue (the extra income from selling an additional item) will gradually be balanced out by the extra cost of producing that item.Anticompetitive actions, whether by a group of companies forming a trust in which they agree to keep prices high, or by a single company cornering a market so it has a monopoly, impede that system, and ultimately harm consumers.Children learn this in the Monopoly board game, in which players compete to buy property groups, each of which typically has two or three components.Owning one property allows a player to charge rent when rivals land on it. Owning an entire group allows a player to double the rate, since he or she now has a monopoly on that neighborhood, as well as add houses and hotels that can push the costs up even more.Antitrust rules that have been put in place by Congress over more than a century to prevent such anticompetitive behavior in the real world are all about economics, said George Cary, a Washington, D.C., partner at Cleary Gottlieb.Formerly deputy director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s competition bureau, Cary represented the agency in its successful challenge to the merger of Staples and Office Depot in 1997. At Cleary Gottlieb, he helped chemical firms Dow and DuPont win approval for a $130 billion all-stock combination of equals, completed in 2017.AT&amp;T's Time Warner dealCoverStory AntitrustSince the 1970s, such mergers have been viewed as anticompetitive by the federal government when they allow a company to control so much output that it can create artificial scarcity and force up prices, Cary explained at an American Constitution Society forum on antitrust laws.\u201cA lot of people were surprised that the Trump administration challenged\u201d AT&amp;T\u2019s proposed takeover of Time Warner, he noted, but the issues it considered in making that decision had been the same as those that spurred the government to act in previous decades.The administration is arguing in a trial that began in mid-March that the $108 billion deal would hurt competition, forcing consumers to pay more while slowing innovation in video programming and delivery.AT&amp;T, widely known for its landline and cellular telephone services, had already become the largest pay-television provider with its $67 billion purchase of satellite-service provider DIRECTV in 2015.Adding Time Warner, which owns channels from HBO to CNN, would allow AT&amp;T to charge its distribution rivals more for content such as HBO\u2019s popular \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d series and college basketball\u2019s March Madness, and also to slow down a shift toward so-called over-the-top video streaming, which can be less expensive than traditional cable television and facilitates \u201ccord-cutting\u201d by consumers.It\u2019s a classic example of a vertical merger, one in which a company buys another firm at a different point in the supply chain \u2014 think of an automaker buying a tire producer, for instance \u2014 rather than a horizontal merger, in which a business grows by acquiring a direct rival.The risk posed by horizontal deals has often been gauged by the dominance of the combined company's market share. While there is no \"crisp black-and-white line,\" controlling less than 30 percent is likely to be safe, while 50 percent or more invites considerable scrutiny, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington.Vertical integrationCongress has specified, however, that both horizontal and vertical mergers can violate antitrust law, the latter because it allows a company to control distribution of a component that its competitors need.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Related: Trump 'obsessed' with regulating Amazon, wants to use antitrust laws: Report]</emphasis>After buying Time Warner, AT&amp;T \u201cwould likely use Turner\u2019s important programming to hinder\u201d competitors including video-streaming services, the Justice Department said in its suit, filed in federal court in D.C., seeking to block the deal.\u201cThe merged firm would have the incentive and ability to charge more for Turner\u2019s popular networks and take other actions to impede entrants that might otherwise threaten the merged firm\u2019s high-profit, big-bundle, traditional pay-TV model,\u201d the agency said.That kind of vertical integration has also posed concerns about Big Tech. Google\u2019s $12.5 billion purchase of mobile phone maker Motorola Mobility, which it sold two years later, is one example. Another is Amazon\u2019s purchase of grocery chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion last year, a move that sent shudders through the grocery industry.At Facebook, meanwhile, takeovers of more direct competitors, such as photo-sharing service Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and mobile-messaging company WhatsApp for $16 billion in 2014, have given the social media giant monopoly-like power, Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern Business School, wrote in Esquire magazine\u2019s March issue.Facebook, along with Apple, Google parent Alphabet, and Amazon, should be forced to break up, he wrote, even though they haven\u2019t \u201cused their power to do the one thing that most economists would describe as the whole point of assembling a monopoly, which is to raise prices for consumers.\u201dInstead, the companies have exploited America\u2019s traditional antipathy toward big government successfully enough that they\u2019ve \u201cled most of us to forget that competition \u2014 no less than private property, wage labor, voluntary exchange, and a price system \u2014 is one of the indispensable cylinders of the capitalist engine,\u201d Galloway wrote.Tech titansCoverStory Companies\u201cTheir massive size and unchecked power have throttled competitive markets and kept the economy from doing its job \u2014 namely, to promote a vibrant middle class,\u201d he wrote. Galloway, author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Four</emphasis>, a book on the rise of the four tech giants, didn\u2019t return messages seeking comment.That the four titans received comparatively little scrutiny while amassing their present market heft illustrates the importance that has been given until now to the single issue of price when it comes to interpretations of antitrust law.\u201cOne of the big shifts in the past few decades was that we decided that the single goal of antitrust should be to promote consumer welfare,\u201d said Linda Khan, director of legal policy with the Open Markets Institute. \u201cIn practice, that has meant that enforcers look at short-term price effects and short-term outcome effects.\u201dOnly fairly recently in the history of American capitalism did price and consumer welfare become the key issues for deciding whether corporate behavior was market-friendly or anti-competitive. Consumer welfare traces its primacy to the late 1970s and Robert Bork, the antitrust scholar and Reagan-era Supreme Court nominee.But such a narrow focus can miss anticompetitive behavior that, for instance, operates not to raise prices but to quash potential rivals or stifle innovation, as the Trump administration says would happen if the AT&amp;T merger with Time Warner were allowed.Supreme Court interpretations of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1911, when the law was only two decades old, applied a \u201crule of reason\u201d standard that held that the law barred any practices that imposed \u201can unreasonable or undue restraint\u201d on trade.One of those interpretations led to the breakup of Standard Oil Trust, the energy giant founded by John D. Rockefeller, that justices determined had worked with dozens of oil producers to inflate prices.'Unreasonable' behaviorStill, Justice Louis Brandeis acknowledged in a 1912 speech to the Economic Club of New York that the standard left considerable uncertainty about what behaviors, specifically, were unreasonable, an ambiguity that would be left to future generations of lawyers to clarify.Brandeis listed several anticompetitive tactics that had been used in his era to achieve monopolistic control. Among them were cutthroat competition, espionage, false claims of corporate independence, and the signing of exclusive contracts.Those practices were \u201cpursued not for the purpose of conducting a business in competition with others, but for the purpose of killing competitors,\u201d he said.\u201cWe learned long ago that liberty could be preserved only by limiting in some way the freedom of action of individuals; that otherwise, liberty would necessarily yield to absolutism,\u201d Brandeis said. \u201cIn the same way, we have learned that unless there be regulation of competition, its excesses will lead to the destruction of competition, and monopoly will take its place.\u201dThat\u2019s precisely the risk posed by today\u2019s tech giants, said Open Markets\u2019 Carty. By selling its own wares on a platform that it controls, Amazon is competing with other retailers paying it to market their products on the site, he said.Amazon\u2019s market share is so big that it\u2019s able to force its suppliers to offer prices low enough to undercut their own profits, Carty said. \u201cThe clearest example is book publishers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of the canary in the coal mine.\u201dOnce Amazon had sufficient scale, it insisted on paying book publishers less, \u201ca tactic we expect Amazon to use in a lot of other businesses,\u201d Carty added.News media and musiciansGoogle\u2019s search engine, meanwhile, has given the Mountain View, Calif.-based company a decisive advantage in the advertising market, pulling money away from traditional media firms that depend on the search engine to reach prospective readers and viewers.Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook not only enjoys an edge in advertising, but also controls how media firms\u2019 content is distributed on its platform, a tool that many use to promote print and video.\u201cNews organizations, musicians, and others have to really rely on this large platform owned by Facebook,\u201d Carty said, \u201cand Facebook is running that in favor of its own products as much as possible.\u201dWhile breaking up the firms, as Galloway proposes, is an obvious method of addressing such concerns, it\u2019s not the only one. And Carty says it isn't necessarily the best one either.The U.S. has a long history of antitrust policy that has employed a variety of different remedies to address the problem of concentrated economic power, he said.In the early 1900s, for instance, AT&amp;T, then known as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, reached an agreement with the U.S. government, which had deemed it a monopoly, to forestall further legal action by selling the Western Union telegraph company, a former rival it had acquired.That deal, known as the Kingsbury Commitment for its architect, Nathan Kingsbury, transformed AT&amp;T into, primarily, a telephone company providing local and long-distance landline service.Six more decades would pass before the company struck another deal with the government, divesting its local Bell telephone subsidiaries, which would become independent companies while the parent continued to provide long-distance service.Other remedies include the Obama administration\u2019s practice of consent decrees with companies proposing mergers, requiring guarantees that they will avoid anticompetitive behavior.In 2011, for example, the Justice Department allowed the initial stage of a merger between cable-provider Comcast and entertainment company NBC Universal to move forward conditioned on the venture continuing to provide programming licenses to Comcast competitors.Live Nation's market edgeThe Justice Department under Jeff Sessions, which favors structural remedies instead, is now reviewing the success or failure of efforts by the Obama Justice Department to control behavior with consent decrees.An example is its approval of a merger of concert promoter Live Nation and ticket vendor Ticketmaster in 2010 which, according to the New York Times, the Justice Department has begun to investigate anew. Anschutz Entertainment Group, or AEG, the second-largest U.S. concert promoter, has told Justice that some venues have been threatened with the loss of valuable shows if they don't use Ticketmaster, the Times said. (AEG is controlled by Philip Anschutz, proprietor of the<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Examiner</emphasis>.)The Obama-era approach was \u201cfundamentally regulatory,\u201d Delrahim, the antitrust chief at Justice, said at an American Bar Association forum last fall.He described it as \u201cimposing ongoing government oversight on what should preferably be a free market.\u201d The newer strategy, by contrast, conforms with Trump\u2019s effort to curb unnecessary regulation, which the president views as hindering economic growth.The structural measures it favors would have been appropriate with Facebook\u2019s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods deal, Carty suggested. Requiring spinoffs now could achieve a similar result.Other measures to boost competition might include minimizing the data that Facebook is allowed to collect from users in order to target ads, or enacting laws that mandate portability for messaging network users, much as Congress did for medical providers in the early 2000s.Very harsh remedyIf Twitter or Facebook users could move their whole networks to a different platform, seamlessly, neither platform would have its dominance guaranteed. And the government wouldn\u2019t need day-to-day oversight of the platforms.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re even close to any kind of case that any of these companies need to be broken up,\" said Balto, the antitrust lawyer. \u201cDivestiture is a very, very harsh remedy and used extremely rarely in antitrust cases.\u201dForcing one of the Big Tech firms to break itself up or even sell a subsidiary, might be construed as penalizing success, he argued. \u201cWe don\u2019t really want to say, \u2018You can grow up, but you can only grow so large or otherwise, we\u2019re going to punish you,'\u201d Balto said. \u201cWe\u2019re just light-years away from any kind of real case here that the size of these companies harms competition or that there\u2019s a need to break them up or limit their size.\u201dStill, antitrust enforcement in its broadest sense is inherently deregulatory, argues Delrahim, citing a Depression-era predecessor who described its purpose as \u201can effort to avoid detailed government regulation of business by keeping competition in control of prices.\u201dDelrahim himself envisions continued emphasis on what Bork, the Yale University antitrust scholar and author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Antitrust Paradox</emphasis>, described as \u201cthe single goal of consumer welfare in the interpretation of antitrust laws.\u201dWhile there\u2019s a debate about whether the concept of consumer welfare could be expanded to cover metrics beyond price, that remains the easiest to measure, so it\u2019s what law enforcement tends to look at, Khan said.\u201cWe\u2019ve adopted consumer welfare as a proxy for what competition is, but it fails to actually capture what competitive markets look like,\u201d she said.'Doesn't feel that way'A bill proposed by Rep. Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat, would address that by requiring the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to undertake retrospective studies of how mergers affect not only prices but also jobs, wages, and local economies.It\u2019s backed by the Congressional Antitrust Caucus, formed by Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat and cosponsor.The caucus isn\u2019t attempting to take a sledgehammer, big-is-bad approach, Khanna explained, acknowledging concerns like those of Consumer Technology Association President Gary Shapiro, who says tech companies' size reflects the ubiquity of the Internet in modern life.\"An overly-interventionist position, which seeks to punish companies for their size rather than for their actual offenses, can impede our economic growth and reduce incentives for risk, creativity and entrepreneurialism,\" Shapiro wrote in a blog post assessing the Trump administration's nominees to lead the Federal Trade Commission. \"More, it would hurt our national competitiveness. \"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, pushed back against Sen. Lindsey Graham's suggestion in last week's hearing that the size of his company makes it a monopoly.\"It certainly doesn't feel that way to me,\" he said, citing firms such as Google and Apple that provide services similar to some of Facebook's. \"We have a lot of competitors.\"While voters have become frustrated, as shown in the 2016 election, with giant corporations they believe disregard their interests and a government they view as co-opted by business, Khanna said it\u2019s still important to address such issues carefully.\u201cWhat we need to do is ask, \u2018How do we encourage competition in ways that are thoughtful?\u201d he said. It\u2019s possible that Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram, for instance, shouldn\u2019t have been approved, but that would have come with risks of its own.When regulators reject a deal like that, he said, \u201cyou provide a disincentive for startups to get funded,\u201d since investors often do so with the hope that a startup will eventually be taken over, giving them a sizable return.\u201cLots of the discussion isn\u2019t, in my view, nuanced enough,\u201d Khanna said, and reflexively deciding that size is undesirable isn\u2019t \u201cgoing to come to the right policy.\u201d</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2026413330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4G-B7K1-JBHT-D0Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3372\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Rockefeller, and William H. \"the public be damned\" Vanderbilt.</p><p>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Image Credit: Ramachandra Babu/Gulf News &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p>The answer then was to bust up the railroad, oil and steel monopolies.</p><p>We're now in a second Gilded Age, ushered in by semiconductors, software and the internet, which has spawned a handful of hi-tech behemoths and a new set of barons like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, and Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google.</p><p>The answer is the same as it was before: bust up the monopolies.</p><p>The current effort is bipartisan. At a Senate hearing I attended last week, the arch-conservative Missouri Republican Josh Hawley asked me, rhetorically: \"Is there really any wonder that there is increased pressure for antitrust enforcement activity, for privacy activity when these companies behave in the way that they do?\"</p><p>Hawley added: \"Every day brings some creepy new revelation about these companies' behaviours. Of course the public is going to want there to be action to defend their rights. It's only natural.\"</p><p>Nearly 90 per cent of all internet searches now go through Google. Facebook and Google together account for 58 per cent of all digital ads, which is where most ad money goes these days.</p><p>They're also the first stops for many Americans seeking news (93 per cent receive news online), and Amazon is now the first stop for a third of all American consumers seeking to buy anything.</p><p>Unimaginable power</p><p>With such size comes the power to stifle innovation. Amazon won't let any business that sells through it sell any item at a lower price anywhere else. It's even using its control over book sales to give books it publishes priority over rival publishers.</p><p>Google uses the world's most widely used search engine to promote its own services and content over those of competitors. Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram killed off two potential competitors.</p><p>Contrary to the conventional view of America as a hotbed of entrepreneurship, according to the Census Bureau, the rate at which new job-creating businesses have formed in the US has halved since 2004.</p><p>Size also confers political power. Amazon \u2014 the richest corporation in America \u2014 paid nothing in federal taxes last year. Meanwhile, it is holding an auction to extort billions from states and cities eager to host its second headquarters.</p><p>It also forced Seattle, its home city, to back down on a plan to tax big corporations like itself to pay for homeless shelters for a growing population that cannot afford sky-high rents caused in part by Amazon.</p><p>Facebook withheld evidence of Russian activity on its platform far longer than had been disclosed. When the news came to light, it employed an opposition research firm to discredit critics.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who holds the world speed record for falling from one of the most admired figures to one of the most reviled, just unveiled a plan to \"encrypt\" personal information from all his platforms.</p><p>The plan is likely to give Facebook even more comprehensive data about everyone. If you believe it will better guard privacy, you don't remember Zuckerberg's last seven promises to do that.</p><p>The New America Foundation, an influential thinktank Google helped fund, fired researchers who were urging antitrust officials to take on the company. And Google has been quietly financing hundreds of professors to write research papers justifying Google's market dominance.</p><p>Regulate or break them up?</p><p>What to do? Some argue the tech mammoths should be regulated like utilities or common carriers, but this would put government in the impossible position of policing content and overseeing products and services. A better alternative is to break them up. That way, information would be distributed through a large number of independent channels without a centralised platform giving all content apparent legitimacy and extraordinary reach. And more start-ups could flourish.</p><p>Like the robber barons of the first Gilded Age, those of the second have amassed fortunes that gave them unparalleled influence over politicians and the economy. The combined wealth of Zuckerberg ($62.3 billion), Bezos ($131 billion), Brin ($49.8 billion) and Page ($50.8 billion) is larger than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the American population.</p><p>A wealth tax, also proposed by Warren, would help.</p><p>Some of the robber barons of the first Gilded Age were generous philanthropists, as are those of today. That didn't excuse the damage they did to America. Monopolies aren't good for anyone except for the monopolists. In this new Gilded Age, we need to respond as forcefully as we did the first time around.

Third-quarter lobbying reports released in the past week show Google, Facebook and Amazon spent a combined $12.6 million on lobbying from the beginning of July to the end of October.</p><p>Google spent $5.2 million on lobbying last quarter, a nine percent increase over last year. That included paying 24 different firms to lobby on Capitol Hill, and deploying another 10 of its own in-house lobbyists to engage Congress on everything from human trafficking to tax reform to \"small business advertising issues.\" Facebook lobbying is up 41 percent over last year's third quarter. Amazon spent $3.4 million, more than it has ever spent in a single quarter on lobbying, (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/10/23/amazon-facebook-and-google-beef-up-lobbying-spending/?utm_term=.1c69cb2337e2\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/10/23/amazon-facebook-and-google-beef-up-lobbying-spending/?utm_term=.1c69cb2337e2</url>) according to the Washington Post.</p><p>Those figures might not represent a huge amount of money compared to the value of those companies, but they do represent a large outlay relative to what companies and trade groups regularly spend on influencing Washington. The top three spenders on lobbying in the U.S. last year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Realtors and Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent a similar amount last quarter: a combined total of $15 million.</p><p>Silicon Valley has long been associated with a libertarian ethos, a spirit that has been reciprocated by a laissez faire attitude from the nation's lawmakers.

Published last month, the book is a polemic against the concentrated power of Big Tech generally, and Facebook, Google and Amazon specifically. International Business Times talked to Foer Monday about Silicon Valley's influence in Washington, our outdated antitrust laws and the need to resurrect the anti-monopoly tradition in American politics.</p><p>The following interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.\u00a0</p><p>What scares you about Silicon Valley?</p><p>They have so insinuated themselves in our lives, in our markets and in our democracy. They have this tremendous power to pick winners and pick losers. Whatever they deem to be important is the thing that surfaces at the top of their feeds and search results, at the top of their store. We've always had tools, and technology has always been one of the things that defines us as human beings. But when we merge with these machines, we're merging with a different type of machine. These are intellectual machines that kind of shape our reality. We'll soon be inhabiting their virtual realities. And the problem is we aren't just merging with machines, we're merging with the companies that run those machines.</p><p>What should be done?</p><p>I think the broad thing that I would like to see is some sort of comprehensive data protection law. So much of the competitive advantage of these companies rests on their ability to amass more data than their competitors. And the fact that Facebook has so much data, and Google has so much data, it helps give them their lock over the advertising business.</p><p>We have a grand anti-monopoly tradition in our country. And we haven't updated it to take into account these companies. But there is such a long, important tradition in trying to limit the power of companies within the communications and information realm.</p><p>How are the big Silicon Valley companies monopolies, and how have they managed to escape antitrust action?</p><p>Well, first of all there's nothing illegal with being a monopoly in our country. You have to be shown to be an abusive monopoly for there to be an antitrust investigation. And part of the thing that makes these companies so different, and in a lot of ways so amazing, is that they offer their products for free or for very cheap. So consumer welfare is the primary paradigm that we have for evaluating monopolies. And these companies aren't so damaging to consumer welfare as defined by the antitrust code. Which isn't to say that there are not competition issues that these companies face. With the Europeans investigating Google, I think what they're essentially saying is that Google has abused its market, its power over markets, to give itself an unfair advantage. But that translates into a complaint pretty effectively in their context, it's less compelling in the context of American antitrust laws.</p><p>Europe has approached regulating these companies differently than the U.S. Is there anything we can learn and apply from the way Europe has looked at these companies?</p><p>There's two things really. The first is that the Europeans care more about privacy right now than we do. That's been one of their dominant complaints with these companies. The U.S. doesn't even have a data protection law. We have laws that protect health information or financial information but nothing that protects data per se, so I think there is something to be gleaned from that. But also if you look at the way the European Union has gone after Google, it's pretty clear that they are starting to come to terms with some sort of way to separate the search engine from the ad sales part of their business. It seems like they are groping toward a soft way of breaking up the company, which I think is pretty interesting.</p><p>In an ideal world, would you want to see Google, Amazon and Facebook broken up? Or is that sort of fighting the last war, in the sense that maybe that's an old way of looking at antitrust. Does that sort of logic still apply, the idea that we could break up a company?</p><p>For sure. I don't see why not. What would be the issue there?</p><p>I'm just thinking that when we broke up Ma Bell, for example, you had different regional businesses. But if you break up Facebook, you've destroyed the whole utility of Facebook, which is that everyone's on it.</p><p>But the idea of breaking it up doesn't necessarily mean breaking up the core network. It might mean applying a solution that's similar to the one the Europeans have applied to Google. So that somehow you change its relationship to ad sales, or force it to be a bit more of a common carrier.</p><p>I don't think we've gotten to the point where the thinking is advanced enough to really start this talk about compelling remedies. We're more in the position right now of diagnosing the problem. I think people are starting to sketch out the remedies. We can talk about it in a very theoretical sort of way, but I would just caution anyone to say something like \"it's impossible to break these companies up.\"</p><p>You're right, we're probably just applying a past template. If we analyzed these companies and their structure, there would be ways to break them up without taking a sledgehammer and smashing them up into a million pieces. There are probably more subtle things that can be done that constitute breaking them up, but not in the Ma Bell style.</p><p>It does seem people are starting to question the power of these companies. Obviously the Russian meddling has drawn a lot of the attention. But do you think people are starting to wake up to the threat of big tech?</p><p>I do think they are waking up to the sense that these companies have too much power. Really, it's a question about the power in a democracy, and also the economy. I think that beginning with the election, I think people diagnosed that the underlying health of American democracy has shifted. And so, Facebook is the first test case of whether the political system really is turning. And it does seem to be turning.</p><p>What company do you see as the greatest threat?</p><p>I tend to place Facebook at the top of the list, just because they've done so much to quickly debase the quality of information that goes to citizens and the impact of that on our democracy has registered almost instantaneously.</p><p>This quarter's lobbying reports just came out, and they show that Amazon, Facebook and Google are spending more and more money in Washington. I think there's a popular perception that Silicon Valley has been pretty separate from Washington, they have sort of done their own thing and Washington has let them do their own thing. But you show in your book, Google specifically has been a player in Washington for awhile now. How did that happen?</p><p>Google I think has the longest deepest history in Washington. They fought a kind of pitched battle in Europe and I think have the greatest sense of their underlying vulnerabilities. So they've invested the most heavily. They were involved in these epic fights over net neutrality, and intellectual property. And also, they were in China, which was a highly politicized issue. So in a way I think they have the most political experience out of the big tech firms.</p><p>While he was still in the White House, (<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/WeiDuCNA/status/907551055856025600\">https://twitter.com/WeiDuCNA/status/907551055856025600</url>) Steve Bannon wanted to treat Google and Facebook as public utilities. Do you agree with that?</p><p>I don't actually agree with that. If we say they are utilities and we regulate them in that sort of way, it gives the state way too much power over them. It also just seems highly unimaginative to me, that we need to assume that their can only be one social media network or one search engine or one retail store. I think that the more American approach is try to use our power to stimulate competition, rather than just accept their size as a given.</p><p>But there is something totally fascinating happen on the political spectrum right now, where you have both the left and the right being divided over the question of how to respond to these companies. And the fascinating thing is that even the center is gravitating toward antitrust in the form of (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bill-galston-and-bill-kristols-new-center-project-takes-aim-at-the-tech-oligarchs\">https://www.thedailybeast.com/bill-galston-and-bill-kristols-new-center-project-takes-aim-at-the-tech-oligarchs</url>) No Labels, where Bill Kristol and Bill Galston have been pushing for the government to do something about the big tech companies.</p><p>You've written about (<url normalizedValue=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119769/amazons-monopoly-must-be-broken-radical-plan-tech-giant\">https://newrepublic.com/article/119769/amazons-monopoly-must-be-broken-radical-plan-tech-giant</url>) Amazon's power .

What has your takeaway been from watching that process?</p><p>There's this sense of desperation, this willingness to give anything to get Amazon. And there's a long history of that. Amazon has managed to always extract a whole lot out of states and localities in terms of tax breaks and subsidies in order to build warehouses.This is not really a new strategy for them. This is something that they've always done.</p><p>We're facing these mega questions about the future of work, and we see that Amazon is a crucial factor in the (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/the-retail-apocalypse-has-officially-descended-on-america-2017-3\">http://www.businessinsider.com/the-retail-apocalypse-has-officially-descended-on-america-2017-3</url>) retail apocalypse that's happening. So if you're a jurisdiction and you're unsure about jobs, and Amazon comes in and is promising 10,000 new jobs, that's a pretty good bet for your city. But I would say, these jurisdictions don't seem to be really doing cost-benefit analyses. They're not really adding up the gain versus the long-term cost of just subsidizing a major corporation.</p><p>There is kind of a competition issue here too, which is that Amazon's size begets more size. Amazon, because it's so big and so prestigious, is able to leverage its reputation to get even more advantage over its competitors.</p><p>Where has the Left been on all of this? That's the group that has traditionally opposed the concentration of corporate power.</p><p>I think it's just slowly dawned on people that this is a problem. So much of the internet era was defined by tumult. We had this sense that companies rose and fell very quickly. We were just slow to acknowledge that there was a stable constellation of major powers in the tech field. Now it's kind of become undeniable.</p><p>And also, what you're getting at, which is in my book, is that the tech companies aligned themselves with the Left. And Barack Obama really closely associated himself with Facebook and Google. And so, I think there was a natural inclination on the Left to view these companies as their friends.</p><p>That leads me to ask too, obviously these companies are very powerful, but the counter argument is that if they have aligned with the left how powerful can they really be? We have Trump and we have a Republican government right now. Same thing on net neutrality, it seems like as powerful as these companies are\u00a0they can't seem to beat the old telecom giants on net neutrality.</p><p>As we saw with Facebook, it's not like these companies were sitting around rooting for Hillary Clinton, they just wanted to make a lot of money, no matter the consequences. And then on net neutrality, the Trump administration installed people in the FEC who had an ideological bent. And there's nothing much they could do about that.</p><p>Universal basic income is an idea that seems to have some cache in Silicon Valley. But it seems to me that concept is based on the the belief that eliminating most jobs is inevitable, and that it's not even worth considering whether we should do that, or attempt to do that. When you hear that discussion about universal basic income, what does that tell you about the worldview of Silicon Valley?</p><p>It shows a narcissism that's embedded in this belief that they can engineer a world in which universal basic income will be enough to carry us through. It's almost the ultimate proposition in social engineering. And like, so much else, it's a rational solution that doesn't actually understand human beings. They just can't comprehend the idea that work is central to dignity. And there's this almost insulting assumption that most people would rather not do their jobs.</p><p>There's gotta be a way to manage technology where we can both allow it to progress without just giving it free reign. Is there a middle ground between embracing the inevitability of technology and being a luddite?</p><p>Of course. Of course. Think about automobiles. When automobiles were created they were incredibly efficient means of getting human beings from point A to point B. But a lot of people got killed because there were no rules. So we created speed limits and stop signs and safety belts and fuel efficiency standards. There is no reason that these companies, and these technologies, should be immune from rules. We can \u00a0harness them for human beings. Nobody is saying \"throw your phone in the sea.\" To betray opposition to these companies as luddite is to concede that any criticism of them is an instance of wanting to suppress innovation, which is ridiculous.</p><p>You mentioned a data protection agency. Can you describe what that would be and what actions it would take?</p><p>It's not a totally novel concept. There are actually data protection agencies in lots of european countries that try to adjudicate complaints that people have with the big companies and try to help people fight to protect their data. But underlying it all, I really think we need a new paradigm for thinking about data. In the book I talked about how we need a paradigm that treats data as something closer to the environment, where we create a whole set of rules that govern how data can be exploited by these companies, and also insists that these companies be held to a very high standard in their exploitation of data.</p><p>Is there any particular law or fix that you would implement now?</p><p>I think what needs to happen very quickly is countervailing pressure. I look at what London has done with Uber, and I think that that's actually an important start. So many of these companies have existed in a bubble where they've been beyond criticism. Forcing Zuckerberg to come testify before the Senate would be, in the short term, an incredibly important thing that would maybe rattle the cult of personality that he has within his own company and apply pressure on their system in a very, very visible way. They would have to answer questions from angry grandstanding politicians. So much of the problem is there's no counterweight right now.</p><p>Silicon Valley, and Google in particular, hire engineers for jobs that traditionally might go to other disciplines, like finance. As we move forward, and the social implications of this technology becomes more obvious and there's more pushback, I wonder if these companies will start to move away from a strictly engineering mindset.</p><p>In the end, computer science is too important to be left to the computer scientists. Some of the systems that have been created may work efficiently and beautifully and logically, but there is very little understanding of ethics or politics. We need to treat human beings as more than the sum of their data. And that will require a really profound paradigm shift within these companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-517582741</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 517582741</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R49-6F21-DYTM-936B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2949\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newsweek Media Group</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times - US ed.</publicationName><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 25, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Lobbying</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>News, opinion and commentary</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Campaign finance reform</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Human smuggling</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lobbying</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political activity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political aspects</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Public affairs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

As the recipient of a number of targeted attacks himself, he said anonymity of the web is  troublesome. </p><p>\"There is a powerful argument that anonymity on the internet is without justification, and there is a right to know from whence come those who wish to communicate on it,\" Grieve said.</p><p>Jo Swinson, Liberal Democrat leadership hopeful, outlined the scale of the disinformation problem.</p><p>Five of the top ten Twitter accounts mentioning Brexit parties prior to the recent European elections were producing more than 140 tweets over an eight-hour or one in every 3.3 minutes, she said, while in Italy there were 23 Facebook pages which collectively had 2.4 million followers spreading false information on migration and vaccines.</p><p>\"These are the threats we share to our democracy and our shared truth,\" Swinson said, calling for digital political advertising to require an imprint, like printed materials, and for an effective cap on political donations.</p><p>Investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr said the spread of political disinformation vial online platforms could not be more serious.</p><p>\"Whats happening is more serious than just politics. It's an attack on our sovereignty and the rule of law,\" she said. The phenomenon is global, she went on, and it's being orchestrated by \"the same authoritarians and being mediated by tech platforms.\"</p><p>Cadwalladr pointed to the lethargic, almost non-existent response to the abuse of electoral law by the British authorities, and the insignificant fines doled out to law-breaking campaigns. Facebook could make investigators' job easier if they would hand over the information on funding of political ads, but that is unlikely without significant pressure.</p><p>\"The law won't save us, and the regulators won't save us, we have to save ourselves\", she concluded.</p><p>Cadwalladr suggested using shame as a weapon against the tech giants. Despite a reprimand from the UN, Mark Zuckerberg has avoided making any public mention of the use of Facebook to propagate mass killings in Myanmar, she pointed out, and he and his deputies have also refused to appear before the government of the UK and Canada to answer questions about data sharing in political campaigns.</p><p>\"There are clear moral lines,\" she said, adding that Facebook now had to pay more to attract employees as a result of its tarnished public image.</p><p>Paul Hilder, co-founder of the OpenDemocracy.net website and campaigning group Avaaz, said that across the globe oligarchs are seeking to extend their power through the use of social media. The early promise of the Web as a democratising force had been \"mugged\" he said, but it's not really about the technology.</p><p>\"What went wrong is oligarchy,\" Hilder said. \"The landscape at play is oligarchy and abuse of power. There are all sorts of loopholes and vulnerabilities in our democracies.\" Hilder added his voice to the growing demand for the power of big technology companies to be curtailed.  \"I think we need to work at the strategic level and think very big about things like breaking up big tech,\" he proclaimed.</p><p>Despite the lack of meaningful action by the authorities, the Cambridge Analytica scandal has had a \"seismic effect on the public conversation,\" he added. Politicians from across the political spectrum are at least starting to feel the way the wind is blowing, even if it seems unlikely that many will follow through.</p><p>Delivering the final keynote of the evening, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Reuniting Britain Post-Brexit, Stephen Kinnock MP, said that social media giants need to spend a much larger proportion of their enormous earnings safeguarding democracy and the rule of law.  \"We need them to invest huge amounts more in fact-checking and balance, and to stop behaving as platforms and start behaving as publishers,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Computing and CRN have united to present the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Women in Tech Festival UK 2019</emphasis>, on 17 September in London. </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The event will celebrate successful women in the IT industry, enabling attendes to hear about, and to share, personal experiences of professional journeys and challenges. </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whether you're the 'Next Generation', an 'Inspirational Leader', or an 'Innovator of Tech' this event will offer inspiration on not only how to improve yourself, but how to help others too.

Instead, we've got the new Robber Barons: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, with Uber and a few others trying to join this profitable circle of global oligopolies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the United States, Amazon increasingly dominates the retail landscape. It handles about 40% of all book sales. For online sales of all merchandise, Amazon's market share keeps increasing; it's estimated that, for each additional dollar Americans spend online this year, about 50 cents will be spent with Amazon. Its market value is now about $300 billion.</p><p>As with Amazon, Facebook has immense power over suppliers who reach customers using its platform. Facebook's market value is $300 billion. It has 1.5 billion users worldwide, and an estimated 40% share of the social media market. On average, users spend almost an hour per day on Facebook. And about 40% of Americans get at least some of their news via the social network.</p><p>The statistics for Google and Apple are equally impressive. Each of these companies benefits from some combination of large upfront investment costs, low marginal costs, and network effects - the traditional recipe for a monopoly or oligopoly. At this stage, it would be immensely difficult financially for a new entrant to compete.</p><p>These factors provide the new Robber Barons with the ability to take advantage of their suppliers, employees and customers. This isn't just an abstract concern about what could possibly happen in the future -- Apple and Google have already admitted to colluding to depress employee wages. And working conditions in Amazon's warehouses seem, at times, a throwback to 19th century capitalism.</p><p>Market power of this magnitude isn't unprecedented; we've faced similar challenges in the past.</p><p>Before the rise of cable, TV was only distributed via airwaves. Under the best circumstances, broadcasting companies were going to have oligopoly power: There was only a limited electromagnetic spectrum. But the government prevented monopolies by limiting the number of broadcast licenses any one company could own, either nationally or in a local market. It also dealt with the possibility that station owners would use their broadcasting power to manipulate political events by im- posing the Equal Time Rule (broadcasters must provide equivalent opportunities to all political candidates) and the Fairness Doctrine (broadcasters must present both sides of controversies of public importance in an honest and balanced manner).</p><p>Similarly, the old Bell System had a monopoly on the telephone industry for most of the 20th century. If you wanted to contact someone by phone, you had to use the Bell System. The government first addressed Bell's position through price regulation. Then in 1982, it broke up the company as part of a court-ordered settlement, setting the stage for actual competition, new technologies and, indirectly, our current telecommunications revolution.</p><p>Government antitrust inter- ventions have promoted innovation in the past, and should again be employed to make conditions more favorable for competitors and consumers.</p><p>Let me offer a few suggestions:</p><p>Break up companies with excessive market share. Broadcast TV, as noted above, was a natural oligopoly because of limited spectrum. Absent a compelling technological reason for a monopoly or oligopoly, the government should move to split up large companies. Amazon, for instance, could be split along product lines (a separate company for books, housewares, etc.), geographically (by regions), or vertically (with fulfillment centers separated from the rest of the company).</p><p>Prevent large companies from using their significant market share to extract monopolistic rent. When the book publisher Hachette wouldn't agree to Amazon's terms, Amazon made it difficult for consumers to buy Hachette books. Giants shouldn't be allowed to arbitrarily crush parts of their supply chain.</p><p>Impose clear, fair and nonarbitrary rules concerning when monopolies and oligopolies can refuse to serve customers. Social media is an increasingly key part of how we communicate. Yet legally, nothing stops Facebook from simply banning users from its platform, for any reason it wishes. This isn't a moot concern. When Facebook objected to some material the American Civil Liberties Union posted on its pages, Facebook suspended its account. The ACLU was able to get its account turned on again, but who knows how many less prominent advocacy groups have been prevented from communicating via the network.</p><p>Regulating or breaking up large digital companies won't be easy. In the late 19th century, the old Standard Oil Trust controlled an estimated 90% of the refined petroleum industry. Although the trust was first sued on antitrust grounds in the 1890s, it successfully resisted breakup until 1911. The original Robber Barons fought, on all fronts, to maintain their monopolistic advantage: in the courts with armies of lawyers; politically with campaign donations (one senator was only half-jokingly referred to as the Senator from Standard Oil); and through public relations campaigns, arguing that their size served the public interest, or that their power wasn't as extensive as it appeared. Our new Robber Barons will likely react the same way to any threat to their profits. But if we don't act, we risk stifling future innovation and being crushed by these new corporate giants.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: (no caption)  PHOTOGRAPHER:Mark Lennihan AP PHOTO: (no caption)  PHOTOGRAPHER:Leon Neal AFP/Getty Images, PHOTO: (no caption)  PHOTOGRAPHER:AP PHOTO: (no caption)  PHOTOGRAPHER:Reed Saxon AP </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LATE-LKMNQ68</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K49-HSW1-DXXV-30TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Los Angeles Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Los Angeles Times</publicationName><edition>Home Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>June 30, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion piece</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Power is in the hands of too few.</p><p>This is the anti-democratic poison that caused the progressives of Roosevelt's age to break up the likes of Standard Oil, John D. Rockefeller's trust that controlled 90 percent of the country's oil. Although Galloway's proposal isn't specific, if it followed the Standard Oil model it would mean busting up Big Tech into multiple smaller, independent entities. Amazon Web Services would be one obvious target to spin off.</p><p>Given this laissez-faire moment, Galloway's proposal will go nowhere. That doesn't mean it won't go anywhere ever, though. Moments change. It's a useful thought exercise, not least for the Seattle area, which has benefited so much from Big Tech's breakout. And it might be more than just an exercise: The Washington Post has been the toughest watchdog on the Trump administration, so it's possible the president could come after its owner, Jeff Bezos.</p><p>To be fair, Fortune's 2017 list of the world's most admired companies placed Apple, Amazon and Alphabet in the top three slots (Starbucks was No. 6,\u00a0 followed by Microsoft). Yet the list is compiled by Korn Ferry, asking executives, directors and securities analysts. This is not vox populi.</p><p>An Axios-SurveyMonkey poll last month found that 55 percent of respondents were concerned that government isn't doing enough to regulate Big Tech, an increase of 15 points in three months. Democrats, Republicans and independents all voiced more worry than in the previous poll.</p><p>\"That's a seismic shift in the public's perception of Silicon Valley over a short period of time,\" Axios reported. \"It shows how worried Americans are about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but it also reflects a growing anxiety about the potentially addictive nature of some of the tech companies' products, as well as the relentless spread of fake news on their platforms.\"</p><p>The findings bolster a poll last fall from another news site, The Verge, showing declining trust in Big Tech. Facebook, Twitter and Apple came out worst, with Microsoft and Amazon doing better. \"Amazon is a ruthless corporate juggernaut that people love,\" The Verge summarized.</p><p>That juggernaut has been very good to Seattle, growing to 45,000 well-paid jobs at its headquarters and helping fill the city treasury. (The downside to having what tech talent desires but being cheaper than the Bay Area is a staggering increase in house prices.)</p><p>Amazon can also claim to be a real employer nationwide - more than 300,000, including 90,000 from Whole Foods. (Microsoft employs more than 74,500 nationwide and about 47,000 in the Puget Sound region.)</p><p>While this is better than Facebook's head count of 23,000, Amazon eradicates jobs, too. More than 514,000 jobs were lost at department stores alone between 2001 and this past December.</p><p>Also, much Amazon work is in warehouses. For example, the Phoenix \"associate\" wage is $12.45 an hour, according to Glassdoor.</p><p>For comparison's sake, General Motors at its peak employed some 400,000 in the United States and Canada. In 1970, starting pay on the assembly line was around $26.60 in today's dollars. Increases were built into the United Auto Workers contract, along with health care, pensions and other benefits.</p><p>This was commonplace in the America of that era, and with far more companies. Rising productivity was widely shared in wage growth, unlike today (the companion trend lines separated around 1973).</p><p>And don't forget that Amazon's enormous power doesn't stop at the marketplace. More than 200 localities sought HQ2. Many, including the 20 finalists, appear willing to shower this wealthy company with incentives.</p><p>\"Chicago proposed to let Amazon keep $1.3 billion in employee payroll taxes and spend this money as the company sees fit,\" Galloway writes. \"That's right: Chicago offered to transfer its tax authority to Amazon, and trusts the Seattle firm to allocate taxes in a manner best for Chicago's residents.\"</p><p>Galloway argues that a breakup of the Big Four would inject \"oxygen\" into the economy, improving competition and unleashing capital.</p><p>Maybe it would hold back Seattle even worse than did Microsoft's \"lost decade,\" which some observers blame on the federal government's antitrust prosecution (others say Microsoft got off too easy, avoiding a breakup). On the other hand, given Seattle's strengths, a breakup might let dozens of new tech flowers bloom here.</p><p>But I'm afraid that trust busting needs to go far beyond Big Tech. Finance, media, telecom, airlines, railroads and health care are among the many sectors that have become too concentrated. This hurts competition, innovation, job creation and the communities that lose headquarters. We also need breakthroughs beyond apps and tech devices, as well as public investment, that create good jobs.</p><p>The Gilded Age's barons look stuffy in black-and-white photos. The moguls of our Digital Gilded Age dress like teenagers or men who accidentally misplaced their ties. But, otherwise, the danger their enterprises pose to the economy and the nation is the same - maybe worse today, where enough of an ignorant nation can be swayed by social-media lies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-29e139e4297d11e8b86fa49dc77ae870</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWV-4521-DY2P-417R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1245\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 18, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

We only know this thanks to the bravery of a whistleblower. This is yet another scandal in a\u00a0troubled period for the company, with a growing sense that it is all profit, no responsibility. But the current malaise goes wider than Facebook. On the internet more widely, the advertising-supported model has demanded its payout, and as a result our experience of the web is getting worse. Like rats scrambling to get back on a sinking ship, senior former-Facebookers are lining up to express regrets. It all feels too little, too late.</p><p>The problem of large corporations posing a threat to democracy is an old one. Monopolies that vest control of markets in a single person create \"a kingly prerogative, inconsistent with our form of government\", declared US senator John Sherman in 1890, when he introduced his eponymous act, which became the cornerstone of American competition law. Facebook looks increasingly like digital royalty, and not in a good way. It controls vast amounts of our data and curates what we read with a mysterious and mercurial flair. As the Cambridge Analytica files show, the platform appears to prioritise advertisers over users, and doesn't do enough to control how the data it collects is handled by third parties. Of course, Facebook is not the only offender: Amazon and Google have enough fingers in enough pies to make digital oligarchies a problem we can no longer ignore. But what is to be done? How could we make a platform such as Facebook less autocratic?</p><p>We need transparent and participatory approaches to rule making</p><p>In the first place, it is critical that we understand this as a systemic problem with the business model. With that in mind, we could follow Sherman's example and break up the market using anti-trust laws. But there are also ways to create alternatives from the bottom up. Governments and regulators could foster the conditions in which alternative networks with more democratic foundations could flourish.</p><p>One way to do this is to increase transparency and public participation around rule-making for digital platforms. For an example of what this means, we can look to Wikipedia. It has its problems, but it is a\u00a0remarkable example of how to make decisions as a\u00a0community, rather than a company. The method by which articles on Wikipedia are produced is governed by a set of rules that have been determined collectively, over time. There are arguments, there is consensus, and there is everything in between - all of which is documented for anyone to see.</p><p>Compare this with Facebook's decree that its news feed would prioritise personal stories over media content, without any apparent indication that it considered the impact on journalism. Or its equally clunky attempt to survey users about who should decide whether child-grooming content should be permitted on the platform.</p><p>The Facebook executive team is clearly unaccustomed to managing democratic processes and genuine community collaboration. But it is possible to imagine a social network where users have a say in how, for example, our daily news feed is curated, and where each choice we make isn't used by some tech giant as an opportunity to monetise our data. We need to start collaborating on the design of rules, create a culture of transparency among platforms and have discussions about what constitutes the public good. It is often said that the spaces for discussion created by social media companies are the 21st-century equivalent of the town square or public meeting. We cannot continue to leave the decisions about how to organise these to the private sector.</p><p>If we want to create alternative services and give them a chance to grow, we will need ambitious programmes of public investment. Platforms organised around the public good will need to be resourced to build a user base, and it is time we stopped pretending that venture capitalists are any kind of proper substitute for public money and oversight. There are precedents for this. Minitel in France, for example, is often scoffed at in Silicon Valley, but actually worked pretty well. Minitel was a publicly supported informatics system before the modern internet, and boomed thanks to government investment. Anyone with a French telephone line could get a Minitel monitor for free and make use of the hybrid public-private network between the late 1970s and 1990s. It looked a\u00a0bit like a\u00a0government information service and a bit like Craigslist, where people could access information, buy things and hang out in chatrooms without anyone using these as data farms for black-ops marketing.</p><p>We have many good reasons to be wary of governments controlling the internet. But investment in infrastructure does not have to be synonymous with state spying. Interestingly, Minitel was built in such a way that users retained a form of anonymity. There was a central money-collecting service (a bit like how the Apple store today sells books, music and streaming services). But service providers were never given an itemised bill, so\u00a0they did not know who their users were.</p><p>Minitel was still centralised, however: all communications had to go through one node. So while we can learn from its example, we also need to allow people to communicate and collaborate without replicating this weakness. What this means is a return to the days before the big tech companies and spooks oversaw the concentration of web activity through central nodes. The internet began as a decentralised network, but market consolidation has effectively changed this, even if its technical underpinnings have remained unchanged. This is what pioneers including Sir Tim Berners-Lee mean when they talk about the need for a \"re-decentralisation\" of the web.</p><p>Modern technological capabilities mean that this objective is within our grasp. Projects such as Berners-Lee's Solid offer a glimpse of what might be possible, by allowing people to control and port their data to different services. The blockchain also has the potential - well beyond cryptocurrencies - to help people deal with each other without having to rely on a centralised platform or ledger. We have the technical capacity to chat, cooperate and trade directly with each other, without relying on private platforms that measure value in ad revenue.</p><p>\"The internet's inherent value and power come from the fact that it is globally interoperable and decentralised,\" writes the internet freedom advocate Rebecca MacKinnon. Everybody can add value to the network, without having to get permission. The basic technical protocols that allow this kind of collaboration are still in place, but the profit motive and market centralisation have undermined their effectiveness.</p><p>We need transparent and participatory approaches to rule making, public investment in digital infrastructure that does not facilitate state snooping, and decentralised forms of data management. Without these kinds of changes, we are unable fully to make use of the enormous resources generated by a network of billions of people. We also, as the news about Facebook has made frighteningly clear, risk undermining the democratic processes that hold wealth and privilege accountable.</p><p>\u00b7 Lizzie O'Shea is an Australian human rights lawyer, broadcaster and writer living in London</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-42452884</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX7-6VY1-JCJY-G3GY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1252\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

With Democrats in complete control of the  federal government, the committee hearing at the time wasn't meant  to be contentious. But shortly before Napolitano's testimony, the  Obama administration had quietly announced that it was retracting a  DHS report on the rise of right-wing extremism in the United  States. The report posited that the recession and the election of  the first black president, Barack Obama, were \"fueling [a]  resurgence in radicalization and recruitment\" of right-wing  extremism, particularly among the ranks of active and veteran  military members. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   Congressional Republicans were enraged by the report. Then-House  GOP leader John Boehner led the way, demanding an apology from  Napolitano for what he called a besmirching of the armed forces.  With conservative talk radio fomenting intense reaction, Napolitano  buried the report. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  A decade later I am still agonized by the choice to ignore the  report's ominous warnings. Because since that ill-fated decision,  the tide of violence it portended has arrived. </p><p>   The shooting at a mosque earlier this year in Christchurch, New  Zealand claimed 49 lives. The Tree of Life synagogue shooting in  Pittsburgh last fall was perhaps the bloodiest pogrom of  anti-Semitic violence committed on U.S. soil. The shooting at the  Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston in 2015 was one of the worst  acts of racist murder since Reconstruction. Charlottesville.  Tallahassee. Parkland. Each of these attacks were committed by  right-wing extremists. </p><p>   These tragedies aren't isolated incidents. A stunning report issued  by the Anti-Defamation League found that 50 homicides resulting  from extremism occurred in the United States in 2018, of which 49  were committed by right-wing terrorists. The ADL revealed that 78%  of extremist homicides were by white supremacists, and 16% by  anti-government zealots. </p><p>   Overall, extremist violence not only encompassed murder but a spate  of assorted acts, ranging from threats and harassment to white  collar crime. The Center for American Progress has identified  similar trends, finding that right-wing domestic terrorism jumped  from just 6% of all domestic terror attacks to a whopping 35%  between 2010-16. </p><p>   Despite this growing threat, the Trump administration has  undermined efforts to address domestic extremism. Trump DHS  political appointees pushed the White House to recognize  anti-fascists as a greater national security threat than actual  fascist sympathizers. Trump canceled a $400,000 grant to a group  that eases people out of the white supremacist movement. In New  Jersey, the Global Peace Foundation, a community-building group,  was denied funding to help build out their programs. My repeated  attempts to free that money have been ignored or pushed aside. </p><p>   Trump aides put a special target on the Countering Violent  Extremism task force, which engaged with community-level programs  to identify troubled individuals before they became radicalized.  Since 2017, Community Partnership's budget has been slashed to the  bone such that one former official said it \"no longer exists.\" </p><p>   And in April, DHS shuttered its office of domestic terrorism  experts. The downsizing, effectuated last year without any  announcement, comes as the tally of domestic terrorism reports  issued by DHS have plummeted and local law enforcement agencies  lament that they are getting little data, little support, and  little outreach from their DHS partners. </p><p>   The ADL discovered that left-wing extremists (animal/environmental  protection, black nationalist radicals) have been linked to 15  murders over the last 20 years. By contrast, from 2009-18,  right-wing extremists accounted for 73% of all 427 domestic  extremist killings. This is not a both-sides problem. Nonetheless,  preparing a blueprint to defeat domestic extremism will take the  concerted efforts of many stakeholders. </p><p>   Men like Robert Bowers and Dylan Roof are not common criminals -  they are terrorists. Political leaders and media outlets must drop  euphemisms like 'white nationalism' and 'racially-tinged.' By  routinely calling domestic extremists for what they are, there can  be no mistake about the gravity of their acts or the source of  their intentions. </p><p>   In Washington, DHS and the Justice Department must have the  resources to assemble offices tasked solely with monitoring  extremism and engaging regularly with communities. Furthermore, as  the threat of jihadist violence ebbs, we must shift resources to  the domestic sphere. This centralization is long overdue, as the  U.S. relies almost entirely on local police forces to stop attacks,  usually while they're already occurring. No other architecture is  in place. </p><p>   We can build that architecture by supporting existing programs  geared towards de-radicalizing young people before they are lost.  This entails greater federal and state funding for programs that  reintegrate extremists back into society and work with young people  to keep them out of hate groups. The first line of defense will not  be Washington, but our own towns and neighbors who can identify and  steer those who are most susceptible to the siren call of  extremism. </p><p>   And the onus also falls on the shoulders of the big tech platforms,  which thus far have not done nearly enough. Their sites have become  the foremost incubators of extremism. </p><p>   While the Christchurch terrorist broadcast his attack, Facebook  didn't even know it was livestreaming terrorism. A cursory glance  at the comments accompanying a host of innocuous YouTube videos  reveal a teeming cesspool of bile. There is zero doubt in my mind  that the deluge of bigoted trolling, conspiracy theories, and  incitements to violence on social media are radicalizing right-wing  extremists more than any other wellspring. </p><p>   These platforms have refused to clean their sites, through a  combination of coveting advertising dollars and a fear of being  harangued by my Republican colleagues with lies of purported bias.  The heads of Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube must decide if their  profits and political fears are worth more than maintaining engines  of hate. </p><p>   And of course, our collective failure to ratify firearm regulations  has perpetuated a society awash in guns. This Congress House  Democrats have offered several measures that would finally provide  a framework for background checks and banning military weapons from  our streets. </p><p>   Finally, there is also the elephant in room. Recently, Donald Trump  expressed that he didn't view rising white supremacy as a threat.  When the leader of the free world traffics in incendiary bombast,  baseless racial attacks on minorities, and waves at anti-Semites,  those extremists are emboldened and are more likely to act on their  perverted beliefs. </p><p>   Trump has given strength to marginalized extremists that have  skulked in the shadows, and shown no signs of stopping how he  speaks or in his domestic priorities. Only when our nation's voice  at the top rejects these influences can we begin the fight against  extremism in earnest. </p><p>   Bill Pascrell Jr., a Democrat, represents New Jersey's 9th  congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.

With Democrats in complete control of the federal government, the committee hearing at the time wasn't meant to be contentious. But shortly before Napolitano's testimony, the Obama administration had quietly announced that it was retracting a DHS report on the rise of right-wing extremism in the United States. The report posited that the recession and the election of the first black president, Barack Obama, were \"fueling [a] resurgence in radicalization and recruitment\" of right-wing extremism, particularly among the ranks of active and veteran military members.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressional Republicans were enraged by the report. Then-House GOP leader John Boehner led the way, demanding an apology from Napolitano for what he called a besmirching of the armed forces. With conservative talk radio fomenting intense reaction, Napolitano buried the report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A decade later I am still agonized by the choice to ignore the report's ominous warnings. Because since that ill-fated decision, the tide of violence it portended has arrived.</p><p>The shooting at a mosque earlier this year in Christchurch, New Zealand claimed 49 lives. The Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh last fall was perhaps the bloodiest pogrom of anti-semitic violence committed on U.S. soil. The shooting at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston in 2015 was one of the worst acts of racist murder since Reconstruction. Charlottesville. Tallahassee. Parkland. Each of these attacks were committed by right-wing extremists.</p><p>These tragedies aren't isolated incidents. A stunning report issued by the Anti-Defamation League found that 50 homicides resulting from extremism occurred in the United States in 2018, of which 49 were committed by right-wing terrorists. The ADL revealed that 78% of extremist homicides were by white supremacists, and 16% by anti-government zealots.</p><p>Overall, extremist violence not only encompassed murder but a spate of assorted acts, ranging from threats and harassment to white collar crime. The Center for American Progress has identified similar trends, finding that right-wing domestic terrorism jumped from just 6% of all domestic terror attacks to a whopping 35% between 2010-16.</p><p>Despite this growing threat, the Trump administration has undermined efforts to address domestic extremism. Trump DHS political appointees pushed the White House to recognize anti-fascists as a greater national security threat than actual fascist sympathizers. Trump canceled a $400,000 grant to a group that eases people out of the white supremacist movement. In New Jersey, the Global Peace Foundation, a community-building group, was denied funding to help build out their programs. My repeated attempts to free that money have been ignored or pushed aside.</p><p>Trump aides put a special target on the Countering Violent Extremism task force, which engaged with community-level programs to identify troubled individuals before they became radicalized. Since 2017, Community Partnership's budget has been slashed to the bone such that one former official said it \"no longer exists.\"</p><p>And in April, DHS shuttered its office of domestic terrorism experts. The downsizing, effectuated last year without any announcement, comes as the tally of domestic terrorism reports issued by DHS have plummeted and local law enforcement agencies lament that they are getting little data, little support, and little outreach from their DHS partners.</p><p>The ADL discovered that left-wing extremists (animal/environmental protection, black nationalist radicals) have been linked to 15 murders over the last 20 years. By contrast, from 2009-18, right-wing extremists accounted for 73% of all 427 domestic extremist killings. This is not a both-sides problem. Nonetheless, preparing a blueprint to defeat domestic extremism will take the concerted efforts of many stakeholders.</p><p>Men like Robert Bowers and Dylan Roof are not common criminals - they are terrorists. Political leaders and media outlets must drop euphemisms like 'white nationalism' and 'racially-tinged.' By routinely calling domestic extremists for what they are, there can be no mistake about the gravity of their acts or the source of their intentions.</p><p>In Washington, DHS and the Justice Department must have the resources to assemble offices tasked solely with monitoring extremism and engaging regularly with communities.</p><p>Furthermore, as the threat of jihadist violence ebbs, we must shift resources to the domestic sphere. This centralization is long overdue, as the U.S. relies almost entirely on local police forces to stop attacks, usually while they're already occurring. No other architecture is in place.</p><p>We can build that architecture by supporting existing programs geared towards de-radicalizing young people before they are lost. This entails greater federal and state funding for programs that reintegrate extremists back into society and work with young people to keep them out of hate groups. The first line of defense will not be Washington, but our own towns and neighbors who can identify and steer those who are most susceptible to the siren call of extremism.</p><p>And the onus also falls on the shoulders of the big tech platforms, which thus far have not done nearly enough. Their sites have become the foremost incubators of extremism.</p><p>While the Christchurch terrorist broadcast his attack, Facebook didn't even know it was livestreaming terrorism. A cursory glance at the comments accompanying a host of innocuous YouTube videos reveal a teeming cesspool of bile. There is zero doubt in my mind that the deluge of bigoted trolling, conspiracy theories, and incitements to violence on social media are radicalizing right-wing extremists more than any other wellspring.</p><p>These platforms have refused to clean their sites, through a combination of coveting advertising dollars and a fear of being harangued by my Republican colleagues with lies of purported bias. The heads of Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube must decide if their profits and political fears are worth more than maintaining engines of hate.</p><p>And of course, our collective failure to ratify firearm regulations has perpetuated a society awash in guns. This Congress House Democrats have offered several measures that would finally provide a framework for background checks and banning military weapons from our streets.</p><p>Finally, there is also the elephant in room. Recently, Donald Trump expressed that he didn't view rising white supremacy as a threat. When the leader of the free world traffics in incendiary bombast, baseless racial attacks on minorities, and waves at anti-Semites, those extremists are emboldened and are more likely to act on their perverted beliefs.</p><p>Trump has given strength to marginalized extremists that have skulked in the shadows, and shown no signs of stopping how he speaks or in his domestic priorities. Only when our nation's voice at the top rejects these influences can we begin the fight against extremism in earnest.</p><p>Bill Pascrell Jr., a Democrat, represents New Jersey's 9th congressional district in the US House of Representatives.

Before going too far, the government should ensure that any measures are proportionate and technically feasible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under the bill to be introduced in the budget session of parliament, the directors of social media companies which are found to have spread \"abhorrent, violent material\" and which fail to take it down expeditiously could face personal liability and up to three years in jail. It is possible even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg could face jail.</p><p>The companies themselves would face fines of up to 10 per cent of global revenue. To get some idea of the potential sums at stake, do the maths: Facebook has global revenue of $55 billion and Google $136 billion. This is strong medicine.</p><p>Attitudes to social media have changed dramatically over the past decade. Once seen as agents of democracy and free speech, the giants of social media such as Facebook and Google are increasingly viewed as dangerous, multinational monopolies which flout consumers' right to privacy and show contempt for social norms.</p><p>For example, Facebook was faulted for its role in diffusing fake posts by Russian trolls during the 2016 US elections and for allowing the technology firm Cambridge Analytica to misappropriate personal Facebook data which it used for political campaigns.</p><p>The images of the Christchurch massacre live-streamed by Facebook two weeks ago caused pain to many and also risked inspiring copy cat crimes. Yet it took Facebook almost an hour before it took the images down.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has asked why social media giants, which are so clever at using artificial intelligence to tailor ads personally to billions of customers, should find it so hard to take down this sort of content. It is a good question which is being asked all over the world.</p><p>The government says the proposed rules are not that new and are similar to legislation on child pornography and to the norms imposed on traditional media such as broadcast television.</p><p>Yet social media companies are sure to raise objections. These could include the question of who decides what constitutes \"violent, abhorrent\" material.</p><p>Big Tech has also stressed the practical problems and huge costs of taking down all the versions of an abhorrent post. By slightly altering specifications or switching to a different social media platform, a violent video can be made almost invisible to Facebook's internal net police and its artificial intelligence bots.</p><p>Social media companies will argue that they are already devoting significant resources to dealing with this problem and if the government takes too tough a line it will only drive violent material underground to the dark reaches of the internet.</p><p>On balance, the government's decision to force tech companies to increase their curation of social media is welcome. It is an area where self-regulation has failed.</p><p>Ideally, the mere threat of new legislation will spur the companies themselves to invest more heavily and take action.</p><p>Yet there is also a risk in rushing ahead. The Herald has argued that a global solution would be preferable. Other G20 countries are also developing strategies to fight extremist material on social media. Australia's strategy should be coordinated with them.</p><p>Australia has already picked one fight with Big Tech by rushing ahead on its own. The Coalition at the end of last year pushed through laws on data encryption that forced tech companies to give Australian security agents back door access to their networks.</p><p>The laws are among the toughest in the world but the government rushed them through without a serious public inquiry, claiming they were needed urgently to prevent a terrorist attack over the Christmas period.</p><p>Yet that haste was probably excessive. Microsoft global president Brad Smith this week was in Canberra complaining other countries might be scared to store data in Australia and Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquar has said the legislation was badly drafted and impractical.</p><p>That should be a warning to the government in the current case. While the momentum triggered by the horror of the Christchurch massacre should not be lost, there should be a thorough public consultation, including with industry, which should canvas this measure and also broader questions of social media's responsibility in a democracy. This is a bold move and the government must take the time to ensure it gets the balance right.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520110779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VS1-CH31-DY19-C184-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Its misuse of the private information of 50 million Americans and its leading role in debasing our elections have appalled the country\u2019s sensibilities. But the problem runs much deeper than one company or one scandal \\x97 it\u2019s a generational challenge posed by the rise of the Big Tech platforms and their unrivaled economic and political power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These new titans are redefining the very concept of \u201cmonopoly\u201d \\x97 one driven by data and a strategy for ongoing surveillance to control your online life. While earlier giants like Standard Oil and AT&amp;T made and sold things, Facebook and Google don\u2019t sellproducts or services; instead they are connectors and market makers that forge and then manipulate online communities.</p><p>The Big Tech platforms suck up the economic value others create in these new communities \\x97 a sort of digital racketeering that increasingly impoverishes creators with little ability to resist. Google and Facebook suck the advertising lifeblood out of newspapers and other media by scraping valuable work so that captive users never need to leave Big Tech platforms. YouTube\u2019s open invitation to the world's worst content pirates is far from a dirty secret, even though readily available technology could help thwart them.</p><p>And Big Tech\u2019s dominance has chillingly spread to the regulatory system itself, where Tech\u2019s massive war chest and unprecedented scale are used to extract \u201cregulatory rents\u201d from targeted industries they seek to absorb. Google, for example, recently sought an FCC rule to give it free access to pay TV streams to create its own cable service \\x97 only without negotiating, or paying, for the content.</p><p>And now Big Tech is promoting a contorted, narrow version of net neutrality that would immunize itself it from neutrality\u2019s basic premise \\x97 that online traffic cannot be prioritized for revenue-driven reasons. Yes, ISPs should not be allowed to discriminate against online content or traffic. But neither should Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or anyone else.</p><p>In the face of these epochal social and economic challenges, we have seen little more than a handful of bills slightly improving user privacy and requiring more disclosure for political ads. What\u2019s really needed is a modern equivalent of the trust busting of a century ago.</p><p>One place to start is by expanding the net neutrality debate. Neutrality was supposed to protect us from internet providers acting as gatekeepers, directing us to their preferred partners and content. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Big Tech does to make profits. Let\u2019s apply neutrality in an evenhanded way, including to the Big Tech platforms where it is needed most.</p><p>Another improvement would be to build on the recent bipartisan rollback of immunity for Big Tech\u2019s role in online sex trafficking and expand that approach to other abuses, so that the platforms can no longer turn an irresponsible blind eye.</p><p>And finally, we need both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to wake up and aggressively investigate these platforms and their ability to shape, dominate and manipulate the online markets under their control. And that may well include busting up the Google Alphabet Trust, denying it the ability to collect personal data in one line of business and then leverage it to dominate another.</p><p>The Internet was supposed to usher in an era of democracy, decentralization and personal empowerment. It is rapidly morphing into a system that knows everything, from where you drive your car and what\u2019s in your refrigerator to your web of relationships and the details of your deepest personal preferences. We must recognize the risks this hegemonic power poses. The dream of the Internet hangs in the balance.</p><p>\\x97 Ev Ehrlich is a former undersecretary of commerce and principal at ESC Consulting

Europe, which depends on America's intelligence reach to fend off terrorists, has embarked on a path that will sabotage some of our most important intelligence capabilities. This crisis has been a long time brewing, and up to now, the US has responded with a patchwork of stopgap half-solutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's not likely to work this time. We need a new strategy.\u00a0 And most of all, we need to get serious about defending U.S. interests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's no surprise that the US fight against terrorism depends crucially on the so-called 702 program, which allows the government to serve orders on social media, webmail, and electronic service providers who store their global customers' data in the United States.</p><p>The intelligence we gather in this way protects Europe as much as the United States. Within days of the Paris attacks, the US agreed to give France direct access to much raw intelligence. Even more recently, the German government credited US (and French) intelligence with helping it thwart planned suicide bombings in Munich over the New Year holiday. The British communications intelligence agency, GCHQ, has a deeply integrated intelligence sharing arrangement with NSA. None of these countries, let alone the smaller members of the European Union, can hope to match the American intelligence resources that are now marshaled in their defense.</p><p>So it might seem odd that the European Union poses a threat to these capabilities. Odd but true.\u00a0 The problem has deep roots in Europe's dysfunctional governance structure and in the mix of dependence and resentment that shape its relationship to the United States. \u00a0In the name of protecting privacy, the EU has long insisted that personal data may not be exported to other countries unless those countries provide \"adequate\" legal guarantees for privacy, and it has frequently threatened to cut off data flows to the United States because of differences in US and EU data protection law.</p><p>The threats were grounded partly in economic interest - keeping data processing jobs and companies in Europe - and partly in a European enthusiasm for expressing its moral superiority to the United States.\u00a0 The EU and US have always been able to negotiate a solution as these crises have been created, but the dynamic changed this fall when the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was asked to rule on the adequacy of US privacy law.\u00a0 Relying in part on irresponsible and inaccurate statements by the European Commission, the ECJ declared that the Commission had not justified a conclusion that United States surveillance oversight is \"adequate.\" It overturned the \"Safe Harbor\" that had allowed US companies to send customer data across the Atlantic.\u00a0 Just as important, it \u00a0authorized individual data protection agencies in each member state to adjudicate the lawfulness of data transfers to the United States. While the decisions of those agencies can be appealed, the EU has reached agreement on penalties for data protection violations that are a percentage of companies' global revenue - billions of dollars in the case of big tech companies like Google and Microsoft.\u00a0 With those penalties hanging over their head, few companies will want to gamble that they'll be vindicated on appeal.\u00a0 The data protection agencies, meanwhile, are delighted to have the US and its tech companies in their sights; they've said that enforcement actions are likely to begin at the end of January.</p><p>The European Commission has been trying to reach a new agreement with the United States to reinstate the Safe Harbor; the US has provided assurances that our intelligence oversight meets European standards. (Indeed, it far exceeds anything that French or German or British intelligence agencies put up with.) But the Commission's authority to bind the data protection authorities is in doubt, and it is increasingly under the thumb of a reflexively anti-American European Parliament, which will be inclined to reject or cavil at whatever it negotiates. As a result, the Commission has dug in its heels, demanding wide access to (and implicit authority over) US intelligence programs. There's a high probability that no deal, or at least no good deal, can be reached with the Commission.</p><p>Weirdly, the European institutions that have created this mess have no serious responsibility for stopping terrorism or for collecting and using intelligence.\u00a0 The European security agencies that have that responsibility are powerful in individual countries\u00a0 but have little sway in Brussels. This means that the machinery set in motion by the European Court of Justice will grind forward, with everyone doing what they've done before: The Commission will seek maximum concessions from US intelligence agencies. The European Parliament will deem the concessions insufficient. The data protection agencies will do all they can to punish American tech companies. Without a deal, tech companies may have to move their data centers out of the United States - making counterterrorism intelligence unavailable to our government. And they will be under heavy pressure to break with the US government on intelligence issues - to encrypt even more data to foil US intercepts, and to fight US intelligence orders in court and in Congress. US intelligence will suffer, perhaps greatly, and European and Americans will be at greater risk of terrorist attacks.</p><p>In short, if all the players in this drama just keep doing what they've always done, the result will be a disaster for US (and European) counterterrorism efforts. \u00a0If we want to stave off that disaster, we have to shake up the peculiar European structures that are driving this outcome. We have to make clear that continued attempts to hold American companies hostage over intelligence collection is simply unacceptable to the United States. Up to now, the Administration has tried to appease Europe; it has not played hard ball.\u00a0 And Congress has been disappointingly inactive, except for the House of Representatives, which has gone from inactive to supine in a related dispute, proposing to amend US law to give greater privacy rights to Europeans without demanding even before the negotiations are complete.</p><p>What could the US do to change Europe's negotiating calculus?\u00a0 It's not that hard, if we have the will. Congress (or, frankly, the President) could simply prohibit the sharing of intelligence with any country whose data protection agencies take action that has the effect of undermining US intelligence capabilities; this would certainly include punishing private companies that send data to the United States. Such a measure would make clear the connection between European data protectionism and our lost counterterrorism insights. While it is harsh to cut off intelligence to countries that are often allies against terrorism, the fact is that their policies will slowly cut off US access to terrorism intelligence. (We don't have to cut off access across the board; the measure could allow exceptions when the President certifies the need to share particular intelligence, but broad intelligence sharing would be barred with any country that takes action against US data access.)</p><p>Such a measure has the advantage of putting the onus of solving the problem on individual member states - the entities responsible for national security and for the actions of the data protection agencies.\u00a0 (It's notable that data protection authorities have rarely or never tried to regulate their own national intelligence agencies; they don't have the clout. Which strongly suggests that those agencies can bring the data protectors to heel if their access to US intelligence depends on it.) Negotiations with individual European nations, then, are far more likely to produce responsible results than negotiations with the neutered European Commission.</p><p>That's one way of making clear to Europe that we've had enough. Here's another. The US and Europe have been negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership for years, and it's likely that a deal will be presented to Congress for approval in 2016. This is part of the Obama administration's ambitious effort to lock in a host of environmental, intellectual property, labor and trade policies via large multinational deals. You'd think that any effort to restrict protectionism and foster trade would address Europe's data export restraints - probably the biggest trade issue between the US and the EU in the last fifteen years.\u00a0 You'd be wrong.\u00a0\u00a0 Both the European Commission and the European Parliament have taken data protectionism off the table in this trade deal, insisting that their current rules must be untouched. The result is a trade deal that as a practical matter blesses the current EU attack on our counterterrorism intelligence programs. Unlike the European Parliament, Congress has said nothing about the issue, strengthening the European hand.\u00a0 Yet it is Europe that likely needs a trade deal far more than the US. Europe's economy has lagged ours in growth and employment for decades, with the one economic bright spot being a consistently large trade surplus with the US. Congress should take a page from the European Parliament's book, adopting a resolution stating that no transatlantic trade deal will be approved if it permits the EU's current interference with both US technology trade and US counterterrorism capabilities.</p><p>There will be opposition to either of these measures. Many American businesses expect to get specific benefits from a trade deal, and they are reluctant to upset the apple cart. Refusing to share terror intelligence, meanwhile, has a cold-hearted air. But if we fail to deal with Europe's data protectionism in this trade deal, we may never have another chance; that will be bad for US industry, which will increasingly be held hostage or forced to accept uneconomic restrictions on how they manage their data. And cutting off counterterrorism intelligence sharing with countries that are undermining the foundation on which that intelligence rests is simply a matter of self-preservation.</p><p>If Europe wants to cripple its intelligence agencies, it is free to make that choice. We should not let it cripple ours.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-c3aa54c708f84e21a0374d228dcb202d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HSN-0MH1-DXKP-J40P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1710\"/><timeReceived>3:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 5, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

It is the right move and the legislation which the government has just proposed puts Australia at the cutting edge of the global debate about where to draw the line of responsibility for social media. Before going too far, the government should ensure that any measures are proportionate and technically feasible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under the bill to be introduced in the budget session of parliament, the directors of social media companies which are found to have spread \"abhorrent, violent material\" and which fail to take it down expeditiously could face personal liability and up to three years in jail. It is possible even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg could face jail.</p><p>The companies themselves would face fines of up to 10 per cent of global revenue. To get some idea of the potential sums at stake, do the maths: Facebook has global revenue of $55 billion and Google $136 billion. This is strong medicine.</p><p>Attitudes to social media have changed dramatically over the past decade. Once seen as agents of democracy and free speech, the giants of social media, such as Facebook and Google, are increasingly viewed as dangerous, multinational monopolies which flout consumers' right to privacy and show contempt for social norms.</p><p>For example, Facebook was faulted for its role in diffusing fake posts by Russian trolls during the 2016 US elections and for allowing the technology firm Cambridge Analytica to misappropriate personal Facebook data which it used for political campaigns.</p><p>The images of the Christchurch massacre live-streamed by Facebook two weeks ago caused pain to many and also risked inspiring copycat crimes. Yet it took Facebook almost an hour before it took the images down.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has asked why social media giants, which are so clever at using artificial intelligence to tailor ads personally to billions of customers, should find it so hard to take down this sort of content. It is a good question which is being asked all over the world.</p><p>The government says the proposed rules are not that new and are similar to legislation on child pornography and to the norms imposed on traditional media such as broadcast television.</p><p>Yet social media companies are sure to raise objections. These could include the question of who decides what constitutes \"violent, abhorrent\" material.</p><p>Big Tech has also stressed the practical problems and huge costs of taking down all the versions of an abhorrent post. By slightly altering specifications or switching to a different social media platform, a violent video can be made almost invisible to Facebook's internal net police and its artificial intelligence bots.</p><p>Social media companies will argue that they are already devoting significant resources to dealing with this problem and if the government takes too tough a line it will only drive violent material underground to the dark reaches of the internet.</p><p>On balance, the government's decision to force tech companies to increase their curation of social media is welcome. It is an area where self-regulation has failed.</p><p>Ideally, the mere threat of new legislation will spur the companies themselves to invest more heavily and take action.</p><p>Yet there is also a risk in rushing ahead. The Herald has argued that a global solution would be preferable. Other G20 countries are also developing strategies to fight extremist material on social media. Australia's strategy should be coordinated with them.</p><p>Australia has already picked one fight with Big Tech by rushing ahead on its own. The Coalition at the end of last year pushed through laws on data encryption that forced tech companies to give Australian security agents back door access to their networks.</p><p>The laws are among the toughest in the world but the government rushed them through without a serious public inquiry, claiming they were needed urgently to prevent a terrorist attack over the Christmas period.</p><p>Yet that haste was probably excessive. Microsoft global president Brad Smith this week was in Canberra complaining other countries might be scared to store data in Australia and Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquar has said the legislation was badly drafted and impractical.</p><p>That should be a warning to the government in the current case. While the momentum triggered by the horror of the Christchurch massacre should not be lost, there should be a thorough public consultation, including with industry, which should canvass this measure and also broader questions of social media's responsibility in a democracy. This is a bold move and the government must take the time to ensure it gets the balance right.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc74oram34nl118n7g785b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VS1-CPN1-JD34-V33J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

He urged broad diversification into such vehicles as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, commodities and real estate investment trusts, as well as a tax-sheltered structure known as a master limited partnership. But he concedes that with ''the exception of M.L.P.s,'' all are expensively priced.</p><p>  Holding cash, in the form of a money-market fund, is another answer, but it is far from perfect, he said. ''The problem with cash is you don't make any money,'' Mr. Brightman said. ''It's the safest place to keep your money, but you get zero real return.''</p><p>  Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco, said it was worth at least ''thinking about'' tweaking a portfolio to fortify it against risk.</p><p>  He suggests funds that focus on stocks specifically selected because their fluctuations are low: They are known as low-volatility stocks, and they have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 14 of the last 15 market downturns since 2011, according to Invesco.</p><p>  Four times a year, Invesco compiles a list of the lowest-volatility stocks in the S&amp;P 500. These are the companies whose shares are least affected by market turbulence. The current list features Coca-Cola as the least-volatile equity, followed by two utilities, the WEC Energy Group and Duke Energy, according to Mr. Kalivas.</p><p>  Low-volatility stocks outperformed the market for most of 2018, according to Mo Haghbin, head of product research and development for Oppenheimer funds. Through December, portfolios of low-volatility stocks in the Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor Exchange-Traded Fund lost 2.43 percent as opposed to the fund's benchmark, the Russell 1000, which lost 4.78 percent, Mr. Haghbin said. High-quality companies -- defined by superior grades on such metrics as return on assets, profits, margins and leverage -- also outperformed, losing 2.68 percent.</p><p>  But investors who shift toward low-volatility portfolios should remember that such portfolios have historically lagged once the market turns up.</p><p>  Two low-volatility E.T.F.s that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 2018 were: Hartford Multifactor Low Volatility US Equity E.T.F., which was basically flat, and Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility E.T.F., which lost just over 2 percent. The S&amp;P 500 was down 6.2 percent last year.</p><p>  Investors may also be wondering what to do about tech stocks, especially the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which have been losing altitude rapidly after a seemingly endless ascent.</p><p>  Through December, Facebook and Netflix were both down over 35 percent from their highs of last year. Apple and Amazon were each off more than 25 percent from their 2018 highs.</p><p>  Although Kevin Landis is portfolio manager of the tech-focused Firsthand Technology Opportunities fund, he said he is wary of the big tech stocks. ''When companies get bigger, they start looking more and more like government agencies,'' he said. ''Even the biggest opportunities are at the saturation point. There's only so many iPhones you can sell.''</p><p>  With evidence of rising public concern about consumer privacy, Mr. Landis said, he expects to see greater regulation. ''I spent the last 15 to 20 years being appalled at how readily people surrendered their own privacy,'' he said. ''I welcome the idea that they've become more aware.''</p><p>  Mr. Landis said there were still good values in smaller tech companies. One major holding is Roku, which hopes to lure consumers who subscribe to cable. He contrasted its market cap of under $4 billion with Netflix's $111 billion market cap and said Roku was a better value.</p><p>  But many advisers say investors should simply hold tight. Brian McMahon, manager of the Thornburg Investment Income Builder mutual fund, said that in many ways, the recent downturn ''is pretty normal. This is not something to panic about.'' He said his largest investment, the CME Group, benefits from an active market. It makes good profits when people trade on options and futures contracts made on its platforms, he said. ''CME Group benefits from volatility,'' he said.</p><p>  In a similar vein, Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, said, ''This is not a time to derisk and become completely defensive.'' There are still ''pockets of quality'' in the volatile markets, she added, citing the Chinese tech sector as one example.</p><p>  But she said there were at least two major threats in the longer term. ''We are increasingly concerned about long-term deficits and their impact on the bond market,'' she said. Bonds, already pressured in the near term by Federal Reserve rate increases, could also face long-term rate pressure from the ballooning Treasury financing required by mounting budget deficits.</p><p>  Ms. Moore also said tech stocks could eventually lose value if new regulations were imposed to protect consumer privacy. ''We don't expect any major regulatory changes in 2019,'' she said. ''We certainly expect the government will impose regulations over the medium term.''</p><p>  Mr. Haghbin of Oppenheimer emphasized that portfolio decisions should reflect an investor's view of the larger economy. ''If an investor feels that growth will continue to slow and risk appetite continue to decline, historically he would emphasize high-quality and low-volatility companies.''</p><p>  But, as Mr. Haghbin warned, investors may need to be nimble. ''Things can change very quickly,'' he said.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Coca-Cola, a low-volatility stock, may be useful in a defensive portfolio, according to one analyst.

All markets are cyclical, but private markets are more cyclical than most and venture capital is the most cyclical of all. The sheer mass of money now likely to move into the sector will depress expected returns, given the limited investment opportunities.</p><p>Why institutional investors want more exposure to private markets, dominated by buyout funds and venture capital, is explained in fascinating detail in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/articles_publictoprivateequityintheusalongtermlook_us.pdf?1596549853128\"> research report</url> from Morgan Stanley. It charts the marked shift from public to private markets in the US over the past quarter of a century and suggests the trend may accelerate. This has massive implications for investors, executives and policymakers.</p><p>The data is striking. Since 1996, the number of US publicly listed companies has halved to 3,640 as a result of acquisitions and a slowing pipeline of initial public offerings. Many start-ups, which might previously have gone public, are software businesses with minimal capital requirements and ready access to private market funding.\u00a0In 2017, US companies raised $3tn in private markets, twice as much as in public markets. Some newer companies are swallowed by the Big Tech companies and never reach an IPO.</p><p>On the other side of the equation, institutional fund managers are desperately searching for higher returns in a world of ultra-low interest rates. They also want to prove their worth, given the popularity of passive funds. Private markets appear to promise most on both.\u00a0</p><p>According to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.preqin.com/insights/research/investor-outlooks/preqin-investor-outlook-alternative-assets-h1-2020\"> Prequin survey of institutional investors</url>, almost 40 per cent intend to increase their exposure to alternative assets. Every 1 per cent shift in asset allocation from public to private equities equates to about $390bn in assets. In 2019, the total commitments to US private equity and venture capital were about $315bn.</p><p>But as Morgan Stanley drily notes: \u201cPeriods of strong investor commitments are generally followed by periods of weak returns.\u201d A lot of spillage results when pouring a barrel straight into a carafe.</p><p>There are many reasons to doubt whether the large funds will get the returns they are seeking from VC, in particular. As SoftBank has found, there are few big scalable investment opportunities in the start-up world, meaning new entrants often move valuations against themselves. Besides, as we have seen with recent tech <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92478bb8-2887-11ea-9a4f-963f0ec7e134\"> IPOs such as Uber</url>, the best antidote to private market overvaluation is public market scrutiny.</p><p>Overall, the eye-catching returns of the big winners in VC obscure the abject performance of most funds. Not only do the VCs clustered on Silicon Valley\u2019s Sand Hill Road have access to the best tech deals, but many entrepreneurs seek out strong brand names for bragging rights, making it hard for newcomers to establish themselves.</p><p>Rather than shifting ever more assets to private markets, mainstream institutional investors would be better advised to help make public markets more welcoming for start-ups.</p><p>They should lobby stock market operators and regulators to reduce the costs and burdens of being a public company. They should press governments to stop treating debt more favourably than equity and pursue tough antitrust policies to prevent the next generation of IPO-able start-ups from being sucked into Big Tech\u2019s maw.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w21181#:~:text=Craig%20Doidge%2C%20G.,Stulz&amp;text=We%20call%20this%20the%20%E2%80%9CU.S.,investigate%20possible%20explanations%20for%20it.&amp;text=The%20high%20delist%20rate%20is,history%20and%20to%20other%20countries.\"> Researchers</url> who have modelled the relationship between gross domestic product, population and governance data have found that there may be a \u201clisting gap\u201d in the US of between 5,800 and 12,200 public stocks. </p><p>Institutional fund managers would benefit most from plugging that gap in public markets. They should be playing the game they know best, rather than fooling around with investment taekwondo.\u00a0</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-0c796a99f86244d7a5b01f6f0b98437d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M5-XY31-JB77-K0KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002LTC</classCode><className>SOFTBANK CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp;

Some might have yet to embrace the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But after the tsunami of revelations about Russian infiltration of Facebook's platform in the 2016 presidential election and the misuse of user data by Cambridge Analytica, these members of Congress finally have woken up to the urgency to protect the personal information collected by giant social media platforms.</p><p> Regulation is needed. Everyone knows it. The uncertainty and challenge are the form and extent of new privacy rules. But they must come, because Facebookhas proved time and again that the government cannot leave that task to it and others like Instagram and Twitter.</p><p> In 2011, Facebookentered into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission regarding charges that it deceived users by telling them their data could remain private while allowing it to be made public and shared. Not much has changed. On the eve of <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>testimony, advocacy and privacy groups accused YouTube, whose corporate parent is Google, of illegally collecting data on millions of child users.</p><p> The tipping point for this week's grilling of <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>- the House Energy and Commerce Committee took its turn Wednesday - was recent news that Cambridge, the British firm that received nearly $6 million from <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>campaign, improperly gained access to the data of 87 million Facebookusers to develop psychological profiles for targeting voters.</p><p> Regulations should reflect basic principles. Users should have to agree to allow their data, which range from biographical information to personal interests and contacts, to be collected and shared. Users should not be forced to opt out of collection. The process of granting permission should be easy to understand. There should be limits on how data are shared with companies and how they use the information. A bipartisan Senate bill to require disclosures about who paid for online campaign ads is a starting point for a different, but similarly troublesome front. Europe is ahead of us, with privacy rules set to take effect in May. Congress must decide whether it also likes the European stick: fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies that misuse users' data.</p><p>America is at a turning point. Skepticism of big tech is growing. People are realizing that if they are not paying for something, they themselves are the product being sold. The #Delete-Facebookmovement includes lots of regular folks among the platform's 2.2 billion users, and tech giants like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla/ SpaceX founder <person><nameText>Elon Musk. </nameText></person>Privacy-oriented sites are seeing slow but steady increases in users.</p><p><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said he accepts responsibility for all the mistakes and spent lots of time Tuesday apologizing. We've seen the apology tour before. And more might be necessary. Given Facebook's recent announcement that the data of vastly more people had been breached by Cambridge than originally thought, it seems unlikely that the company knows the full extent of possible data misuse by other parties.</p><p> The law, it is said, is always behind the technology. It's time for our government to catch up.</p><p> NEWSDAY</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REPTRY-33fd44fc09f5b5f1150f2f35fce39825</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REPTRY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3C-TXH1-DXVP-V13S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387651</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 GateHouse Media, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Expect disinformation: The FBI and the government's top cybersecurity agency alerted the public to an imminent wave of online disinformation after the November election.</p><p>FULL BRIEFING</p><p>1. Majority of Americans favor greater regulation of Big Tech, poll finds</p><p>Amid a national debate over whether the government should use antitrust laws to break up large technology companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, six in 10 Americans believe Silicon Valley should be subject to greater government regulation, according to a new Consumer Reports poll.</p><p>Nearly 80 percent of Americans say mergers and acquisitions by Big Tech companies unfairly hurt competition and consumers, according to the poll released Thursday, and three-quarters say the power amassed by online platforms is a moderate or major problem in the United States today.</p><p>\"This survey shows that Americans are alarmed about the negative impact that a handful of giant technology platforms are having on their daily lives,\" George Slover, senior policy counsel at Consumer Reports, said in a statement. \"Consumers can see firsthand the harms these companies are causing, and recognize that it is denying them the range of quality choices for products and services at fair prices.\"</p><p>The poll comes as federal and state agencies are considering antitrust enforcement action against the companies, and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle weigh the need for new antitrust laws better suited to regulate companies such as Facebook and Google, which offer their products for free.</p><p>This week, Justice Department officials met with various state attorneys general about an ongoing antitrust probe of Google, which is said to be focused on the company's search engine and whether it directs users to search results ultimately beneficial to its own advertising model. Reports indicated that the antitrust enforcement action by DOJ and various states could come this fall.</p><p>Nearly half the respondents to the Consumer Reports poll said they found it hard to distinguish between a paid advertisement and an objective search result.</p><p>The mostly online poll, with some people contacted by phone and mail, was conducted between July 7 and 22 and used a nationally representative sample of 3,219 respondents. The margin of error is 2.17 percentage points.</p><p>The full survey is available here. </p><p>2. Former executive says Facebook followed Big Tobacco's playbook to hook users</p><p>A former Facebook executive on Thursday told House lawmakers that the social media giant borrowed Big Tobacco's playbook to make its platform as addictive as possible.</p><p>\"We sought to mine as much attention as humanly possible and turn it into historically unprecedented profits,\" Tim Kendall, who was Facebook's director of monetization, told the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee. \"To do this, we didn't simply create something useful and fun. We took a page from Big Tobacco's playbook, working to make our offering addictive at the outset.\"</p><p>Kendall worked at Facebook from 2006 until 2010 before working for another social media company, Pinterest. In 2018, he started a new company called Moment, which designs an app that monitors users' phone habits and is designed to \"break your screen and social media addiction,\" according to the company.</p><p>By allowing misinformation, conspiracy theories and fake news to flourish on its platform, Kendall said Facebook was mimicking what tobacco companies did to keep smokers hooked to cigarettes by adding sugar, menthol, ammonia and other additives to lessen irritation.</p><p>\"Facebook's ability to deliver this incendiary content to the right person, at the right time, in the exact right way ... that is their ammonia,\" Kendall said.</p><p>The hearing, titled \"Mainstreaming Extremism: Social Media's Role in Radicalizing America,\" comes as the White House and lawmakers of both parties accuse social media companies of censoring their side's voices while allowing their opponents to flourish.</p><p>It's unclear how or if Congress will act to curb the legal freedom that social media companies enjoy without taking responsibility for content posted by users.</p><p>Congress has held multiple hearings in the last three years focusing on the problem of hate speech and violent content on social media platforms. After several violent episodes involving gunmen shooting worshippers in mosques and churches, social media companies have said they're stepping up to monitor and remove such content. But companies have balked at policing messages that are tinged with political overtones.</p><p>\"We've had several hearings over the past few years trying to shine light on these problems and imploring social media companies to act,\" Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., chairman of the full committee said. \"It's clear they won't do it on their own\" and Congress may have to step in, he said.</p><p>While extremist ideas are not new in the United States, social media platforms are spreading them far and wide, said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., chairwoman of the subcommittee, citing the history of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi movements.</p><p>\"What's different today is how social media algorithms can amplify hate speech,\" Schakowsky said. \"Social media's dark side has grown and divided Americans.\"</p><p>Freedom of speech is being undermined by social media companies, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., the top Republican on the subcommittee said. \"I'm extremely concerned when platforms apply inconsistent content moderating policies for their own purposes,\" Rodgers said. \"There's no clearer example of a platform using its power for political purposes than Twitter.\"</p><p>Rodgers said Twitter has singled out tweets by Republican commentators and lawmakers as well as President Donald Trump, while allowing \"blatant threats of violence by activists\" as well as Democratic candidates and foreign leaders \"untouched.\"           </p><p>Social media platforms are now being used to whip up social unrest focused on the killing of Black people by police officers, said John Donahue, a former New York City police officer who now teaches at Rutgers University.</p><p>Messages and memes circulating on platforms are potentially leading to insurgencies, Donahue said. \"America is at a crossroads, the intersection of constitutional rights and legitimate law enforcement, public safety, and civil society has never been more at risk by domestic actors as it is now as seditionists actively promote a revolution,\" Donahue said.</p><p>Legislative fixes may be needed so that social media companies can work collaboratively among themselves as well as with law enforcement agencies, he said.</p><p>-- Gopal Ratnam</p><p>3. Justice Department sends Section 230 proposal to Congress as Trump trashes social media companies</p><p>The Justice Department on Wednesday sent Congress a legislative package proposing changes to a law that protects technology companies such as Facebook and Twitter from lawsuits stemming from third-party content posted on their platforms.</p><p>Based on recommendations released by the department in June, the legislative package arrived on Capitol Hill amid a flurry of attacks on social media companies and their prized liability shield -- commonly known as Section 230 for the part of the Communications Decency Act that regulates online companies -- by President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers angry with Silicon Valley over alleged anti-conservative bias online.</p><p>To counter such alleged bias, Justice is proposing to clarify Section 230's language that currently allows technology companies to regulate content on their platform deemed \"otherwise objectionable,\" meaning it is not illegal but may violate the company's terms and conditions for use. Immunity would be limited to moderation of illegal content or content promoting terrorism, self-harm or violent extremism.</p><p>The proposal would also remove immunity for the internet companies from civil suits and antitrust claims filed by federal agencies.</p><p>\"For too long, Section 230 has provided a shield for online platforms to operate with impunity,\" said Attorney General William Barr in a statement.</p><p>Barr urged Congress to enshrine the proposal in law and \"begin to hold online platforms accountable both when they unlawfully censor speech and when they knowingly facilitate criminal activity online.\"</p><p>Speaking alongside Barr and a group of Republican state attorneys general at the White House, Trump accused social media companies \"tightening their grip over commerce and communications in America.\"</p><p>\"They've used this power to engage in unscrupulous business practices while simultaneously waging war on free enterprise and free expression,\" Trump said. At the urging of the radical left, these platforms have become intolerant of diverse political views and abusive toward their own users.\"</p><p>Scrutiny of Section 230 has come from both sides of the aisle. The law, long credited with enabling Silicon Valley's rise in recent decades, has emerged as a prime target for Congress as lawmakers seek to rein in the power of technology companies following the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Senate Republicans have already introduced legislation mirroring aspects of the Justice Department proposal. Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., have both introduced bills (S 4632, S 4534) that would regulate how social media companies moderate content on their platforms.</p><p>Graham's bill, which also includes provisions of a bipartisan bill (S 1273) that would establish the Copyright Claims Board within the U.S. Copyright Office to handle small-claims copyright cases, was set for a markup by the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, but the proceedings were dominated by a discussion of the Supreme Court vacancy and consideration of the bill was deferred.</p><p>On Thursday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., a high-profile critic of Big Tech, sought unanimous consent to pass his legislation (S 3983) that would allow members of the public to sue social media companies if those companies violate their own terms of service, but he was blocked by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.</p><p>Co-signing Hawley's bill is Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., who introduced a separate bill (S 4062) that also seeks to address alleged anti-conservative bias.</p><p>While it remains unclear whether any changes to Section 230 can ultimately make it to Trump's desk, multiple pieces of bipartisan legislation are thought to have the best chance. A bill (S 3398) sponsored by Graham and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, would revoke automatic Section 230 immunity from companies and force them to earn it back through content moderation.</p><p>Another bill (S 4066), introduced by Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, would allow companies to retain their Section 230 immunity as long as they post publicly their content moderation practices and explain why certain content is removed.</p><p>Nearly all the proposals have met resistance from the technology industry as well as from civil liberties advocates, who say the government should not have a hand in moderating speech online.</p><p>\"Members of Congress would be wise to follow the sound logic of their predecessors who created Section 230,\" said Gaurav Laroia, policy counsel at the nonpartisan advocacy group Free Press Action. \"A regime of government-mandated speech completely undermines efforts to promote free speech and a diversity of views online. Congress should respect the Constitution and the First Amendment and reject this dangerous attempt to push online platforms into service of all things Trump.\"</p><p>You can find a section-by-section breakdown of the Justice Department's proposed changes to Section 230 here. </p><p>4. FBI, CISA warn against looming wave of disinformation about election results</p><p>Foreign hackers and cybercriminals could spread disinformation about the results of the 2020 elections as they will not be known on Election Night because of an increase in absentee and mail-in ballots prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, federal agencies warned this week.</p><p>\"Foreign actors and cybercriminals could create new websites, change existing websites, and create or share corresponding social media content to spread false information in an attempt to discredit the electoral process and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions,\" the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a joint release on Tuesday.</p><p>Because it will take additional time to certify election results, bad actors \"could exploit the time required to certify and announce elections' results by disseminating disinformation that includes reports of voter suppression, cyberattacks targeting election infrastructure, voter or ballot fraud, and other problems intended to convince the public of the elections' illegitimacy,\" the agencies said.</p><p>Read more from my colleague Herb Jackson, whose latest CQ Magazine column explains how disinformation could throw an already fraught election season further into chaos. </p><p>SCHEDULES</p><p>Check out CQ Roll Call's up-to-date daily schedule of congressional hearings and more.

When it comes to freedom of speech, everyone has a right to their opinion as long as it is not inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious. If that line is crossed, the perpetrators are legally liable for damages. But in America, the world's most irresponsible media empires - Twitter, Facebook and Google (now Alphabet) - have become giants that allow anyone to spew anything without legal consequences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They have gotten away with it by claiming that they are platforms, not publishers, and are therefore exempt from having to edit or curate what people post. They've also spent billions of dollars lobbying and supporting political campaigns, in order to retain this corrosive privilege.</p><p>By contrast, traditional media is hobbled with the costs of curating responsible advertising and editorial content.</p><p>This free pass to social media is the loophole through which that reckless, self-promoter named Donald Trump tweeted his way into the White House. It's how he and other trolls intimidate, bully and slander their foes.</p><p>Europe has begun reining in social media, but elsewhere, these companies operate with impunity and claim that they are entitled to self-regulate. But monkeys cannot guard bananas, and Trump's recent, and most vile, gaming of Twitter illustrates why the same rules should apply to social media as they apply to everyone else.</p><p>Last week, Trump smeared a critic, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, blaming him for the death of his assistant, Lori Klausutis, when Scarborough was serving in Congress in 2001, even though there is no evidence of any wrongdoing. The president tweeted on the subject six times, calling the woman's death a \"cold case\" that should investigated, then essentially accusing Scarborough of murder. Twitter refused to remove the tweets, even after the woman's widower, T.J. Klausutis, wrote to Twitter's president and pointed out the injustice and the social network's hypocrisy.</p><p>\"Nearly 19 years ago, my wife, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, fell and hit her head on her desk at work. She was found dead the next morning,\" he wrote. \"The president's tweet that suggests that Lori was murdered - without evidence (and contrary to the official autopsy) - is a violation of Twitter's community rules and terms of service. An ordinary user like me would be banished from the platform for such a tweet, but I am only asking that these tweets be removed.\"</p><p>Twitter refused to comment on the issue. Meanwhile, Facebook, to which Trump's unsupported allegation and libel was cross-posted, responded arrogantly: \"We do not remove political speech solely because people may find it offensive, as this content understandably is to the family of Lori Klausutis and others. Speech from candidates and heads of state is among the most scrutinized content on our platform, which helps ensure people are held accountable for their words.\"</p><p>This week, Twitter finally did something to bridle this presidential misbehaviour when it labelled a pair of Trump's tweets, which claimed that mail-in balloting in this fall's election would result in widespread voter fraud, as misleading. (No labels have been applied to the Scarborough tweets.)</p><p>Trump erupted and has threatened to take action against Twitter and social media in general. Then he conflated this with a fight for freedom and tweeted: \"Big Tech is doing everything in their considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let that happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely crazy. Stay tuned!!!\" This from a president who labels all critical media as \"fake news\" and has driven his tank through social media's anything-goes loophole to damage people, organizations, groups and democracy.</p><p>What's next is that Trump will character assassinate all his opponents and, if he loses the election, he will simply tweet that it was stolen and he's not leaving.

When it comes to freedom of speech, everyone has a right to their opinion as long as it is not inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious.

They've also spent billions of dollars lobbying and supporting political campaigns, in order to retain this corrosive privilege.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By contrast, traditional media is hobbled with the costs of curating responsible advertising and editorial content.</p><p>This free pass to social media is the loophole through which that reckless, self-promoter named Donald Trump tweeted his way into the White House.

But monkeys cannot guard bananas, and Trump's recent, and most vile, gaming of Twitter illustrates why the same rules should apply to social media as they apply to everyone else.</p><p>Last week, Trump smeared a critic, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, blaming him for the death of his assistant, Lori Klausutis, when Scarborough was serving in Congress in 2001, even though there is no evidence of any wrongdoing. The president tweeted on the subject six times, calling the woman's death a \"cold case\" that should investigated, then essentially accusing Scarborough of murder. Twitter refused to remove the tweets, even after the woman's widower, T.J. Klausutis, wrote to Twitter's president and pointed out the injustice and the social network's hypocrisy.</p><p>\"Nearly 19 years ago, my wife, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, fell and hit her head on her desk at work. She was found dead the next morning,\" he wrote. \"The president's tweet that suggests that Lori was murdered - without evidence (and contrary to the official autopsy) - is a violation of Twitter's community rules and terms of service. An ordinary user like me would be banished from the platform for such a tweet, but I am only asking that these tweets be removed.\"</p><p>Twitter refused to comment on the issue. Meanwhile, Facebook, to which Trump's unsupported allegation and libel was cross-posted, responded arrogantly: \"We do not remove political speech solely because people may find it offensive, as this content understandably is to the family of Lori Klausutis and others. Speech from candidates and heads of state is among the most scrutinized content on our platform, which helps ensure people are held accountable for their words.\"</p><p>This week, Twitter finally did something to bridle this presidential misbehaviour when it labelled a pair of Trump's tweets, which claimed that mail-in balloting in this fall's election would result in widespread voter fraud, as misleading. (No labels have been applied to the Scarborough tweets.)</p><p>Trump erupted and has threatened to take action against Twitter and social media in general. Then he conflated this with a fight for freedom and tweeted: \"Big Tech is doing everything in their considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let that happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely crazy. Stay tuned!!!\" This from a president who labels all critical media as \"fake news\" and has driven his tank through social media's anything-goes loophole to damage people, organizations, groups and democracy.</p><p>What's next is that Trump will character assassinate all his opponents and, if he loses the election, he will simply tweet that it was stolen and he's not leaving.

When it comes to freedom of speech, everyone has a right to their opinion as long as it is not inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious. If that line is crossed, the perpetrators are legally liable for damages. But in America, the world's most irresponsible media empires - Twitter, Facebook and Google (now Alphabet) - have become giants that allow anyone to spew anything without legal consequences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They have gotten away with it by claiming that they are platforms, not publishers, and are therefore exempt from having to edit or curate what people post. They've also spent billions of dollars lobbying and supporting political campaigns, in order to retain this corrosive privilege.</p><p>By contrast, traditional media is hobbled with the costs of curating responsible advertising and editorial content.</p><p>This free pass to social media is the loophole through which that reckless, self-promoter named Donald Trump tweeted his way into the White House. It's how he and other trolls intimidate, bully and slander their foes.</p><p>Europe has begun reining in social media, but elsewhere, these companies operate with impunity and claim that they are entitled to self-regulate. But monkeys cannot guard bananas, and Trump's recent, and most vile, gaming of Twitter illustrates why the same rules should apply to social media as they apply to everyone else.</p><p>Last week, Trump smeared a critic, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, blaming him for the death of his assistant, Lori Klausutis, when Scarborough was serving in Congress in 2001, even though there is no evidence of any wrongdoing. The president tweeted on the subject six times, calling the woman's death a \"cold case\" that should investigated, then essentially accusing Scarborough of murder. Twitter refused to remove the tweets, even after the woman's widower, T.J. Klausutis, wrote to Twitter's president and pointed out the injustice and the social network's hypocrisy.</p><p>\"Nearly 19 years ago, my wife, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, fell and hit her head on her desk at work. She was found dead the next morning,\" he wrote. \"The president's tweet that suggests that Lori was murdered - without evidence (and contrary to the official autopsy) - is a violation of Twitter's community rules and terms of service. An ordinary user like me would be banished from the platform for such a tweet, but I am only asking that these tweets be removed.\"</p><p>Twitter refused to comment on the issue. Meanwhile, Facebook, to which Trump's unsupported allegation and libel was cross-posted, responded arrogantly: \"We do not remove political speech solely because people may find it offensive, as this content understandably is to the family of Lori Klausutis and others. Speech from candidates and heads of state is among the most scrutinized content on our platform, which helps ensure people are held accountable for their words.\"</p><p>This week, Twitter finally did something to bridle this presidential misbehaviour when it labelled a pair of Trump's tweets, which claimed that mail-in balloting in this fall's election would result in widespread voter fraud, as misleading. (No labels have been applied to the Scarborough tweets.)</p><p>Trump erupted and has threatened to take action against Twitter and social media in general. Then he conflated this with a fight for freedom and tweeted: \"Big Tech is doing everything in their considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let that happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely crazy. Stay tuned!!!\" This from a president who labels all critical media as \"fake news\" and has driven his tank through social media's anything-goes loophole to damage people, organizations, groups and democracy.</p><p>What's next is that Trump will character assassinate all his opponents and, if he loses the election, he will simply tweet that it was stolen and he's not leaving.
