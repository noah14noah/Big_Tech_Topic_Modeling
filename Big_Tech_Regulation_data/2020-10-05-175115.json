BRYAN JORDAN, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us here in Nashville. I hope everybody had a good time last night. It's important that you're here for a couple of reasons. One, we wanted you to see Nashville, and we wanted you to see really the dynamic thing that is going on here in the middle of Tennessee. It is, by far, the fastest-growing city and economy in our homestay here in Tennessee. And we wanted you to see the vibrancy here, but we also want to show you the foundation that we'll talk about throughout the day. What we've done here over the last 4 or 5 years under Carol Yochem's leadership, you'll hear more about. But we believe very strongly that we can do that in 2019, '20, '21 and beyond in markets like Raleigh, Charlotte, South Florida. So you'll hear more about that.</p><p>With us today, we have a number of our leadership team. You'll hear from them throughout the course of the day. This is a brief agenda. I think you might have a copy on your -- each of your tables. David, who joined the bank in 2008, will start off with banking. You'll hear from Carol Yochem and Jeff Jackson. Carol joined the organization 4, 5 years ago. Carol leads our market here in Middle Tennessee, and she'll give you a good background of what we're doing here. Jeff Jackson has been with us most recently in Chattanooga, and then he moved to South Florida in the last several months and is now leading our effort there in South Florida, doing a great job in the early days of recruiting and attracting talent to the platform. And you'll hear more about that. And then joining David, Susan and Jeff will be Susan Springfield, our Chief Credit Officer, for Q&amp;A in a little bit. After a break, you'll hear from Tammy LoCascio and Chris Van Steenberg in Q&amp;A. Tammy has been with the organization about 5 years. She runs our retail, wealth management, consumer businesses. Chris runs our deposit product. He's been with the organization about 3 to 4 years. Todd Jones is the newest leader in our commercial business. Todd was named to this position about 3 months ago. Todd joined us through our restaurant franchise finance acquisition from GE about 2 years ago and the process of moving from just miserable climate in the Southwest in Phoenix to something a little more moderate like Memphis, Tennessee, where we actually have 2 seasons, winter and summer. And then you'll hear in the Q&amp;A session joining them will be Steve Hawkins. Steve has been with the organization 30-plus years and a very senior leader in the organization, most recently running our commercial businesses. Steve plans to retire in 2019. So in addition to helping with the transition, he is the founder and builder of most of our specialty businesses in partnership with a number of the folks that are around the room today. You'll hear from our newest member after lunch, Dawn Morris. Dawn is in her third month with the organization. She is our Digital Banking and Chief Marketing Officer. She is bringing up a lot of energy and new ideas to the organization, and she will give you a good overview of what she plans to do and where she plans to take the organization in that regard. And then all of you know BJ. BJ has been with the organization, coming up on 10 years now, sort of. He joined us right as we rolled out the bonefish. In fact, BJ gets the credit for offering that, enrolling that out across the organization. We'll talk more about that.</p><p>To prove to you that I'm not going to read all the slides, I'm going to start with this one. This is our forward-looking statement. It is in small print, but it is important. We will talk about the future. We'll say words like believe and think and -- just put qualification around all of it. We don't know what we don't know, but we're going to give you our best view of the future of the organization.</p><p>The theme for the day, as most of you had a chance to flip through the slides, are proven, focused and better. This is a team of leaders that I'm very, very proud to work with. And as you hear from them, you'll understand the capabilities that they bring to the organization and what they really can do to transform our business as we move into 2019, 2020, 2021, but we have a very strong foundation. We have transitioned the business over the last 8 to 10 years. We've transformed it in very meaningful ways: lower risk balance sheet, more profitable balance sheet. And you'll see that as we go through the day. This is also a leadership team that is very focused. It has a focused strategy to create value, to create value based on economic profitability, looking at the capital we put to work and the returns that we get on that capital. And finally, we do believe that we have better opportunities. We think we can continue to be a better organization. We have better strategies and better markets. And you'll see throughout the day information about the demographics and the opportunities that we have, not only here in our home state of Tennessee, but the additions of the markets in the Carolinas and South Florida through the acquisition merger with Capital Bank.</p><p>So the second reason we wanted you here today is to deliver to you our strongly felt belief that we are going to create superior value and outperform the industry over the next several years given the foundation that we have and the opportunities that we have as an organization.</p><p>Most of you know I joined the organization in 2007 immediately before the financial crisis. Most of you probably know and believe that I didn't cause the financial crisis. I was named CEO in September of 2008, 7 days before Fannie and Freddie failed. So September 2008 I think was roughly 25 (sic) [10] years ago. Over that period of time, we have done a tremendous amount of repositioning of our organization. Everybody knows we exited the mortgage business. We worked out of our nonstrategic portfolios and mortgage issues, particularly repurchase risk. The nonstrategic portfolio in January of 2009 was roughly $7 billion. The balances today are under $1 billion. It's been a $7 billion headwind for about 10 years now. We focused the business on profitability. We rolled out our bonefish targets. We retrained the organization. We went from a focus on growth to profitable growth, a very significant transition. You'll hear more about how we built the business, the specialty businesses. You'll hear more about our footprint, but we are positioned with a very strong foundation for growth and profitability.</p><p>We'll do what we say we'll do. We'll do what we say we will do. In 2009, when BJ joined the organization, we created the bonefish, essentially a road map for you to understand where we were taking the organization. It was dimensioned in financial dynamics, and BJ will talk about those later today. We created transparency. We try to give you a tremendous amount of information on our balance sheet, our risks and how we thought the business would perform over the foreseeable years. But one thing we didn't anticipate is that the recovery would be so slow and take so long, and that we'd still be dealing with the mortgage business 5, 6 years on. But this is a team that is focused on making commitments and delivering on those commitments, taking profitability tools and driving profitability and shareholder value creation.</p><p>The past year, the hard work on getting the Capital Bank integration merger completed was not on announcement day. It really started in the summer of 2017, and it went through some time in the early part of the third quarter of this year. We spent a lot of time leading up to the Capital Bank merger thinking about the strategy and how important the markets were, the culture of the organization. You heard in the video the First Power culture and our strong belief that culture matters. The way that we interact with each other, the way we interact with our customers all matters. All that was important to get right. And the integration involved culture and people and training, and it also involved making sure we got it right for customers. If we didn't do Capital Bank right, nothing else mattered in the last year. And I can say that integration is done. I feel very, very good about the outcome, the work that was done and that it was done well. We spent over 30,000 hours training people, over 200,000 outbound calls to our customers, all in an effort to make sure that we were prepared on Memorial Day weekend to deliver as seamless an integration as we possibly could. It had some impact. When you do that much effort, it requires an inward focus. So it had impact on growth and growth dynamics. We got the integration done, as I said, early in the third quarter, and we saw that organization turned back outward, focused on customers and customer growth and started to see tremendous building of the momentum, both customer acquisition on the commercial and the retail side. You'll hear more about that. So we got the integration done.</p><p>One of the key elements of any merger is delivering on the cost saves. When we announced it in May of 2017, we said we'd save roughly $65 million. Today, we have $85 million largely built into our run rate. You'll see a chart from BJ later that shows you where we are. We think we have done that in a thoughtful, meaningful way that will not adversely impact customers. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to build on the cost savings that we've achieved.</p><p>We announced the transaction, we didn't say anything about revenue synergies, other than we expect there to be some. A year ago, I said I think -- we think that we can deliver $25 million to $30 million of incremental revenue synergies. Today, we have $31 million already booked or in the process of being booked. And we truly believe, and you'll hear throughout the day, that we have just begun to scratch the surface in terms of creating revenue leverage with our expanded footprint, our expanded customer base and our bigger, more flexible balance sheet for customers.</p><p>We strengthened the balance sheet. We took some low-yield and some high-yield assets. High-yield, high-risk assets off the balance sheet over the last several quarters. Admittedly, we could have been smarter about the impact that, that had on headline loan growth numbers because, as you'll see in a chart BJ shows you later, it did depress our loan growth trends. But we think about our balance sheet not so much quarter-to-quarter. We think about it for the long term. And I firmly believe that those actions, those steps were the right ones to take to position the business for the long term.</p><p>I've mentioned a couple of times bonefish. We said 15-plus percent returns in 2008 (sic) [2018]. We hit that with north of 17% returns through the third quarter of this year. And you'll hear from BJ later that our outlook for the future is that we will continue to produce very strong returns on capital, a 1.20% ROA. In spite of the headwinds from the nonstrategic portfolio, 6% compounded loan growth, 9% compounded deposit growth, we've shifted the mix of our balance sheet to a more profitable commercially-oriented business, particularly with a focus on our specialty businesses.</p><p>Our deposit base is expanding. Tennessee is a great deposit market. We have #1 share here. We have opened up with the Capital Bank merger and integration. The North Carolina, South Carolina and South Florida markets, and as you will see later, they are huge. And we have the ability to be a disruptive competitor in those markets and the ability, in our view, to generate a tremendous amount of deposit growth over the next several years.</p><p>We've deployed capital. Over the last several years, we've bought back about 10% of the company. We've completed 7 mergers, including the Capital Bank merger, TrustAtlantic, Mountain National. I mentioned restaurant franchise finance, all of which are adding to our profitability and our growth dynamics. And finally, in the third quarter, we sold our Visa B shares, adding $161 million to our capital base, improving our capital ratios by about 50 basis points and improving our tangible book value per share by $0.64. The capital ratios are important, and I'll come back to that.</p><p>In the video, you heard we have created shareholder value. We pick 5 years, you can pick any period you want. But over the last 5 years, 5 years because our last Investor Day was November 20, 2013, we have outperformed our regional bank index. You can see the strong EPS growth and quarterly dividends growth.</p><p>We play to our strengths. Our business, the financial services industry is going through a tremendous amount of change, and we don't think that we're immune to that nor do we think that we'll be doing business the same way in 3 years, 5 years, 10 years that we're doing business today. I firmly believe that on the whole that it's going to be extraordinarily difficult for the average or the median financial institution to create shareholder value in meaningful ways over the next 5, 10, 15 years. And why do I say that? Because business models are being changed daily, changed daily by technology. The largest financial institutions in the U.S. are spending billions on an annual basis. And all of you have models on us, and you know we don't spend billions on anything. But we also have confidence that while you don't win with technology, you can darn sure lose with it and that we can be fast followers, that we can make the needed investments in technology and infrastructure to be competitive, table stakes, so to speak. And our focus is on figuring out the right technologies to invest in and to invest in those technologies in ways that provide differentiation to our customer base.</p><p>Specialization is our advantage. I've talked about the specialty businesses, and those are unique. They're very scalable. They're regional, and in some cases, national. But we're also specialized in our markets. You'll hear more from David and Carol, Jeff, Todd, Tammy later. We push decision-making close to the customer. We know our customers. We know our markets, and we really do try to compete in a differentiated way. We are keenly aware that all good decisions are not made in Memphis or any other city in this U.S. Knowing your customers and serving them with specialization and customization is extraordinarily important to being successful and growing in the banking business.</p><p>And finally, success is a matter of the business model. We intend to keep decisions close to customers. We intend to differentiate. We intend to be a fast follower on the necessary technology to be at table stakes. While scale matters, scale is not a game that I believe that you can win. I feel very, very good that our balance sheet puts us in the sweet spot. It puts us in a position where we're big enough to provide big-bank products and services, to take meaningful hold positions in transactions, to use our capital to facilitate customer activity. And we're small enough to be flexible and nimble in our decision-making, our customization and knowing our customers in meaningful ways.</p><p>I started with an analogy last night. I was talking to Ken Zerbe. And I said in some ways, it's not a perfect analogy. And as a coffee drinker -- I'll disclose my vice. As a coffee drinker, I see coffee as a commodity. But you look at what people do to get coffee at Starbucks. I drove to the office yesterday morning, the entire right lane of Union Avenue, Marty knows it, was blocked with people trying to turn in to Starbucks. And they had just missed 3, or 4 or 5 convenience store gas stations. They missed a Dunkin' Donuts. They missed a lot of places to get coffee, and banking is similar to that. Ken came up with a better analogy for me. He said, \"You know, that's interesting.\" He said a lot of us here tonight, a lot of you here today write research. And all research is not a commodity, right? Everybody brings an edge to it. Everybody brings a different perspective. And that's what we're doing in the banking business. It's a commodity-based product set. Our loan documents are no easier to read. Our money is no greener, but we can deliver it in a differentiated, thoughtful way using analytics about where value is created and where it's destroyed. And we can deliver meaningful shareholder value, and we can do it in a differentiated way that performs the broader industry.</p><p>There's 2 buttons here, and I can't seem to get the right one. Too many choices. We have a lower-risk business model. We have a highly commercially-focused business. Over the last 5 years, we have made meaningful improvement in the quality of that portfolio, using our tools around profitability but also disaggregating our risk and thinking about diversification and how the balance sheet will perform through many cycles. You can see here a slide, just the credit grade equivalents, tremendous improvement in credit quality.</p><p>In spite of the fact that DFAST disclosure is not required, we intend to disclose it to you because we think 2 things about capital. One, you need to have a safe and sound balance sheet and adequate capital, and you don't need excess capital. You need to get excess capital back in the hands of shareholders, if you came invested in the business profitably. And to do both of those things, you have to run stress testing. So we intend to continue to run the DFAST as a management tool, and we intend to lay it out to you. We put it in our third quarter analyst packet, which was rolled out in the, gosh, August time frame. And you can see here, cumulative loss rates. BJ will come back to that. But capital efficiency and capital adequacy go hand-in-glove, and so we intend to keep you informed about that. But we feel very, very good about our capital base and our ability to stand the ups and downs in the business cycle.</p><p>I mentioned better opportunities, great markets with strong market shares, quickly growing specialized businesses, $730 billion of opportunity in the new markets where we have smaller shares and the ability to be an aggressive competitor. And finally, very strong demographics, strong household growth rates, household income growth rates. And when you look at a business in an economy, it's going to grow. Pick your number, 2%, 3% in the aggregate. Being in better markets with better opportunity matters, and we're well positioned in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and South Florida to deliver better results.</p><p>So our strategic priorities over the next several years. We're the leading financial institution in terms of deposit share in Tennessee, and we intend to continue to win here. We intend to continue to intend to grow our specialty businesses and capitalize on the new markets that we have. We truly do mean to transform the customer experience. We know to be successful, we have to change our business, break the traditional paradigms about banking. And how we put technology to use, how we go to market, all of those things are in play. We'll give you a lot of estimates or guesses about where we think we need to be 2, 3 years down the road, but we also know that we're not playing solitaire. We recognize that we've got to adapt and we've got to adjust. And then finally, optimize our expense base. BJ will have a slide later that shows you how we have managed expenses over the last 10 years. BJ also coined the term about 10 years ago, control what we can control. And we truly believe that we can control our expenses. We have controlled our expenses, and we expect to continue to do that. We know we're going to make investments in technology. We also believe we have to cover that with our existing run rate. We don't see it as incremental ads, and you'll hear some of the tools of how we get there.</p><p>So in summary, the 5 key things for investment thesis. Over the last 5 years, we've delivered results. We have a strong profile. We have great and many growth opportunities. We are focused on capital and capital deployment, and we have a lower-risk balance sheet that will perform through many cycles.</p><p>So as you leave here today, the 3 key takeaways that we're going to deliver value by using a proven team with a focused strategy and better opportunities for delivering shareholder return.</p><p>Now if you would, please welcome to the platform, David Popwell, our President of Banking. David?</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL, PRESIDENT OF BANKING - FIRST TENNESSEE BANK, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: All right. Thank you, Bryan, and thank you to all of you for being here today. A little bit about myself. As Bryan said, I'm the President of Banking at First Tennessee. I joined First Tennessee in May of 2007 as the President of our Memphis bank. In September of 2008, I was named the Chief Operating Officer for the overall regional bank. And then 6 years ago, in 2012, I was named President of Banking for First Tennessee.</p><p>Around 5 years ago, at the time of our last Investor Day, the regional bank set a goal of doubling economic profit over the next 5 years, and we did it. We hit the number, and in fact, we exceeded it. What did we do? 3 things. Number one, we focused on enhancing the most profitable segments of our business by growing core deposits and increasing our emphasis on higher-return specialty lending. Two, we executed with the best interest of our customers in mind. And then finally, we hired, retained and developed great bankers who know how to take care of customers. You're going to hear today about how we invest in people. If you hire great people, they will pay for themselves every time.</p><p>Again, our priority in the regional bank is to enhance the most profitable segments of our business. As you can see on Slide 4, even with leading market share in Tennessee, we were able to grow deposits faster than peers. And our ability to analyze economic profit led us to optimize the loan portfolio towards higher-return specialty lending areas.</p><p>Today, we set out on a new plan. We're setting the goal of doubling economic profit in the regional bank over the next 5 years. I have 3 purposes in my comments today. Number one, I want to lay out the component parts of our coming 5-year plan to double economic profit. Others will follow me and give more detail. Two, I want to impress upon you the enthusiasm that I have for the opportunity we have with Capital Bank. We knew when we signed the merger agreement in May of 2017 that this was going to be a good thing for our company. But knowing what we know now, the future is even brighter than we thought. Finally, this is a story about people and transformation. We're continuously raising the bar on how we execute. We recruit, we retain, and we develop people who know how to take care of customers.</p><p>We have what it takes to execute this plan. How do I know? Let's start with some facts. First, we have the leadership in place today. Well, first of all, we're building from a position of strength. We have the leadership in place today to execute this plan. Many of these leaders have been in place for more than 5 years. We're continuing to add experienced bankers and leaders with substantial connections in their communities. The Capital Bank merger gives us improved economies of scale to make further investments, gives us access to attractive growth markets and provides an opportunity for many complementary revenue synergies, such as treasury management, wealth management, referrals to our specialty lines of business and mortgage originations. We are already seeing these synergies hit the books. Not only that, our merger integration is behind us. The economy is strong, and the regulatory environment is in our favor. We have done it before, and we will do it again.</p><p>Not only do we operate from a position of strength, we have a performance culture. What do I mean by that? We prioritize, talk about, measure and track and incentivize what matters, growing the balance sheet profitably. Our financial performance is prioritized by focusing on the financial metrics that drive return on equity. Essentially, we measure economic profit, which is net income minus the cost of capital. Focusing on revenue growth, expense control, our net interest margin or pricing and credit quality drives economic profit and return on equity. Our bankers understand customer profitability, and we can take it down to the market, to the line of business, to the individual relationship manager and the individual customer. We make good decisions for our shareholders. We track, measure and celebrate successes that drive economic profit growth. Our incentive plans pay for profitable revenue growth, consistent with these financial drivers. Our incentive plans are aligned with shareholder returns.</p><p>It's a fact. Our business model is different from our large bank competitors. If you're a business owner, you want to deal with the decision maker, not an order taker. As you can see on Slide 12, we have decision-making leaders and credit officers on the ground in our key markets. This pushes decision-making closer to our customers. Our local bankers have the ability to influence outcomes and serve as advocates for their customers. Our structure provides for team-based selling, team-based servicing and team-based credit collaboration. We have credit officers working in the same offices as line bankers, again allowing the right decisions to be made closer to our customers. We have a real advantage over our big-bank competitors because we can facilitate quick, efficient decisions. With our larger balance sheet capacity and expanded product offerings, we are well positioned in our markets.</p><p>I've seen this model work from personal experience. Back when I was the President of the local bank in Memphis, there was a great local business that had been in existence for about 3 generations. They were in the cement or the ready-mix business. They were banked by a competitor who was acquired by an out-of-state holding company. Eventually, credit decisions started being made from out of town that affected this business. The balance sheet didn't tell the story. They were tax-basis financial statements, and they had lots of fully depreciated dump trucks and ready-mix cement trucks. And they also had a lot of land that had been purchased over 30 years ago by their fathers and grandfather, and it didn't really reflect the value because this land was loaded with sand and gravel. Eventually, we got the call. We took our senior credit officer out to the business. We walked through their financial statements, understood the value of their equipment. And we understand and we could see from their income statement the value they were creating with the sand and gravel coming out of this low basis land. Within 48 hours, we were able to deliver to them a term sheet for a credit facility that would enable them to operate their business the way that they needed to. Eventually, the principals of this business moved their personnel business over to our private banking group. 11 years later, they sold this business for north of $50 million, and First Tennessee Bank won the opportunity to participate in managing their wealth. It was a great win.</p><p>In a few minutes, you're going to hear from Carol Yochem, the President of our Middle Tennessee Bank, and she'll talk to you about how she has used this business model at Middle Tennessee with her team to transform our bank. After Carol, Jeff Jackson, who ran our bank in Chattanooga very successfully, will come up. And he will talk about how he is going to use this model in South Florida to effectively compete as well.</p><p>Our specialty businesses are our growth engine. They make us different. These specialty businesses, 8 in total, such as mortgage warehouse lending, franchise finance, and within asset-based lending, our trucking and transportation business and consumer finance lending business are industries that are right for banker specialization. They present a nationwide footprint, and our company has a less than 5% market share. So we have room to grow, especially in the Capital Bank footprint. Our specialty businesses are led by tenured, experienced leaders and teams. In these businesses, our bankers have the reputation of understanding a business and staying with customers during both good and tough economic cycles. Other banks come and go out of these businesses, but we've developed this portfolio over the years because the loyalty we've developed, we often grow by customer referral. When we're out on the road and we're meeting with trucking companies and the ABL group, maybe a consumer finance company and particularly in the mortgage warehouse lending space, we hear time and time again how, in 2008, 2009, 2010, a lot of banks abandoned these customers and they got out. And they thank us and they say that if it weren't for First Tennessee Bank, they might not be here today.</p><p>So historically, these businesses have not generated deposit opportunities, which is precisely why we believe this is a special growth opportunity. We believe that the mortgage warehouse lending business and corporate regional businesses present the opportunity to grow substantial deposits over the next 5 years.</p><p>So growing deposits is the linchpin of our strategic plan. The merger integration is behind us, and we can focus on sales activities. The demographics of the Capital Bank markets give us the opportunity to grow both new customers and expand relationships with existing customers. Folks, there's a lot of opportunity in the Carolinas and Florida, and we intend to capture it.</p><p>So what's different about our strategy to grow deposits? First, we understand that deposits are foundational for economic profit. The evolving customer experience will augment our deposit growth. We can use multiple levers such as product positioning, employee incentives, pricing and marketing to expand our deposit base. Our bankers are known for providing superior service to our customers, and we can leverage these strengths to build deposits.</p><p>We're enhancing our ability to use data and analytics to more intelligently prospect with existing customers and prospective customers and within various segments of our business lines. You'll hear more about this in a minute from Tammy LoCascio, Head of all our Consumer Businesses; and Dawn Morris, our new Chief Marketing Officer. We know growing deposits is critical to our success. It's the lifeblood of the banking business, and it drives profitability.</p><p>Our credit quality is outstanding. We have a diversified loan portfolio that's weighted towards commercial banking. It's underweight commercial real estate in land and construction loans. In a stress case situation, our portfolio loss rates are 1/2 of peers because of our underwriting practices and management of portfolio limits and concentrations. Our relationship manager-portfolio manager operating model allows for continuous loan servicing and ongoing credit monitoring. Having local credit officers also helps to avoid lending money to the wrong people or into the wrong situations. Because of our excellent asset quality, we are focused on growth opportunities and not problems.</p><p>We are a company that knows how to grow. We have done it before, and we can do it again. We are operating from a position of strength with a focus on strong economic profit and risk management. We're more excited about the Capital Bank merger now than when we announced it. We make decisions close to our customers. We are decision makers, not order takers. We have high-return specialty banking areas. We have strong growth opportunities with a blueprint for going on offense. And finally, it's about people. And we have great bankers who know how to take care of our customers.</p><p>I'd now like to introduce Carol Yochem, President of our Middle Tennessee market; and Jeff Jackson, President of our South Florida market, and they're going to come up and tell you about how they'll use our business model to succeed in their respective markets. So Carol?</p><p>CAROL BLADE YOCHEM, PRESIDENT OF MIDDLE TENNESSEE, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: Thank you, David. Nashville is the one major market in Tennessee we have never historically owned. Today, we are a major player here. Good morning, and welcome to Nashville in Middle Tennessee, my home territory. By now you know I lead this market for First Tennessee. I came onboard about 5 years ago to lead and deliver this exceptional growth here in the marketplace with a very well-equipped team. You've heard we have a formula for growth for our new markets, and I'm going to show you how it's made us successful here. Then Florida President, Jeff Jackson, is going to provide some insight into how he is applying the formula for growth, customized of course, for his customer base in his markets.</p><p>Our Mid-Atlantic market is another fast-growing market, and it's led by Rick Manley. He is a stellar banker with a lot of experience in the Mid-Atlantic footprint. He is not with us today. I understand he's gathering up some deposits in the Mid-Atlantic territory. He's the one that's actually working today.</p><p>So let me share with you the headlines for Middle Tennessee. Over the last 5 years, we've doubled our loans. We've essentially doubled our deposits. We've doubled our revenue. And when you do all of that, it starts falling to the bottom line. Our pretax profit is up nearly 3x. And as a result, our economic profit, which you're going to hear a lot about today, has increased nearly eightfold in just the last 4 years.</p><p>Now why we've essentially doubled our deposits? We have outpaced the market growth 2.3x in the last 3 years, and that's in one of the fastest growing markets in the country.</p><p>It's a proof point that our strategy is working. The bulk of this deposit growth is organic growth. Now like the growth that we've had in deposits, I'm especially proud of the organic growth that we've had in loans over the past 5 years and that further demonstrates the power of our 3-pronged approach. How did we do it? And how do we replicate it?</p><p>Well, the key to our success is our commitment to getting the best people. We've hired rainmakers. We were very intentional about the leaders that we brought onboard. They were well connected with the customers and in the community, and they have the ability to deliver against the aggressive goals that we set for ourselves. Then those leaders were intentional about building their teams in the very same way. So our investment in talent has paid off. And it's why we've been able to grow our loans by $2.2 billion and our deposits by $2 billion in the last 5 years.</p><p>The next thing that we did was focused on elevating our brand by creating raving fans of our employees, our customers and our community. The first bright spot, of course, was with our people. When you have the top bankers in town, people want to bank with you.</p><p>So the investment in talent elevated our brand. Our bankers are everywhere in this community and they're fully engaged with customers and with community organizations. With strategic sponsorships, we've received outstanding brand recognition in Nashville. We are consistently recognized as a top workplace and the top regional bank in the toast of music city awards. We've also invested in marketing where we could get the biggest bang for our buck. The best example of this is that we purchased the naming rights to First Tennessee Park. It's our AAA minor league baseball stadium on the north side of downtown that's home to the Nashville Sounds, an affiliate of -- now an affiliate of our Texas Rangers. Those investments are paying off. All of this combined has resulted in a 25% increase in unaided brand awareness in a 2-year period when it typically takes 20 years to achieve that.</p><p>The third aspect of our strategy has focused on the rich opportunities that are right here in Nashville. The 4 industries with the greatest economic impact here in this market are the health care industry, the music industry, the manufacturing industry and then the hospitality tourism industry. And the 4 of these combined have an economic impact of around $70 billion. We set out to bank them all.</p><p>So let me give you an example of how we've tapped into 2 of these industries in a very differentiated way. Two years ago, we created a sub-strategy and recruited 2 unique industry teams, a music industry team and a sponsored-backed health care team. And I'm proud to say that 2 years later, they have delivered a combined $350 million in outstanding loans, $100 million in deposits and $13 million in revenue. These are just additional proof points of strategies that differentiate us in the market and have helped us move the needle.</p><p>As you can tell, I am super excited and proud of what we've been able to accomplish here. The success formula, which includes talent, elevating our brand and focusing on the unique opportunities right here in our own backyard, can be replicated successfully across our entire footprint. You can see that we have transformed our banking franchise here in Nashville. We have tremendous momentum. I say we are just getting started.</p><p>Now I would like to welcome Jeff Jackson, who will talk to you about how he is going to use this success formula in his market. Jeff?</p><p>JEFF JACKSON: Good morning. I joined the company in 2009. As David mentioned, I was recently the market President of Chattanooga, Tennessee, and in the last 30 days, I moved to Florida to take over that new market. I'm really excited about the future of our company.</p><p>We really have a blueprint for success, and the details really matter especially when you're going to grow your business. It's really important if you're going to double your business, like both Carol and I have done since we've been with First Horizon. Even though our markets are different, we both use the same blueprint for success.</p><p>We really focused on 3 things: investing in talent, elevating the brand and a targeted industry focus. Before I was named regional President for Florida, I was the market President for Chattanooga, as I mentioned, and we doubled our commercial loans, grew our deposits to a 25% market share and quadrupled our economic profit to almost $20 million this year. So I've seen what it takes to get it done in the market.</p><p>When I look at the blueprint, it all starts with investing in talent. We're going to do some things differently. First, we're going to hire some commercial middle-market bankers to focus on bringing in full relationships but also using a bonefish framework to make sure each hire makes sense and pays for itself.</p><p>The second thing we're going to look at doing is bringing in talent from a private client and wealth perspective. Today, these markets do not have that talent. And because of the markets being so rich in deposits, we feel like there's a great opportunity to optimize those opportunities and bring in strong deposits in the growth markets.</p><p>And then finally, we're going to add to our treasury management team. Based on the acquisition, we've got a lot of new treasury products that we can implement in our current customer base and new prospects. And so I believe there's a lot of low-hanging fruit within the portfolio in the Carolinas and Florida that we can take advantage of with these new treasury fees.</p><p>The second part of our blueprint is elevating the brand. Once again, we're going to do things differently. We're going to put together a strong marketing and advertising plan that will use all forms of media. We're also going to use our foundation dollars and advertising dollars to go toward sponsoring events where we not only get brand awareness but we get our employees face-to-face opportunities to network with prospects and customers. We are going to use every dollar to make sure it's either to our customer acquisition, retention or expansion. Last year alone, I went to 176 events myself, and that's the type of leadership we're going to have in these new markets.</p><p>The third thing when it comes to elevating the brand is making sure our employees are ingrained in the communities they serve. That means they are well known in the communities. That means they're very active on boards and other things to make sure they elevate our brand as well. I think by executing on these 3 things, our brands will get elevated in these new markets in the Carolinas and Florida, and we'll really have a successful brand going forward.</p><p>Finally, the third piece of the blueprint is using a targeted industry focus when it comes to new business. In the previous First Tennessee footprint markets, we're very successful in the medical industry. We're going to take that approach and take our owner-occupied medical program, combine it with our consumer MD mortgage program and drive a lot of business in these new markets.</p><p>Secondly, we're going to leverage our specialty groups, ABL, franchise finance and [pro] CRE. By using these groups, we can optimize our opportunities and grow the business in these markets where they're very rich with opportunities for our specialty groups.</p><p>And then this all comes together because we're going to optimize our local decision-making on the credit side and as well as the pricing side. When we use local decision-making it increases our speed to market. Based on the blueprint I just talked about, and how we're going to operate differently in these markets, I have no doubt we're going to be able to double our franchise in 5 years.</p><p>When I look at the Mid-Atlantic market, it's really exciting because we are feeling really good about a couple of markets there, especially Raleigh and Charleston. They look like markets that we have dominated in the past in Tennessee. And with the population growing in North Carolina and South Carolina 2x the national average, we know this is a very deposit-rich market that we will take advantage of.</p><p>We're also currently looking to hire people to bring in deposit specialists to really mine these markets for the opportunities they present. And then finally, we have a good commercial customer base but we can also look at expanding that through treasury services, higher home limits, selectively, and other fee-based services. We really feel like we could really increase the fee base -- the fee generation in this market. And then finally, since we are a capital bank, we're going to really focus on the marketing effort to build up the brand.</p><p>As we turn to Florida, I'm really excited about taking the lead for this team. We have a lot of great opportunities we're really excited about. Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Southwest Florida, Naples, Fort Myers. These markets have more deposits than the entire state of Tennessee, and we're going to hire people to capitalize on these opportunities. I personally have already interviewed 33 people and we are looking to hire approximately 30 to 40 bankers based on the bonefish framework to ensure our growth in these markets over the next several years.</p><p>We will also be working on elevating the Capital Bank brand with a strong marketing and advertising mission, which is already in place.</p><p>We have proven that we can double our business in Nashville and other legacy markets. Going forward, we're going to be focused on executing on Carol's plan that she used for Nashville in these new markets. We have experienced leaders who are going to get it done. And there will be no doubt we're going to be successful in these growth markets. Now I'd like to ask David, Carol and Susan Springfield, our Chief Credit Officer, to the stage for Q&amp;A session.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: We have microphones placed here in the room. If you have a question, if you could go to the microphone and maybe someone will pass it to you, that would be great. I would like to do a special introduction though for Susan Springfield, who is our Chief Credit Officer and has been a great partner to the bankers that were here today and leaders. She and her team have been a huge part of the success of our organization in the past, and they will continue to be a huge part of our success as we go forward into these new markets. And so the floor is open for anyone who has a question.</p><p>KENNETH ALLEN ZERBE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Question for you. Just in terms of the doubling of economic profit goal that you have, can you help us put that into context? Like what dollar amounts, what -- I mean how big or what exactly are we talking about? And what does that mean for sort of the overall organization?</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: Yes. It's doubling economic profit for the regional bank. And BJ, I'm going to lean on you a little bit, but going from roughly $130 million in economic profit to $260 million in economic profit, hard to correlate that to EPS because you have taken out the credit charge and the cost of capital.</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: Yes. I think, Ken, what I would add to that is what you have in terms of economic profit, as David laid out, is what we look at is net income less a charge for economic capital, right, because you all are requiring us to have a certain level of return on the equity that you provide us to grow our business. So we require our businesses to do the same thing, right? So it's more than just growing net income. It's growing it profitably. So the way that we do that is by continually improving the credit quality on our portfolio while improving the pricing on the balance sheet mix that we're driving, number one. Number two, fee income generation is huge. Fee income does not take up any economic capital. It falls right to the bottom line, so making sure that we're building business like treasury services that both Jeff and David and Carol talked about to drive business forward and drop income to the bottom line. Third piece of it is expense management, right? We will invest to grow, as you heard from Carol and Jeff, but look at what Carol also put up there that we doubled the business. We doubled the balance sheet. We hired people. We put in marketing but we also more than doubled the pretax income. So it all works together but with the foundation of using our economic capital as wisely as possible.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So presumably taking sort of that $130 million to $260 million, just as a bottom line number, that's not the right -- is that the right -- or is that not the right way to think about it?</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: Yes, it is. Over the next 5 years, right. So what David, I think, actually showed was about $70 million to $150 million from 2013 to 2017 -- 2014 to 2017, and what we're targeting in the regional bank is being able to do that again, driven by deposits and driven largely by specialty lending.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just while we're on that point around economic profit, so we talked about pretax income in Middle Tennessee being up 3x but economic profit being nearly up eightfold for the last 4 years. So what drives that elevation of economic profit versus pretax income? It just seems a little larger than I would expect.</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: Well, it's the weighting of the deposit growth. If you have a loan book and a deposit book and you grow them equally, the deposits don't attract near as much capital. And therefore, it creates an incentive for our leaders and our relationship managers to go out and grow deposits. And so that's how you get the leverage and the economic profit growth is by growing your deposits.</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: There's also though the improvement in the loan portfolio, as Brian and David both pointed out, in terms of investment-grade equivalent, you saw that go from 20% to 38%. And so that also drives positive economic profit growth.</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: Because of the lower capital charge.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Maybe separately, a question for Jeff. I understand the plan is to follow the blueprint in Middle Tennessee and the South Florida market. However, they are very different markets, right? So the Nashville area had a fair amount of tailwinds over the last several years, which helped drive that growth. And so how do you think about applying that model or strategy into this newer market? I know you hadn't been in South Florida for all that long at this point. But can you talk about some of the differences in the end market and how that can maybe dictate the evolution of that strategic blueprint for growth?</p><p>JEFF JACKSON: Sure. Obviously, the markets are different. Even the 4 markets that I have today are extremely different. I think part of it is really hiring the diverse talent to fit the markets that we're in, and I know that we can do that. It all starts with having great people. So obviously, in Miami, it's highly bilingual, and we've got a lot of employees. We're going to hire more that focus on that market. Other markets are different but I would say it starts with the talent, and then, obviously, we have to elevate the brand, the various things I mentioned before. But other than that, I mean we're going to really get into the communities, make our name known and also really build relationships with those face-to-face interactions. And so I think it's similar in that perspective.</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: Yes. We win our business 2/3 of the time by taking customers away from the larger banks. And what we have found is what Jeff said, if you have great bankers who know the market and know how to take care of their customers, and most of them have been at larger banks at some point in time in their careers, if we are consistently out in front of our prospects, eventually our larger bank competitors will move too slowly, there will be a servicing glitch and we will get a phone call. And that's when we have the opportunity to go in and prove that we can make decisions locally closer to customer and win the business. And after we win the business, we have to continue to do a great job taking care of those customers, which in part is keeping your employees and keeping that consistency and growing the relationships, and that's what we have done in all of our businesses. And that's what I see as the biggest opportunity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Maybe for David. So Brian talked about being in the sweet spot, big enough to serve your clients but close to them. I didn't see anything on customer satisfaction metrics, when we think about your ability to take share. Could you share those?</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: You'll see later in Todd Jones' presentation, and I believe you did see earlier today maybe in Brian's, Greenwich and Associates rates commercial banks on a number of criteria. And over the last 2 or 3 years, we were 1 of 5 or 6 banks in the United States that earned more than 20 awards. I believe last year, we won 23. Another organization Phoenix-Hecht reviews treasury services and capabilities for the top 50 banks in the country. And over the last 3 to 5 years, we've either had all A pluses or a couple of A pluses and maybe an A. And generally, we are the only bank with all As or all A pluses in the top 50, and so we've got those capabilities. Tammy LoCascio, when she talks about the consumer business, will make reference to our retention, and again, it's industry-leading from a retention standpoint.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And then a second question for Jeff. You said you would hire midmarket commercial bankers in Florida by using a bonefish framework. What does that mean?</p><p>JEFF JACKSON: It's a complex way of saying we're going to make sure everybody we hire based on their compensation and what we feel like they can deliver from a [protections] perspective makes sense to us financially. Does that make -- kind of a targeted portfolio size and depending on the market.</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: So at First Tennessee bonefish is a verb, it's a noun, it's a lot of things. When somebody saves money in doing something, we talk about how we bonefish something. When we talk about bringing a new relationship into the bank, we say it bone fished, mean we don't bring things in hopefully that lose us money. And so when we talk about hiring somebody and we say they're going to bonefish, it means we're going to make money.</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: Well, Carol talked about this, about hiring rainmakers and people that have an established name in the community in terms of being excellent bankers, whether they be commercial bankers, private client, financial center managers and that Jeff has said before, he's already interviewed a number of people and so making sure that we're getting folks that are already established in the markets and can bring business over when they join us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: How does the approach to pricing loans and deposits in the growth markets compare with the approach in markets where you're more of an incumbent?</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: You will hear more later, but I'll address it. As we go into these new markets or markets where First Tennessee would be new, obviously, Capital Bank has been there, we will not \"leave\" the market from a pricing standpoint but we will pay competitive rates for deposit products. We're a lot stingier on the loan side. We understand what you have to do to make money lending money. We understand our cost very well, and so that'll be our challenge. We will not go in and buy business on the loan side. On the deposit side, we will pay competitive pricing and it's to get the customers in the door so that we can grow those relationships.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Is there an opportunity on the deposit side to innovate a little bit given that you're in markets that are far away from Memphis?</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: There is. We can do things from a pricing standpoint, for example, in southern Florida that we wouldn't do in Memphis, Tennessee or Chattanooga or Knoxville or northeast where we have #1 market share, no doubt. Marty?</p><p>MARLIN LACEY MOSBY, DIRECTOR OF BANKING &amp; EQUITY STRATEGIES, VINING SPARKS IBG, LP, RESEARCH DIVISION: Three questions. Susan, not to pick on you first, but 77% of deposits are in the Tennessee market, yet you're getting a lot of the loan growth outside of the Tennessee market. We've played that story out before. Why is this different? And how do we control the fact that we're not going to just fund all this specialty lending outside of the market with our Tennessee deposits?</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: Right. I'll start, and then David might want to add in. We do have, and we have for several years, have a really specific focus on full relationships. And David touched on it. I think Todd may hit it later, in many of our specialty businesses, which have been traditionally heavy lending markets, we're also focusing on building deposits there. It's really an opportunity that we believe will propel us forward in terms of deposit growth. Personally, from a credit standpoint too, I think that full relationship banking, you -- not only do you have more retention because it's harder for them to leave. The credit outcomes also are better, I think we've proven that and other banks have as well. If you've got the full relationship, you've got the insight into cash flows. So you will continue to see us focus on that in the specialty businesses as well in our core markets.</p><p>MARLIN LACEY MOSBY: Now I am going to pick on you, Jeff. So when we think about going into South Florida and you talked about the bilingual culture. You ran Chattanooga, okay. Why is First Horizon desperately needed in South Florida right now? Why as a bank are you introducing your talents into a market that's going to be very different than what you were used to running in Chattanooga, it's just 2 very distinct markets? So I'm just curious how you imagine, not just that there's a lot of opportunity, we know there's a lot of deposits down there, but everybody else in the country knows that. So why is this brand, this strategy needed in South Florida?</p><p>JEFF JACKSON: Well, I think first, I haven't seen a bank that does what we do in South Florida. I could be missing it, but I haven't seen a bank that's really entrenched in all the communities like we do in Tennessee. I think the other piece of it is it's all about the talent. And so while you're right, it is bilingual, and I do not speak Spanish yet. But I do have a Babbel app on my phone. But once again, I can hire that talent. I'm very confident about the talent base. Like I said, I've talked to 33 people. I can probably hire 28 of them today if I wanted to. And these are well-entrenched bankers that are in these markets that have great customers that I know we can win. The second thing, we have some products and offerings that other banks are looking at. I look at our owner-occupied offering, right? We will -- for the right credits, we will look at 100% LTV on a medical office building. We'll go up potentially to 95% LTV on longer terms. So there's some things that we'll do on the product side also getting ingrained in the community. And once again, I feel very strongly about the talent that I think we can differentiate ourselves in these markets. And while Miami is bilingual, obviously, Fort Lauderdale, Naples, Southwest Florida, those look more like the markets we do well in, in Tennessee.</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: The other thing, Marty, back to your question to me, combining it with what you asked Jeff, the deposit opportunity in South Florida is huge. And so you saw that on, I believe, David's slides or Jeff's about the deposit opportunity and so the opportunity to mine those deposits in South Florida, which will continue to help us support growth throughout the company.</p><p>JEFF JACKSON: Yes. And just one more thing. We don't have to be like we are in First Tennessee in Tennessee with the dominant market share. Due to the large market, I mean if I can move the needle 1%, 2%, 3%, you can do the math. I mean, that's an enormous move in deposits for us.</p><p>MARLIN LACEY MOSBY: All right. Your turn, Carol. So we think about Tennessee and you mentioned what we're doing in Nashville, very acquainted with our struggles to get into Nashville and do well in Nashville, the history of First Tennessee here. What it looks like is the Tennessee banks are gaining market share. So in other words, what's gaining is Pinnacle's gaining in Memphis, you're gaining in Nashville. The ones that are losing are the bigger out of market kind of players that are here. So if you kind of look at that race, Pinnacle's added about 4% In Memphis. You probably add about 4% in Nashville. Kind of compare how each of those different banks are kind of cross-streaming within Tennessee because it looks like you all 2 are the ones that are kind of capturing the market against what's outside the state.</p><p>CAROL BLADE YOCHEM: Yes. I'll comment on a couple of things. If you look at -- well, the dynamics here are really shifting pretty extraordinarily. If you looked 20 years ago, the top 3 regional banks here, BofA, Regions and SunTrust combined had about 57% of the deposit market share. Today, they have 37%. So they've ceded 20 percentage points of market share. If you look at our growth here, we're fifth in market share here, Pinnacle is #1 as of this year. The last 3 years, there have been only 2 banks in this market out of the top 5 that have grown double digit each year and that's us and Pinnacle. So those are some of the changing dynamics that are happening here on the deposit front and the market share front.</p><p>JOHN G. PANCARI, SENIOR MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: John Pancari, Evercore ISI. Just a quick question again regarding that topic. You've been in the Southeast markets and other markets outside of Tennessee in the past, and you've since retrenched and then now you're heading back into these markets. And everything -- what is -- how does this expansion differ? Like what's different about the model in these other markets outside of Tennessee than what you had previously when you had backed away from it?</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: Yes, so if you went back 11 years, we had a presence in Washington, D.C. We had a presence in Atlanta and we had a presence in Dallas. And at that time, this is pre 2008, we had a nationwide mortgage business , or 23 states. And the idea was that we were going to put 10 branches in each of these 3 cities and we were going to be able to get consumer banking services from our mortgage origination customers. There was a wealth piece. There was a small business SBA piece. And I would just say that was a very different strategy. When Brian joined the company, looked at the numbers very quickly, exited those businesses because we figured out that long term it was not going to be a profitable strategy, High-priced deposits, and [he walks] with mortgage origination, it was not a good recipe. It did not bonefish. The new expansion process, again, we're primarily or we are heavily weighted on the lending side in core commercial relationship banking plus these specialty lending businesses, and then we use our retail footprint to gather deposits, hopefully low cost, that's the best objective to then go and deploy into the specialty businesses and, to some degree, to the extent the core commercial businesses are self-funded, to help fund that. But it's a very different target customer today versus 11 years ago. In the new expansion, we also have the benefit of the Capital Bank locations. And many of the banks that were acquired through the Capital Bank process had been in existence for an extended period of time. And so they really truly had core commercials, retail base, et cetera. So we think it's a much better foundation to grow from.</p><p>JOHN G. PANCARI: And then Susan, just regarding the specialty lending efforts, what's that done to your credit assumptions? Have you had to modify go-forward loss assumptions given the nature of the specialty businesses in your growth plans?</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: Actually, our specialty businesses, if you look at the specialty businesses we were in before the last downturn, they performed better than many of our just traditional businesses did because of the expertise and the ability to really go in and call on specific customers. So we believe that while some of these are higher return, the credit quality actually performs better throughout a cycle. So we're not factoring in additional credit quality concerns associated with the specialty business growth. We actually think that it's a great thing for our balance sheet and will perform well throughout the cycle.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I just had a question for Carol. You mentioned that the bank has been, obviously, experiencing tremendous momentum in Nashville and that's likely to continue. If we look back at the last Investor Day, the bank by deposit market share was #5 sort of where it is today. And so what does the milestones of success look like in the Nashville market in terms of do you want to be #3? Or what do you think that outcome's going to look like over the next 5 years?</p><p>CAROL BLADE YOCHEM: The answer to that question is above my pay grade. So look, I would love for us to move up in market share here. I feel that we'll continue to do a lot of what we're -- what we have been doing to make us successful and grow organically. We are probably $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion outside of fourth place, if you will. So when could we get that organically is kind of a question. I don't want to make any predictions but I think if we were to move into a much higher rank, it might require an acquisition.</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: I would say it this way. We are about profitability first and market share second. Market share says great things about your company, but at the end of the day, we're running the business for profitability and returns. If we had to go out and pay up for market share, we wouldn't do it. If we can take business from the competition, and particularly those large bank competitors and we can grow profitably and improve our market share, that would be great. But we wouldn't go out and pay up for the sake of paying up just to be at some market share level. It's about profitability.</p><p>KENNETH ALLEN ZERBE: Ken Zerbe again. Did I hear you right that you talked about -- obviously, specialty lending did not really bring in a lot of deposits but now it was going to bring in a lot of deposits. Can you just elaborate on that?</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: Sure. We have 2 businesses. Well, first of all, every one of our business leaders will be better incentivized by growing low-cost deposits. So it's baked into our incentive plans. Our mortgage warehouse lending business coming out of the 2008, 2009, 2010 era, it was growing very quickly, and we were really focused on being great at operating there and managing credit. We were not actively going out and asking for mortgage servicing deposits and just operating regular old deposits. And what we have seen is that where we were the primary mortgage warehouse lender, and particularly where we've been in there for 7, 8 years or longer, we are being well received when we go out and ask for those deposits. And so we are focused on going out to all of our mortgage warehouse lending customers where we're the primary lender and asking for their operating business deposits and their mortgage servicing deposits, and we've had a positive reception there. In our corporate regional business -- and this is something that could be a ways off, but we're very optimistic, we're working with some fintechs that are in the payment space. And because of our size, because of our technology and our ability to be flexible and nimble, we have the opportunity potentially to be the back-end bank for some of these payments processors, and we're actively pursuing that business. And potentially, that could be something that's a little different but would give a company like ours a real growth engine for deposits. So it's a high priority.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WILLIAM MARINAC, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, FIG PARTNERS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Question on commercial real estate. The slides showed a while ago that the concentration is very low. Should we think of that as an opportunity for growth in the next several quarters? Or is that something for dry powder to keep for a different time and different cycle?</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: Chris, as you know, we've been conservative around commercial real estate, which has enabled us I think to serve our customers well in terms of not being overexposed, and we have a really good opportunity. We can work with our customers to get that done. But our goal is to continue to remain below peers as it relates to commercial real estate concentration. In addition to that, with commercial real estate as well as our other specialty businesses, we have a very robust portfolio limits process, making sure that we're maintaining discipline around and in commercial real estate by product type, by geography. We monitor any exceptions to policy. They're very small. So we've got really good average equity in the commercial real estate portfolio today. It's 32%, which is very strong. The debt service coverage on that portfolio today, the actual debt service coverage is over 1.7x. And on a stabilized, if you permed it out, would be over 1.5x. So we feel good -- very good about the portfolio that we have. So we do -- we have room to flex a little bit when we want to for a particular customer and a particular market where we feel like the market metrics are right, but we don't aspire to be overexposed in commercial real estate.</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: I believe that's it. We'll go on to the next session. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will take a break until 10:45. Please enjoy the refreshments in the foyer.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome EVP of consumer banking, Tammy LoCascio.</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO, EVP OF CONSUMER BANKING, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: Good morning, everyone. My name is Tammy LoCascio and I lead our consumer bank. As Bryan said earlier, I've been here a little more than 5 years with the company. And I have the amazing privilege every day to work with great bankers, experienced and talented folks across our organization. And today, I'm excited with you, on behalf of all of them, to share our plans for the consumer bank.</p><p>As you heard earlier today, we do what we say we will do. We set a target of doubling economic profit in the consumer bank and we have doubled it twice in the last 6 years. In doing so, we've become a far more efficient organization. We have grown our deposits to $18 billion and we have increased our revenue by 80%. And our opportunities still lie ahead of us, to grow our deposits, to take costs out of our organization and to invest in faster and easier solutions for our customers.</p><p>Let's start with our successes. We have a strong foundation in Tennessee. We have expanded our #1 market share and demonstrate that where we focus, we deliver growth. Second, we continue to evolve our customer experiences. We use data-driven insights and technology to match the right customers with the appropriate channels. This enables us to deliver distinctive and relevant experiences to our customers whenever and however they choose.</p><p>The third, we remain focused on profitable customer growth and, more specifically, deposit growth. As the funding source for the bank's lending activity, growth in deposits is our #1 priority. We will achieve this growth through expansion of existing customer relationships as well as focusing on cultivating new ones. And as you heard earlier, our success in Nashville provides a blueprint for success in newer markets. We have a proven model that will allow us to differentiate our approach across our markets, bringing the full set of capabilities to our customers.</p><p>Page 3 highlights a few of our financial wins. The consumer bank consists of 5 lines of business: retail, private client, wealth management, small business and mortgage. We focus on profitable growth while managing expenses. And when we do this, we get proven results. We know how to grow deposits, manage our expenses and take care of our customers.</p><p>First, growing deposits. As you'll see on the top line, on this slide, we have 90% growth in deposits and 80% growth in revenue across our network over the last 5 years. In managing our expenses, we reduced our branch network by 21%, twice the industry average and faster than any other bank in the state of Tennessee. We also improved our efficiency ratio by 12% and, most importantly, taking care of our customers. We could not have accomplished our goals without putting the customer in the center of everything we do. We have top quartile customer satisfaction and a strong 91% customer retention, both of which are critical components to growing our balance sheet.</p><p>Even with the addition of Capital Bank, we have delivered outstanding performance in our home state. As the #1 market share bank in Tennessee, we organically grew deposits by 44%, 1.5x the state average. And in spite the strong competition that we see and Carol talked about here in Middle, Tennessee, our Nashville market has grown consumer deposits by 78% over the last 5 years. Our focus on Tennessee will continue to remain strong as it is foundational to our success.</p><p>Also foundational to our success is how we think about our delivery network. At the top of Page 5, you will see that over the last 5 years, we have grown our franchise and entered into new markets through acquisition. We have been aggressive but thoughtful in managing our distribution network. The most recent evidence of this came during our Capital Bank conversion. We closed 69 branches over the last 18 months and retained 94% of Capital Bank customers and their deposits. This success represents learning from prior optimization efforts, where we retained at least 90% of customers and their balances post consolidation.</p><p>Continual optimization of our network allows us to reduce our cost to serve and also improve our efficiencies. It also, very importantly, provides us the means to reinvest back into our business into profitable markets and profitable programs that drive growth.</p><p>With shifting consumer preferences and their ability to digitally engage, we have more choices today than just physical distribution to engage and connect with customers. As we build on our strong foundation, we look at our business through the lens of our customers and change our models to reflect their evolving customer expectations.</p><p>We recognize that consumer banking is relatively a commoditized business, and being able to deliver distinctive experiences is what sets us apart from competitors both large and small.</p><p>So how do we show up differently for our customers? Page 7 highlights that both internal and external research validates that customers consistently say that we excel at looking out for them and being friendly and helpful.</p><p>In fact, we are best-in-class in both of those 2 categories. We're better than national banks and we're better than regional and community banks. Customers who bank with us really like us.</p><p>And while these 2 attributes help us differentiate us from our competitors, the number one reason customers choose a bank is the ability to serve all of their banking needs. And it so happens we actually rank strong in this category as well, better than regional and community banks and just shy of national banks. And it's the combination of all 3 of these attributes together that helps us stand out from others and allows us to continue to grow our business.</p><p>We track customer channel preferences closely because it's imperative that we understand this intersection between personal and digital engagement. What we see in customer behavior today is generally a digital first engagement where they choose self service options to handle their transactional needs. Over the last 5 years, 35% of our transactions have migrated to digital channels. These costly, low-value transactions have been taken out of our branches. And yet with that said, 93% of our customers still come in and visit with a banker at least once a year.</p><p>We've reduced transactional interactions and replaced them with more moments that matter with our customers. This allows us to free up our banker's capacity and focus on more complex needs, which is the value that our people deliver. We continue to enhance our ability to convert data into insights that empowers our bankers to proactively engage with the right customer at the right time. We do this every day.</p><p>This visual on Page 9 represents how we engage with our customers, both personally and digitally. We'll continue to expand and refine our ability to use data and insights and technology in smarter ways. We will create distinctive experiences for our customers, whether it's in lobby or independent of a physical distribution network. As you'll hear later today from Dawn Morris, interactions with our customers are incredibly valuable. And data-driven insights make those opportunities much more impactful.</p><p>Our ability to rapidly iterate new ideas, develop robust customer solutions and position our offers through the customer's channel of choice helps keep us relevant and one step ahead of their expectations. To share with you more about how we prepare our people to leverage data insights and technology, to create extraordinary experiences for our customers, take a look at this short clip.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: A great example of our strategy to transform our banker and customer experience became evident during conversion. We leveraged the friendly and helpful attributes of our bankers and the power of data-driven insights to reach out to our customers.</p><p>Bryan mentioned earlier, the hundreds of thousands of calls we made as a part of our personalized outreach program helped us to deliver 94% customer and balance retention. We have now shifted this powerful combination of bankers and digital capabilities to deposit acquisition. And as a result, we have seen double digit annualized deposit growth from our new capital bank footprint over the last 90 days.</p><p>Understanding the value of target customers and aligning how we deliver on their preferences will drive profitable growth. We will be actively focused on 2 critical segments in our business: the affluent and small business segments.</p><p>On Slide 11, you'll see the opportunity afforded to us in our new expanded footprint for both affluent and small business is significant. There are over $120 billion in mass affluent and affluent deposits and $150 billion in small business deposits available on the markets that we serve. Expanding existing share of wallet will continue to be important as a core competency that we do really well. But we will increase our focus on new-to-bank customers, most notably in these 2 deposit group segments.</p><p>As the proof point in our value proposition is already resonating with these 2 segments, our consumer money market customers on boarded in 2018 have $130,000 on average deposit with us and almost $1 million available on investable assets.</p><p>If you go back to 2017 on the First Tennessee side, our new-to-bank money market acquisition average was $87,000, highlighting the value that our new markets bring to the organization. In small business, we've increased our average deposit size this year on new-to-bank acquisitions by 25%.</p><p>Both the affluent and small business segments require business models that allow us to deliver the full breadth and depth of our organization at the appropriate cost to serve. One example of a business model change is how we're going to market with wealth management. Let's watch how our advisers leverage a combination of people and technology to deliver results.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: Our ability to leverage technology in the wealth space and change our business models has given our advisers more time to spend with high-value customers and prospects, as much as 30% more time each day. From a robo-solution that offers 100% digital experience to full service adviser and planning capabilities, our wealth business has and continues to adapt to an ever-changing landscape.</p><p>I want to transition now to how we will execute in our markets. Our go-to-market strategies will be based on the diverse opportunities that we have available to us.</p><p>Our combined footprint highlighted on Page 13 is an exciting opportunity. The #1 market share we earned in Tennessee is a privilege that we don't take for granted. And our position in high-growth markets in the Carolinas and Florida only strengthen our ability to grow. We have completed extensive research to inform the approach we will use in the expanded footprint. We've evaluated market potential, the competitive landscape, how we're currently positioned for success.</p><p>We have also spent time looking at the opportunity to acquire key talent as you heard Carol and Jeff talk about and also the cost to achieve a meaningful level of share of voice that affords us the opportunities that we need to meet our objectives. Based on these factors, we have segmented our markets into 3 categories noted on Page 14.</p><p>The first is core markets. Moderate growth market such as Memphis or Knoxville, where we have dominant branch and deposit share, yet still opportunities for targeted growth. These markets also represent an opportunity for us to optimize resources and reinvest back into growth and target markets.</p><p>The second is growth markets. For example, Nashville, where we have strong -- a strong market opportunity and expansion opportunities in key segments with enough physical presence to deliver outpaced market growth.</p><p>And finally, target markets. Cities like Naples and Charleston, where we see high deposit growth opportunities and significant concentrations of affluence with a FHN branch presence. These markets will deploy a people first strategy, focus on niche opportunities as you heard in the video such as medical private client and our women and wealth programs. Each market's unique opportunity will determine the choices we make to achieve our growth objectives. Let's take a look at Nashville, a proof point of how we succeed in markets where we don't have dominant share.</p><p>Nashville continues to excel and is positioned well for future growth. As Carol shared earlier, outpacing the market at 2.3x the average, our story in Nashville on the consumer side is not just about what has been done the last 5 years, but what our opportunity is for the momentum that we have built for the next 5. And the combination of the right people, distribution, marketing and community engagement leads to outstanding results.</p><p>When we show up for customers as a unified team, we win relationships. And our sweet spot is finding where our customer segmentation strategy combined with our local market approach allows us to be nimble and flexible when building customer relationships.</p><p>Taking our Nashville blueprint to Raleigh on Page 16, we have the same great opportunities to combine local talent, marketing and digital capabilities along with a solid distribution network to drive outpaced growth. 5 years ago, 10 years ago, if we were talking about going to Raleigh, it would have been heavily weighted towards building branches. But with shifting consumer preferences and their ability to digitally engage with banks, customers' purchase decisions are driven more by convenience, delivered through a combination of distribution marketing and digital than just physical locations alone. And the good news is we can now enter into new markets for significantly less than it would have cost us to build out a full distribution network and deliver the same growth.</p><p>We recently tested a new branch concept in Nashville and in Knoxville. We leveled a traditional branch and rebuilt it with a refreshed look in a much smaller space. Our open concept floor plan removes the physical barriers between our customers and our bankers, enabling better collaboration as we meet their needs. This approach cost us roughly 70% less, but is 100% more cool.</p><p>These locations, staffed with just 3 to 4 banking specialists, provide the high touch access our target customers look for and also act as a 24/7 billboard of our brand. And yes, I said 70% less cost for all the math people, 100% more cool.</p><p>Inherent to our go-to-market strategy is recruiting and retaining the very best talent in our markets, and you heard that earlier today. When we support that talent with the right complement of distribution, digital offerings and marketing, we win in our markets. We're already executing this concept and our team-based approach in our new markets. We will also relentlessly test and learn from a variety of new concepts that we can export to additional markets as we identify new opportunities.</p><p>As we look to the future, our ability to deliver profitable growth, market growth as well as transform the customer experience will be a critical part of our success. Page 17 summarizes our commitment. We have a track record of doing what we say we will do. The consumer bank has doubled EP twice in the last 6 years. We have dominated the state of Tennessee and we'll continue to expand our market share. Our distinctive value proposition will continue to evolve and resonate with our target customers.</p><p>We will grow across our footprint capitalizing on our appeal to both affluent and small business customers and we will take our successful playbook in Nashville and export it to new highly concentrated affluent markets. We are confident in our plan. We are very encouraged by what we are seeing in recent trends and we're excited about the new opportunity and tremendous potential that our new combined footprint brings to the organization.</p><p>Thank you for your time this morning. I would now like to invite Chris Van Steenberg, our Executive Vice President of Consumer Strategy and Delivery to join me on stage as we open the floor for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: A question for you on the new concept branch. How broad are you going to be replicating that throughout your branch network, given it's obviously a lot less cost intensive than your current branch?</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: Yes, a lot more branch effective. We had a little bet on what our first question was going to be. So delivery wins.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. VAN STEENBERG, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; HEAD OF PRODUCT MANAGEMENT - FIRST TENNESSEE BANK, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: Yes.</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: I will say this about our delivery platform. We don't lead in any of our markets with distribution. So it really comes down to focusing on understanding the markets we want to go to first; working with the market presidents to understand the key talent, the strategies that we can go after, et cetera, in those markets; what our marketing is going to look like as a part of all of that. And then distribution is complementary to that piece. So as I mentioned, there are 5 growth and target markets that we want to spend time on. We're looking at each of those 5 markets now and trying to determine what the distribution looks like in those areas. But what I can tell you is that we feel like we've got great presence already in those markets that we have. We are going to be looking at some of the micro markets inside those broader footprints to look for opportunities to be able to expand. I'll use Raleigh. It was on the slide, so I'll that as an example. We've got a strong distribution already in Raleigh. If we look underneath the Raleigh MSA, where we already have talented bankers and a marketing plan there, there's a couple of small pockets where there's high significant affluent and small business opportunities. Durham's a great example of that. It's 15, 18 miles from Raleigh. So that would be an example of a place for a really small footprint. A addition in that market would complement our overall plan there. So don't know if that answers your question, but that's -- we will look at those 5 markets specifically and look to add in, in those places as we have the opportunity. The flip side of distribution is how we continue to optimize. And so that's a core competency that we have and we know we have to fund growth in these new markets and so we will continue to look at optimizing in places where we have the ability to do that as we have the last 5 years, so that we can reinvest and have the money to reinvest back in our business.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You mentioned that you improved the efficiency ratio in the consumer bank by 12% over the past 5 years. Where is the efficiency ratio now for the consumer bank? Where is it running? And what's your goal over the next year or several?</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: Yes. So fully loaded, all in, we're running at 60...</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. VAN STEENBERG: 64.</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: 64-ish percent. We plan on continuing to move forward with our efficiency ratio. I mean as we continue to take costs out of our organization, and I talked about creating better, faster simpler processes for our employees and our customers. We'll continue to do that. We've had double digit reductions over the last 5 years and I think being close to that and approaching that over the next 5 years is certainly achievable for what we have planned both for our distribution network and then also just taking additional cost out of the organization as we're able to automate and focus on digital transformation in our network.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And then -- and secondly just around your overall branch plans. Can you just remind us the overall plans in terms of expansion of the network or how much you're closing over the next several years?</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: Yes. I wish it was static saying that we have a plan and a number today. We are very aggressive. I said aggressive, but thoughtful earlier in terms of branch distribution. It's a dynamic process. We look all the time at where we have the opportunity to consolidate locations, which will give us the opportunity to kind of reinvest back in new ones, but it's not something where we come up with a number every year that says, hey, we're going to take out this many from the bottom of the organization. Branches that we closed the last -- I said 18 months, closed 69 in the last 18 months. Some of those locations, if we look back 3, 4, 5 years ago, we said were not an opportunity for us to close because we can't get too far ahead of the pace of where our customers are going. If they're not migrating fast enough and that's our opportunity to get them to migrate to digital. But we don't want to get in front of that because it impacts our retention and also impacts our acquisition. So we'll continue to be very aggressive as our customer preferences change. We definitely don't want to lag that, but don't want to get too far in front of it. In terms of growth, we will share those over the -- BJ will be able to share them over the next couple of quarters as we dig into those 5 key markets. So it's Nashville, Raleigh, Charleston, Fort Lauderdale and Naples and then be able to share with you kind of what our thoughts are to complete some of the distribution that we're looking at in those areas.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Great. So my question relates to Southwest Florida and the consumer banking opportunity there. Certainly, those markets, Naples, Fort Myers tend to skew older, particularly in the affluent segment and so with older clients, is it more of a challenge to take market share from that perspective? And what's the strategy to grow in the affluent areas in those regions specifically?</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: Yes, great questions. So older customers tend to want relationship bankers. And I think First Tennessee does that really, really well, and it's something that our capital bank -- bankers in those markets also do really well. So we have had and seen tremendous growth, as I talked about a little bit earlier and just in the last 90 days as we've been able to come out of focusing on conversion and really focusing on cultivating new relationships. We've added marketing, a marketing overlay component to Florida and we've got customers coming in across all of the generational spectrums coming in to open new accounts and have conversations with our bankers. So we've been real pleased. We've got experienced bankers in those markets. As you know, the banking competition in Florida is extensive. But as Jeff said, hiring and retaining and keeping the very best people there. We have not seen any issue in terms of attracting new business and bringing the full breadth and depth of our new organization to those markets it gives us an opportunity to offer things that they were not able to offer before. So we talk about private client and wealth management. Those are both new offerings in that market that we'll be able to bring to Southwest Florida.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: [Jimmy here.] I had a question for you. You talked about you're seeing double-digit annualized deposit growth out of the new Carolina markets. Just talk about what types of deposits you're seeing the growth and what's the cost of those?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. VAN STEENBERG: Yes. So we're seeing it across the spectrum. And so our focus is winning primary relationships. Our value proposition doesn't lead with rate, but as Tammy referenced, it is a component and it's part of what customers expect, particularly as you see the competition heating up over the course of 2018. So we've been delivering that through, as Tammy referenced, we've got a relationship-first approach. We're attracting primary transacting relationships, and we're also winning high-value deposits in money market in CDs. We're not leading the market and so there is no intents to lead the market within -- with our rates in any of our footprint whether it's legacy Tennessee or in the capital bank market. And so we're coming in, I think, below the market leading competitors, but I think we're coming in at a competitive rate that matching up with our relationship-first approach and the marketing that Capital Bank really historically never did. We're creating more opportunities at the top end of the funnel to enable us to capture share. But we're not finding that we have to price outside the market on any level in order to get that double digit growth.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: The other question I had, so the challenge from many banks, particularly your size, is acquiring millennial customers that don't use branches. What is your strategy? Can you talk about customer acquisition trends? Like, what are you actually seeing in terms of bringing new millennial customers in?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. VAN STEENBERG: Yes. As we look at our data and benchmark against both regional peers and the national banks, we see they're actually capturing our fair share of both Gen Y and Gen Z customers. And in fact, we were indexed on the Gen Z customers. And while for the more transactional -- more basic needs that they've got, digital first tends to be the solution. We still see more than 50% of those customers coming to our branches at least once a year in order to solve a more complex need, whether it's buying their first home, starting to save for retirement, et cetera, they're still coming in to talk to their banker. So we're still seeing a lot of volume to that.</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: And our average age in terms of just new accounts this year has gone down significantly, which shows kind of the full range of being able to do that. I think our new account average this year is in the low 40s. And historically, on the First Tennessee side, we've had a higher 40s, low 50s range. So we are seeing acquisition come kind of across, as Chris said, all of the generational spectrums.</p><p>BROCKER CLINTON VANDERVLIET, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR BANKS ANALYST OF MID CAP, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Just as a follow up to that. It's Brock Vandervliet, UBS. This quarter, I'd say, across the industry, one of the trends was really a mix shift that became quite pronounced with particularly declines in non-interest-bearing growth rates and some managements going as far as saying new growth is likely to come from all interest bearing going forward. What -- where do you kind of come out in terms of future growth in the mix shift that you expect?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. VAN STEENBERG: Well, I think certainly our recent trend is probably not as extreme as we saw (inaudible) Wall Street Journal article last week, week before last, around that. So I think when we look at our noninterest, we're seeing modest growth. Certainly compared to how we forecast out the next 5 years at the low end of the range there. We are seeing much faster growth in the interest-bearing products. We're balancing that again by capturing full relationships and so as we look at -- I'll use our private client population as an example. We're not just -- we're not chasing hot money, we're not just capturing the interest bearing, 91% of our private client population with those high balances and their accounts have got a primary transacting relationship with us. So while there is an element of bringing rate in, we're also capturing the core relationship.</p><p>BROCKER CLINTON VANDERVLIET: If we think about the change in the landscape to branches becoming less important, technology becoming more important, it feels like that may be shifts the dynamic a bit in favor of banks with very big tech budgets and very big marketing budgets and maybe the branch network becomes less important. Are you kind of seeing any sign of the big banks doing better at the expense of some of the regional competitors, the community bank competitors that you're seeing?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. VAN STEENBERG: As we look at -- so there's a -- I think, a couple of components to that answer. We don't see share -- we don't see our customers leaving us for the larger institutions. So as we look at our outflows, where it's going, we don't see a particular category. And I think Tammy referenced it, better than 90% retention rate. We don't see a category or an individual institution where share is moving from us to them. And while branches are perhaps less important for certain segments of the population, both looking at our target segments and then looking at how you see some of the larger national players announcing their continued investment in branches and you see some of the digital first banks building physical branches, they're recognizing the value of having both options, right? I think as we look at channels, you never take a channel out, you simply continue to add and that's because the customers have a desire to bank with you however they want to and so we've got to have the ability to meet their needs in whichever channel they decide they want to come to us. I don't know, if you would add anything?</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: I would just say we are big enough as an organization to have the technology budget that we need to take care of the things that matter most to our customers. So the good news is the last 5, 7, 8 years, we have built our technology platforms to be able to scale and do the acquisitions that we want to do, do the things that we want to do and now we can take that focus in our technology spend, and BJ will talk a little bit about this, this afternoon in terms of what that percentage is, but we can take that technology spend and really focus it on customer experiential things that matter most for our target segment customers and Dawn will highlight that a little bit this afternoon as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Maybe just a follow up on 2 of the questions that were asked. One of the things that was mentioned earlier was about how you elevate -- wanting to elevate the brand? Can you just maybe talk about how you elevate the brand given that some of these markets are highly competitive and you do have a lot of larger bank competitors who probably are spending a lot more money? And then second -- I'll ask my second question upfront, you talked about 91% retention. Can you maybe just talk about how that compares versus peers? How do you think that compares across peers? And a follow up to what Jeff had asked. Is it different across markets? Is it different across different kinds of competitors? Or are you seeing less retention in markets that are highly concentrated in large institutions and better retention in markets where you're competing against smaller institutions?</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: I'll try and answer...</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. VAN STEENBERG: It's a lot of questions to unbundle.</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: You came back up on that. So a couple of things around retention. We see strong retention across all of our markets. And generally, retention for the most part is driven by customer satisfaction net promoter's scores. It is also driven by primacy. So we spend a lot of time really making sure that we get primary banking relationships with customers. And banks that do that well, like us, have strong customer retention. Banks that don't have a strong core checking account business, core checking account relationships, see a little bit more turn. And so it's top quartile in terms of customer retention and comparison to peers, we do really well and we do that because we've got primary checking account relationships. In terms of elevating the brand, so the unique opportunity that we have across our organization is that we compete with small community banks in Tennessee, we compete with large national banks and the way we show up in our markets is different and unique and we do that as Jeff and Carol said through our people. And so when we're competing against smaller banks, we have the opportunity to elevate our brand by talking about the full complement and the breadth and depth of our organization that some of the smaller banks and credit unions can't offer. When we compete against national banks and talk about elevating our brand and spending time out there selling our bank to prospects and to customers, it's about creating -- adding value in local decision-making and what we're able to do because of the size of organization that we are. Being nimble and flexible and being able to put together deals and products and packages and test and learn things that a larger organization can't. So we're really trying to, one, through our people; and then two, really understanding what value we bring in those particular communities and balancing them.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. VAN STEENBERG: Well, in the example -- the story that David shared about the cement company where it started out as a commercial opportunity, it evolved into a consumer and wealth opportunity. That's -- again, it's not just one line of business showing up to engage with the customer, it's calling their colleague down the street to say, \"hey, listen, I've got this great opportunity, let's go do a joint call.\" And so we really do win and you've heard this a lot and you'll hear it over the course of the rest of the day and over the next several years as well when we show up as a team. And it's bringing all the value to the customer and thinking about how we can help them achieve their objectives. One of the thing to add to the brand, Tammy referenced this when she referenced share of voice, and Dawn's got a presentation there where she will talk more about customer experience. We try to be very intentional where we focused our energy in our 5 focus growth markets, where it wasn't going to require that outsized marketing spend as well. So trying to be judicious and it's not all brand, it's all channels, it's all mediums in terms of how we go to market and show up and where customers are getting their perspective from as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So Chris, we used to have a metric of a branch covered so many miles, and the digital, at least what I'm envisioning is happening, is the digital is expanding that reach. So what is the current metric? Is it the number of people, in a sense of you do a circumference around the branch, is it miles? What is the typical way that when you're optimizing these branches, what's the metric that you can kind of use to say okay, that's what we can cover?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. VAN STEENBERG: Yes, we're looking at it on a couple of layers and Tammy will add to this comment, but it's less about the number of people than looking at what's the pockets of affluence target customers and really what's the deposit gathering opportunity. And so that's really the primary circumference driver that we use around that and digital does expand to that reach, both in terms of how they can interact with us but also how we generate awareness, right? So it's not just doing -- talk about brand. Brand awareness doesn't just happen through TV and print, it goes out through digital mediums. And so we're using that to both expand awareness and to expand our ability to serve customers beyond a drive radius.</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: I mean, drive time is certainly something that's important for customers, it's something that they take a look at. So we -- it's one of the components that we use. Surprisingly enough, as we do our evaluation of our network, most customers use somewhere between 3 and 4 branch locations. And so we really spend time looking at their traffic patterns and not only when they show up in a location but how they're using, as Chris said all of our digital channels and kind of pull those together. The other piece we're very thoughtful of is when we optimize our distribution and take a 4 branch down to 3 branches or 2 branches, is the potential opportunity to lose acquisition as a result of that. You want to have enough presence where people think of you top of mind when they have a purchase decision. And so we really balance all of that together. So it's not just about the transactions that kind of flow through those locations, what's the full opportunity of acquisition available on the market when we look at it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So maybe another way to think about that is, has it expanded 50%, 100%? What is the amount...</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: What we used to say...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Of branches in a city is cut in half, just some kind of rule of thumb, what have you kind of imagined? I know every market is different, but just in general.</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: Yes. It is more -- it's less about the distance and more about drive time, but generally, the less people want to come in, so they used to come in once a month, now they come in once a year. So you know you're willing to drive a little bit further in order to do that. So what used to be an average of 6, 8, 10 minutes' drive time, 15 to 20 minutes is now reasonable for somebody, assuming that they don't have to pass 10 competitors on their way, right? Because if they got to pass a lot of people on the way, then you lose opportunities every time they do that. So again it's kind of a balance, but you will start to see an expansion in terms of radius for locations as people need to use them less.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Very helpful. Now Tammy, 2 questions for you. In a sense of when you're thinking of the consumer bank -- running the consumer bank as director of the consumer bank, what's -- the vision that we've heard is touch, contact, products, but how do you -- what is your vision in the sense of digital and all the pieces that come together? How do you see 10 years from now, what are you moving towards? And how does your experience kind of take you in a certain direction? So I was just curious what's your vision is for this particular business line?</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: Yes. So we will continue to optimize our network. We'll continue to work on getting customers as they choose to migrate to digital capabilities and you'll hear Dawn talk about that this afternoon, particularly in certain segments of our business, right? Being able to optimize and really being more efficient in certain parts of the organization will allow us to invest in higher growth and higher pockets of profitability in our business, which is really around our affluent segment and our affluent strategy. And those still will require even though a lot of their transactions will migrate digitally, it still requires -- it is a higher touch model, it's a relationship model. And that's something that I think is our sweet spot where we can win. We will continue to see and attract mass market customers because of the markets that we're in and we're going to work as quick as we can to migrate some of those to digital. But we will continue to be invested in relationship banking with our affluent segment customers and our small business and business banking customers and we feel like that's a place where we can continue to win.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER J. VAN STEENBERG: I think that's a wrap on our time. Thank you all for your time and engagement this morning.</p><p>TAMMY S. LOCASCIO: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Now please welcome Executive Vice President, Wholesale Banking, Todd Jones.</p><p>TODD JONES, EVP OF WHOLESALE BANKING, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: Good morning. My name is Todd Jones. I joined the bank a little over 2 years ago in connection with the franchise finance portfolio acquisition. My team and I were immediately impressed with the culture and the leadership here at the bank, and that's only grown since our time over the last couple of years.</p><p>A couple of months ago, I was given the opportunity to lead the wholesale banking organization and I couldn't be more excited about what our growth prospects are going forward and I'll share those with those with you today.</p><p>There are 3 key themes about the strength of our commercial banking platform you will hear throughout today's presentation. One, we build deep profitable relationships supported by robust data to drive decision making. Two, in our legacy commercial bank in Tennessee, along with our new markets in North and South Carolina and South Florida, we see opportunities for continued growth in both loans and deposits. Three, our specialized industry verticals produce strong returns and they are all well positioned in their markets for continued profitable growth.</p><p>On Page 3, you'll see that we have a $19 billion loan portfolio and $9 billion in deposits spread across 9,000 relationships. We are relationship-driven organization. Our 741 dedicated employees serve our customers every day providing the necessary capital to help them grow their businesses and manage their liquidity through our full suite of treasury products and services.</p><p>Among our strengths in this portfolio is our diversification across geographies and business lines. Here's some highlights.</p><p>First, we are strong in Tennessee and the market leader. Collectively, our Tennessee markets represent 55% of our commercial deposits and 28% of our loans. We will continue to win there.</p><p>Second, as you heard earlier from Jeff and Carol, our new market, the Carolinas and South Florida are large markets with significant opportunities to grow loans and deposits. Today, those combined markets represent only 20% of our loans and 15% of our deposits. We see the opportunity to not only target new middle-market customers between, say, $3 million and $500 million of revenue but we can also bring our expanded set of deposit and treasury capabilities to our existing capital bank customers.</p><p>Finally, we are unique, particularly for a bank our size to have such size and breadth in our specialized industry verticals. Together, they represent about half of our loan portfolio and 30% of our deposits.</p><p>Over the last 5 years, we have delivered strong balance sheet growth in both loans and deposits. A strategic acquisition, Capital Bank, an important component of our most recent strategic plan as you heard from Bryan, contributed $4.7 billion in loans and $1.2 billion in deposits. More importantly, however, was our growth during that same period excluding that acquisition. Our regional bank and specialized industry verticals combined to deliver an impressive 14% compound annual growth rate for our loan portfolio and 11% compound annual growth rate for our deposit book. We're well positioned to continue this momentum.</p><p>So why have we been so successful growing our balance sheet over the last 5 years? The answer, at its core, our customer's value, our differentiated approach and our results show it. Here's some highlights.</p><p>Our 2017 Greenwich Survey showed that 94% of our customers are highly satisfied with us. 94%. That satisfaction rate places us among the top performers in our peer set. Strong results like this define a relationship bank. A relationship bank also needs primary relationships to be successful and we excel there too. We are the lead bank for more than 3/4 of our relationships. Being the lead bank affords us the opportunity to deepen our relationships and bring our full suite of products and services to our customers. We see opportunity, especially in the Carolinas and South Florida to expand those relationships and increase our penetration rates.</p><p>So why does this work? What makes us so different? There are 4 key principles. First, as David mentioned earlier, we have localized decision making. Being nimble and close to the customer gives us an advantage in competitive situations. Second, we're involved in our local business communities, the chambers of commerce, professional associations, nonprofits and other organizations where our teams can connect with community influencers to help drive the right opportunities. Third, our brand recognition. We have a long history in Tennessee and our #1 market share provides us a competitive advantage for our teams versus the competition.</p><p>And finally, you've heard this a few times today, our people make all the difference. Their experience, knowledge of in connection to their communities and service mindset helps them build long-lasting relationships and we've done it profitably.</p><p>Over the last 3 years, we've been on a journey to enhance our profitability at the relationship and product level and we've delivered. We increased our economic profit by 84% per relationship over the last 3 years. During that same time, we increased the net income contribution for the business by 136%.</p><p>From our increased vigor and focus on profitability, 3 key elements of our success emerged. Number one, full lead relationships with deposits are key. When we have control of the relationship with the opportunity to cross sell additional products and services further enhancing our return profile. Two, we increased our average relationship size. Larger -- the math is simple, larger loans and deposit balances provide a better offset for fixed costs and generate more absolute revenue per opportunity. But increased balances are not enough without discipline. Third, we increased our intensity and focus on risk-adjusted loan pricing.</p><p>Capital is a finite resource, and we've added tools to help our teams evaluate each incremental opportunity. I will show you more on that in the next section.</p><p>Our customer data helps us build deep profitable relationships. Put more simply, good data yields better decision making. So how do we use it? On Page 8, you'll see an excerpt from our pricing and profitability tool. The boxes highlighted in blue summarize our relationship profitability. On the left, you'll see some basic attribute data about the relationship such as the loan fees, our fee profile and our credit grade. On the right is a mini P&amp;L that shows revenue, income, economic profit and our returns. Down below, our relationship managers and business leaders have visibility to the profitability of each product. This holistic relationship view, along with the product view, helps them make strategic decisions about each relationship and provides insights on what mix of products and services can enhance returns.</p><p>We also have visibility to the portfolios and performance of our relationship managers. For our legacy First Tennessee relationship managers, which include a mix of commercial and business bankers, our average loan portfolio per relationship manager is $77 million, and that number is $58 million for deposits. But the average is only part of the story, so is the dispersion. As I mentioned earlier, larger balances and correspondingly, larger portfolios per RM, are one of the components of enhancing our overall economic profit.</p><p>Now if we compare our newly-acquired Capital Bank portfolio and its dispersion to our legacy First Tennessee Bank portfolio, we see a substantial opportunity. On the loan side, the First Tennessee average portfolio is $15 million higher than Capital Bank. When you look to deposits, that differential was even more significant, it grows to $41 million. So what does this mean for our potential profitability enhancement?</p><p>If we raised the portfolio average for the Capital Bank portfolio to the size of the Legacy First Tennessee Bank portfolio averages, we see an opportunity for up to $42 million of incremental pretax income. Translating that into loans and deposits, it's up to $800 million of incremental loans and up to $2.3 billion of incremental deposits. Applying similar portfolio rigor and discipline as we've done for the last 3 years in Legacy First Tennessee Bank using the tools and techniques that I've outlined, can contribute to enhanced profitability for our business.</p><p>Looking ahead, we are excited about the potential we see in our growth markets, specifically, the Carolinas and South Florida. As Jeff mentioned in his presentation, we see opportunities there. In the Carolinas, we see a $27 billion commercial deposit opportunity and a $32 billion commercial loan opportunity. Correspondingly, in South Florida, those numbers are $28 billion for deposits and $38 billion for loans. Growing our share of these markets can be accomplished using some of the same strategies we developed to grow our national market that Carol shared earlier. They include #1, expanding our teams with the right talent who are connected in their markets and to key prospects. #2, leveraging that talent to move up market to larger, more profitable relationships. Again, back to the math problem I suggested before. Three, identifying cross-sell opportunities to expand existing relationships with our existing customers. And finally, focusing on key industries like healthcare, manufacturing and professional services that are not only high potential, but also where domain expertise matters to our customers, and it can be a differentiator.</p><p>Speaking of domain expertise, I'll now transition into our specialized industry verticals where specialization is our advantage. We're excited about the results we've achieved over the last 5 years in our specialized industry verticals. We've added $6 billion in incremental loan growth, a 134% growth rate, and we've done it profitably. Pretax contribution has increased 75% over the last 5 years, and 83% of all of our relationships are income profitable.</p><p>So what are the keys to success of these verticals? First, they're collectively an efficient delivery platform. The efficiency ratio, 29%. Second, the industry specialization creates fewer, more focused competitors than a traditional C&amp;I model. Third, and our biggest driver, our customers value the expertise of our teams, and we see that in our risk-adjusted returns.</p><p>Let me share a story with you from our franchise finance business. We have a longstanding customer who's a multiunit franchisee in a well-known national brand. He's grown his business through a combination of strategic acquisitions and organic growth, and has been quite successful doing that over the last 10 years or so. Earlier this year, he was evaluating strategic options, including an opportunistic buyout of his partner. As his leader and trusted adviser, the franchise finance team went to work helping him evaluate those options. The team provided insights on the capital required for each option and had numerous conversations on the trade-offs between an opportunistic buyout and having capital for growth and acquisition.</p><p>Initially, he decided on the buyout, and then the team had one more heart-to-heart as they sensed that emotion and logic or rational thinking were being mixed in, and we shared some additional analysis and had one more conversation. Time passed and ultimately, he decided to defer the buyout and refocus his efforts on growth.</p><p>Now we fast forward to this past October, he just closed on another multi-unit acquisition that will be accretive to his returns and profits. That would not have been possible, especially this soon, had he pursued that buyout opportunity. He was quick to send our team a note thanking us for the transaction like he always does, but more importantly, he appreciated the discussion, care and concern we had about helping him evaluate a significant strategic decision-making option, and that's true across our verticals. Our customers value support, candor and the analysis that comes from the domain expertise that our various teams have built in these verticals.</p><p>If you look at Page 16, this is an overview of the collection of businesses that make up our specialized industry verticals. As I mentioned earlier, we've grown loans by 134%, and that growth has been spread across these various verticals. Since our last Investor Day, I'll highlight 3 additions to the portfolio. First, back in May of 2014, we added our energy lending vertical. Second, and Carol touched on this earlier, back in 2016, we added a second healthcare vertical, this time specifically focused on private equity sponsors who are active in that space. And finally, in September 2016, which brought me and my team to the bank, we started the franchise finance group in connection with the portfolio of loans we acquired from GE Capital. In each case and here's what's important, teams with extensive industry experience were recruited from other institutions to build and grow those platforms.</p><p>Our prospects for continued growth are strong. David said it earlier, none of these businesses have more than 5% market share in their markets. Individually, these businesses are strong as you can see, but collectively, they are even stronger due to the diverse industries that they represent.</p><p>I'll now share highlights from 4 of the businesses. First is our vertical focused on loans to mortgage companies, it's also called our mortgage warehouse lending vertical. This platform provides lines of credit for mortgage lenders secured by high-quality liquid residential mortgages. We've grown this to be a $2.1 billion platform. This is our most economically profitable lending business, economic profit is up $10 million over the last 5 years, that's more than a 75% increase.</p><p>The key differentiators for this platform are the proprietary technology and processes used to run this business and manage our customer's warehouse lines.</p><p>Let me share a story with you now about how well, this business executes for its customers and why it's so well positioned for future growth. In the middle of last year, we had a small 15-year relationship on the West Coast, which sold out to a larger lender. As part of the negotiated sale terms, the owner of the small company required the buyer to get aligned with First Tennessee so she could continue using us. How has this relationship changed over the last year-plus, the larger lender is so pleased with our product and service level that it jettisoned 2 other warehouse lenders that were providing it capital and asked us for an increase to our line. On top of it, we're in active discussions right now about adding additional treasury products and services to the relationship. There are a lot more stories just like that one in this business. They've received many calls from our customers asking for us to increase our line so that they can replace one or more existing lenders in their facility because of the way that we deliver and execute in this space. What do our customers value? Our reliability, our ease of doing business and our nimbleness and our flexibility.</p><p>Next is our asset-based lending business. This is a traditional working capital lending platform. Loans are typically supported by receivables and inventory, it's also a $2 billion platform. Much like mortgage warehouse, we've also had success profitably growing this business. Over the last 5 years, loans are up 75% and economic profit has increased by 50%. Credit discipline, along with robust ongoing monitoring and our field exams have been keys to mitigating losses in this vertical. Through our regionally deployed business development team and our focus on industries we know well such as wholesale trade, manufacturing and transportation, we believe our asset-based lending vertical is well positioned for continued success.</p><p>Next is our franchise finance vertical. This business makes loans to restaurant franchisors, franchisees, regional chains and private equity sponsors that invest across all 3 of those channels. Typical brands include established recognizable concepts like Taco Bell, Wendy's, Burger King and Dunkin' Donuts. We established this business back in 2016 when we acquired a portfolio of restaurant loans and recruited a team to grow the business. Credit discipline here is critical, it's about identifying strong brands with the right management teams, and then remaining disciplined on advanced rates and terms, particularly since many of the credits are secured by cash flow and equipment.</p><p>We've been building our brand awareness over the last couple of years in this vertical. We've shared proprietary research with the market and we've been frequent presenters at brand and industry conferences. At only $800 million in assets, our share is low, and we see continued opportunity for prudent growth in the franchise finance segment.</p><p>Finally, our commercial real estate lending vertical, our formula here is simple. We select high-quality sponsors who have high-quality projects in markets that we know well, predominantly, the southeast. Diversification is also important, as you can see, we mentioned -- manage our concentrations by collateral type, by market and by project size. Our average relationship, $14 million. Similar to franchise finance, credit and structure discipline is important here, too, particularly at this point in the real estate cycle.</p><p>Our philosophy has been all along to balance growth and prudency, and we'll continue to strike that balance going forward to help drive continued profitability.</p><p>In addition to growing loans in our specialized industry verticals, we are also increasing our focus on generating deposits. We see 3 areas in the specialty lines for outsized growth. #1, in our mortgage warehouse business, as David said earlier, we plan to capture more share of corporate and escrow deposits from our customers and mortgage servicers. We've already won a $53 million mandate this quarter and we see more opportunities similar to that in our pipeline. Two, in our correspondent banking platform, we are underway with some digital platform enhancements to make it even easier for our partner banks to do business with us. When Dawn comes up after lunch, she'll share more on our digital strategy going forward.</p><p>Third and finally, in our corporate finance group, we have an initiative underway with our treasury management team to develop specific products and capabilities to support the fintechs as it relates to payment processing. We are excited about these specific initiatives, but the deposit in treasury focus doesn't stop there. It's been increased across all of the specialized industry verticals to help drive our balance sheet growth and provide the necessary fuel for continued loan growth.</p><p>So to recap, we believe our commercial bank is well positioned for growth for 3 important reasons. One, we build deep, profitable relationships supported by robust data to drive decision-making. Two, in our legacy commercial bank in Tennessee, along with our new markets in the Carolinas and South Florida, we see opportunities for continued growth in both loans and deposits. And 3, our specialized industry verticals produced strong returns, and they are well positioned in their markets for continued profitable growth.</p><p>As I ask David Popwell, Steve Hawkins and Susan Springfield to join me on stage, we'll share a short video highlighting some of the themes I covered in today's presentation.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce Steve Hawkins, who's joined us on the stage. Brian mentioned Steve earlier, but from 2012, up until the time that we recently named Todd the Executive Vice President in charge of Wholesale Banking, Steve had that role. Steve has been with our company for over 37 years, and in the video that you just watched with John Culp talking about dealing with the same people for 30 years, he was referring to Steve. But Steve is a great relationship banker and as Brian said, has had a huge influence on our company from the standpoint of really crystallizing our strategy with these specialty lines of business. And it's been very successful, and so we appreciate all that Steve has done.</p><p>STEVE J. HAWKINS, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; DIRECTOR OF SPECIALTY WHOLESALE BANKING - FIRST TENNESSEE BANK, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I guess, 2 questions on the deposits in the business. So if I look at what you laid out on Slide 3, you show $19 billion of loans and $9 billion of deposits in the business. And I was a little bit surprised that given that you said that you're the lead bank for 76% of the relationships that you would have that high of a loan-to-deposit ratio in the business. When I look at it, clearly the specialty business is one of the big drivers of over $10 billion of loans and just $3 billion of deposits. So my first question is, what are the strategies in place to close that gap in terms of this business becoming more self-funded over time? And then second, when I look at the opportunity you laid out regarding Capital Bank, that $58 million per RM of deposits versus just $17 million at Capital Bank, what is it about Capital Bank's footprint that made it so much lower? Was it just it's early in its evolution, was it products? And what is the strategy that you have in place to actually close that gap?</p><p>TODD JONES: I'll start, and then Steve maybe you can jump in on the first question. But as we look at the -- your question on, especially the specialty verticals and the mix of loan to deposits, there's a couple of things there. First, those tend to be larger relationships for us, they tend to be businesses that are using capital, specifically, loans, as part of how they're driving their growth. So they tend to be a little lighter on deposits. So part of it's fundamental, but also the second part of it really is the effort and heat and light that we're going to put on it now to capitalize on opportunities where we weren't before. The returns were strong and now as we're seeing with some success that we've had beginning to the middle of this year and expectations we have going forward, to capture more share there than we had historically. Steve?</p><p>STEVE J. HAWKINS: Sure, I would echo what Todd said. The specialty businesses, those verticals, they're not deposit -- most of them are not deposit-centered businesses. ABL, we control the cash in our ABL and we take that cash and we apply it to a loan balance. So that's just a business that's not going to generate significant balances for us, unfortunately. But the returns there are very good on the loan side, and the treasury business there is very good on the fee side for us. So we'll continue to do that. We do have some opportunities, though, to drive deposits in some of our lines. You heard about mortgage warehouse, we will put some heat and light on that, we think we'll get significant traction there. Correspondent, what we'll do there, we'll generate significant balances and DDAs as well. Our CRE line of business, we have 500 -- almost $500 million in our CRE line of business and deposits today. We'll continue to grow and expand that. So I think on the specialty side, I think the things we're doing there, the heat and light, we also -- we haven't mentioned this much, but earlier this year, we created our syndication team in our company, where we're going to be the -- we said lead bank but that lead bank, that 75%, most of that is 1 bank, it's us that's 75%. But particularly, on some of our large relationships, that we would have lost that relationship as it outgrew us in the past. We'll be able to be the lead bank on those and keep the deposit and relationships in First Tennessee and grow that as well, what we're doing there.</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: And then your question associated with Capital Bank, Capital Bank did not have the treasury management products that we have at First Tennessee. And so the ability to go in and offer these commercial customers more sophisticated products will allow us to have more deposits, offer them the opportunity to bank with us primarily. And you heard Jeff talk earlier about adding some treasury management professionals in Florida, and we've added a few in the mid-Atlantic as well. Because obviously, when you're talking about middle-market companies, they're wanting more than just a deposit account, they're wanting some of those treasury management, and that's really going to help us fill that gap as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Maybe you could say a little bit about the healthcare business. You mentioned private equity-backed companies, what sort of leverage are we looking at there? And then, I guess, stepping back across the specialty lending businesses, maybe more a question for Susan. But on the credit side, what are the things that you see some of your competitors doing that you're not willing to do from a credit standpoint?</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: Right. I'll -- let me start with that one and we'll go back to the healthcare, and Todd and Sue can jump in as well. We talk about -- and you heard every speaker talk about our disciplined approach. We do believe, one, we've got great growth opportunities ahead of us. But we also know when to say no and when to let something go to a competitor. It could be a bank competitor. We're also seeing nonbank competitors come in. We've seen that, I know, in franchise finance, we've seen it in commercial real estate, we've seen it in healthcare. And so I think it's about remaining disciplined even while having the growth goals. What you see in terms of competition that we're not willing to compete against is when you have very little repayment. So 1% amortization type term loans, where you have leverage that exceeds -- that's far ahead of where it should be and wouldn't sustain a downturn, so we're cautious there. And then also, I think, and Todd talked about this earlier, really evaluating how management is managing that business. So what is their trajectory? What's their risk appetite and making sure that we're selecting customers that we can stick with and can stick with us through a cycle. And I don't know if you want to add anything on things you're seeing from competition where sometimes we'll choose to let it go or not compete. All that being said, there are opportunities where we need to sharpen our pencil, and we've done that to maintain a good relationship.</p><p>STEVE J. HAWKINS: Well, I would add things that our competitors are doing, we're very fortunate. I think, Carol used the term, rainmakers, and we have a lot of really good relationship managers in our company, and they can deliver the business. And we have robust pipelines in our company and because of that, it gives us the opportunity to be really selective on what we're doing when we look at credit and we look at pricing. So things we see that other banks do, because of our strong pipelines, we have the opportunity to be a little bit more selective, we have the opportunity to say no a little bit more sometimes when we need to because we're focused on soundness, profitability and end growth, things that we focus on. So our pipelines are really strong, we can be a little bit more selective. We see all kinds of things that we say no about, whether it's amortization, guarantor support, pricing, covenants, all those things that are debts. We look at a whole different lines of businesses across all of our core commercial and specialty lines of businesses that sometimes we just can't get there when we look at things and because of our pipelines, it gives us the ability to say we'll pass on it.</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: And then your question specific to the sponsor-backed healthcare, typically, leverage is in the 4x or less, that's kind of where we want to be, I would say, in most of our leverage businesses. We've actually had a decline in leverage lending transactions over the last 12 months. Commitments are down a little over $200 million in our overall leverage lending portfolio, it's something that we don't want to be overexposed there, it's less than 3% of our commercial loan portfolio is leverage lending. The sponsor backed, specifically, we're very selective with the sponsors that we do business with. And actually, Brian, David and I have met the sponsors that we've done business with to date in that portfolio. So we make sure not just the healthcare team, but also executive management, is meeting with these private equity sponsors, understanding how they do business and how they've supported their transactions over time. So it's a well-run business for us, and we're managing it, I think, in a great way. We do see opportunities to grow that prudently with some of these sponsors that we've met.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Hey, just a couple of questions on the mortgage warehouse business. So 270 roughly clients today, what would that number have been like a year or 2 years ago? And then can you talk about how pricing has been impacted and how you expect it to be impacted, just given the pretty sizable market share you've taken and having to compete with some pretty aggressive peers -- peer banks?</p><p>STEVE J. HAWKINS: I don't know about a year ago, but I know about 3 years ago, it was about 130 customers we had in that group. Today, it's up to 270, as you mentioned. We have seen pricing get more aggressive in that line of business, it's tough to compete in it. We feel like we have great bankers in that line of business, though. We have people that understand the business, they're engaged in the business as well. Todd told the story about the one that wanted us to stay in the financing business and we've grown it and expanded that even after an acquisition. And then we have some systems, some back-office systems, and people and processes, where we're more nimble, we're more flexible, and we're more easy to do business with than our competitors to be honest with you in that. And we win business day in and day out in that line of business because of that.</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: Just in the last 6 months, and I'm looking at Bob Garrett, he's in the back, he manages that line for us. Just in the last 6 months, the client count has grown more than 15%. Bob's added a couple of RMs over the last year or so, a year or 2, who've brought in additional relationships. So we have been able to grow that client list.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Commercial losses the last several quarters have been very, very low, particularly outside of CRE. If you go back the last 13, 14 years, they've been an average, I think, close to 70 basis points, but your portfolio is so much different. Going forward, how should losses evolve relative to the past? Is past any guidepost or should you have less losses just because of the way you've re-mixed and specialty is a bigger component?</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: We do believe that our losses going forward, will be less than they were during the last downturn, for a number of reasons that you've heard today. One, we do believe in diversification. We think it's just very important to make sure that we're managing that and the bankers in the room know that we have robust discussions with management about what limits should be, exception tolerances, et cetera. The other thing that we have, we have very little credit card exposure, very little auto exposure. So when you look at the overall mix for us, it's -- we think it's an advantage for us. And then I think last but not least, is just the fact that we talked about the local decision-making and I believe strongly, and David gave an example of the way we us it in a positive way, which is great, right? So you really know the customer, you're able to respond, but I would tell you it also helps us on the ones that maybe we need to avoid, right? By having local leadership like the Carol's and the Jeff's and I've got credit risk managers in all of those geographies and the lines of business and they, together, can say, \"This is not the type of company we want to bank based on things that you might not pick up just from a financial statement.\" And so for all those reasons, I feel very good about our portfolio and the ability to sustain for the long-term.</p><p>MATTHEW JOHN KEATING, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Matthew Keating from Barclays. Just a question. We heard earlier today that bonefish is a noun and a verb here at First Horizon. So I guess the question really relates to -- we heard from the consumer banking division earlier and now we heard a lot of detail on commercial banking. In general, banks your size tend to say that their consumer banking operations are not positive economic profit businesses at this point, maybe they're not earning their cost of capital. I guess, my question would be maybe for David, in terms of how you allocate capital incrementally between the consumer and commercial banking division now? And maybe you could also comment on whether First Horizon's consumer banking operation -- we heard economic profit is growing, but is it actually earnings its economic cost of capital? I'd just appreciate your perspective there in terms of deploying capital between the 2 business lines within the regional bank.</p><p>DAVID T. POPWELL: Yes, it's -- there's a formulaic methodology that based upon the loan portfolio size and the actual credit grades of those portfolios and with respect to, I guess, the mix, the mix of loans and deposits, the numbers fall out where they are. The reason that we earned our cost of capital and the reason that our consumer business is so profitable is that we have a very high level of deposit balances and we are a very, I don't want to stay small, but relative to our deposit size, we do not emphasize consumer lending to the extent, I think, a lot of other banks do. And therefore, that business draws a lower capital allocation and therefore, with the profitability from the deposits, we drive positive returns in that business, along with the fees that we earn from our deposit products and our wealth management products.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just regarding your national businesses as part of the specialty verticals. I know in the past you've had issues in some of the national businesses that you've been in. You talked about how you've retrenched and mortgage and everything nationally before. How is this -- how are you confident that you're going to avoid the similar pitfalls of national lending when it comes to these specialty businesses? And Susan you mentioned now twice that the fact that it's 30% of your loans hasn't changed your assumption on long-term credit experience. So how do you look at that?</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: Well now I'll let Steve jump in and Todd as well. But when you look at -- so I've mentioned some of our several business lines that are natural in nature, and have been for a number of years. The mortgage warehouse lending business we've been in for 25-plus years, it's a national footprint. But even while it's national -- and I mentioned earlier about David and Brian and I go out and meet customers in all of our lines of business, we're not just buying into loans. We're calling on companies, we're going to meet them in their offices, we're doing the field exams and asset-based lending, the due diligence we need to do in mortgage warehouse, making sure we're visiting sites in commercial real estate. So we're really, really doing the basic blocking and tackling really well. So even though a few of these businesses are national in nature, we're going out and we're calling, we're touching, we're touching the customer, we're visiting factory sites, we're involved in trade group associations to make sure that we have insight into what others are seeing and thinking, so making sure we're continuing to build that knowledge base. So I really do believe that we're doing it the right way and we're doing it with the -- one of the things that we've got in place today that we didn't during the last downturn are these fairly prescriptive portfolio limits and data and analytics into are we making exceptions or not, and we've got a limit on the tolerance limit on exceptions. So we believe that we're building -- while we've got an emphasis on these specialty groups, they've performed better during the cycle, we've got insight into the portfolios and we're being very disciplined. Steve and Todd may want to add as well.</p><p>STEVE J. HAWKINS: Well, I would add 1 -- I think Susan said it very well. We're very disciplined in what we do. We're very engaged with the customer base and the big difference is, it is a finite, small -- relatively small customer base. We're going to grow and expand it, but when you look at mortgage warehouse, 270 customers, ABL probably 200 customers in that group, franchise finance, probably 150-or-so. I mean, so it's a finite group of customers, they're larger relationships, we have a team that really handles those relationship, there's an RM and a portfolio manager, and a line-of-business leader, and a credit risk manager, that's all engaged in monitoring and handling those relationships. And it's just like what you saw on the Maverick video here. I mean, we're engaged with them day in and day out, it's not like we make the loan, and then ride away -- which is what we often did on the mortgage side when we had a national footprint. And that was hundreds of thousands of loans on a nationwide basis, so it was a little bit different then.</p><p>TODD JONES: And I'll add one piece that I think is at the core of this, especially in the specialty verticals, and that's the domain expertise, knowing the space, I'll take franchise finance as an example. Being connected to the right concepts, knowing who the good operators are in those systems, being active at the trade conferences and the brand shows, and we've had pretty active participation in there, and so when you understand the market and understand the separation between those opportunities that are strong, and those opportunities that aren't, it lets you transcend geography because it's more about making sure you get connected to the right opportunities, really, regardless of where they are in the country, when you know what the playing field is.</p><p>MARLIN LACEY MOSBY: So Steve, I have a question for you. John O'Connor, which was a senior credit officer before Susan, walked into my office one day and said, \"Marty, I know that the end of the world has come because chicken farmers are getting debt placements and we're losing loans to capital markets to chicken farmers in Arkansas,\" which was a specialty lending for us. We went through the financial crisis, and it seems like the environment's changed because we're seeing all the super regional banks going back into these specialty lendings, these verticals. It's a very common theme now. So you've been through this, you're experienced, you've been through the whole cycle of all these different times. Could you just let us digest a little bit of why it's different today than where we were losing even the chicken farmers in Arkansas? Why now we're being able to be successful across the industry because it's not just First Horizon, there's been the others that are taking this same stance? So just curious from the standpoint.</p><p>STEVE J. HAWKINS: Well, Marty, I've been in a lot those chicken houses. And it was an experience. But I think -- the banks that are getting into it, we've seen that through the years. We've seen people -- I know Bob's seen people get in and out of warehouse, mortgage warehouse lending. We've seen people get in and out of ABL. We've seen people get in and out of franchise finance lendings. So we have seen people do that. I think the thing that is different at First Tennessee than other people getting in and getting out, I think we understand it. We understand the commitment that you have to make at the credit level, at the people level, at the systems level, that -- you have to make that decision, and those types of decisions to support this industry, to be engaged in the industry. We see people that say, \"We're going to be specialists.\" But what Todd talked about, being engaged in the industry, being at their conferences, being at their credit association, knowing what's going on in the industry, adding that value to that customer base, that's what's different at First Tennessee. I can't speak to other banks about why they decide to get in and out of things, but we see them getting in and out of it all the time. And I think it's different at First Tennessee. When we get into something, we're committed to it, we're going to stay in it, we're going to manage our way through it and that's been our business model and it's been very successful for us.</p><p>SUSAN L. SPRINGFIELD: One other thing I just want to add on, really, Marty, to your question and to John's and that is our focus on economic profit is something that's really been a focus point after the last downturn. And so instead of -- our leaders are not measured or compensated or evaluated based on just growth, they're based -- they're evaluated on economic profit. And obviously, economic profit includes net credit charge. And if we started booking loans, big loans with very low pass PD grades, that economic profit would drop pretty dramatically. And so it incents people to do the right thing both at origination as well as during servicing and make those tough calls sometimes to say, \"Maybe this isn't the right one.\" So we -- I think that is something that is definitely different in the way we manage the business today, that leaders are not just evaluated on pure growth but that capital, that credit capital charge comes into play in a big way.</p><p>STEVE J. HAWKINS: We're at our break time for lunch, so you'll hear some instructions shortly about what's next.</p><p>AARTI BOWMAN, SVP OF IR, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to invite you to move up to the LA Jackson restaurant.</p><p>(Break)(presentation)</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>DAWN C. MORRIS, EXECUTIVE VP AND CHIEF DIGITAL BANKING &amp; MARKETING OFFICER, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORPORATION: Thank you. As you can see in that video, today, now, more than ever, relevancy is the best currency in the age of the customer. It's important for us to be relevant to our customers because essentially, that's how we're going to win. Good afternoon, I'm Dawn Morris, the new Chief Digital Banking and Marketing Officer. As Brian shared earlier, I've been at First Horizon for just over 8 weeks now. I'm thrilled to have joined this great team from Webster Bank, and I'm excited to share with you today how we're going to utilize our existing customer data to help us win and be more relevant to our target customers in both commercial banking and consumer banking, to help drive profitable growth for First Horizon.</p><p>Over the next 20 minutes, I'm going to walk you through how we will be more relevant to our target customers. I'm going to share with you how we've done this and how we're able to transform our customer experience to help us drive growth.</p><p>As you've heard all day today at First Horizon, we've been taking a hard look at ourselves. Deconstructing what we're good at, where our value lies and how our customer segments deliver profitability. This self-examination has been a part of our comprehensive bonefish strategy that has set us up well for transformation. A transformation that optimizes the experience we offer customers and puts us on the path of doubling our economic profit to the regional bank.</p><p>By transforming our customer experience from the outside in, we will create a win-win for our customers and for the bank. This strategy will help us drive the twin factors of profitable revenue growth, along with expense and optimization realization.</p><p>Today, as we discuss this transformation, we'll see where we've proven the track record of our commitment to excellence, what we're focused on, connecting profitability knowledge with customer-centric insights and finally, what better looks like. How a transformed customer experience ensures our ability to double economic profit for the regional bank.</p><p>Our mission at the start of this journey was to look inward. What aspects of our organization were most essential in helping us transform our customer experience to drive value? What proven platforms could we build upon? Our examination identified 3 key pillars. The first pillar is a culture committed to excellence. The second pillar is customer and employee loyalty. And finally, the third pillar is our bonefish profitability and insights.</p><p>Let me start with the first pillar. As you can see on this slide, we've had a culture committed to excellence. And transformation often encounters its great inspection in the context of a corporate culture that isn't committed to excellence and doesn't embrace change. But what company, quite honestly, doesn't say that.</p><p>And I'm thrilled to say, at First Horizon, we've proven it. We're built on the strength of a thriving nimble culture that has been locally and nationally recognized for workplace satisfaction and service excellence. But more importantly, our culture permeates everything we do. Our cultural values of accountability, adaptability, integrity and inclusive relationships are woven throughout every decision we make and help us efficiently facilitate change and drive innovation.</p><p>So why does a good culture matter? It matters in these statistics. It results in customer and employee loyalty. As you can see from these tenure statistics, our customers as well as our employees stick with us. Obviously, customer loyalty is critical in any business. But as we think about transforming our customer experience to deliver value and grow our business, it is essential. We get to begin the work of optimizing our customer experience on a foundation that's already incredibly solid. And we get to do this work with our frontline bankers who are highly experienced and familiar with the needs of their customers that they serve day in and day out.</p><p>And our final pillar, bonefish profitability insights. Building profitability starts with knowing where it exists. Back in 2013, we started this journey on a mission to identify and optimize the levers that drive customer profitability throughout the entire business. It was part of our overall bonefish strategy, and simply put, it was transformative. Today, bonefish permeates every part of our organizational DNA. But beyond the bottom line numbers is this more fundamental advantage. We have a deeper understanding of what we're good at, a deeper understanding of our key areas of profitability and a deeper understanding of where we could begin to connect these insights to an enhanced value-producing customer experience strategy.</p><p>So this is our focus as we execute this strategy. The customer experience transformation begins to take shape as we connect the original inside-out profitability approach with an outside-in view now of our customer.</p><p>So how are we going to do that? We'll start by strengthening our outside-in customer experience strategy. This process will focus on profitability, except this time, from an outside-in, customer-centric view. We want to analyze the moments where we are over or underinvesting in our customer experience. And how do these moments diminish our capacity to provide value in priority moments? And more importantly, how can we refocus our resources to enhance the value that we provide in priority customer moments? Based on a better understanding of our current customer profitability grid and a precise mapping of those opportunities available, we can lever our approach to efficiently target high-priority moments that drive value. Essentially, this is the evolution of our bonefish strategy.</p><p>So let me explain what I mean by this customer profitability grid. You can see it here on the screen. This is a representation of our customer profitability grid that I quickly worked with the team to make this happen in the first 4 weeks of being at First Horizon. And it was due to the great work that the finance team has done under the leadership of BJ to have this available for us and be able to activate it immediately.</p><p>When you look at this grid, you'll see that it's divided by profitability and tenure. And the reality in business is that we know that all customers are not created equal, and what I mean by that is that all customers are not equally profitable. As you'll see on this slide as I walk you through some insights on the simple 2-by-2 grid, there are some key drivers of profitability that we can hone in on now to drive growth. So as this grid illustrates, it's a high-level view of tenure and profitability. There's clear insights around product mix, channel usage, balances and Net Promoter Score that can help us responsibly grow our business while meeting our customers' needs.</p><p>And I want to take a minute just to highlight Net Promoter Score. Net Promoter Score, as many of you know, was developed over a decade ago by Bain &amp; Company, and it is all around what's called the ultimate question, how likely would you be to recommend First Tennessee/Capital Bank to your family and friends? Net Promoter Score has proven it's the only customer experience metric that predicts business growth. Customers in our upper right-hand corner of the grid represent our most valuable customers, whereas customers in the upper left-hand corner of the grid offer our greatest opportunity. We know already from our own customer data that we have on hand today that higher Net Promoter Scores in these upper quadrant, our most profitable customers, are correlated with increased profitability, longer tenure and more share of wallet. Through this transformation, we will develop a deeper understanding of the needs, preferences and expectations of our most profitable customers so that we can continue to increase customer value profitably.</p><p>We know that a simple 5% shift to improve customer profitability in the consumer customer base alone can deliver an additional $76 million in annualized revenue. And let me just repeat that: a simple 5% shift in increasing our customer profitability in our consumer base will deliver an additional $76 million in annualized revenue.</p><p>So let's take a deeper dive into this grid. The view of profitability is rich with insights, and I'll walk you through just a few of them today. Our high-profitability, low-tenure quadrant offers us some of our biggest growth opportunities. By simply reducing their attrition rate and improving that Net Promoter Score, we will increase our customer profitability.</p><p>On the next grid, you'll see these are our most valuable customers. Our high-profitability, high-tenure customers have some of our highest Net Promoter Scores. These are our most loyal customers and longest tenured. They are ripe for advocacy opportunities, and we know that word-of-mouth advertising is one of the strongest influences today in choosing where to bank. This is basically free advertising, and it greatly reduces our cost to acquire new-to-bank customers.</p><p>In this quadrant and the other quadrant, we will continue to create targeting opportunities to create look-alike models to go and find these customers in digital marketing capabilities by leveraging our current marketing technology stack. Again, another strong capability that we already have. The focus for our low-profitability, low-tenure customers will be to reduce our churn and our cost to acquire and cost to serve. We'll do this by continuing to optimize our spend associated with acquisition efforts as well as continue transaction migration strategies to self-service channels.</p><p>And finally, there are additional efficiencies to be found in our low-profitability, high-tenure quadrant by reducing the cost to serve and reallocating the current resources that are here today aligned to sustaining their Net Promoter Score. Today, we know that this quadrant of customers are heavy users of multiple channels. So again, this is another transaction migration strategy to increase self-service channel usage. Additionally, we will right size our efforts to delight these customers appropriately. And we will redeploy these efforts and resources up to the quadrant with our highest growth opportunity.</p><p>So this is where the journey begins. This is how we'll be more relevant to our most profitable customers in the consumer and commercial bank. So how do we make the type of connections that powerfully fuse what we know about our high-priority customers and the high-priority moments that drive value? We'll do this by accumulating a better understanding of our customer pain and satisfaction points; by identifying misalignments between the value of our highest-priority customers and their current customer experience today; we're going to recognize moments of high cost and high friction within our customer experience; and finally, this is going to be an incredible opportunity for us to uncover opportunities for innovation.</p><p>So let me take a minute, I know it's after lunch, to explain this very powerful and perhaps a little confusing slide to you. This slide illustrates how we're going to align customer priority with customer preference. The initiative focuses first on our highest-priority customers by connecting insights about customer profitability to what our customers value most. And again, that's our most profitable customers. Our customer data to date shows us who those most valuable customers are, and our customer research will show us what's most important to them. Connecting these 2 together through journey mapping will help us grow customer lifetime value by identifying priority moments in which to concentrate those resources and also focusing on moments where we are over or underinvesting resources today.</p><p>You'll see down at the bottom the buy/own/advocate journey highlights key moments throughout the experience. Some of these key moments are being underinvested in today, you'll see them on this slide highlighted in green. And then others are overinvested in, which are noted in red. And as we create the map and optimize this journey, we're able to move, outlier moments, which are those over or underinvested moments, into the control path, which will deliver greater customer lifetime value for us. We'll do that by identifying these moments that are either accretive, that are either adding to customer lifetime value or moments that we know are diminishing customer lifetime value. These are the moments that are disproportionately creating or destroying customer satisfaction, loyalty and advocacy and disproportionately creating or destroying business value today.</p><p>So what are the results of this transformational journey? And where does this transformational journey take us? We believe that this journey ensures our ability to double the economic profit of the regional bank. And the business case for this strategy is clear. You can see the metrics up on the slide. This works. When we take this transformational approach to our customer experience, we will increase our most profitable customer satisfaction, their loyalty and, most importantly, their advocacy, while at the same time driving profitable growth, optimizing expenses and increasing customer lifetime value. Transforming our customer experience from the outside in is truly a win-win. It's a win for our -- the customer and a win for the bank.</p><p>Thank you very much. I'd like to now introduce our Chief Financial Officer, BJ Losch, to the stage.</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: All right, the homestretch. I have been at First Horizon since January of 2009, almost 10 years now. And I have never seen our company stronger than it is right now. So does that mean that we're at our peak? Well, I hope, as you've heard today, you agree with me, absolutely not. We are just getting started.</p><p>Proven success, focused strategies, better opportunities and, I'll add, lower risk is what you've heard today. Now let's put it all together, starting on Slide 3. So why invest in First Horizon going forward? First, we have delivered results, as you've seen today, from exceeding our bonefish targets and doing what we say we will do. And we can do it again. Second, we have a strong return profile with high returns on equity and a strong capital position. Third, we have multiple growth opportunities, as you've heard throughout today, in Tennessee, in our newer markets in the Carolinas and Florida and in our specialty businesses. Fourth, we have capital to deploy. Our capital foundation today is sound, and we're generating significant earnings momentum, which will give us both the strength and flexibility to organically fund the growth that we expect as well as opportunistically buy back shares and return capital to shareholders. Finally, we have a lower risk model. Our credit profile and the complementary earnings streams that our core businesses afford us give us the opportunity to perform well in any operating environment.</p><p>Proven results matter. And let's take a look at some of the ones that we've had on Slide 4. Bryan said it, I've said it, we have done what we said we would do over the last 5 years. Starting with the primary objective of our bonefish strategy, return on tangible common equity. You can see on the upper left-hand side of this page that we have exceeded our historical long-term bonefish target of 15-plus percent, going from 7% 5 years ago to over 17% today. As you can see on the lower left, our return on assets, a very important profitability metric, as you well know, has doubled during that time period to over 1.2% today. And very importantly, we have done it by delivering strong EPS growth, as you can see on the right-hand part of this slide. We grew EPS over the last 5 years at a 14% compound annual growth rate from 2013 to 2017 on an adjusted basis. And then we accelerated that growth in 2018 with the benefit of tax reform as well as the incremental addition of Capital Bank.</p><p>Turning to Slide 5. As you've heard from Bryan and others throughout the day, we have done this the right way, first by profitably growing our balance sheet. Over the last 5 years, the organic loan and deposit growth that we've seen as a company, excluding the positive impact of the Capital Bank addition, has averaged 6% and 9%, respectively. The core regional bank loan portfolio, excluding the $3 billion of nonstrategic runoff that we've seen over this time period, has actually grown organically by 11% a year, 11% a year.</p><p>Second, we generated significant positive operating leverage. As a matter of fact, over this time period, over 4x positive operating leverage, 12% revenue growth on only 3% expense growth on an adjusted basis. And as you can see, we improved our efficiency ratio materially, growing from 75% 5 years ago to 64% today. Our efficiency ratio improvements were not driven by large onetime savings or other items but by daily application of our bonefish concepts of continually taking out cost that does not give us a chance to generate revenue.</p><p>As Bryan talked about at the beginning, 2018 was a very important year for us. And as shown on Slide 6, we have been focused on getting the Capital Bank merger done successfully and strengthening the balance sheet. We manage this company for long-term sustainable performance, and getting success drivers right like this in the short term has been important to our long-term momentum. Job #1 in 2018 was getting the Capital Bank merger done and integrated successfully, which meant not just systems integration but assimilating and training new Capital Bank teammates into our organization, delivering on merger expense efficiencies and starting to drive revenue opportunities from the combined business. As Bryan talked about and alluded to earlier, we also took steps to strengthen the balance sheet to position us for long-term improved profitability and growth going forward.</p><p>And as we turn to Slide 7, you see that our goals of combining our 2 companies well and maintaining positive earnings momentum were accomplished. Our strategic objectives for the Capital Bank combination were clear: first, accelerate our ability to achieve our bonefish targets; and second, provide us an expanded platform for growth. And we're very excited that they have achieved both of those objectives.</p><p>Financially speaking, we've delivered excellent earnings performance since the first quarter of 2017, which was the last quarter before the Capital Bank announcement. As you can see on the upper left, adjusted EPS is up 58%, 58%, over the last 7 quarters. In the top middle part of the slide, you'll see ROTCE is up over 700 basis points on an adjusted basis over that time period. And the 40 basis point ROA improvement that you see on the top right has been driven by the 2 things that you'll see in the bottom 2 charts: strong expansion of the net interest margin, up 36 basis points on a core basis and 52 basis points on a total basis; and an 850 basis point efficiency ratio improvement from, number one, continued overall expense discipline, like I talked about, but also the incremental cost saves that we've gotten from the Capital Bank merger. And we're not done.</p><p>While I'm incredibly pleased with this performance, we have so much more opportunity ahead. As you can see on Slide 8, we are exceeding the merger cost and revenue efficiency goals that we outlined for you, and we have more to come. You'll remember that we initially announced the $65 million cost save, we subsequently raised it to $85 million, and we will hit that target. And you'll see all of it in the 2019 run rate. As you see on the upper part of this slide, with over $30 million of incremental year-on-year expense reduction benefit to be captured from '18 to '19, we are well positioned for a net reduction in our expense base in 2019.</p><p>Looking at revenue synergies on the bottom part of the slide. Bryan talked about we had an incremental revenue goal of $25 million to $30 million over 2 to 3 years. We have captured that in less than a year, and we're nowhere near finished. We have only scratched the surface on 2 really big opportunities, and you heard about them today: number one, improving our treasury management and commercial deposit-gathering capabilities, particularly in the Carolinas, Florida and the specialty businesses; and second, optimizing our deposit base towards core relationships and away from the $4.5 billion of market-indexed deposits that we have as a firm.</p><p>Turning to Slide 9. As I said earlier regarding our 2018 areas of focus, sometimes we make decisions that are in the best long-term interests of this company that may have an impact on the short term. Over the next 2 slides, I'll give you an example of how that philosophy has played out this year and why those types of decisions make us a stronger company.</p><p>The first of those decisions was to optimize our overall loan portfolio in 2018 by intentionally running down roughly $350 million or so of low-spread, low- or no-relationship assets in addition to selling noncore subprime portfolios. While these actions, combined with the general industry slowdown in loan growth, had a dampening effect on our loan growth results, they were the correct ones and position us and our balance sheet well for the future. Though there will always be optimization opportunities in our portfolios, these were a bit more outsized than usual, and you should not expect nearly as much growth impact from optimization impacts going forward. As you've heard throughout today, our pipelines are solid, and our loan growth plans are strong.</p><p>On Slide 10, you've heard me use this term before. You can see that our long-term focus on managing what I call the totality of the margin to improve our profitability has worked. What I mean by managing the totality of the margin is that it's not just about loan betas. It's not just about deposit betas. It's not just about how much loan growth you had or deposit growth you had. It's all of it. It's everything working in tandem and constantly pulling the levers that are available to you quarter in, quarter out, year in, year out to improve our profitability. We do that in 3 ways: improving our balance sheet mix, managing our pricing and growing the balance sheet profitably. Over time, this focus on managing the totality of the margin results in strong performance.</p><p>As you can see on the upper right of this slide, our net interest margin performance since the beginning of the rate cycle has outperformed most peers. How do we do it? We capture the asset sensitivity that was inherent in our loan book. We continue the shift of our lending mix towards more profitable activities, like our specialty lending businesses, we managed over the cycle our core deposit betas appropriately, and we grew our balance sheet profitably, all resulting in higher margin expansion.</p><p>Going forward, we will continue to manage the totality of the margin. We will continue to shift more of our loan growth to specialty lending. We will balance our ability to retain and grow deposits the way we would like with the level of price competition that we know we're going to see.</p><p>Speaking of deposits. The second decision we made this year was to make proactive moves, particularly in our consumer relationship deposit rates in the second quarter, to protect and grow that base. We obviously knew that deposit betas would look high for a quarter or 2. We also knew that our cumulative deposit betas for both our core consumer and our core commercial deposit bases remain competitive through the cycle at 18% and 24%, respectively. So taking the long view on deposit pricing has positioned us well to retain the deposit base that we find so valuable and grow deposits going forward. And as you heard today, we expect to remain very disciplined on further rate increases.</p><p>Sticking with deposits for a moment. I mentioned it earlier: we have a great opportunity over time that really nobody else in the industry has as it relates to deposits. We can optimize our deposit mix by replacing a roughly $4.5 billion, 100% beta, market-indexed deposit book with relationship core deposits at much lower betas. When we do this, it can provide a tailwind to the margin and further strengthen our deposit base. We have strong conviction that managing the totality of the margin quarter in, quarter out, year in, year out, will allow us to strengthen the profitability of our balance sheet and allow us to have one that we'll be proud of.</p><p>So let's shift and talk a little bit about our earnings growth opportunities on Slide 11. We are focused on the best opportunities in the pursuit of sustainably strong earnings power and returns. These opportunities are profitable growth, improving efficiency and managing our capital smartly.</p><p>You've heard over the course of today strong conviction from our leaders on our plans for balance sheet growth. Now let's take a look and review what those plans are again on Slide 12. Here are our key loan and deposit growth expectations over the next 5 years. On the lending side, we see a continued emphasis on outsized growth from our higher-return, higher-profitability specialty businesses where we would expect over 5 years as much as a 50% increase or more in those aggregate portfolios. That would continue our intentional shift we have driven in our overall loan portfolio mix towards those attractive commercial lending businesses. We can see continued profitable loan growth across Tennessee, particularly in this market right here in the Nashville market. And as you've heard throughout the day, our multiple loan growth opportunities in our newer markets in the Carolinas and Florida, particularly on the commercial side, are expected to deliver outsized growth as well.</p><p>On the deposit side, 60% of our existing deposit mix is in our consumer bank. And as you've heard from Tammy, our primary focus in that business is growth in core deposit relationships. It is the key to our continued success. Over the past 5 years, we have grown our #1 Tennessee market share and our deposit franchise by 45%. Starting from #1 market share, we grew at 45%, almost 50% faster than the Tennessee market as a whole. We will continue to press that advantage we have in Tennessee. In our newer markets, our aspirations are to organically double the size of our total deposit base in targeted high-potential markets within the Carolinas and Florida, places like Raleigh, places like Naples, places like Fort Myers, places like Charleston, that ones that you heard Tammy and others talk about.</p><p>On the commercial side, we have only scratched the surface on our commercial deposit-gathering and treasury services opportunities in the Carolinas and Florida, as Todd alluded to. And in our specialty businesses, as we talked about as well, we have well-defined plans that we believe will double the size of that deposit base over the next 5 years.</p><p>Turning to Slide 13. We continue to be focused on enhancing our operating leverage. If you start on the left side of this page, you can see obviously that we are a materially larger company today than we were in 2009. We were $26 billion back then, we are $41 billion today, yet we have $400 million less in expenses than we did back then. And over this time period, our pre-provision net revenue in the heart of the franchise, our regional bank, is up over $600 million. Let me say that again: the regional bank over this time period, pre-provision net revenue is up $600 million.</p><p>We know how to reduce expenses. Well, how did we do it? Well, at the beginning, we managed through adversity and crisis area exposures. Then we streamlined the organization. And from 2009 to 2013, we took out over 20% of the total expense base, the core expense base. We simplified and we made numerous process improvements in our back-office operations. We optimized our branch network and our office space. We consolidated our technology and our vendor relationships. And we did thousands and thousands of other little things across our organization, delivered by people operating in a culture of expense discipline.</p><p>But we didn't just reduce expenses. We also invested in areas critical to revenue generation in our long-term success. We made, over this time period, hundreds of strategic hires, from key business executives like Tammy and like Carol and like Todd to experienced relationship managers across our footprint that have brought us profitable business and relationships to grow.</p><p>We have also made significant technology improvements and investments as well. Our core systems today are current, they're scalable, and they're wrapped with state-of-the-art technologies. We have upgraded all of our key applications as well during the merger integration process. And over this time, we have consistently increased the percentage of our total expense spend as an organization on technology. In 2009, we only spent about 8% of our total company expense on technology. Today, we spent 14% of our total spend on technology. And of that 14%, 45% of it is spent on customer-enabling technology. We are trying to be very smart about how we use the resources that we have as a $40 billion bank to have the most impact on customer revenue generation and customer relationships. By reducing expenses in non-revenue-generating areas and investing in revenue generation activities, we have been able to sustainably invest and improve profitability.</p><p>So what's the bottom line? From 2013 to 2017, adjusting for notable items, revenues grew by 12% while expenses grew by only 3% a year, less than 1% -- 3% total over those 4 years, less than 1% a year. This demonstrates that this company and this leadership team knows how to drive positive operating leverage. And the improvement in our efficiency ratio will be evident, with a long-term operating target of less than 59%, another 500 basis points or more of improvement from today's 64% level.</p><p>Let's shift and take a look at capital strength and deployment opportunities on Slide 14. We pursue soundness, profitability and growth, in that order. And our capital ratios and where we operate them are a reflection of that philosophy. Our stress test, which we use extensively, as Bryan talked about, as a management tool, demonstrate our balance sheet's strength. And with the primary capital ratio that we manage to CET1 at just under 10% today, we start from a position of strength. This, combined with the earnings power, is a powerful combination of capital strength and flexibility.</p><p>So let me walk you through an illustrative example. In the middle of this side (sic) [slide], you'll see an illustration of how much excess capital we currently have and how much excess capital generation we have. If you start in the top middle, you'll see that our 3Q year-to-date annualized net income adjusted for notable items is about $465 million. Out of that, you then assume a 35% dividend payout, which would imply about $160 million of dividends paid from that net income. Then assume, let's say, a 5% asset growth on that, which would consume about $150 million of capital to support the increase in the balance sheet. You're left with about $170 million of current excess capital generation, which you see on the upper right. This is in addition to the over $300 (sic) [$293] million or so of excess capital above our long-term operating target of 8% to 9% CET1, as you see on the lower right.</p><p>So the combination of the earnings power that we're generating, combined with the existing capital levels, give us powerful flexibility to opportunistically buy back shares at these valuation levels. And to date, this quarter, we have bought back over $30 million. So we're finding very good opportunities to put this capital to work.</p><p>You can see on the left that our current capital priorities are clear: number one, invest in the multiple growth opportunities that you've heard about today; second, pay 35% in dividends out of our earnings streams; third, opportunistically buy back shares when it's appropriate and advantageous to do so; and fourth, take a long-term view on M&amp;A when it makes strategic and financial sense. These are our capital priorities, in order, today, and we expect that over time, we'll be able to pursue all of them profitably and for the benefit of our shareholders.</p><p>Slide 15 has one of my favorite quotes, \"Adversity does not build character, it exposes it.\" And by that, I mean, when times are good, everybody can always look good, but your true colors emerge when times get more difficult. Today, the operating environment is generally favorable, and I think all of us expect that or hope that to continue for quite some time. But we believe what fundamentally makes First Horizon better is our business model's ability to thrive and perform well in any operating environment. Our focus on soundness, profitability and growth, in that order, ensures that we maintain a strong risk profile and continually look for ways to strengthen the resiliency of our earnings power. That's why we make sound decisions with the long term in mind regardless of short-term pressures.</p><p>So what gives us confidence that we'll be a business that can perform well in any operating environment? First, on Slide 16, you've seen and you've heard today, we believe that we have a lower credit-risk model. And it shows up in superior results on stressed loss rates versus the composite of all 35 DFAST peers. In fact, our severely stressed credit loss rates are less than half the weighted average of all of those peers. Why? Again, focus on soundness, profitability and growth, in that order, and the use of our economic profit and economic capital concepts that permeate the organization.</p><p>What else? We like commercial real estate, but we like it in the right sectors, we like it in the right geographies, we like it in the right types, and we like it in moderation. We have minimal exposure to higher-risk consumer portfolios, things like auto, things like student lending and things like subprime lending. As evidence of that long-term view, you know that we just sold a higher-yield subprime loan portfolio that we inherited from the Capital Bank merger, not because it was underperforming. As a matter of fact, it was highly performing with high yields and very low charge-offs, but it didn't fit our long-term credit risk profile.</p><p>Across our commercial portfolios, we use disciplined risk-adjusted pricing and economic profit, credit underwriting to ensure we're building a strong balance sheet. And we are proud that over 40% of our entire commercial loan portfolio is considered investment-grade equivalent. That is strength. All these characteristics, we believe, add up to a lower, stronger credit risk profile.</p><p>Second, on Slide 17. And in addition to that strong credit risk profile, the complementary nature of our core businesses, our regional banking business and our fixed income business afford us the countercyclicality of earnings that -- and offsets that no other regional bank can match. You can see from the chart on the top a view of pretax income trends in our regional banking and fixed-income businesses through multiple stressed, muted and growing economies over the past 18 years. In each period, you can see the complementary nature of our core businesses at work.</p><p>In a growing economy like the one that we're in today and have been for several years, on the right-hand part of this chart, our banking business will be very strong, and you'll see fixed income pretax income moderate. In a more muted economy, like the one we saw for several years, roughly 2010 to 2016, on the right-hand side of the page, you'll see both steady performance from banking and fixed income. But in a stressed economy, like the ones we saw on the left-hand side of this chart in the early 2000s or during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 in the middle of the chart, you will see fixed income strength offsetting lower banking earnings.</p><p>So wrapping these 2 points together on Slide 18. What happens when you have a lower-risk credit model and combine it with complementary earnings streams? Lower credit losses in times of stress, healthy pre-provision net revenue earnings power and far better stress test results that capital -- that demonstrate capital strength that we believe is far more resilient than others in the industry.</p><p>You've heard the theme of evolution repeated multiple ways throughout the course of the day: evolving our go-to-market business models for different types of markets and opportunities; evolving our specialty businesses to capture not just loan growth opportunities but deposit growth as well; evolving and even transforming our customer experience based on deeper, more holistic customer insights; evolving and optimizing our expense base to reduce cost in order to fund needed investment in people, marketing and technology.</p><p>But on Slide 20, you see the visual representation of our bonefish strategy. And as you might know, we introduced this back in 2009, and it has served us very well over that time period, both internally and externally. Internally, as you heard today, it's called multiple things. It's a noun, it's a verb, it's everything. It's become part of our cultural DNA in how we do business. And externally, it's been a definition of our success.</p><p>On Slide 21, you'll see that our bonefish design has evolved as well, a little bit more modern, a little bit more fishy. While the look is different, the key drivers, which are -- should be important to you, are exactly the same as they have been in the past. Exactly the same. You also might notice on here that there aren't specific metrics in the bonefish. That's because we are currently meeting or exceeding all of our long-term historical bonefish targets. And you'll see that we expect that to continue in 2019. What we are focused on now is constantly getting better on driving consistently strong returns on equity and assets, on maintaining a strong capital base, on strengthening our net interest margin and keeping our net charge-offs as moderate as possible</p><p>And finally, on expense discipline, as measured by improvement in the efficiency ratio.</p><p>Day in, day out, year in and year out, the tactics may change, the levers that we have a chance to pull, or as Bryan said, control what we can control, they may change, but the overall goals of driving sustainable long-term returns and profitability will be the same.</p><p>As you've heard throughout the day, our business plans are aligned around our strategic priorities, and these are going to be the levers of earnings growth: dominate Tennessee by pressing our advantage even further, particularly in the deposit space; profitably growing our key markets and our specialty businesses; transforming the customer experience to improve both customer engagement and our profitability; and fourth, optimizing our expense base to afford us the ability to remain competitive and compete while improving our efficiency ratio. I am convinced that we have the operating capabilities and the talent to deliver.</p><p>Now let's take a look at what that looks like for 2019 on Slide 23. Our current 2019 outlook reflects our expectation of continued strong returns and profitability. We expect continued EPS improvement from profitable balance sheet growth, positive operating leverage and capital deployment, the key things that I've talked about over the last few minutes. And starting with the key assumptions on the bottom of this chart, there are 3 there that are very important to driving balance sheet growth and operating leverage.</p><p>The first is healthy balance sheet growth, which we would expect sitting here today in the 3% to 6% range. We're currently assuming 2 rate increases, one late this year and one in the middle of next year. And third, the full realization of our merger cost saves.</p><p>If you look in the upper -- in the NIM column, in the upper part of this slide, you'll see that the combination of the balance sheet growth and the fed funds rate increase expectations, along with overall disciplined pricing, we believe we can maintain overall NIM stability going into next year, even with expected declines in benefits from purchase accounting accretion from the capital bank portfolio and assumed continued deposit price competition.</p><p>We expect that with the incremental merger cost save benefits, coupled with disciplined expense management, as I said earlier, we expect to see full year expenses down from 2018 to 2019. A key assumption in that expense outlook is FDN average daily revenues, which sitting here today, we currently expect to be relatively flat to 2018 levels. If ADRs are higher in the fixed-income business, we are going to see higher expenses and our expenses may grow, but they will be more than offset by revenue in that business.</p><p>As you can see in the efficiency ratio column in the top part of the slide, the resulting positive operating leverage that we expect to generate in 2019 leads to an expectation of another 200 to 400 basis points of efficiency ratio improvement from 3Q '18 levels by the end of 2019. You will note that in the net charge-offs column, we expect the environment to remain very benign with low levels of charge-offs and provision. And finally, the last assumption on our total payout ratio at the bottom of the slide reflects our ability to pay a strong dividend in the 35% range and buyback a meaningful amount of shares given current valuations, while maintaining a strong CET1 ratio in the 9.5% to 10% range, as you can see in the upper right column.</p><p>The financial metrics of our bonefish strategy continue to guide the management of our business through any environment. With that mind, the long-term objectives for our company are these: deliver top quartile returns, maintain strong credit quality and capital, grow the balance sheet profitably and demonstrate enhanced operating leverage.</p><p>Our proven results, strong 2019 outlook and focus on our long-term objectives leads us to what's on Slide 28. We fundamentally believe that we are a unique franchise from our #1 market share position in Tennessee to our higher growth, higher return specialty businesses, to our attractive market opportunities across the Southeast, to the complementary nature of our core businesses, to the lower risk profile that we maintain. We are a company with sustainable, strong returns on tangible common equity with a strong 2019 earnings outlook and attractive dividend and payout with both capital strength and flexibility.</p><p>We are a company that warrants an attractive valuation. As I said at the beginning, our company has not been stronger in the last 10 years than it is right now. And I hope you heard today and believe as we do that our future is even brighter. And I couldn't be more excited about where we're headed.</p><p>As we wrap up on Slide 27, on behalf of my colleagues, I'd like to thank you for joining us both in person here today and online. We appreciate your investment in and your interest in First Horizon. We've hope you gained a better perspective on our businesses, our talented leaders and our opportunities. I'd also like to thank the leaders that presented here today, our talented teammates that helped us put this Investor Day together, our dedicated employees that are out serving our customers so well every day, and especially our customers and our communities that we have the pleasure to serve. Proven success, focused strategy, better opportunities, this is First Horizon.</p><p>With that, I will pause and ask Bryan to come up and join me, and we'll be happy to take some questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: First question comes from Gene Taylor.</p><p>GEOFFREY ELLIOTT, PARTNER, REGIONAL AND TRUST BANKS, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: I guess, I was kind of surprised that the bonefish was empty of numbers. So how much debate was there around that? How much discussion on should you put some numbers into the bonefish or not? And then assuming you're not going to suddenly change your mind on that and give us new numbers now, can you talk about which of the levers you think are most important? I guess, it kind of feels like it's probably the efficiency ratio from here, given you've given that long-term sub-59 efficiency target. But if you can give us thoughts on what's going to continue to drive results from here.</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: Yes. So I'll take the first one, Geoffrey. So we've had a lot of discussion once we exceeded our bonefish targets about should we change them, should we not change them. And the reality is that they were excellent targets for a long period of time for us as an aspirational goal. And when we hit them, we saw that we don't want to just stop. We want to continue to improve and continue to improve. The problem with that, though, is that it's hard now to see the future, particularly around credit, right? That'll probably be the biggest toggle in terms of not just us, but the industry in general knowing we're not-- whether or not they're going to be able to improve returns. So for us, over the next couple of years, in 2019, we see 17% to 18% ROTCEs. If the credit environment remains benign, we see the growth that we expect to drive. We expect -- and we improve the operating leverage like we expect. That will likely go higher over the next couple of years. But without being able to know what the credit environment is going to be 2, 3, 4 years down the line, we just thought, frankly, it was more prudent to say, you know what, day in, day out, year in, year out, we are going to build a business model that can generate top quartile returns, wherever those top quartile returns are. And we'll give you a view of what the next year looks like, which we did, and we'll do that going forward.</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: To add to BJ's comment, I think, just the framework of the top quartile returns, year in, year out, is an aspiration, is very aspirational. And we are very focused on the dynamics of the business and particularly, the attractive returns that we produce and being very efficient in capital. And the second part of your question is, what is the key lever, if anything? Operational efficiency is a big part of it. We think that -- and you've heard us describe today a number of places that we're going to be investing. You heard talking about hiring people in our markets South Florida, Jeff Jackson mentioned, it could be 25 to 30 people over the next 4 or 5 years. We're going to make investments in technology. But we've got to pay for those so we've got to drive efficiency in other parts of the business. But ultimately, all of that is geared towards deploying capital in a thoughtful way and producing superior returns on that, which top quartile would ultimately be. And while it's hard to mention what the cycles look like and if we raise the bonefish targets from north of 15 to 17 to 20, and where do you end with that? And so we just wanted to set something that worked for any environment, which is producing top quartile returns. John?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes, just a question regarding the presentations. So noticed no presentation today on FTN Financial. How should we think about that? Is -- I mean, could you talk about your commitment to the business? And maybe a little bit around the -- if you're still committed to it, what's the longer-term outlook in terms of the contribution from the business, the longer term ADR level that you think?</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: Yes, I'll start. Mike Kisber, who runs the businesses, is hiding out in the corner over here. That is a business we're committed to. We've been in the fixed-income business for darn near a century, 75 to 80 years. We know it well. We know it through various cycles. And you know when interest rates are bottoming out, that is going to be a difficult environment. And as BJ said, we expect average daily revenues to be very low. I think it's a telling picture that it is a countercyclical balance to our business that when the economy, invariably, and it will, I don't expect it next year, maybe the year after that, but at some point, the economy will turn down. And FTN Financial will be a very countercyclical balance to that. So when our credit cost goes up like everybody else's, probably at a slower rate, but when it goes up, we will have an offset to that, and it gives us the ability to continue to lean in. All of that said, if you look at the business even with these very low levels, we do make money in the business. And while it is sort of just around cost of capital returns today because it does not draw a tremendous amount of capital, we don't run it with very much risk in the business. It is essentially a go home flat every night business. We don't run trading portfolios. It is a matching up buyers and sellers business. We can make small amounts of money in it and still be comfortable with -- the return profile we have in the short term knowing that over the long term, it is a very complementary piece of our business.</p><p>BRADY MATTHEW GAILEY, MD, KEEFE, BRUYETTE, &amp; WOODS, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: I had a question about loan growth. We heard from a lot of other people this morning talking about Nashville, the Carolinas. And you're hiring 30 to 40 people in Florida. The specialty lending group, looks like the outlook is pretty good there. But you look at loan growth next year at 3% to 6%. It just seems like a little bit of a disconnect.</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: So I'll start. So a couple of different factors that we're -- right. So 3% to 6% is total company. We still have nonstrategic portfolio rundown, so that's a little bit of a dampening effect. The second is, and you've heard this mentioned across the day, profitable growth. If we don't see opportunities for profitable growth, then we're not going to pursue them. We don't go out and just make loan-only syndications to make loan-only syndications and grow the balance sheet. We are looking for profitable relationships in our businesses. So if you look at that, and to mention that 3% to 6%, I think our specialty businesses are going to be at the high end or higher of that. I think our commercial businesses are going to be maybe in the middle range to that. Our consumer businesses are going to be on the low end of that. But in general, I think that's where we think the opportunity is going to be given what the H8 data is telling us about growth and where we see the opportunities. Going forward, though, we're thinking that, that accelerates over time if loan demand starts to come back, if we're getting outsized traction as we're hiring bankers in the Carolinas or in Florida, as we're seeing better opportunities or continued opportunities in specialty. But for 2019, we think that that's just the most appropriate expectation.</p><p>BRADY MATTHEW GAILEY: All right. And then I had a second question. So a lot of talk about economic profits doubling over the next 5 years. I think you quantified it 130 to 160. But I thought I saw on a slide, 2017 was 155. So just kind of explain that. And then you're not talking about EPS doubling. This is something separate, right?</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: That's right. That'd be noteworthy, wouldn't it? So doubling EPS over 5 years. So think about it this way, okay? We -- and there's a slide, Slide 5 in your reference materials. So we had these decks, that were posted, there were reference materials posted as well. Slide 5 on that kind of breaks down how the regional bank doubles economic profit and it shows loan growth and it shows balance sheet growth and it shows economic capital usage. What happened over those 4 years is that net income in those businesses actually grew a little bit over 50%, but economic capital usage in that business was roughly flat and we doubled economic profit. So what happened was the regional bank grew the net income by managing the allocated capital that we gave to them, reducing the credit loss in there, building a higher return balance sheet, growing deposits, which don't carry economic capital hardly at all. All of those things drove that. The job of our businesses in the regional bank are to manage the allocated capital that we give them. Bryan's job and my job is to then take the excess capital and optimize our total capital for the benefit of our shareholders, like more than doubling the dividend payout over the last 5 years, like buying back 10% of the company over the last 5 years. And if you look, actually, from 2013 to 2017, excluding the capital bank deal, EPS was up 66% during that timeframe. So the bank manages, with taking control. And we optimize the capital such that from your perspective, we're trying to grow EPS and build a sustainable top quartile return business.</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: Brady, the piggyback -- oh, I'm sorry, Ken, one more point, to piggyback on the intersection of your 2 questions. The loan growth is not the only proxy for growth and profitability. And I don't know that it made the final cut of the reference material. But you saw it a little bit in the slides that we had there today. We've shown in the past the chart, basically, a waterfall chart of all the products that are profitable dipping down and those that are unprofitable. There is growth and profitability opportunity in the existing business, the relationships that we have. And you heard that sort of woven throughout the conversation today. So when you think about how we use these tools and you hear BJ talk about improving the capital efficiency and the banking business, it comes from better pricing on existing relationships. It comes from having less risky relationships so you'll use less capital at better spreads, and it ultimately comes from making relationships, products -- those waterfalls apply to products, they apply to RMs, they apply to geographies. And while you can look at those as a glass half full or a glass half empty. I see them as a glass half full. I see a lot of interesting opportunity for us to improve our profitability with the existing book of business that we have. And so our growth and profitability is not only to mention about how fast we grow the balance sheet, it's how fast we're able to leverage the profitability that is in that balance sheet. And as BJ said, when it comes to loan growth, we're going to make every good loan we have an opportunity to make. But we're not going to put our balance sheet at risk for the long term by trying to hit artificial targets about some percentage or another. We're focused on what we think is the right thing for the long term, what we can do in a reasonable fashion and in a profitable fashion. And as we look at the next year or so, that range that BJ laid out, 3% to 6% seems like a reasonable place to start. Ken?</p><p>KENNETH ALLEN ZERBE: Alright. I guess, first question is just in terms of capital return. I understand you wanted to deploy it prudently, totally makes sense. But you have $290 million of excess capital. You are generating $170 million of annual capital. What's holding you back from getting a little more aggressive with the capital return?</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: You want to start?</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: Go ahead.</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: All right. We -- a quarter ago, our CET1 was right at 9%, and we got a lot of feedback. And one thing that's holding our price back is our price intangible book, it is often that our capital ratios are low. FTN does have some impact on our tangible common equity ratios to tangible assets. Basically, while it doesn't have much risk, it uses $2.5 billion, $3 billion worth of balance sheet. And so we looked at that and said the reasonable answer for that is you just go out and raise some more capital, which makes no sense at all. But when we let the Visa stock drop into the income statement, which was hidden capital that we've been talking about for years, it brought those ratios up. It's not to say that we won't bring them down, but if that's a scream that people are running and not being, I'd say, critical or thoughtful about how the risk in a balance sheet stacks up, vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis, peers, you can't get too far outside that range. So that's a big part of it. But I'd say BJ's, his chart that he had up here, 9.5% to 10% is a safe range. That's above our long-term range. We feel comfortable there. In his pro forma, you're going to distribute the $170 million or so in capital next year. BJ didn't say, at least I didn't hear him say, early this quarter, we bought back about $30 million of stock as the stock went on sale in our view over the last several weeks. So we're going to be opportunistic. We're not just going to plow ahead pushing capital out the door. But we're going to be thoughtful and we're going to manage it, vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis, the market as a whole. I don't know if you want to add to anything.</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: Yes, I'll just reiterate. $30 million bought back in 1.5 months is pretty good, pretty good starting points. So...</p><p>KENNETH ALLEN ZERBE: All right. Then just one follow-up. Just -- I heard you right, I think you said you had $4.5 billion at the market index deposits and you want to try to replace those. Obviously, that's -- it's a fairly large number. What's the timing of when you could potentially replace those?</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: Yes. Fast as our leaders can bring it. I'm glad you brought that up, Ken, because a lot of the questions, rightly so, that our business leaders got from you all today was, well, in these newer markets, where you're kind of more of an upstart, don't you have to be aggressive on pricing? And don't you have to pay up for it and so on and so forth? And the likelihood is in some cases, yes, that'll be a lever that we pull. But remember, we are paying 100% beta, fed effective plus 5 or 10 today on $4.5 billion of deposits. For every $1 that Tammy or Jeff or Carol or Todd bring in, that's less than that, that's a relationship that's also going to have some checking balances to it in addition to savings or CDs. We are materially improving the margin as we're paying those together dollar for dollar. So when I said over the next 5 years, I would like to see double the deposit base in certain high potential markets that we have, that's a couple of billion dollars. If we can double the deposit base that we have in our specialty businesses that, in aggregate, is $4-ish billion, and that could replace our market index. So that's how I think about it.</p><p>KENNETH ALLEN ZERBE: And there's no prepays or anything on those? Like you bring in a dollar of core deposit, you can just payoff $1 of the market index. Is that right?</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: Yes, good question. The way the market index deposits for us work is there are multiple contracts over a certain period of time. So what we do to optimize that is where we see our balance sheet growing, we'll just let the contracts go. And it's as easy as that and we can have ebb and flow there, the base.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So you've highlighted the revenue growing 12%, expenses growing 3% over the past 5 years. Would you expect that, that relationship will continue? Or what are the risks that expenses will -- I guess, revenue will grow slower compared to this past 4x operating leverage with all of the initiatives you're doing. And then, secondly, you've highlighted a few areas where you think you can get $42 million of pretax income closing the gap with the relationship managers and CBS. And then there's $75 million of annualized revenue marketing. So are these commitments you're making? Or are these just opportunities that if they happen, it would be great, but not necessarily a core focus? And then if they are going to happen, what does the timeline look like for that?</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: Okay. Let me start. Okay Starting on the first one, the 12% revenue growth and the 3%, so about 4x leverage, that's a lofty goal. I would expect that we would at least target 2x operating leverage or more over the next few years, and that's what we're thinking about for 2019 for sure. So that's -- part of that is knowing where our revenue opportunities are. So as we talked about earlier, 3% to 6% balance sheet growth next year, we think is pretty strong and healthy given the environment that we're going to be operating in. And so we're going to calibrate our expenses accordingly and try to drive positive operating leverage there. The things that you heard throughout the day, the $42 million or the improving customer profitability, those are absolutely part of our plans to continue to grow the profitability of the bank, double the economic profit in the business over the next 5 years and obviously, grow corporately the earnings per share that we see. They're not, specifically, in any of the things that we have disclosed to you today. But the things that we disclose to our board, the things that we talk about at our management meetings, all of those things feed into how are we going to continue to enhance our operating leverage, improve the efficiency ratio better than 59% and continue to improve the earnings per share that we think we need to deliver. Ryan?</p><p>RYAN MATTHEW NASH, MD, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Bryan, BJ had laid out the capital priorities of the bank. It sounds like there's a lot of organic growth opportunities. I think you guys have a view the stock is disconnected or discounted from where it should be. So clearly, you purchasing stock makes a lot of sense at this point in time. And you've talked about whole bank M&amp;A is probably not in the cards any time soon. I guess, when you look at the inorganic opportunities out there, just given all the things that you guys laid out today, what's going on at the bank, what would some of the inorganic opportunities that you would potentially pursue be in the nonbank area?</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: I can't think of anything today, Ryan, that we've pursued is inorganic in the nonbank area. I think David talked about a few opportunities, which are...</p><p>RYAN MATTHEW NASH: Not whole bank.</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: Not whole bank. Well, the restaurant franchise finance. That's -- we had a small couple of $100 million franchise finance portfolio. GE decided to the exit that business. And if we had known, we couldn't get Todd Jones to commit early enough. If we could have hired Todd early enough, we would've bought the whole portfolio, which would've been roughly 3x what we bought. Those kind of opportunities that fit with areas of expertise, sure, but they don't come up very often. But there's nothing that we sit around and think about that is a gap in our product set today that least we're aware of that we feel like we need to go in and fill the gap. So there's nothing really that I think of today or you're thinking about something I'm missing. But we're going to be opportunistic in that regard. There are restaurant franchise finance, our specialty health care team that we had the opportunity to build a business around. We didn't talk, but I think a minute or so on it in Todd's slide, we've got a very small energy lending team that has been growing and doing a very nice job in our Houston office. So we'll be opportunistic to look for things like that, but nothing I can think of today. Steve?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I wanted to follow up on expenses. BJ, maybe regarding the self-funding of tech and other expenditures. Could you talk about what areas are left? You've been cutting cost for 10 years. What's left at this point?</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: It's what a lot of our leaders say, too. I's like, come on, how much do you want me to give? We're looking at numerous continued areas to take out. And candidly, there are a lot of the same ones that we've looked at before. I think what we're doing though, Steve is looking a little bit harder at efficiencies that are tech enabled, right? So we haven't done as much as we think we could have using technology to then reduce cost across the organization. We've done some of the other things that I've mentioned. So that's going to be, I think, a big piece of it. And as Bryan said at the beginning and clearly, it shows up in our aspirations of efficiency, we can't let it not be self-funded. We can't afford to do that. And so Yousef Valine, who's here today, and Bruce Livesay and I are leading an effort to figure out where we're going to take cost out of the organization and where we're going to put money into, primarily technology, but also marketing and people to be able to do that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Given your ability to continue self-funding, do you think you can hold expenses flat to down beyond 2019? Because as we go to 2020, do we start getting some natural growth of expenses? Or could this continue beyond 2019?</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: That's a nice aspiration, but I wouldn't commit to it today. But what I will commit to is what BJ said, which is we understand we have to drive positive operating leverage. And I don't know what investments will be required. And expenses and operating leverage need to be looked at over more than a quarter-to-quarter basis or year-to-year basis, that needs to be looked at over a longer horizon. And while we will endeavor to do exactly what you said, I wouldn't feel like we're in a position to commit in that regard, because -- I described in my earlier comments, the world is changing way too fast. But I am encouraged that the work that BJ just referenced with Yousef and Bruce Livesay and BJ will find opportunities where we can use technology to eliminate cost. You heard Tammy very clearly say today, we're looking at our cost structure even in the consumer bank, and our branch network and figuring out how we take the dollars we're spending a day and invest them in what we need for the future. So I think it's a core competency of the organization and it is something we will always endeavor to do. We very clearly talk about spend every dollar as if it were your own, not a corporate dollar, not an allocated dollar. But if you own 100% of the company and you are spending that dollar, is that what you would do?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: One final one. So quite a few of the slides talked about the opportunity from the new markets from the capital deal. From what I'm hearing, it sounds like it's more of an ROE opportunity, right, replacing expensive deposits, stuff like that. Is that the way you're viewing it? Or do you think this is a stair change in terms of long-term growth of the company?</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: I think it's a little bit of both. I think it is clearly an enhancement to the overall demographics of the franchise and the growth opportunities. We've pointed out in very -- well, clearly, in less than subtle ways, that the growth dynamics of the capital bank markets are very, very strong. We also start out with a very small toehold in those markets. So it's going to take some time to build that momentum. And it'll be partly through our branding and our marketing efforts. It will be partly by augmenting the strong team that Gene and the capital bank team was able to put in place with additional hiring. But if you look at the demographics of Raleigh or Charlotte or Charleston or, even some of the submarkets in South Florida that Jeff has referenced, that should enhance our growth rate over the long term. It's probably not as much a factor as -- because of the small base we start with in 2019, but you will see that accelerate, I believe, over the forthcoming years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So just a clarification question on the efficiency ratio for the 2019 outlook. Is -- BJ, I thought you said that was a -- by year-end efficiency goal? Or is that a full-year goal?</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: The 200 to 400 basis point improvement was from 3Q '18 levels by the end of 2019.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. So the 60% to 62% is by 4Q, '19?</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: Yes. So yes. You're right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. I thought you guys did a nice job laying out all the opportunities over the next 5 years, particularly around the doubling of the economic profit over the next 5 years. Can you just remind us how the executive compensation may or may not be tied to hitting these goals?</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: Short-term economic compensation for executives is driven on a -- the bonus program is basically on a series of shorter-term annual goals that are discussed with the board in the early part of 2019. So it incorporates the things that we've been talking about here. Longer-term compensation, historically, has been driven by relative ROEs. So stock compensation, performance years have been driven by relative ROEs. In all likelihood, we will probably include a TSR measure into that as well. Short-term compensation in addition to goals includes a measure around overhead efficiency ratio. So we keep a focus on controlling costs. And so there is a modifier. And we might add to that as well as we look at 2019. For this year, we might add some growth dynamics in that as well.</p><p>ROBERT FRANCIS PLACET, ASSOCIATE ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: So I've got a couple questions for BJ and then, Bryan, I've got an easy one for you. The loan loss allowance is one of the lowest levels. And if you kind took out the nonstrategic, it's even lower in the bank. Is there a level set? Or how do you rebuild that? Or how do you -- I mean, over the next couple of years, should we build any increase in that ratio as you go forward? Or is CECL going to be your recalibration once you get there?</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: Yes. So let's put CECL aside for the moment, hopefully forever. But at least for the moment today. Yes, we will, as we're growing the loan portfolio, we will incrementally be adding to it. Our portfolio, just keep in mind, number one, obviously, it's starting from a position of strength. 40% of it is investment-grade equivalent. So we -- Susan does an excellent job of calibrating what we need in terms of reserve and have a lot of eyes on it. But number two, keep in mind that our loans-to-mortgage company business is about 12% or so and really doesn't hold any reserve. Because it's really fraud risk, not credit risk in that business. So we got a $2-ish billion portfolio that really has no reserve against it. Now don't get nervous about that. Again, it's very little to no credit loss. As a matter of fact, Bob, I don't think, not in my tenure here, we've never had a single credit loss, right? So that artificially impacts the optics of the reserve. But regardless, you've heard today that we focus on soundness, profitability and growth in that order. And we will not hesitate in the least to do something with the reserve or to build our provision when we think it's prudent to do so. But we're actively watching it and across our portfolios, absent something lumpy or one-time, we are seeing continued strength across all of our portfolios, and we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future.</p><p>ROBERT FRANCIS PLACET: So the second question, could you lead the way for all your FTN Financial customers and show how you can actually accelerate the benefit of your yield in your portfolio by restructuring and using your extract capital? So use that temporary benefit and show some of those customers the pathway so that maybe they'll start to follow suit.</p><p>WILLIAM C. LOSCH: Duly noted. I'll think about it.</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: What's the easy one?</p><p>ROBERT FRANCIS PLACET: The layout. We see the bug everywhere, right? So -- logo bug. But I was surprised, I guess, I just fell asleep at the wheel, that capital bank was still the name in, in the out markets. So I's just interested with First Horizon there as the big brand, you chose to use Capital Bank and not use First Horizon. So I was just curious how that thought process went.</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: Well, it was reasonably straightforward. We used the First Tennessee name when we acquired TrustAtlantic in 2016. And it became clear that, that was final and commercial side. It was more problematic on a retail side. The capital name was a good name. It was a strong name. We were able to use the First Tennessee logo. And we operate basically 1 charter, 1 set of systems but 2 names. So if you're in Nashville, you can go to Fort Myers and vice versa. We will have to work that out over time. Dawn has been here for 8 weeks, and I can't imagine why she doesn't haven't solved it yet, but she will. We'll work through that. We're going to end up with probably 1 of 4 choices. It'll be either be First Tennessee, Capital Bank, First Horizon or something else. But that's not a real burning platform. We need to resolve it before we push a lot of dollars into marketing and branding the Capital Bank name. On the other hand, the First Tennessee name is extraordinarily powerful here in the State of Tennessee. So it's not an easy thing to work through, and we took the pressure off of the situation by saying that, that's a decision for down the road.</p><p>ROBERT FRANCIS PLACET: Just the First Horizon name as the corporation, I was one of those that said well if we're going away from the National strategy, let's just become First Tennessee again. And we kept it. We kept the First Horizon name. So just thought that would be the nomenclature that was just there because that's why you all kept it.</p><p><person><nameText>D. BRYAN JORDAN</nameText></person>: Well, we kept the First Horizon name because I was sort of cheap, didn't want to spend $400,000, $500,000 it took to have a shareholder vote and reprint business cards to change it. And it really had nothing to do in impacting our operations. It's a name that is tested well over the years in terms of -- Horizon always implies optimism, or seems to imply optimism to most folks. So it's in the mix, but we didn't keep it for that. In particular, it was more just a decision in 2009 that we want to spend $500,000 and go through the brain damage with everything else we had going on to change a name of the company that really doesn't have an -- is not an operating entity.</p><p>I'm going to go ahead and wrap up. We'll stick around and have any other questions. I'm trying to be mindful, I know a lot of people have 4:00 flights, and I'm making you late. We are grateful that you took the time to visit with us here today and experienced Nashville. This is an outstanding city to visit. And I hope you come back here. Hope you come back to Tennessee or any of our markets and visit. And I hope you'll take the time to come back and visit with us, and we'll be happy to put more people in front of you.</p><p>One of the benefits of days like today is that you have the opportunity to see a broader cross section of the leadership and the organization. And it is extraordinarily talented team. I'm very, very proud of this team. They're very thoughtful about the business, and they're very focused on creating a tremendous amount of value. We're sort of fanatical in the organization about a book, probably the best book ever written on business, Moneyball. Those of you that read it, it was a book before Brad Pitt did the movie. Moneyball is a book about baseball, but it's the business of baseball, Billy Beane and the Oakland A's and how they took statistics and measures and created 100-win teams with the lowest payroll in baseball.</p><p>They said \"We don't have the resources to outspend the big guys, the Yankees, the Dodgers. But if we look at what puts runs on the board and think about our business in differentiated ways, we can win,\" and win they did.\" And essentially everybody in Major League sports is trying to do something like that. That's what we're doing in the banking business. We're taking data. We're taking analyses. What drives value. What destroys value. And weave those things together and create a customer experience that is differentiated and creates superior returns. If you leave with anything, I hope you leave with this is a team that has proven its ability to transform and execute the business, that we really do have a focused strategy for creating value and we recognize that we have to adapt that strategy to change in circumstances. And finally, we have some of the most attractive markets to serve of anybody in our peer group. The Tennessee footprint, the Carolinas, the South Florida footprint provide us opportunities that are almost unparalleled in the business. So thank you again for being here with us today. Thank you for the big investment of time it took you to get here, to spend 6 hours with us today and to get home later. If you have questions, please follow up with us. I hope everyone travels safely.

More interestingly, regulators have the power to order that violating data processing cease. While, in many EU countries, third parties such as consumer rights groups can file complaints on behalf of individuals.<br/>Since GDPR begun being applied, there have been thousands of complaints filed across the bloc, targeting companies large and small - alongside a rising clamour around a lack of enforcement in major cross-border cases pertaining to big tech.<br/>So the timing of the DPC's announcement on reaching a draft decision in its Twitter probe is likely no accident. (GDPR's actual anniversary of application is May 25.)<br/>The draft decision relates to an inquiry the regulator instigated itself, in November 2018, after the social network had reported a data breach - as data controllers are required to do promptly under GDPR, risking penalties should they fail to do so.<br/>Other interested EU watchdogs (all of them in this case) will now have one month to consider the decision - and lodge \"reasoned and relevant objections\" should they disagree with the DPC's reasoning, per the GDPR's one-stop-shop mechanism which enables EU regulators to liaise on cross-border inquiries.<br/>In instances where there is disagreement between DPAs on a decision the regulation contains a dispute resolution mechanism (Article 65) - which loops in the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to make a final decision on a majority basis.<br/>On the Twitter decision, the DPC told us it's hopeful this can be finalized in July.<br/>Commissioner Helen Dixon has previously said the first cross border decisions would be coming \"early\" in 2020. However the complexity of working through new processes - such as the one-stop-shop - appear to have taken EU regulators longer than hoped.<br/>The DPC is also dealing with a massive case load at this point, with more than 20 cross border investigations related to complaints and/or inquiries still pending decisions - with active probes into the data processing habits of a large number of tech giants; including Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tinder, Verizon (TechCrunch's parent company) and WhatsApp - in addition to its domestic caseload (operating with a budget that's considerably less than it requested from the Irish government).<br/>The scope of some of these major cross-border inquiries may also have bogged Ireland's regulator down.<br/>But - two years in - there are signs of momentum picking up, with the DPC's deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, pointing today to developments on four additional investigations from the cross-border pile - all of which concern Facebook owned platforms.<br/>The furthest along of these is a probe into the level of transparency the tech giant provides about how user data is shared between its WhatsApp and Facebook services.<br/>\"We have this week sent a preliminary draft decision to WhatsApp Ireland Limited for their submissions which will be taken in to account by the DPC before preparing a draft decision in that matter also for Article 60 purposes,\" said Doyle in a statement on that. \"The inquiry into WhatsApp Ireland examines its compliance with Articles 12 to 14 of the GDPR in terms of transparency including in relation to transparency around what information is shared with Facebook.\"<br/>The other three cases the DPC said it's making progress on relate to GDPR consent complaints filed back in May 2018 by the EU privacy rights not-for-profit, noyb.<br/>noyb argues that Facebook uses a strategy of \"forced consent\" to continue processing individuals' personal data - when the standard required by EU law is for users to be given a free choice unless consent is strictly necessary for provision of the service. (And noyb argues that microtargeted ads are not core to the provision of a social networking service; contextual ads could instead be served, for example.)<br/>Back in January 2019, Google was fined $57M by France's data watchdog, CNIL, over a similar complaint.<br/>Per its statement today, the DPC said it has now completed the investigation phase of this complaint-based inquiry which it said is focused on \"Facebook Ireland's obligations to establish a lawful basis for personal data processing\".<br/>\"This inquiry is now in the decision-making phase at the DPC,\" it added.<br/>In further related developments it said it's sent draft inquiry reports to the complainants and companies concerned for the same set of complaints for (Facebook owned) Instagram and WhatsApp.<br/>Doyle declined to give any firm timeline for when any of these additional inquiries might yield final decisions. But a summer date would, presumably, be the very earliest timeframe possible.<br/>The regulator's hope looks to be that once the first cross-border decision has made it through the GDPR's one-stop-shop mechanism - and yielded something all DPAs can sign up to - it will grease the tracks for the next tranche of decisions.<br/>That said, not all inquiries and decisions are equal clearly. And what exactly the DPC decides in such high profile probes will be key to whether or not there's disagreement from other data protection agencies. Different EU DPAs can take a harder or softer line on applying the bloc's rules, with some considerably more 'business friendly' than others. Albeit, the GDPR was intended to try to shrink differences of application.<br/>If there is disagreement among regulators on major cross border cases, such as the Facebook ones, the GDPR's one-stop-shop mechanism will require more time to work through to find consensus. So critics of the regulation are likely to have plenty of attack area still.<br/>Some of the inquiries the DPC is leading are also likely to set standards which could have major implications for many platforms and digital businesses so there will be vested interests seeking to influence outcomes on all sides. But with GDPR hitting its second birthday - and still hardly any decision-shaped lumps taken out of big tech - the regional pressure for enforcements to get flowing is massive.<br/>Given the blistering pace of tech developments - and the market muscle of big tech being applied to steamroller individual rights - EU regulators have to be able to close the gap between investigation and enforcement or watch their flagship framework derided as a paper tiger...<br/>\u00a0<br/>Update: noyb has since issued an open letter calling for the European Commission to take action against the DPC for failing to enforce the regulation - accusing the regulator of engaging with Facebook on a so-called \"consent bypass\" in which it claims Facebook told it it has switched from \"consent\" to an \"alleged data use contract\" with users as its legal basis.<br/>\"This contract allegedly obliges Facebook to track, target and conduct research on its users,\" noyb writes in the letter. \"According to Facebook, this switch happened at the stroke of midnight when the GDPR became applicable.\u00a0 Such a (mutual) reframing of an agreement (in this case from consent to contract) to bypass the law is called simulatio and is invalid.\"<br/>\"It is nothing but lipstick on a pig,\" Schrems continues in the statement. \"Since Roman times, the law prohibits 'renaming' something just to bypass the law. What Facebook tried to do is not smart, but laughable. The only thing that is really concerning is that the Irish DPC apparently engaged with Facebook when they were designing this scam and is now supposed to independently review it.\"<br/>\"It is a slap in the face of about 10,000 complainants if the DPC highlights the first of six steps in two cases after two years as an achievement,\" added Schrems.<br/>We've reached out to the DPC for comment on that. Update II: The DPC denied holding any \"secret meetings\" with Facebook, saying: \"We regularly engage and meet with companies from all sectors as part of our regulatory enforcement and supervision functions, in accordance with Article 57 of the GDPR, in the same way that many of our EU colleague Data Protection Authorities do.\"<br/>\"The DPC currently has 23 'big tech' inquiries open and last Friday we announced significant developments in a number of these inquiries, including three that were initiated on foot of complaints received from noyb,\" it added. \"One of these complaint-based inquiries, which focuses on Facebook Ireland's obligations to establish a lawful basis for personal data processing, has now moved to the decision-making phase at the DPC. In the other two, concerning the Instagram and WhatsApp platforms respectively, we have sent draft inquiry reports to the complainants and companies concerned. We cannot comment any further on these inquiries at this point as they are very much ongoing.\"<br/>Schrems IISummer is also shaping up to be an interesting time for privacy watchers for another reason, with a landmark decision due from Europe's top court on July 16 on the so called 'Schrems II' case (named for the Austrian lawyer, privacy rights campaigner and noyb founder, Max Schrems, who lodged the original complaint)\u00a0- which relates to the legality of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as a mechanism for personal data transfers out of the EU.<br/>The DPC's statement today makes a point of flagging this looming decision, with the regulator writing: \"The case concerns proceedings initiated and pursued in the Irish High Court by the DPC which raised a number of significant questions about the regulation of international data transfers under EU data protection law. The judgement from the CJEU on foot of the reference made arising from these proceedings is anticipated to bring much needed clarity to aspects of the law and to represent a milestone in the law on international transfers.\"<br/>A legal opinion issued at the end of last year by an influential advisor to the court emphasized that EU data protection authorities have an obligation to step in and suspend data transfers by SCC if they are being used to send citizens' data to a place where their information cannot be adequately protected.<br/>Should the court hold to that view, all EU DPAs will have an obligation to consider the legality of SCC transfers to the US \"on a case-by-case basis\", per Doyle.<br/>\"It will be in every single case you'd have to go and look at the set of circumstances in every single case to make a judgement whether to instruct them to cease doing it. There won't be just a one size fits all,\" he told TechCrunch. \"It's an extremely significant ruling.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-1021559</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601X-Y611-DYDW-70DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1829\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 2, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Continue reading First major GDPR decisions looming on Twitter and Facebook</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The lead data regulator for much of big tech in Europe is moving inexorably towards issuing its first major cross-border GDPR decision   saying today it s submitted a draft decision related to Twitter s business to its fellow EU watchdogs for review.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The draft decision focusses on whether Twitter International Company has complied with Articles 33(1) and 33(5) of the GDPR,  said the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) in a statement.</p><p>Europe s General Data Protection Regulation came into application two years ago, as an update to the European Union s  long-standing data protection framework which bakes in supersized fines for compliance violations. More interestingly, regulators have the power to order that violating data processing cease. While, in many EU countries, third parties such as consumer rights groups can file complaints on behalf of individuals.</p><p>Since GDPR begun being applied, there have been thousands of complaints filed across the bloc, targeting companies large and small   alongside a rising clamour around a lack of enforcement in major cross-border cases pertaining to big tech.</p><p>So the timing of the DPC s announcement on reaching a draft decision in its Twitter probe is likely no accident. (GDPR s actual anniversary of application is May 25.)</p><p>The draft decision relates to an inquiry the regulator instigated itself, in November 2018, after the social network had reported a data breach   as data controllers are required to do promptly under GDPR, risking penalties should they fail to do so.</p><p>Other interested EU watchdogs (all of them in this case) will now have one month to consider the decision   and lodge  reasoned and relevant objections  should they disagree with the DPC s reasoning, per the GDPR s one-stop-shop mechanism which enables EU regulators to liaise on cross-border inquiries.</p><p>In instances where there is disagreement between DPAs on a decision the regulation contains a dispute resolution mechanism (Article 65)   which loops in the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to make a final decision on a majority basis.</p><p>On the Twitter decision, the DPC told us it s hopeful this can be finalized in July.</p><p>Commissioner Helen Dixon  has previously said the first cross border decisions would be coming  early  in 2020. However the complexity of working through new processes   such as the one-stop-shop   appear to have taken EU regulators longer than hoped.</p><p>The DPC is also dealing with a massive case load at this point, with more than 20 cross border investigations related to complaints and/or inquiries still pending decisions   with active probes into the data processing habits of a large number of tech giants; including Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tinder, Verizon (TechCrunch s parent company) and WhatsApp   in addition to its domestic caseload (operating with a budget that s considerably less than it requested from the Irish government).</p><p>The scope of some of these major cross-border inquiries may also have bogged Ireland s regulator down.</p><p>But   two years in   there are signs of momentum picking up, with the DPC s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, pointing today to developments on four additional investigations from the cross-border pile   all of which concern Facebook  owned platforms.</p><p>The furthest along of these is a probe into the level of transparency the tech giant provides about how user data is shared between its WhatsApp and Facebook services.</p><p> We have this week sent a preliminary draft decision to WhatsApp  Ireland Limited for their submissions which will be taken in to account by the DPC before preparing a draft decision in that matter also for Article 60 purposes,  said Doyle in a statement on that.  The inquiry into WhatsApp Ireland examines its compliance with Articles 12 to 14 of the GDPR in terms of transparency including in relation to transparency around what information is shared with Facebook. </p><p>The other three cases the DPC said it s making progress on relate to GDPR consent complaints filed back in May 2018 by the EU privacy rights not-for-profit, noyb.</p><p>noyb argues that Facebook uses a strategy of  forced consent  to continue processing individuals  personal data   when the standard required by EU law is for users to be given a free choice unless consent is strictly necessary for provision of the service. (And noyb argues that microtargeted ads are not core to the provision of a social networking service; contextual ads could instead be served, for example.)</p><p>Back in January 2019, Google  was fined $57M by France s data watchdog, CNIL, over a similar complaint.</p><p>Per its statement today, the DPC said it has now completed the investigation phase of this complaint-based inquiry which it said is focused on  Facebook Ireland s obligations to establish a lawful basis for personal data processing .</p><p> This inquiry is now in the decision-making phase at the DPC,  it added.</p><p>In further related developments it said it s sent draft inquiry reports to the complainants and companies concerned for the same set of complaints for (Facebook owned) Instagram  and WhatsApp.</p><p>Doyle declined to give any firm timeline for when any of these additional inquiries might yield final decisions. But a summer date would, presumably, be the very earliest timeframe possible.</p><p>The regulator s hope looks to be that once the first cross-border decision has made it through the GDPR s one-stop-shop mechanism   and yielded something all DPAs can sign up to   it will grease the tracks for the next tranche of decisions.</p><p>That said, not all inquiries and decisions are equal clearly. And what exactly the DPC decides in such high profile probes will be key to whether or not there s disagreement from other data protection agencies. Different EU DPAs can take a harder or softer line on applying the bloc s rules, with some considerably more  business friendly  than others. Albeit, the GDPR was intended to try to shrink differences of application.</p><p>If there is disagreement among regulators on major cross border cases, such as the Facebook ones, the GDPR s one-stop-shop mechanism will require more time to work through to find consensus. So critics of the regulation are likely to have plenty of attack area still.</p><p>Some of the inquiries the DPC is leading are also likely to set standards which could have major implications for many platforms and digital businesses so there will be vested interests seeking to influence outcomes on all sides. But with GDPR hitting its second birthday   and still hardly any decision-shaped lumps taken out of big tech   the regional pressure for enforcements to get flowing is massive.</p><p>Given the blistering pace of tech developments   and the market muscle of big tech being applied to steamroller individual rights   EU regulators have to be able to close the gap between investigation and enforcement or watch their flagship framework derided as a paper tiger...</p><p>Max Schrems</p><p>@maxschrems</p><p>Just in time for the 2nd anniversary of the #GDPR the @DPCIreland dropped publicly that it *will* issue the first GDPR fine   not against Facebook, WhaApp, Apple, LinkedIn, Instagram ( ), but against the state child care agency..#Enforcewhat?<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/tusla-becomes-first-organisation-fined-for-gdpr-rule-breach-1.4255692?mode=amp\">https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/tusla-becomes-first-organisation-fined-for-gdpr-rule-breach-1.4255692?mode=amp</url> ...</p><h>Tusla becomes first organisation fined for GDPR rule breach</h><p>Agency fined  75,000 over three cases where data about children was wrongly disclosed</p><p>irishtimes.com</p><p>57Twitter Ads info and privacy 31 people are talking about this</p><h>Schrems II</h><p>Summer is also shaping up to be an interesting time for privacy watchers for another reason, with a landmark decision due from Europe s top court on July 16 on the so called  Schrems II  case (named for the Austrian lawyer, privacy rights campaigner and noyb founder, Max Schrems, who lodged the original complaint)   which relates to the legality of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as a mechanism for personal data transfers out of the EU.</p><p>The DPC s statement today makes a point of flagging this looming decision, with the regulator writing:  The case concerns proceedings initiated and pursued in the Irish High Court by the DPC which raised a number of significant questions about the regulation of international data transfers under EU data protection law.

There won t be just a one size fits all,  he told TechCrunch.  It s an extremely significant ruling. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-union\">https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-union</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Natasha Lomas<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2566107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6007-SKY1-F08D-5439-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1633\"/><timeReceived>3:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 25, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Continue reading First major GDPR decisions looming on Twitter and Facebook</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The lead data regulator for much of big tech in Europe is moving inexorably towards issuing its first major cross-border GDPR decision   saying today it s submitted a draft decision related to Twitter s business to its fellow EU watchdogs for review.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The draft decision focusses on whether Twitter International Company has complied with Articles 33(1) and 33(5) of the GDPR,  said the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) in a statement.</p><p>Europe s General Data Protection Regulation came into application two years ago, as an update to the European Union s  long-standing data protection framework which bakes in supersized fines for compliance violations. More interestingly, regulators have the power to order that violating data processing cease. While, in many EU countries, third parties such as consumer rights groups can file complaints on behalf of individuals.</p><p>Since GDPR begun being applied, there have been thousands of complaints filed across the bloc, targeting companies large and small   alongside a rising clamour around a lack of enforcement in major cross-border cases pertaining to big tech.</p><p>So the timing of the DPC s announcement on reaching a draft decision in its Twitter probe is likely no accident. (GDPR s actual anniversary of application is May 25.)</p><p>The draft decision relates to an inquiry the regulator instigated itself, in November 2018, after the social network had reported a data breach   as data controllers are required to do promptly under GDPR, risking penalties should they fail to do so.</p><p>Other interested EU watchdogs (all of them in this case) will now have one month to consider the decision   and lodge  reasoned and relevant objections  should they disagree with the DPC s reasoning, per the GDPR s one-stop-shop mechanism which enables EU regulators to liaise on cross-border inquiries.</p><p>In instances where there is disagreement between DPAs on a decision the regulation contains a dispute resolution mechanism (Article 65)   which loops in the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to make a final decision on a majority basis.</p><p>On the Twitter decision, the DPC told us it s hopeful this can be finalized in July.</p><p>Commissioner Helen Dixon  has previously said the first cross border decisions would be coming  early  in 2020. However the complexity of working through new processes   such as the one-stop-shop   appear to have taken EU regulators longer than hoped.</p><p>The DPC is also dealing with a massive case load at this point, with more than 20 cross border investigations related to complaints and/or inquiries still pending decisions   with active probes into the data processing habits of a large number of tech giants; including Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tinder, Verizon (TechCrunch s parent company) and WhatsApp   in addition to its domestic caseload (operating with a budget that s considerably less than it requested from the Irish government).</p><p>The scope of some of these major cross-border inquiries may also have bogged Ireland s regulator down.</p><p>But   two years in   there are signs of momentum picking up, with the DPC s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, pointing today to developments on four additional investigations from the cross-border pile   all of which concern Facebook  owned platforms.</p><p>The furthest along of these is a probe into the level of transparency the tech giant provides about how user data is shared between its WhatsApp and Facebook services.</p><p> We have this week sent a preliminary draft decision to WhatsApp  Ireland Limited for their submissions which will be taken in to account by the DPC before preparing a draft decision in that matter also for Article 60 purposes,  said Doyle in a statement on that.  The inquiry into WhatsApp Ireland examines its compliance with Articles 12 to 14 of the GDPR in terms of transparency including in relation to transparency around what information is shared with Facebook. </p><p>The other three cases the DPC said it s making progress on relate to GDPR consent complaints filed back in May 2018 by the EU privacy rights not-for-profit, noyb.</p><p>noyb argues that Facebook uses a strategy of  forced consent  to continue processing individuals  personal data   when the standard required by EU law is for users to be given a free choice unless consent is strictly necessary for provision of the service. (And noyb argues that microtargeted ads are not core to the provision of a social networking service; contextual ads could instead be served, for example.)</p><p>Back in January 2019, Google  was fined $57M by France s data watchdog, CNIL, over a similar complaint.</p><p>Per its statement today, the DPC said it has now completed the investigation phase of this complaint-based inquiry which it said is focused on  Facebook Ireland s obligations to establish a lawful basis for personal data processing .</p><p> This inquiry is now in the decision-making phase at the DPC,  it added.</p><p>In further related developments it said it s sent draft inquiry reports to the complainants and companies concerned for the same set of complaints for (Facebook owned) Instagram  and WhatsApp.</p><p>Doyle declined to give any firm timeline for when any of these additional inquiries might yield final decisions. But a summer date would, presumably, be the very earliest timeframe possible.</p><p>The regulator s hope looks to be that once the first cross-border decision has made it through the GDPR s one-stop-shop mechanism   and yielded something all DPAs can sign up to   it will grease the tracks for the next tranche of decisions.</p><p>That said, not all inquiries and decisions are equal clearly. And what exactly the DPC decides in such high profile probes will be key to whether or not there s disagreement from other data protection agencies. Different EU DPAs can take a harder or softer line on applying the bloc s rules, with some considerably more  business friendly  than others. Albeit, the GDPR was intended to try to shrink differences of application.</p><p>If there is disagreement among regulators on major cross border cases, such as the Facebook ones, the GDPR s one-stop-shop mechanism will require more time to work through to find consensus. So critics of the regulation are likely to have plenty of attack area still.</p><p>Some of the inquiries the DPC is leading are also likely to set standards which could have major implications for many platforms and digital businesses so there will be vested interests seeking to influence outcomes on all sides. But with GDPR hitting its second birthday   and still hardly any decision-shaped lumps taken out of big tech   the regional pressure for enforcements to get flowing is massive.</p><p>Given the blistering pace of tech developments   and the market muscle of big tech being applied to steamroller individual rights   EU regulators have to be able to close the gap between investigation and enforcement or watch their flagship framework derided as a paper tiger...</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/card_img/1262138390096621568/CH4-qGda?format=jpg&amp;name=small\">https://pbs.twimg.com/card_img/1262138390096621568/CH4-qGda?format=jpg&amp;name=small</url></p><h>Schrems II</h><p>Summer is also shaping up to be an interesting time for privacy watchers for another reason, with a landmark decision due from Europe s top court on July 16 on the so called  Schrems II  case (named for the Austrian lawyer, privacy rights campaigner and noyb founder, Max Schrems, who lodged the original complaint)   which relates to the legality of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as a mechanism for personal data transfers out of the EU.</p><p>The DPC s statement today makes a point of flagging this looming decision, with the regulator writing:  The case concerns proceedings initiated and pursued in the Irish High Court by the DPC which raised a number of significant questions about the regulation of international data transfers under EU data protection law. The judgement from the CJEU on foot of the reference made arising from these proceedings is anticipated to bring much needed clarity to aspects of the law and to represent a milestone in the law on international transfers. </p><p>A legal opinion issued at the end of last year by an influential advisor to the court emphasized that EU data protection authorities have an obligation to step in and suspend data transfers by SCC if they are being used to send citizens  data to a place where their information cannot be adequately protected.</p><p>Should the court hold to that view, all EU DPAs will have an obligation to consider the legality of SCC transfers to the US  on a case-by-case basis , per Doyle.</p><p> It will be in every single case you d have to go and look at the set of circumstances in every single case to make a judgement whether to instruct them to cease doing it. There won t be just a one size fits all,  he told TechCrunch.

As long and as tall as a cruise ship, the sleek glass structure loomed above rusty, century-old dry docks, serving notice to the industrial neighborhood that the new economy was coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The project, known as Dock 72, is the brainchild of WeWork, the fast-growing New York start-up valued at a whopping $20 billion. In just eight years, WeWork has built a network of 212 shared working spaces around the globe. But WeWork's chief executive and co-founder, Adam Neumann, isn't content to just lease out communal offices. Mr. Neumann -- a lanky, longhaired 38-year-old Israeli -- wants nothing less than to radically transform the way we work, live and play. </p><p>  When Dock 72 is completed this year, if the aggressive timeline holds, it will represent the fullest expression of Mr. Neumann's expansive vision to date. There will be an enormous co-working space, a luxury spa and large offices, for other companies like IBM and Verizon, that are designed and run by WeWork. There will be a juice bar, a real bar, a gym with a boxing studio, an outdoor basketball court and panoramic vistas of Manhattan. There will be restaurants and maybe even dry cleaning services and a barbershop.</p><p>  It will be the kind of place you never have to leave until you need to go to sleep -- and if Mr. Neumann has his way, you'll sleep at one of the apartments he is renting nearby.</p><p>  It's an all-encompassing sort of ambition, and Mr. Neumann is the brash and idealistic pitchman. Simply by encouraging strangers to share a beer at the office, he argues, WeWork can heal our fractured society.</p><p>  ''How do you change the world?'' Mr. Neumann asked in a recent interview. ''Bring people together. Where is the easiest big place to bring people together? In the work environment.''</p><p>  It may sound simplistic, but around the globe, companies are buying whatever it is that Mr. Neumann and his co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, are selling. WeWork has rapidly expanded to 20 countries, assembled a formidable executive team and attracted some 200,000 members. Big companies like JPMorgan Chaseand Siemens are signing on as tenants, and revenues are growing fast, expected to top $2.3 billion this year.</p><p>WeWork last year bought the iconic Lord &amp; Taylor building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which is being transformed into the company's new headquarters. That deal was made possible in part by a recent $4.4 billion investment from SoftBank, the Japanese technology group led by the enigmatic billionaire <person><nameText>Masayoshi Son.</nameText></person></p><p>  Already the company has started WeLive, its residential offering, and Rise, its gym. It acquired Meetup, the social network that facilitates in-person gatherings, and the Flatiron School, a coding academy. Still to come: WeGrow, the company's for-profit elementary school, set to open in September. WeWork has even invested in plans to create giant wave pools for inland surfing.</p><p>  A company ostensibly about co-working now employs yoga instructors, architects, teachers, environmental scientists, software engineers, molecular biologists and social psychologists.</p><p>  Is it all a bit much for a young company still trying to build out its core business? ''I've made that argument,'' said Bruce Dunlevie, a WeWork board member and partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark. But, he said, ''great entrepreneurs like Adam don't listen to guys like me.''</p><p>  As WeWork expands in all directions, it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model. Critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage -- leasing a space, spiffing it up, then subleasing it out to other tenants. The company owns hardly any properties, giving it precious few hard assets. Its growth projections strike many as unattainable, and it has missed expectations before. A number of upstarts loom as potential competitors, seeking to replicate WeWork's success. And many WeWork tenants are unproven start-ups that could quickly fold.</p><p>  IWG, a publicly traded co-working company that has more members and more real estate than WeWork, is valued at just $2 billion. Yet Mr. Neumann has convinced investors that WeWork is worth 10 times that figure.</p><p>  ''Adam's explanation for the valuation of WeWork speaks for itself,'' said Chris Kelly, co-founder and president of Convene, a company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms. ''This is not an Excel spreadsheet calculation. He believes there's an energy behind the brand, and he's gotten people to invest at that valuation. He has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms.''</p><p>  Indeed, to assess WeWork by conventional metrics is to miss the point, according to Mr. Neumann. WeWork isn't really a real estate company. It's a state of consciousness, he argues, a generation of interconnected emotionally intelligent entrepreneurs. And Mr. Neumann, with his combination of inspiration and chutzpah, wants to transform not just the way we work and live, but the very world we live in.</p><p>  It's an audacious, perhaps delusional plan for a company that made its mark by building communal desks and providing refreshments. And so far, it seems to be working.</p><p>  Mr. Son, WeWork's largest investor, is betting that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come, making his multibillion-dollar investment a veritable bargain.</p><p>  ''Make it 10 times bigger than your original plan,'' Mr. Son told Forbes late last year. ''If you think in that manner, the valuation is cheap. It can be worth a few hundred billion dollars.''</p><p>  Close Communities</p><p>  The notion that white-collar workers might actually like their offices is a relatively new one. From the countinghouses of industrial England to the skyscrapers of 1980s Manhattan, offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space, often with row upon row of unglamorous desks.</p><p>  ''The only kind of model that anyone had for laying out a large workplace was a factory,'' said Nikil Saval, author of ''Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.'' ''So the office was made to resemble an assembly line.''</p><p>  This dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest, at least for some, during the dot-com bubble. Tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and Ping-Pong tables, making work spaces less formal. Free food became commonplace.</p><p>  Raised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream, and today, more and more employees -- especially millennials -- expect enlightened, unconventional offices.</p><p>  Enter WeWork. With people bouncing between employers, jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely, the demand for co-working was suddenly real, and ready to be monetized. Mr. Neumann, who grew up on a kibbutz in Israel, had an epiphany: Bring the communal vibe to the office.</p><p>  Soon he and a friend -- Mr. McKelvey, an equally tall Oregonian who grew up on a collective and was working as an architect -- founded an eco-friendly co-working space in Brooklyn. They sold it, but they quickly turned around and started WeWork in 2010.</p><p>  ''Me and Miguel have this common ground,'' Mr. Neumann said. ''We both grew up in very close communities.''</p><p>WeWork didn't invent co-working spaces, of course. IWG, better known as Regus, has been around for decades. But Mr. Neumann and Mr. McKelvey quickly hit upon a recipe that drew throngs of start-ups: an industrial chic aesthetic, some big common areas with comfy couches, free beer and piped-in pop music.</p><p>  Individuals pay as little as $45 a month for occasional access to a desk in a common area. Start-ups can pay a few thousand dollars for a private room on a month-to-month basis, and some big companies pay millions of dollars a year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locations.</p><p>  It's a formula that has caught on from New York to Tel Aviv to Shanghai. In New York alone, WeWork has 49 spaces, most of them nearly full. At the WeWork in Harlem, dance companies share space with hair care start-ups in a common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians. At a WeWork in TriBeCa, fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in a spartan space decorated with neon lighting.</p><p>  For WeWork to really succeed in changing the way we all work, it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees. The strategy is an odd reversal for WeWork, which made its name catering to freelancers and start-ups.</p><p>  The Weather Channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous WeWork in Midtown Manhattan. Barbara Bekkedahl, who runs the group, said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish.</p><p>  But Ms. Bekkedahl had a complaint, too, one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space. She suggested that the hygienic and sartorial habits of some of her new office mates were lacking.</p><p>  ''As a TV sales team, we groom and dress for outside sales,'' she said. ''Some of the techie and start-up types housed at WeWork aren't facing customers all day, so don't always have the same standards.''</p><p>  Gripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down WeWork's business with corporate clients, especially if Mr. Neumann makes good on his promise to save them money. Because WeWork is building out so much space and buying so much furniture, Mr. Neumann says, he can renovate and operate an office for a fraction of the cost that companies would normally spend.</p><p>  ''We have economies of scale,'' he said. ''I'll cut your operational costs between 20 to 50 percent.''</p><p>  It might seem like another instance of Mr. Neumann's talking a big game but for the fact that more and more companies -- GE, HSBC, Salesforce and Microsoft among them -- are signing on.</p><p>  For years now, big companies have outsourced payroll processing, janitorial services and security. It's not a stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to a company like WeWork.</p><p>  ''We only have 200,000 members,'' Mr. McKelvey, 43, said. ''That's ridiculous. We need to have two million and then 20 million.''</p><p>  More 'We' Than 'Me'</p><p>  Bankers and lawyers poured out of skyscrapers and made for the suburbs on a recent Monday night in Manhattan's financial district. But at 110 Wall Street, a building controlled entirely by WeWork, the party was just getting started.</p><p>  Last year, this 1960s-era office tower was converted into a mixed-use development of Mr. Neumann's design. There is a co-working space. On the ground floor are trendy restaurants including Westville, Fuku, Momofuku Milk Bar and a bar called the Mail Room.</p><p>  And then there is a WeLive: a complex of about 200 fully furnished apartments rented out on a short-term basis. Tenants get the signature WeWork aesthetic of unpolished wood and wrought iron, as well as various perks. There are hot tubs on the terrace. There are arcade games and a pool table in the laundry room. There are a chef's kitchen and a communal dining room. At a bar on a residential floor, a happy hour was brewing and free Tempranillo was flowing.</p><p>  In the communal dining area, three brothers -- Jordan, Jake and Jimmy DeCicco -- were cooking for a half-dozen social media influencers, hoping to stir up enthusiasm for their protein-infused iced coffee company. Over rib-eye steaks and brussels sprouts, they talked about promoting the brand and breaking into new markets, passing out beers to anyone who walked by.</p><p>  The brothers are all in: They live in WeLive, work in the adjacent WeWork space and exercise at WeWork's nearby gym, Rise.</p><p>  ''It's awesome,'' Jake DeCicco said. ''You just roll out of bed, go down the elevator and get to work.''</p><p>  Had Mr. Neumann been there to share a beer, those words would have been music to his ears. He believes that creating a work and living environment where people mingle is in fact a world-changing innovation. Each WeWork has a ''community manager'' who keeps tabs on members, makes introductions and organizes social activities.</p><p>  If more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water, the thinking goes, they are more likely to meet up and invest in one another's socially responsible start-ups, and then the world will be a better place.</p><p>  ''Once you choose to enter a WeWork, you choose to be part of something more 'we' than 'me,''' Mr. Neumann said. ''People start coming together. They'll see each other in the elevator, they talk in the stairways. There's a thousand other things they do.''</p><p>  Elevators. Stairways. Hardly world-changing innovations. But WeWork takes extra steps to encourage fraternization. Like beer kegs that never run dry.</p><p>  More than most companies, WeWork promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue. Posters on the wall encourage people to have a drink. There are wine tastings at WeLive. Company parties feature top-shelf liquor. Mr. Neumann has a well-known penchant for tequila, and a well-stocked bar is prominent in his office.</p><p>  On a recent Tuesday at 4:07 p.m., the community manager of a WeWork in Midtown Manhattan sent an email reading: ''It's time to get your creative juices flowing! Join us on the 5th floor to drink some wine &amp; paint a beautiful picture.'' Just after noon on Valentine's Day, there was an invitation to share wine and cake in the common area.</p><p>  Though alcohol is a social lubricant for some, it can be off-putting to many others. Many women have shared stories of feeling uncomfortable with what they described as a frat house culture at some WeWorks, prompting some to leave. </p><p>  As WeWork has grown, minor scandals have rattled the company. In 2015, the company grew ensnared in a complicated legal dispute with a group of former janitors who tried to unionize at a subcontractor that WeWork used. The next year, WeWork drew scrutiny for its use of arbitration to settle workplace disputes, and for its firing of an employee who refused to adhere to a related policy.</p><p>  But so far nothing -- not alcohol, labor disputes, questions about the business fundamentals or bad publicity -- has managed to alter the company's trajectory.</p><p>  ''We're a disrupter of the way people view the spaces they work in on a day-to-day basis,'' said Mr. Dunlevie of Benchmark. ''And we're in the early days of taking advantage of that phenomenon.''</p><p>   Teaching Tykes</p><p>  In September, WeWork will open its most ambitious project to date: a kindergarten. It may also be the effort that tests whether WeWork is flying too close to the sun.</p><p>  The creation of Mr. Neumann's wife, Rebekah, 39, the school is known as WeGrow. When it opens, it promises a well-designed space with a curriculum that emphasizes socializing and entrepreneurship for 3-year-olds on up.</p><p>WeGrow fits neatly into Mr. Neumann's expansive vision for creating a generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs. But the risk-reward calculus is different when starting a school.</p><p>WeGrow won't scale as rapidly as WeWork has, so the financial upside is limited. Yet should something go wrong, the fallout could be devastating: It's one thing to be responsible for the internet going out or paper running low at the communal printer. It's another thing to take responsibility for the health and development of someone's child.</p><p>  Though Ms. Neumann has no background in education (on the website, she describes herself as ''an avid student of life'' and says her ''superpower'' is ''intuition''), she has applied for accreditation from the state, has hired a team of career educators and is accepting applications for the coming school year. Tuition for toddlers: $36,000 a year.</p><p>  ''We all understand how complicated and regulated school is compared to the simpler business that we are already in,'' Mr. Neumann said. ''But we decided we're going to go into education. If you really want to change the world, change kids when they're 2.''</p><p>  As he proselytized, Mr. Neumann was sitting on an enormous leather couch in his Chelsea office, which is bigger than many New York City apartments. It included a conference table, a video conferencing setup, several desks, a bar, spreads of food, a Peloton exercise bike, a climbing machine, a boxing bag hanging from the ceiling, a gong, an antechamber where assistants work and a private bathroom.</p><p>  ''It's going to work,'' Mr. Neumann continued. ''Is it going to be perfect? Definitely not. Are we going to make mistakes? A hundred percent. Are we going to be comfortable admitting those mistakes? Definitely. It's what we do here.''</p><p>  Though such unbridled zeal can be abrasive to some, it could also be viewed as the mark of a peripatetic savant. Walter Isaacson, the biographer of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Leonardo da Vinci, counts Mr. Neumann as a friend, and said he shared some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeed.</p><p>  ''He has an instinctive feel for how millennials are going to want to have community work experiences without joining large corporations,'' Mr. Isaacson said. ''And like Steve Jobs and other great entrepreneurs, he knows how to connect the humanities with business and technology.''</p><p>  'Make a Life'</p><p>  It can be tempting to dismiss WeWork as just another overvalued start-up that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from na\u00efve investors. With little more than faddish interior design, free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers, Mr. Neumann claims to have conjured up a whole new paradigm for white-collar workers -- and for education -- and vows that it can change the world.</p><p>  It's the kind of utopian prattle that can come off as dangerously out of touch at a moment when a backlash against big tech is brewing. But if any of these potential pitfalls concern Mr. Neumann, he doesn't show it.</p><p>  On a Wednesday night in January, Mr. Neumann strode onstage before a packed house at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, basked in spotlights. Wearing a black leather biker jacket and a T-shirt that read ''High on We,'' Mr. Neumann was playing host at his own extravagant party, a multiday celebration of WeWork and its extended community.</p><p>  On this, the first night of festivities, Mr. Neumann would oversee a ''Shark Tank''-like competition for socially responsible small businesses -- ranging from a start-up that made customized prosthetics to a food-delivery service staffed by refugees -- each vying for a $1 million prize.</p><p>  Earlier, Mr. Neumann had rattled off the company's achievements and outlined some of its more outsize ambitions. As the evening's performer, the Grammy-winning rapper Macklemore, waited backstage, Mr. Neumann went on an impromptu riff about how people should ''make a life, not just a living,'' the company's aspirational motto.</p><p>  Mr. Neumann also stated that it was important to support social entrepreneurs. ''Of course that makes a lot of sense, but who's going to pay for that?'' he said. ''And we said, 'Well, Masa might!'''</p><p>  The line generated a laugh among the hundreds of knowing employees in the room -- Mr. Son, whose nickname is Masa, was conveniently absent -- but it was a tell from Mr. Neumann, a sly admission that at this point he is playing with house money.</p><p>  Then, when the time came to choose a winner, Mr. Neumann made a surprise announcement: Instead of choosing one recipient, WeWork would give away $1 million each to two of the companies -- Re:3D, a 3-D printing company, and Global Vision 2020, a nonprofit that provides prescription glasses to people in the developing world. And it would give another couple of million to the other half-dozen finalists.</p><p>  Confetti fell from the rafters. The winners cried on stage. Mr. Neumann took it all in, beaming.</p><p>  Even Macklemore was taken aback by all the money flying around. ''I was just watching it, chugging a Red Bull,'' he said shortly into his set, ''and I immediately thought, 'Damn, I should have got into technology.'''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Clockwise from top left, Adam Neumann, chief executive and co-founder of WeWork</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>the dining room at the WeLive facility at 110 Wall Street</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Miguel McKelvey, a WeWork co-founder</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>and residents at a bar at 110 Wall Street.

But things have come back nicely. We may even end up higher, which of course could be the possibility of records. The market and the reasons why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A soft quarter for Softbank. The Japanese giant posts its first loss in years. Big investments are backfiring. We'll get into the details.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Xerox wants to ink a deal with HP. Now HP is a company three times the size.</p><p>And election trouble for Donald Trump. The Democrats are winning big in Republican strongholds.</p><p>We are alive in the world's financial capital, New York City on a spectacular day, but it is Wednesday, it is November the 6th. I'm Richard Quest, and yes, I mean business.</p><p>Breaking news on CNN tonight. Air Europa says an emergency involving one of its planes at Schiphol, Amsterdam is a false alarm. The spokesperson for the Dutch military says passengers and crew are safely off the plane after what it called a suspicious situation aboard an aircraft. Emergency Services had flocked to the airport and there was a major incident underway.</p><p>Now, Nic Robertson is following this in London. And Nic, I shall give you the delight and joy of telling us what Air Europa says was the reason why.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Air Europa says that it was a mistake on board the aircraft that the warning -- that it was triggered by mistake, a warning was triggered by mistake, that was warning of a possible kidnapping situation on board the aircraft.</p><p>They're not saying at the moment who made the mistake. The Dutch national broadcaster had been earlier indicating that what they were hearing was that the pilot, the captain of the aircraft had actually hit a button that indicated a hijacking was underway. There were 27 passengers on board the aircraft, but the airline putting their hands up here and saying it was a mistake.</p><p>All in all, this has taken about an hour and a half to wrap up. But for all those travelers familiar with airport travel and familiar with the delays that can happen at airports, this has been a relatively short one and certainly, for the Dutch authorities will have put them through their paces to respond to an emergency situation because they responded as if this was real, and stood up to the task ahead of them, bringing everyone ultimately safely off the aircraft.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, indeed. And I notice that Air Europa perhaps embarrassing, though it is, but at least they say, we deeply apologize for what took place -- Nic.</p><p>ROBERTSON: They do, and that will be some consolation to passengers. Look, you can spin this several ways that this was absolutely unnecessary and you could be heading towards a business meeting and this could have really, really upset the end of your day.</p><p>On the other hand, many passengers will be thankful that there are alert systems in place to protect them in the worst eventualities.</p><p>QUEST: And I would also just add to that, any one of us who has not made a mistake in some shape, form or another, let them go to the front of the queue if you're going to throw a rock and criticize. Nic Robertson, thank you, joining us from London.</p><p>Other breaking news tonight, U.S. House Democrats have released the transcripts from the testimony of the top U.S. envoy in Ukraine, William Taylor.</p><p>Now, they reveal that Taylor told lawmakers in his deposition, it was his clear understanding there will be no Ukraine military aid without a commitment to investigate the Biden family.</p><p>The Democrats have also announced Taylor will testify in the first public Impeachment Inquiry hearings, they take place next week. He is due to appear before Congress on Wednesday, along with -- appear before Congress along with top State Department official, George Kent.</p><p>The Committee will hear from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch on Friday. Now, let me remind you, who is who, in all of this.</p><p>Taylor, whose testimony was released today was U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine in both Bush and Obama. He served briefly under President Trump. He wasn't an ambassador. He was sort of a half-time Ambassador because of protocols and he said he felt the President was holding up security aid until it launched investigations on the President's behalf.</p><p>[15:05:07]</p><p>QUEST: Marie Yovanovitch was a former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, a career diplomat who served six Presidents. She was fired by the Trump administration and she believes she was forced out by the President.</p><p>Lauren Fox join me on Capitol Hill. Now, we have seen the formal transcript. What stands out for you?</p><p>LAUREN FOX, CNN POLITICS U.S. CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER: Well, I think the key takeaway here, Richard, is the fact that Bill Taylor came to believe that the U.S. military aid, nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid was being tied to the President getting investigations announced into his political opponents.</p><p>According to the transcript, he said, \"That was my clear understanding. Security assistance money would not come until the President committed to pursue investigation.\" So now, Taylor was clear as he was pushed by Republicans behind closed doors. Taylor was clear he didn't speak directly with the President himself, but that that was his understanding.</p><p>He also brought those concerns to Mike Pompeo arguing that if the policy had changed in Ukraine, he would have to leave. So very key takeaways there. He also said he had concerns to even go to Kiev, because he was concerned about, quote, \"a snake pit\" in Washington and in Ukraine -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: And if I remember his statement correctly, it was his wife, who said if your President or if your country asks, you then, you serve. He may be regretting that, of course, in retrospect and on this -- on the hearings next week, Lauren, I mean, this is where the tone changes, doesn't it? Because -- well you tell me, how will it be different next week?</p><p>FOX: Well, Richard, I think a key takeaway and something that Adam Schiff, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee has been arguing is that this is the first opportunity that the American public is going to have to hear from these diplomats.</p><p>A lot of these characters are people that the American people who had never heard of before a month ago. Now, for the first time, they're going to see them in a committee hearing setting. They're going to be able to hear from them. And I think that that's a very important takeaway, and something that could potentially shift public opinion, Richard.</p><p>I think if you start to see these hearings unfold, it could shift public opinion for the American people, but also for perhaps Senate Republicans who are potential jurors, if Articles of Impeachment pass the House of Representatives and move over to the Senate for a trial -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Lauren, thank you. You'll be watching of course next week and bringing us analysis of the hearings as and when they get underway, and we're grateful for that.</p><p>It all happens as Democrats are celebrating victories in some of the country's most conservative states that took place in the midterm elections on Tuesday.</p><p>Now in Virginia, you see there on the map, the Party took control of the House and the Senate for the first time in more than 20 years. Whilst in Kentucky, a little further down, the Democratic candidate for Governor seemingly beat out the incumbent Republican who is refusing to concede. Rebecca Buck is with me. Good to see you.</p><p>Look, these races now, off years are often a chance to bash and send a message to a ruling administration. But they don't necessarily always follow through when the deed has to be done in the big one. So can we realistically take anything from last night?</p><p>REBECCA BUCK, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: We can, Richard and here is why. These may be state elections, it may be an off year, but these are reliable early indicators of where the energy is among voters and what issues are really resonating with them.</p><p>And so what we saw in Kentucky and Virginia last night, where Democrats won big in some traditionally Republican areas are a few things. First, that the President remains unpopular in the suburbs.</p><p>These are going to be the areas, these suburban communities where the 2020 presidential election will play out and be decided. And so what we saw last night was that Democrats were energized in these areas - that the President remains deeply unpopular, and that that was driving many of these voters to the polls and driving their decisions.</p><p>What we also saw though, is this turnout. This is an off year election, you don't necessarily expect this sort of energy. But there was some question especially in light of Democrats pursuing impeachment in the House. This is the first election after Democrats have been pursuing impeachment, our first glimpse of how voters feel about it.</p><p>And what we saw is that they are not responding negatively to Democrats pursuing impeachment. That they are, in fact, responding positively. That they do share some of these negative impressions of the President. So these are the really significant takeaways looking forward to 2020 and the elections in the coming year.</p><p>Now, Republicans I should note are pointing to the local factors for example, the Kentucky governor's race. The candidate, they say had some very serious weaknesses. The Democrats feeling really good, Richard by what they saw last night.</p><p>QUEST: So the -- at what point though do the Republicans get alarmed? I'm not suggesting, you know, ditch the President yet, but at some point, they will consider whether or not he is more of a hindrance than a help.</p><p>BUCK: Well, what Republicans have believed is that their best hand is to stick with the President, and that's what we've seen in elections past, in the midterm elections in 2018, and that's what we continue to see from them.</p><p>The reason that they have hope is that they believe they can consolidate the world, though, where the President tends to be extremely strong turnout Republicans who are really loyal to him and win that way. And they do remain optimistic because among Republicans voters, the President is very popular and they believe in a presidential election scenario, those voters who are intensely loyal to him will ultimately turn out.</p><p>But it's a great question, you know, do they sort of hedge their bets here, and especially depending on the way impeachment goes, you could see some shifts in strategy -- Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Rebecca, thank you.</p><p>BUCK: Thanks, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Less than an hour left on Wall Street on a mid-week session and markets are mostly flat, a streak of gains earlier in the week. The Dow is betwixt and between as we say. It's off the sessions highs, a midday fall.</p><p>Now that midday fall at 12 o'clock was on reports that President Trump and President Xi may delay a signing of Phase 1. Energy stocks are the worst of the day. Chevron and Exxon were down that's pulling down the market.</p><p>We might still end up positive, but it's going to be a close one, I think by the end of the day.</p><p>Ben Phillips is Chief Investment Officer of EventShares. Good to see you, Ben, joining me from Los Angeles. I was reading your comments on this -- you heard us obviously since the beginning of the program. We've talked about Donald Trump on impeachment, Donald Trump on the elections. But your advice when looking at your portfolio, vis-a-vis politics is what?</p><p>BEN PHILLIPS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, EVENTSHARES: Well, we say look at policy, not politics. That's our key line that we want investors to always keep in mind.</p><p>Politics is that noise and debate. Policy is the change and the trends that actually drive business valuations. They drive markets, and they drive changes to industry. So we look at policy, not politics.</p><p>QUEST: But one leads to the other in many cases, and you know, it's a fine line in this administration when the politics is the policy.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes, that's right. I mean, but you actually rarely see a lot of this politicking translate to policy. So you have to look very closely at where there's actually a policy trend.</p><p>I'll tell you, Medicare-for-All is a good example. It's largely politicking. We think very low probability that actually materializes into policy. ACA is sticking around in our view, hence why there's an opportunity in healthcare names right now, because the market is overreacting to that political sentiment.</p><p>QUEST: What are the sectors you like the look of?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, from a policy perspective, from policy investing, and what we're buying in our ETF is largely infrastructure names. We think they're still really attractive. The states are spending. Everyone thinks it's a Federal story, it's not. It's a state story.</p><p>5G telecom - really good valuations there at some of the towers. Some of the equipment makers were staying away from the Chinese exposed semiconductor names though, but some interesting things in 5G telecom.</p><p>We also like sports betting. Some of the regional gamers, some of the gaming stocks, too and some of the technology companies that are enabling sports betting or partnering with sports betting.</p><p>So those are a few that we actually really like and are looking for and then select energy names. You mentioned energy is underperforming today, but there's this IMO 2020 thing that is starting on January 1, 2020 that is saying low sulfur fuel regulations are the new norm for shipping, and there's opportunities there.</p><p>QUEST: And the big tech? The big names? Are they taking a breath? Where many of us have seen the biggest gains in our portfolio, we're also seeing the largest risks at the moment, and I'm wondering if that plays over for the time being?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes, it's something that we look at closely. I mean, we are concerned about the policy turning negative there for big tech. So you look at data regulation, you look at the social media controversies that have occurred over the past couple of years. There's a real will from D.C. on both sides of the aisle to regulate those companies, and we think that's going to be a headwind for them.</p><p>QUEST: We're at record levels. We might even close at a record today as well, since yesterday was a record. It will be touch and go. I'm trying to always gauge every day now, how fragile we are at these levels.</p><p>I mean, are we for example, sort of like on a matchstick just swaying waiting to fall off? Or are there real concrete pillars holding up this market at these levels?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, there's one very large concrete pillar and it is global Central Banks, including the Fed. They're pumping liquidity back into the system at the top of a cycle. That's the real risk for anyone who is overly cautious right now is that this excess of liquidity that we're putting back into the system causes another rally.</p><p>I mean the technical level is on the upside for the S&amp;P are another 24 percent higher. So there's a big upside potential if we get a China deal, if we see some growth return, and all of a sudden all this liquidity goes back to work putting it into stocks, it's going to drive stocks higher.</p><p>[15:15:22]</p><p>QUEST: And we are lucky, we have a second or two more so we can take the opportunity to Investing 101 and remind viewers, Ben, why the Central Banks with their liquidity of pumping money, why that boosts the stock market? Many - myself included sometimes can't see a direct correlation between a Central Bank printing money and a stock market going up.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, there's certain things they do. They have reserve requirements. They have overnight rates and ways they can manipulate how much cash is going in the system.</p><p>As you recall, we spoke in late September it was, we spoke about just the liquidity crisis that occurred at the repo -- the overnight repo -- that was because there wasn't enough cash in the system. So the Fed overcompensated. They're putting more cash in the system. The cash has to go to work somewhere, so people have to invest.</p><p>They're either going to buy bonds, or they're going to buy stocks for the most part, or do other investments. But largely, its bonds and stocks. And so those are two alternative for large institutional investors and bond rates now are one percent plus, you know, one to two percent range.</p><p>So the options are, okay, we're just going to go back into stocks because it is better risk reward. There's good risk reward internationally, too. So it's going to go into stocks is our view.</p><p>QUEST: Perfectly explained. Now, we've got a better understanding, as we always try to do here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS of, if you like, the plumbing and mechanisms of how it all works. I'm very grateful to you, Ben, for joining us tonight.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Thanks.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue, Softbank is taking a hard hit after some of its major investments proved to be more risk than reward. We will show you which is which.</p><p>Xerox has its sights on a company more than three times its size -- HP, and why the two come together. In a moment.</p><p>QUEST: Softbank's big bets have soured, and now the costs are coming home to roost. A disastrous three months for the marquee investments in its tech fund. It resulted as the company's first quarterly loss in some 14 years. A $6.5 billion loss for Softbank itself and a $9 billion loss for the so-called Vision Fund upon which it is part.</p><p>[15:20:07]</p><p>QUEST: Softbank's CEO, Masayoshi Son has been well and truly humbled. Now, this is not unfamiliar territory for the man known as the unicorn hunter. Let's look at exactly what he has done and see how it actually occurs.</p><p>So these are the major investments. Softbank and particularly Masayoshi Son went big in the dot com boom. Now, the bubble burst and he lost most of his fortune. That is an out and out failure.</p><p>In 2000, he invested $20 billion in Alibaba. It's now worth over $100 billion. $20 billion to a $100 billion, I think we can claw on that as being a roaring success.</p><p>In 2017, Uber, well, it became the largest shareholder. The stock is at an all-time low, but it is too soon to say that's an out and out failure. Let's put that out there, half and half. You never know what he got in and what he paid in level of investment.</p><p>And the same with Slack looking successful. Now, it's in all-time low, but we don't know what they went in at or what the returns are. So we have to gauge that as being beyond.</p><p>Now, WeWork bungled its IPO. The value of $47 billion dropped to $8 billion. Masa Son admits poor judgment. The poor judgment means, I think, since WeWork could still -- they're going to have to put more money in there. They have put more money in. Let's call that a failure at the moment.</p><p>That's the way it looks. Really only one substantial success and numerous possible and failures and maybes. Clare Sebastian is with me. Clare, not a terribly successful strategy.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: You mean, his investing in these unicorns?</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, I mean, it has served him well in the past. Arguably, Alibaba is one of the best venture capital investments of all time. It's really held up there, but I think the problem now is that he is colliding with the public markets.</p><p>Uber was a big test because that was the first company in the Vision Fund to go public, and it's not gone well. Wall Street's appetite for these loss making companies is waning. Uber has yet to convince the market that it has a path to profitability. And today of course, we have the lockup expiring in the shares and we see them tumbling on that as well. Though perhaps, not as much as expected.</p><p>But WeWork is really the big cautionary tale, Richard, and that's where we see the humility from Masa today.</p><p>QUEST: And putting more money -- he is putting more money in.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right. And he tried to justify that today. Obviously, they had already piled more than $10 billion and they piled another $10 billion in to rescue them. He said, this isn't a rescue. This is a way of buying more shares at a lower price, but I think there's clearly some skepticism around that because this is going to lead to fundamental restructuring.</p><p>QUEST: Besides these marquee names, what else does it do? I mean, these are not doing well. Is the rest of the group doing okay?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right. Well, I mean, they still have a telecoms company in Japan. They own Sprint, ARM Holdings in the U.K. I mean, the rest of the company seems to be, you know, it doesn't have such marquee losses as the Vision Fund.</p><p>But the Vision Fund is super important, Richard. Earlier in the year, when the company was making a profit, it was more than half of that. So this is a big deal for Masa. It's not just his bottom line, it's his reputation as well. And I think that's why he came out with such candor, such humility, but also defiance.</p><p>Today, he said, you know, we continue to forge ahead with the second Vision Fund. He is going to invest in artificial intelligence. He still wants to be, you know, the man with the vision finding the next big thing.</p><p>QUEST: He likes the limelight.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right.</p><p>QUEST: I think back to his arrival at Trump Tower.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: During the transition, what he was promising he was going to do over then.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The mystique.</p><p>QUEST: The mystique. Yes. How is he viewed? Is he viewed as an Oracle who sometimes gets it a little bit wrong? Or is he viewed with something regarding a playboy who can't get it right?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: I feel like there's a shift taking place. It's partly due to the kind of the Zeitgeist that we see on Wall Street that people are taking a second look at these loss making companies. They may not be able to stomach it quite so much anymore.</p><p>And I think, you know, he -- it's just not been going very well recently and because of that, people are looking at him thinking, you know he is clearly infallible, he is clearly fallible.</p><p>QUEST: Uber is the interesting one, because Uber -- the share price goes further down. There are more issues and problems, but at the same time, there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people taking Uber rides every single day. This is not a pets.com. This is a real company, which has shifted the transport behavior of large numbers of people worldwide.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: And Uber could still come back. We had the CEO --</p><p>QUEST: Yes, but, surely what will it do?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, we had the CEO this week just saying you know, they're going to be profitable on an adjusted basis by the end -- by the full year of 2021. Faster in fact than Lyft is promising, but I think the question with Uber and with the likes of WeWork and others is, did Masa Son come in and give them too much money, found too much growth too quickly and get to them to the point where they are now struggling to make the numbers add up.</p><p>[15:25:05]</p><p>QUEST: Good to have you with us. I appreciate it. Thank you. The CEO of the scooter startup, Lime, has told us he is focused on profit despite our rocky investment landscape. Speaking to Hadas Gold at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Brad Bao says this company can still make money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRAD BAO, CEO, LIME: We focus on the beauty of the business right now and also focus on the profitability. So I think, you know, that's the -- what we are obsessed with.</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Now, we have seen some reports about Lime's revenue right now. Some potential investors might be a little bit worried. Do you think that you can continue to tap investors after what seems like a Wall Street backlash against companies such as yours, such as an Uber or Lyft and a WeWork?</p><p>BAO: I think the, you know, the capital chases performance and the performance really is divided in a simple way. Growths and profitability and we're advancing on both hand. That really might make some difference. We are already the leader in the micro mobility space and our revenue has never been seen before in any industry.</p><p>Now, we're growing so fast. In the meantime, that we're also improving our own profitability. We, as a company has been gross margin positive for the entire quarter as a whole company and we anticipate that it will be profitable entirely in 2020.</p><p>GOLD: Now one of the uncontrollable in your business is one of the most important parts, which is the rider. And we've heard some complaints from cities, you know, the people are leaving scooters in places; in Paris, they throw them into the river. How do you control the uncontrollable? How do you help keep a handle on your riders?</p><p>BAO: Well, first of all that, the percentages in terms of those incidents are very small, even though it's a little bit disproportionally reported or being unnoticed, but percentage-wise, it is very small.</p><p>On the other hand, we are working very closely and collaborating with cities that come up with better regulation and education as well.</p><p>First, rider campaigns is something we do to advocate the user to ride safely, but also very importantly, to advocate the user to ride respectfully right to the pedestrians, to the community and to the city as well.</p><p>And technology really helps in here. By using and leveraging the connected IoT devices and sensors, we can help you regulate or incentivize the right behaviors.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Now Xerox is trying some corporate alchemy, but two declining businesses together to try and build a single healthy company. But the takeover of HP, it faces some serious hurdles, not least of which, the whole question of whether it's worthwhile. After the break.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>QUEST: I'm Richard Quest, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. We're going to look at Xerox's bold takeover bid for HP, the company is three times its size. And Ryanair becomes the latest airline to report cracks in its 737 NGs. The Chief Executive of Kenya Airways will give me his take on the western crisis.</p><p>Before all of that, this is CNN, and here, the facts always come first. The first public hearings in the impeachment inquiry are now set to begin next week. The chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee says the U.S. Diplomat Bill Taylor and the State Department official George Kent are to appear on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch will testify next Friday.</p><p>In Mexico, we're learning more about a Mormon community reeling from the brutal murders of nine people on Monday, six of them children. Some members of the family had a longstanding reputation in the community as anti-crime activists, causing friction with the cartels in Mexico according to a former Mexican foreign minister.</p><p>In Britain, election season is now under way. The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson went to the queen at Buckingham Palace to formally dissolve parliament. Ahead of the campaign, the U.K. heads to the polls on December the 12th. And Hong Kong, a lawmaker known for his criticism of ongoing anti-government protests has been attacked with a knife while campaigning in the city.</p><p>Police say Junius Ho's assistant was injured in the attack as well. Both victims are being treated for their injuries. The suspect has been arrested for assault and personal injury.</p><p>And the situation at Schiphol Airport onboard a plane in Amsterdam was a false alarm. According to Air Europa, the Spanish airline says the alarm was activated by mistake and set off protocols for hijacking and kidnapping. Metro police rushed to the scene, passengers and crew were evacuated from the plane, Air Europa says we're all deeply sorry.</p><p>So, now Xerox is considering a takeover of HP. Over to the printer, assuming it's worked, indeed it has. My producers have been printing out the terms of this deal to our HP printer. I rather like an HP printer, I have one at home. But be as it may, let's have a look. It's printed in color and on card, we are lucky here.</p><p>OK, remember that HP is more than three times the size of Xerox, 27 billion to 8 billion. It's a sign for sale or a sale sign. Xerox is selling stakes in parts of its business, it also has a funding commitment from a bank for all of this. And there are sales reports that show why this merger could happen.</p><p>If you look at this sales report, printers and ink are down, and therefore those falling sales. Now that's as it relates to HP. Look at Xerox and you get a copy of it. So, naturally, the copy machine has been seen sales falling as well, too. Consolidating is a way to survive. But the question is, do you survive bearing in mind copy machines down, printers and inks down, do you survive if you put two failing companies together?</p><p>Besides the natural synergies that you will get, cost savings and accounting and the like, what do you think, Paul?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: I think it's going to be a tough sell for shareholders if this deal actually does get proposed. Keep in mind, as you pointed out, Xerox is a much smaller company than Hewlett- Packard right now. HP's market cap is closer to $30 billion today because of the takeover talk spiking it higher.</p><p>[15:35:00]</p><p>So, you know, three to four times more expensive than the Xerox market cap, Xerox is probably going to have to sell assets, get some private equity backers, other Wall Street firms to help finance this deal before they could even think of proposing something to HP that HP might want to accept.</p><p>QUEST: Does it make sense though? I mean, even if you can get -- you know, we all -- I'll say we all need a printer because I'm one of those --</p><p>LA MONICA: Do we?</p><p>QUEST: Sorry?</p><p>LA MONICA: Do we?</p><p>QUEST: Well, I have several printers, do you have a printer?</p><p>LA MONICA: I do, I do as well, but you know, we're not millennials, are we?</p><p>QUEST: I thought you were going to print out something, think of a doc, but my point is that, you know, HP split of course from the solutions company to the printers and the -- and the other part --</p><p>LA MONICA: Right, you have the HP enterprise, business and then Xerox split, too. They have the separate company now known as Conduit; it is more of a document management company. So, they've already shed the higher growth businesses, and these are the two legacy, you know, titans of tech. From --</p><p>QUEST: But I'm just --</p><p>LA MONICA: The 1950s joined Merck--</p><p>QUEST: But I'm just dragging out of my memory if I -- earlier this year or late last year, Hewlett-Packard took a very large fall in its share price. It was in the mid-30s, and it dropped into the high teens. On the back of problems on questions about whether the viability of these companies.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think it is a safe assumption that a deal of these two companies, it's the classic case possibly of two wrongs not necessarily making a right. Unfortunately, if a deal were to go through, you would have to think that one way to sell it to Wall Street is that this is about synergy, it's about cost-cutting.</p><p>And we all know what that usually means. It means job cuts. So, this may not be a great thing for these two proud franchises to merge and then, all of a sudden have to hack away at their workforce.</p><p>QUEST: Xerox used to be a noun, didn't it?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: I'm going to the Xerox machine, you're too young to remember that.</p><p>LA MONICA: No, I am not, I am older than you think. There's a fair amount of grey in this beard. It used to be a verb, I mean, Xerox today -- I mean --</p><p>QUEST: It's a verb you say --</p><p>LA MONICA: Xerox back then was kind of like Google today. I mean --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>LA MONICA: Obviously, it is something that was synonymous --</p><p>QUEST: Will you Xerox me these papers?</p><p>LA MONICA: Should I get you some coffee, sir, while we're at it.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir --</p><p>LA MONICA: Starting an episode of \"Mad Men\" for some reason or not.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you, let's leave that one exactly where it is, don't touch it. When we return, it's been a year since Kenya Airways reached an aviation milestone. First, it had a non-stop flight from Nairobi to New York, remember, we were on it. Now the CEO is back to tell me how it's performed, in a moment.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>QUEST: More headaches for Boeing, Ryanair is the latest airline to find cracks in some of its older 737s. It joined Southwest, GAL and Qantas in pulling the plane's -- there were tests, minute cracks in what's known as the Pickle Fork which attach the wings to the aircraft. The discovery is coming -- part of an FAA investigation into issues with Boeing's next generation of models.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kenya Airways is celebrating the one-year anniversary of the world's first-ever direct flight from Nairobi to New York. Remember it, there we go, on board the inaugural flight last October. A moment of national pride. It was a 15-hour journey from there, Kenya's Airways' CEO Sebastian Mikosz is with me, good to see you, sir, thank you --</p><p>SEBASTIAN MIKOSZ, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, KENYA AIRWAYS: Richard, good to see you --</p><p>QUEST: For joining us. The -- let's talk about the 737s which you don't have. But the problems facing Boeing at the moment, the issues facing them. How beleaguered -- how under the pressure are -- is the company at the moment? As -- from airlines like yourself?</p><p>MIKOSZ: I think under tremendous pressure. We don't have the Maxs, but we have the NGs --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>MIKOSZ: It's actually what you just mentioned. We did the checks, so we performed the maintenance recommendation on doing them. I think they're under --</p><p>QUEST: And there was nothing wrong?</p><p>MIKOSZ: No, there was nothing wrong. We tested -- because they were sent a number of planes with the number of cycles that needed to be checked. So, we did it as recommended by its --</p><p>QUEST: But it's a -- it's not -- obviously it's not good when your brand new planes, the Max is grounded because of safety issues, and now your NG, which is the regular plane is also sort of got questions about it.</p><p>MIKOSZ: Yes, but on the other hand, it's good that they do it. So, I wouldn't discourage them or I wouldn't blame them for that because when there is a doubt, it's better to say it than to check it and ground it if necessary. Even for three airlines is an issue, rather than hide it and play with apparently what happened with the Max where people knew and then somebody wrote the e-mail, I mean, you know, it's all under investigation, so, I have no clue what was the reality. But they are under pressure for sure, yes.</p><p>QUEST: Your flight from Nairobi to New York, it's proved -- you knew it was going to be tough to run that route on a daily basis. Has it proved tougher to make money on it than you thought?</p><p>MIKOSZ: Yes, indeed, it is. I mean, and we were surprised by two things. The pricing problem, so the competition is absolutely overwhelming. But that we knew, the Northern Atlantic and for us, its Southern Atlantic is really one of the most competitive route or regions in terms of airlines, so, that's one.</p><p>But second is we also noticed a much higher seasonality, this is why we changed the frequencies because we started daily, then we shifted to five, and then we're back to daily in high seasons, and that's I think the good pattern.</p><p>QUEST: Are you making money on it?</p><p>MIKOSZ: No, but you know, you don't make money on a route like this in the first 18-24 months, and we've been operating only 12. But we're very happy to say that there were weeks we already break even, much faster than we thought. Overall it's an investment, but it's an investment which is paying, 105 passengers carried, almost 600 flights, 1,000 tons of cargo. So, we're able to elevate the number of passengers we carry through our hub.</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk about Kenya because you're leaving Kenyan Airways at the end of the year.</p><p>MIKOSZ: Yes, correct.</p><p>QUEST: And you're coming first -- quite a bit of bashing in Kenya, one way or another for what's happened with the airline or whatever. There are those who disagree with what you have done. Are you satisfied? Are you leaving, feeling that you've done the job well?</p><p>MIKOSZ: I've done my best. Now, I'll leave it to the others to judge if I've done a good job. I can defend one thing, I think that one of the success that I personally contributed to is to bring the attention of the public to Kenya Airways problems, and to the fact how we compete because we compete as a private carrier with absolutely state-owned, state-protected, non-listed competition all around us. And that makes the situation a little unfair.</p><p>QUEST: I realize you're still there and you've got to go back. But is the -- is the fear now that the government -- that re-nationalizes, interferes or all the private sector gains that might have been made, get lost as Kenya Airways becomes a political football?</p><p>MIKOSZ: But you know, I will reverse the argument. Kenya Airways went into big trouble when it became private, not state-owned. Actually, the state had to bail out Kenya Airways from private decisions. So, I'm -- we are existing as an airline and I have a job because Kenyan taxpayers has subscribed to a sovereign guarantee, without which the airline wouldn't exist.</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>QUEST: So, you've got a sovereign guarantee, you might as well have to sovereign own it. But the problem is, when governments interfere in airlines, we end up with South African Airways.</p><p>MIKOSZ: Or with Ethiopian, which is the largest African carrier and which has been consistently supported and has done a tremendously good job.</p><p>QUEST: But the Ethiopian government recognizing that, have put in place basically a hands-off -- you know, they've determined that Ethiopian Airways is an important part of the Ethiopian economy and therefore needs to be run as a proper -- on proper terms.</p><p>MIKOSZ: But this is what we want to do also in Kenya. This is what I'm trying to convince the public and the government about. The fact that you own an airline doesn't mean that you interfere, because that's a question of political choice. If you take all the region, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, and all our Gulf carriers, they all are state owned, and the level of interference is different. So it then relies in the hands of the politicians if they want to operationally interfere or not.</p><p>But for sure, the model in which we are doesn't allow us to compete on the same playing level field.</p><p>QUEST: What would you do next?</p><p>MIKOSZ: I would love to stay in airline or maybe I'll go as a CNN commentator of airline if you invite me from time to time.</p><p>QUEST: You look after your job and I'll look after mine. Good to have you, there.</p><p>MIKOSZ: Good to have you, thank you, thank you.</p><p>QUEST: And Japan has just wrapped up hosting the Rugby World Cup. Tokyo is now preparing for the 2020 Summer games. I spoke to Akito Tadokoro; Director of Tokyo's Convention and Visitors Bureau, and I asked him the sporting -- giant sporting events, how significant to bring visitors and prestige to the city.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AKITO TADOKORO, DIRECTOR, TOKYO CONVENTION &amp; VISITOR'S BUREAU: It is important in two ways, you know. The -- we wanted to -- a sport to be a culture, OK? And the second point is that Rugby and Olympic is a great opportunity for us to gain more visitors from the U.S. and Europe, yes.</p><p>QUEST: So, is that your target?</p><p>TADOKORO: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: The visitors from the United States and Europe?</p><p>TADOKORO: Yes, we are already welcoming many business from Asia, OK? But we want more from U.S. and Europe, yes. Because these two areas, they, you know, they have potential --</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>TADOKORO: They have potential. But not many business are coming to Tokyo and Japan.</p><p>QUEST: Why -- why do you think so? Is it because it's expensive or they think it's difficult, or it's a long -- why do you think it is?</p><p>TADOKORO: It's simply just because they didn't know that Tokyo and Japan is a fantastic place to visit. But now they discovered, because we had rugby and many rugby fans came to Tokyo and Japan first time and they enjoyed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Think about this, a round trip in economy class from New York to Tokyo costs around $1 billion -- sorry, one ton's worth -- I beg your pardon, one ton's worth of carbon emissions. Eleven thousand scientists are warning air travel is a key factor, making the climate crisis worse and doing so faster than expected. We'll hear after the break.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>QUEST: As the U.S. begins the process of pulling out of the Paris climate accord, the leaders of China and France have signed a pact pledging to stay in. Somewhat strange that you have to sign a pact to stay in an agreement that you're already in. But there you go. The deal includes 195 countries, a common goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degree Celsius.</p><p>President Trump says it puts unfair burdens on American businesses. At the same time, 1,000 scientists around the world warn that climate crisis is accelerating faster than expected. In fact, it's like the loss of tree cover, more meat production and a rise in air travel to show the world is unequivocally in a climate emergency.</p><p>Our next guest Bill Weir probably wouldn't disagree. CNN's chief climate correspondent Bill, good to see you --</p><p>BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Good to see you of course, yes.</p><p>QUEST: On this question, first of all, of Paris, how realistic is it for some states to maintain the limits of Paris if the country itself is out?</p><p>WEIR: Michael Bloomberg, former New York mayor, Jerry Brown, former California governor have tried that question. And they've said they have about 65 percent of the American population trying to meet the Paris targets, 70 percent or so of the U.S. economy. But it's a good question, if the biggest, most powerful country in the history of humanity isn't engaged in what is essentially World War C for climate, what -- where do we go from there?</p><p>QUEST: Well, 11,000 scientists claiming that all these things less tree cover, but particularly air travel --</p><p>WEIR: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: Showing that, that's worsening the situation. But you and I know that air travel is just 2 percent of all carbon emissions. Now, obviously, as an airline correspondent, I might take a different view of it than you do as the climate --</p><p>WEIR: I think about it every time I get on board, absolutely, to think about what the unintended consequences of the choices we make. I think it's less about specifically air travel. It's more that the top 10 percent of earners in this planet burn half of the carbon than the bottom 50 percent is responsible for about 10 percent.</p><p>So, if you're looking to trim that in some way, you know, average American burns about 17 metric tons of carbon a year, a flight from Paris to L.A. is about a ton and a half. And so, you can do the math there. But maybe you don't have a car, maybe you use -- maybe you can offset that somehow.</p><p>QUEST: Do you like offsetting schemes? You know, every offsetting scheme I've seen has always left me wondering -- not if it's a crime, but there's something scammish(ph) about it.</p><p>WEIR: I think it is a road to hell paved with good intention.</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>WEIR: And people are still figuring it out. I was just at a conference on Al Gore's farm in Tennessee which he has triple offsetting the carbon footprint of everybody who came to this as well. And it certainly -- and some have called it -- it's like buying indulgences from the Catholic Church in some ways.</p><p>But those who support it say this is where we have to move it, we have to move markets. There are some -- you know, as you speak of air travel, Imperial College out of London did a study, and one of their radical recommendations was, we should do away with air loyalty mileage program which incentivize people to take extra flights just to keep their status.</p><p>Instead, maybe airlines can incentivize more earth-friendly point system in some way. So, yes, I think, this is -- humanity is making this up as they go along. But as this 11,000 scientists are coming out, every month, there's one that's more alarming than the one before, the technology gets better, the satellites get better, we understand more and as a result, economists are saying we are grossly under-predicting how much this is going to hurt, how much is it going to cost?</p><p>QUEST: Right, so, when? When -- I mean, well, I suppose that you would say, there's -- colleagues in the meteorological department would say and the weather center would say we're already seeing the evidence.</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>WEIR: I think it's long before the waves are lapping on Miami Beach. It's insurance companies that are not going to underwrite certain zip codes --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>WEIR: Which craters property values and tax bases, they're seeing it in the hills of California where insurance premiums are going up. So, this will create economic dust bowls long before, you know, it's the day after tomorrow, apocalyptic --</p><p>QUEST: Will it be the economics --</p><p>WEIR: Moving --</p><p>QUEST: That finally drives this argument for ordinary people? When they suddenly think because it's seemingly we are lemming-like determined to go over the edge.</p><p>WEIR: Oh yes, I mean, it's -- and you know, truth sure said, right, Americans will do the right thing when they've tried everything else. And once they've seen that, wait a minute, budgets are shrinking --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>WEIR: For first responders as fires are quadrupling, we have to do something about this.</p><p>QUEST: We have to say, thank you.</p><p>WEIR: Thank you, Richard --</p><p>QUEST: At least, come -- make sure we come -- and have you discuss this more often.</p><p>WEIR: Any time you ring.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much -- oh, you want to ring, go on. It's first time on this program, you can have one, gently go on.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>There will be complaints from others. We will have a profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, on the show, Sebastian Mikosz; the outgoing CEO of Kenya Airways gave an interesting and full-throated defense of the idea of government owning airlines, particularly in Africa where he says, all the regional ones around him, including the Gulf, of course, Emirates, Etihad, Qatar, Ethiopian, South African, Rwandan, Ugandan, all of them are owned by the government and it's only, of course, Kenya that's in the private sector.</p><p>That's a good argument, and it justifies perhaps, only perhaps as Kenya going back into public ownership. But longer-term of course, it doesn't justify the poor quality of air services across the African content, where it's often easier and quicker to go back up to the Gulf and down again than intra Africa.</p><p>There's a new treaty and agreement on single African skies, let's hope it's more successful than the last one, but honestly, I'm not particularly optimistic. At the end of the day, African skies will only open when the middle class in Africa believe it really is their time to fly.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. No records today, but the bell is ringing, the day is done.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019110601cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFM-DSR1-JB20-G21R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7775\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 6, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Impeachment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.K. Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Junius Ho</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000892</classCode><className>IMPEACHMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjU1Q0FGMTcyM0M5NDQzMkIxQ0Y0NUFFQ0VGRjQ0MjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwQTI5QTZCNDQ4NEM2MUI3NTM4MUYzMDgyRDQwQzE</classCode><className>Contracts Clause</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp;

We appreciate everybody is taking the time to come spend a day with us. My name is Mike Ioanilli, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations for the bank.</p><p>So before we get started, I have just a few housekeeping items.

And please note that we may make forward-looking statements during this event that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In addition, some of our discussion today may include non-GAAP financial measures. Please take a moment to notice the full disclosures in your materials. And if we could put those up on the screen as well, please.</p><p>This event is going to be audio webcast, and the recording will be made available for replay through the bank's website. These sessions are not confidential, and participants should have no expectation of privacy, and your participation implies your consent to record these sessions for use in this webcast.</p><p>Lastly, we're going to have the question-and-answer session at the end of the day so if you don't mind just holding your questions until that time.</p><p>Now I'd like to start today by turning you over to Jim Herbert, our Founder and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT, CHAIRMAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER &amp; FOUNDER, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Glad to have you here. We're going to go through a lot of presentation slides today. The -- let's just get to this one.</p><p>The real issue, which I'd like to ask you to think about throughout the day, is the numbers are interesting, but the numbers are only the result of an extraordinary client service culture that's been built for 30-plus years, coupled with the fact that we're in banking and we have good credit. And so what you're going to hear today repetitively and the thing I would like to ask you to think about as you go through the day is, is this a place I'd like to bank? And if it is, then it's a place that other people would like to bank. And as a result, we've taken a start-up de novo with 8 people and $8 million, one little merger along the way to the 22nd largest bank in America. And the only reason that's happened is client service. We don't have any products that anybody else doesn't have. We don't change very rapidly. We don't go to new markets very often. We're very, very cautious on credit. We are competitive on rates, but we're not crazy competitive. And our standards for credit in terms of covenants and so on are as tight as anybody in the business. The credit record is not an accident. David Lichtman, who's here and will be talking later, joined the bank in 1986. So it's a very steady record for a reason.</p><p>So how did that happen? Disruptive, superior client service. It's as simple as that. If you have a choice of 2 vendors for anything, airlines, pick airlines, and one of them is significantly better than the other and they have the same pricing, what do you do? This is not rocket science stuff.</p><p>We also have chosen good markets, coastal, urban. And in those markets are lots of young and mature professionals, and that's who we bank.</p><p>This is a quote from the 1985 shareholder letter, 1985. I started the bank in 1980, built it up, took to public and sold it in '84. And we learned about jumbo home lending when rates were 20%, 22%. And we learned about Silicon Valley as well. Yes, there was one then. And what we learned most of all, though, was some people wanted service. We knew it, but we didn't appreciate how powerful it was. And as we went through that cycle and sold that bank, we started this one with the fundamental premise that it's all about the client always, every day, every time. Before the client, it's all about the people. It's about some people that are working for you, take very good care of them, create a good environment, empower them, give them an opportunity to grow in their careers and personally. They stay. We have very low turnover, very, very low turnover amongst client-facing front line, a couple of percent a year. And then if they're happy, they take care of their clients. And we don't move people around. There are people that have banked with bankers in this bank for 10, 20, in some cases, 30 years. They don't get to go run the new division or do this. They stay with the clients. They're focused intently. That's so fundamental. We get trial, and then we give them significantly differentiated service, and then the clients are happy, then they send a friend. And that results -- this is a slide that shows the stability of the bankers. 90% of all of our lending has been done by people that have been here -- that are still here, rather. 71% of our lending's done by people that have been here more than 10 years. There are other measures that would show the same thing.</p><p>How good is the service? Twice as good. It's not 5% better, it's not 10% better. It's twice as good. It's actually not the absolute number that matters. It's the delta that matters. It's the differentiation that matters. Where does the business come -- this slide and the 8% and the 2% are the whole day you're going to hear today. The whole day is on this slide. If you don't take anything else out of this room today, take this slide out of the room. 85% of the loans that we made -- growth in loans is with clients or their direct referrals. If you've been banking with a banker for 10 years and you like that banker, who do you refer to them? Your friends that may be questionable credit, I'm sure we don't have any of those, or the best credits.</p><p>Deposits, same thing, we lose 2% per year. The average in the industry is 8%. We've got a guest in the room. We have people that are relatively quantitative. 6% times 5 years compounded difference, how many more new clients does the other person need to get versus how many more new clients do we have to get? What's the cost of finding a new client? What's the cost of booking a new client? What's the AML risk of getting a new client? What's the credit risk of getting a new client? In 5 years, they have to find 35% more new clients than we do. 35%, that's 1/3 of their bank. That's a very big delta. Every new client is a risk. You don't know them. You don't know how they act yet. Spend your time when you get up in the morning taking care of the clients you have, and everything else will work out.</p><p>What's further -- what's powering our growth a bit ahead of normal? A couple of things. Business banking is growing very nicely. We didn't go into this until about 2000. Now it's growing at about 18% this last 3 years on here. Private wealth management is growing very nicely.</p><p>And then we have the millennial strategy. You're going to hear more about each of these today, so I won't belabor this. But it is worth noting that 3 years ago, only 3 years ago, 17% of our borrowers were millennials. And to date, 34% are millennials. That's a double in 3 years.</p><p>The other thing that's happening, not to be overlooked, is that historically, we've had a client base that is, basically, we found them around their home loan, and they were kind of late 30s, now they're kind of early 40s; not always their first loan, by the way, but we got them through the home loan, and then we bank them. And when we hung out the shingle in 1985, most of our clients were 35 years old, roughly mid-30s. There were some who were in their 50s, so they were pretty well situated. There are a lot of good banks then. As a result, our clients now are up into their late 70s -- their late 60s rather, coming into their 70s. Okay? So we have 15, 18 years, I'm counting on a lot of years to go with them, the wealth management. And then on the other end, the millennial strategy has taken us down to the mid- and low 30s, so which you also have powering the growth of the bank. In addition to the things that were back here -- sorry. In addition to this is this. You've got a double-double happening. The millennial clients are just getting there. You'll hear about this in a moment, okay? And the mature clients are in the years where they're living inside their capital and it's accreting up, compounding up.</p><p>Look what this does for you, service, service, service. And in marketing, by the way, our primary -- 90% of our marketing challenges get trial. If you have a particularly good product, your #1 marketing challenge is get trial. After that, it's up to the product, and our product is service.</p><p>Compounded growth rates, bottom line tangible book value per share, it's cash, plus dividends, stock price, not including today, that's the story.</p><p>Let me turn this over to Gaye Erkan, who is the President and has recently joined the Board of the bank. It's a pleasure to have her here on board. Thank you.</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN, PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thanks, Jim. Good morning. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. I would like to talk about what's most important to us at First Republic, our secret sauce and the drivers behind our sustainable organic growth, which I think you'll find to be a unique and compelling story.</p><p>Let's first start with our financial performance. Since our IPO in 2010. We have achieved a 20% average annual growth rate in total assets, 19% in total deposits, an impressive 28% in assets under management and mid-teens growth rate in total revenue. When we look at revenue per employee, we are well above the banking average. In fact, we found it valuable to compare ourselves to other service-focused industries, such as luxury and technology. So our most relevant growth peers may not even be in banking.</p><p>To better understand these results, let's first take a look at who are we. First Republic is a service organization that just happens to be a bank. Service is our product. Therefore, our most important success measures are client satisfaction and household acquisition. Financial metrics, of course, are very important, but these reflect the true drivers of our financial performance. And how have we done? We have outperformed. Our Net Promoter Score, which indicates client satisfaction and loyalty, has been consistently more than double the banking average. Our clients are extremely happy. And we're acquiring households faster than ever. When you look at our historical run rate, we grew consumer households an average of 9%. Take a look at the last 3 years. The growth rate of households has nearly doubled. In short, we are keeping our existing clients happy, and we're acquiring new households at an increasing pace. In addition to being a bank with a regulatory moat, these results speak to the differentiated service moat that First Republic has created by simply taking great care of our clients one relationship at a time.</p><p>Now let's move on to what are the keys to our continued success? Or, simply, how do we continue to make this happen? First and foremost, culture. Our culture is grounded on extraordinary client service delivered by empowered, stable, trusted advisers with great accuracy and speeds and incredibly coordinated teamwork. And service excellence is no small thing at First Republic. It is our purpose of existence.</p><p>We achieve it by delivering value to our clients in 3 dimensions. First, trust, peace of mind, keeping our bank safe and sound at all times, giving the best advice to our clients, putting them first always. Second, time, our clients' most precious, most important currency. We enable quick decisions. We empower our trusted advisers to move forward, move fast for their clients. And third, experience. We have turned commoditized banking business into highly personalized relationships customized to each and every relationship based on their single point of contact. That is the key to the value delivery, one quarterback for the relationships, one relationship manager per client. The stability, as Jim mentioned, the stability of the relationship managers translates to the stability and happiness of the client relationship. And over the years, we have expanded the services we provide as well as the delivery channel. But the model has remained constant. Each client has their go-to person. There's Fatema, there's Jeff, there is Samir, who deliver the entire First Republic to them and customize their financial journey. After all, First Republic is a collection of individual-client relationship.</p><p>The model works. The question is, how do we scale it? Or how do we continue to scale it? Through empowerment. We empower our trusted advisers through knowledge that enhances their service. Our Eagle Intelligence team, our in-house analytics team, provides timely customized alerts and dashboards to our trusted advisers to help them prioritize their prospect or client outreach.</p><p>We also empower their service teams, our support teams by removing bottlenecks, by streamlining processes, everything we do within our continuous process improvements. And you'll have a chance to hear more about these initiatives later today. The key is, at First Republic, technology is here to empower our proven high touch service. It does not replace it.</p><p>It is this commitment to service excellence that has enabled us to more than double our assets over the past 5 years. Not through acquisitions, not through chasing new markets, simplify by doing more of what we do best, taking great care of our clients one relationship at a time. And that type of relationship banking, as you all know, allow us a ton of value through service quality. Client knowledge allows us to serve our clients better. It enables us to make safe credit decisions. And we better manage risk for our clients. Because we know our clients' typical banking activities, we can identify unusual trends faster. And we also benefit from advantaged funding. What do I mean with that? Of course, deposits. Our bank is largely deposit funded. Because of these relationships, when a client pays down their loan, what do they do? They increase their liquidity and their deposits with their trusted adviser. And our clients bank with us not for a rate, they choose First Republic because of their human trusted adviser and our superior service, which leads us to organic, lower cost, sticky diversified funding, which enables us to grow and grow safely.</p><p>Is this growth sustainable? A definite yes, and it compounds. I'll explain why. The equation is simple. First, happy clients stay with us. We have only 2% attrition compared to banking sector at 8%. Other banks are filling a much bigger hole with new clients. We just keep our clients happy. Second, happy clients deepen their relationships, and they refer others. 75% of our growth comes from within, 75%. We wake up, we take care of our clients, and we take care their referrals, this is how First Republic grows. One happy client relationship can create a large referral network. In fact, over the past 5 years, our best client promoters have referred us more than 80 relationships each.</p><p>In case you're wondering how is that possible, let me share an example. It all starts with one satisfied client. We deepen our relationships with the clients, we've followed them to their family, their friends and neighbors, their kids' school, the business, accountants and lawyers and, of course, the nonprofits that are close to their heart. And as soon as we touch another individual, the cycle repeats. It is astounding where one happy client can take us.</p><p>That's why the model is simple, and it compounds. The more clients we have, the more referrals we get as we grow as long as we continue on superior service because that superior service is not just a soft metric. With a Net Promoter Score more than double the banking sector, it leads to real performance. Amongst the publicly traded top 25 banks, we are #22 in total assets. And our service has propelled us to #1 in asset growth, #1 in credit quality, #1 in revenue growth, #1 in tangible book value per share and #1 in total shareholder return. And here we are after 34 years of organic growth in mid-teens at $111 billion of total assets and $140 billion assets under management.</p><p>What's most exciting is that in our current footprint, we still have less than 5% market share, plenty of room to grow. With amazing culture, exceptional people, happy clients, we have everything we need to be successful as long as we continue to focus on service excellence, delivered one client at a time and as long as we continue to work hard and stay humble.</p><p>Thank you very much. And with that -- thank you, I would like to invite our Chief Operating Officer, Jason Bender, to the stage, please. Thanks.</p><p>JASON C. BENDER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thank you, Gaye. Thank you, Jim.</p><p>I'd like to take a few minutes this morning just to elaborate on a couple of really key elements to our business model. Many of you have heard us speak to these points over time, but we thought a good way to build the foundation for the day is really to dig in on a couple of these key points. So I'm going to spend a few minutes this morning talking about the markets that First Republic is in and the opportunities contained therein as well as a deeper dive into Net Promoter score and exactly sort of unpack that NPS concept for us.</p><p>So first of all, our markets, extraordinary opportunity. Gaye touched at this a bit, and we'll dig in a bit more here. But many of you know that we are primarily in coastal markets, New York and Boston on the East Coast, San Francisco and Los Angeles on the West Coast and then a handful of ancillary markets including San Diego, Portland, Oregon, Palm Beach, Florida and our newest Jackson, Wyoming. The predominance of our business, however, is in the 4 primary markets that I just mentioned, New York, Boston, L.A. and San Francisco.</p><p>A number of years ago, we began tracking and developed an index along with Rosen Consulting to track the economic activity and health of our markets using publicly available information that came out and was published at least quarterly or monthly. Primary reason for that, it replicates regional GDP, but that's only available on a very lagged basis and wasn't very useful for us to try to track those markets real time. So using this particular index, we can see that our markets in aggregate tend to lead the rest of the U.S. in terms of economic health and activity. Importantly, you can see the gray shaded area here, the great recession. We tend to lag during periods of downturn, and we tend to lead during periods of upturn. We outperformed the U.S. as a whole by 34% since we started doing this before the recession in '05. And importantly, if you look at the 4 primary markets that I just mentioned, each one of those is either at the U.S. average or above substantially. Of course, in the last couple of years, San Francisco and New York have done particularly well, but all 4 are at or above.</p><p>This is a quick snapshot of First Republic and where we are in those markets. You can see, obviously, San Francisco, which is our home market, where the bank was founded in 1985, obviously, more investment there. Over the years, we've had longer to grow. That represents about 40% to 45% of our business across virtually all of these dimensions. Southern California came next shortly after we founded in 1985, opened branches in Southern California. This particular road takes a look at Los Angeles and San Diego combined. Again, that's about 20 -- roughly 20% of our business; New York, another 20%. Boston, which is our most recent market was founded in 2006. We're already at about 15% or so in Boston. Probably the most important thing on this slide, though, as far as I know is really the growth numbers over on the right-hand side. There's no one market that is outperforming another. We have 4 very well-diversified pistons to this engine. We're proud of the results. But importantly, I think that makes for stronger and more stable base for us.</p><p>If we dig a little bit into the concept of high net worth households, many of you know that this is a study that we've done since 2003 in conjunction with Capgemini. Importantly, high net worth households are a proxy for the type of client that we like to bank. But it's not the only client that we bank. In fact, high net worth households represent less than 50% of our client base. And in fact, that's declined a bit as we build out our next-generation strategy, which you'll hear more about momentarily. However, it's still a great segment and one that we do focus on quite a bit.</p><p>The important piece to this slide is really the relation between the 2 columns. The left-hand side shows in our markets, what percentage do our markets comprised of the total U.S. population. So 21% of all U.S. households reside in the markets that we operate in. However, almost 59% or 59% of high net worth households reside in those same markets. We have a disproportionate share of high net worth households in the markets that we operate in, and those households represent prospective clients to us.</p><p>Now what's also interesting is to note that over time, that share has increased. So back in 2003 when we first started doing this study, our markets comprised 46% of all high net worth households. So it's grown by almost 30% over the years that we've conducted the study. What's that mean? That means that the markets that First Republic are in are either producing or attracting high net worth households faster than the rest of the U.S. by a substantial margin. We'd much rather operate in healthy, vibrant markets that are attracting talent than vice versa.</p><p>This takes a look at the raw numbers of high net worth households in those markets. Again, these are not clients that we bank. These are all high net worth households in these markets. But again, as you can see, the green reflects the high net worth households in our markets, the gray, the rest of the U.S. Since we started doing this study, high net worth households have grown at twice the rate in our markets as compared to the rest of the U.S.</p><p>This slide kind of puts together those concepts into one place. What you have across the X axis is the growth rate of high net worth households in both our markets as well as others. The light gray reflects other U.S. cities. The dark gray reflects global markets. The Y axis shows the density of high net worth households in those markets. So the markets that are up and to the right are the ones that are growing quickly and are densely populated, relatively speaking, in high net worth households. As you can see, the First Republic markets are really clustered in the upper right. So when we talk about carefully selecting the markets that we're in, that is a very deliberate part of our strategy, and it always has been. We really are angling for those markets that are resilient and represent the best opportunities for banking in the U.S.</p><p>Now the other interesting aspect of this slide is the size of the bubble on the chart. That represents the relative size in terms of total high net worth households. Just gives you a sense for how many prospective clients reside in those markets. It gets interesting when you start to compare some of them. So New York alone, in terms of the number of prospective clients for First Republic, is equivalent to the number of high net worth households in all of China or all of Germany. Even Boston, which is a smaller city, obviously, has more high net worth households than Norway or Hong Kong. So the point is not to denigrate other markets, obviously, but the point is to show you just how much opportunity exists in the markets that we're in today. So when we talk about not really needing to go to another big, major new market, that's why. And it's really summed up when you look at the market share.</p><p>Now Gaye referenced this in her remarks very well. This looks at just high net worth households. It's true across other dimensions as well. This shows our market share of high net worth households since 2003, when we first started tracking this. We're delighted to see that we've gone from 3% to a little over 4% over that time period. In markets that are rapidly growing, the denominator is growing almost as fast as the numerator. But what we're really excited about is the fact that 96% of the high net worth households in the markets that we're in today don't yet bank with First Republic.</p><p>So when people ask us, do you have to go to a new market in order to gain more opportunity to keep this growth rate up? The answer is absolutely not. There's so much opportunity in the markets that we're in right now. We could keep doing this for years and years. And that's really a strength, I think, and an important part of the business model.</p><p>Let's jump to Net Promoter Score for a moment. We talk a lot about client service. You've heard that already in the first two sets of remarks today. Net Promoter Score for us is just a measure. It's not the end thing that we're after. What we're really after is highly differentiated client service. Net Promoter Score is a way for us to measure that and to monitor that. It's interesting. We came to Net Promoter Score, and it's -- that's a score and a system and a framework that's used by a lot of companies, not just in banking, as many of you know. But we came to that a little bit backwards from most companies. Many companies stumble on Net Promoter score when they have a client service problem that they want to address, and they want to start measuring it and they want to start solving that problem. We came at NPS in order to try to quantify, first, for ourselves and then for others, how is our client service compared to others. Intuitively, we felt it was pretty good. Our growth rate certainly would suggest that it was good. But NPS for us gave us a way to benchmark against others and to really monitor how that service is going. So if there's one thing that we're delighted about when it comes to NPS, it's the stability of that score and the relative outperformance to the banking sector. Our competition.</p><p>For those of you who need a very quick refresher on Net Promoter score, it's pretty simple. It's an answer to one single survey question. How likely are you to recommend First Republic, or whatever company you're measuring, to a friend or colleague? The responses are graded from 0 to 10. If you answer a 9 or 10, meaning most likely to recommend, you're considered a promoter. Now note, that's not 5 and above, that's 9 or 10. So to be a promoter, you have to be particularly passionate about the company that you're promoting. 7 or 8 are considered passives. \"My bank does what it needed to do.\" If you're a 6 or below, you're a detractor. So a lot of people don't realize, it's a very skewed score. And this is the way it's graded across all industries. This is the standard approach to NPS. So net Promoter score is simply the percentage of respondents that are promoters minus the percentage that are detractors, giving you a Net Promoter Score. Anything over 50 is considered excellent. And yes, you can have a negative Net Promoter Score if you have more customers saying bad things about you than good things.</p><p>You've seen this slide already. We included it simply as an anchor point. It's important. For us, we have typically been in the low-70s, bank overall. And for clients that consider us their lead bank, we're in the 80s. But most importantly is how we stack relative to our competition. And again, 2x the rest of the banking industry, something we're proud of. But also, it's an important part of our business model. And so when Gaye and Jim talk about how the #1 focus is that client service proposition, that's what it's all about. It's trying to maintain that relative difference.</p><p>Now we ask other questions in our own Net Promoter Score survey. In fact, when we do this once a year, we ask a lot of questions, and we get great responses. And it allows us to unpack that Net Promoter Score a bit more. And so what this slide is showing here is actually the respondents to about 4,000-or-so written in narrative comments from our clients. When asked, what is it about First Republic that caused you to give the score that you did, the 9s and the 10s for promoters and the rest for passives, detractors. And what's interesting about this is that when you start to group these in themes, the top 3 are all about service and experience. In fact, many of them just go so far as to say, it's about extraordinary service. 61%, almost 2/3, in fact, are commenting on that. And then another 20% to 30% are elaborating, saying, \"You make me feel special. You provide something unique that I can't get other places.\" It's not until you get all the way down to #4 that people even start talking about rates. Now we're competitive on rates when we need to be, but that's not why our clients are with us. They're with us for the first 3 things. And in fact, if you jump down to the bottom 2, you'll see they pick up the themes of service yet again.</p><p>Importantly -- let me back up. One more thing. The other aspect of NPS is that we really use it not just as a static metric. We also use it actively to engage with our clients. And so even when the survey is underway once a year, we're using that information, real-time, to respond. So if we do, for instance, get a detractor, we have a banker on the phone with that client immediately as long as they've said that it's okay. It is an anonymous survey. But we give them the option, especially the detractors, if they're having an issue, to have somebody contact them. And so we learn a great deal even as we're conducting the survey. And we unpack it further and we turn that into action items that we focus on throughout the rest of the year. So this is a very -- it's an active and engaged study for us. It's not just a static metric behind the scenes.</p><p>So let me end with another example of the power of this client service model. Now we've talked some about high net worth. We've talked about other examples. This one is a bit of a case study, and it looks at deposits. Looks at deposit clients, and it looks at our ability to build deposits in a market that we've been in for a very long time. Now this is all based on public information from the FDIC. So what we're taking a look at here is a 25-year snapshot of First Republic's performance in the San Francisco deposit market. So back in '94, obviously, we had less than $1 billion of deposits. We've grown that very nicely and up into the right, $40 billion to date. That equates to a 20% compounded annual growth rate in San Francisco deposits.</p><p>Now the San Francisco market is a healthy market. It's growing too, deposits overall in that market have grown at 7%. But we've outrun the market by 3x. Now that's interesting, and you'll see a lot of slides that are up and to the right today. But for me, what's really compelling, especially when we're talking about differentiated service and the power of referrals, and the power of keeping your clients happy is, again, how we have performed relative to others over that same time frame.</p><p>It's a little bit of an eye chart, but what you see here are the top 30 banks in San Francisco by market share -- deposit market share. On the left, 1994, 25 years ago, we were ranked #26. We had 0.5% market share. And what's happened relative to that over the following 25 years today, 2019, we're now #3 at 10%, just behind Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Now most of you know, San Francisco is a very well banked market. Wells Fargo and BofA, both headquartered there for many of these years, and they have been in the top 1 and 2 spot for market share in every single year of this study, 25 years. And we jumped from 26 to right behind them, #3, today, with very little movement in the rest of the chart. So if there's one thing that really sort of drives home the power of keeping your clients happy, growing with them, the power of doing that within a defined marketplace where people talk to one another and your reputation can build, this to me is a perfect example of that.</p><p>So that's what I've got for markets and NPS this morning. I'm sure you'll be hearing more about that as we roll through the day. I think at this point now, we're going to take a very brief pause and show you a couple of videos just to kind of liven things up a little bit. Thank you very much.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>MICHAEL D. SELFRIDGE, SENIOR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF BANKING OFFICER, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: My name is Mike Selfridge. I am the Chief Banking Officer at First Republic Bank. It is my pleasure to present the business banking segment for you today. And joining me on stage, I'd like to make a few introductions: Chris Coleman, Chris is the Head of Business Banking; Jeffrey Bruce, who is our Deputy Regional Managing Director here in New York City on the relationship management side; and Scott Aleali, who is our Managing Director of Private Equity Finance, also here in New York City.</p><p>So we'd like to talk a little bit about the business bank, its strategy, where it's come and then the growth opportunities looking forward. And with -- Jeff will give a little perspective on the approach to business banking and how it leads from the personal to the business side, as Gaye had touched on. And then with Scott, we'd like to take a little bit of a deeper dive into the capital call lending opportunities for venture capital and private equity.</p><p>Jim alluded to the start of the business bank. The concept started in 1999. And if you were to talk to one of our promoting satisfied clients, they were asking us, \"Is it possible you could do what you're doing for me on the personal side for the business that I own or influence?\" And that sets the foundation for the strategy of the business bank in 1999. I think we did our first loan in 2000, and not a lot has changed since, except the numbers. So when you look at First Republic -- why First Republic for the business bank? And I think of 3 key competitive advantages amongst many as it relates to other financial institutions. The first is unified, cohesive approach. So we don't silo the business bank over here and the personal banking relationship over here and the wealth manager over here. It's unified. So collectively, Jeff and Scott and maybe somebody on private wealth management, probably cohabitate in the same office, same floor. And the compensation is also structured such that they're better off working together in pursuit of what's most important. That's the client. So the unified holistic approach.</p><p>The stability of banker and business banker that Jim talked about. And I think of that as being not segmented. So if Scott is that single point of contact for a business, he is such for life. We don't segment like other business banks that we see with our competitors, into the small business bank and the medium business bank and the large corporate business bank. So that drives stability of relationship. And that's not dissimilar to the model of First Republic. And third, I would call it a relentless focus. So our bankers' specialized. They're knowledgeable in about 8 segments that we serve in our markets with deep opportunities. Focus on credit, focus on client, focus on relationship. And as we go through the credit track record of the business bank, you'll see that, that focus on quality credit, allows our bankers to spend less time with a troubled situation, more time with the client.</p><p>So knowledgeable bankers, strong credit, deep expertise, holistic approach and you put that together and you look at what the business bank can drive for the overall franchise, it's quite significant. So for example, Chris will touch on some of the numbers that we've been able to generate over the last 19, 20 years. Today, over half of the deposit franchise comes through the business bank at an average cost of business banking deposits of 41 basis points. That compares to about 65 basis points for the average cost of deposits of the entire First Republic Bank for the quarter ended September 30.</p><p>For every dollar that we put out in lending on the business bank, we get about $4.3 back in deposits. A great contributor to the deposit franchise and the diversification of that deposit franchise. And lastly, strong loan growth, which comes in at an average loan yield as of last quarter of about 4.38%.</p><p>And so I'd like to hand it over to Chris Coleman, I mentioned he's the Head of Business Banking, to talk about our exceptional results.</p><p>CHRIS COLEMAN, HEAD OF BUSINESS BANKING, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Great. Thank you, Mike. That 4:1 ratio has been around as long as I've been around. That deposit-to-loan ratio. And that -- it runs about 12 years. I joined 12 years ago.</p><p>To dive into the numbers just a little bit, first, on the deposit side. Here you see a compounded annual growth rate in high 20s, low 30s. Most of that is checking, and as Mike mentioned, it's a little over half of the bank's overall deposits. And then we have a similar growth rate in the lending side for business loans, hovering right around 30% since 2010. We watch that top part of the graph very carefully. That is loan commitments, we view as a leading indicator, a key indicator for more deposits and more private banking. Once you book the loan, the deposit and operating accounts come over in a 3- or 4-month period, typically. And then we're off to the races in talking to not just senior members of the management team, but also the associates and all employees within the firm about private banking opportunities.</p><p>So the question we get a lot of times, what is driving this growth? It is that unified, integrated delivery model to the client. So as Mike mentioned, we co-mingle and joint call with the wealth advisers, the business banker, the preferred bankers, bringing the entire bank to the client. That's a critical success factor. We never know in talking to a prospect whether the mortgage is going to be the hot topic, a student loan refinance actually for their son or daughter, or for the associates within the firm. So we always want to be prepared for that. And we employ a lot of tactics and strategies from the way we pay people to literally having them co-mingle and sit with one another, so as to form one team and stay client-centric. That's critical.</p><p>The other critical feature is the industry verticals that we focus on. Half a dozen verticals primarily in the professional service realm, doctors, lawyers, accountants and then private equity and venture capital and nonprofits. Those are some of the leading sectors that we work on. That does a couple of things for us. Importantly, by focusing on an industry, one gets much more marketing efficiency. The more you understand that industry and reflect that to the client, the more they're going to give you referrals as well as their own follow-on business. So that's -- it's very efficient from that standpoint.</p><p>In equal measure, when focused as an industry expert, you're more likely to detect headwinds for that sector. And the earlier we detect headwinds, the more time we have to make adjustments and work with the borrower through any speed bumps that they may be encountering. So that's critical for us. It also leads to better cash management solutions and more innovative financing in general.</p><p>Speaking of headwinds, here's the credit history in a snapshot. Over $50 billion in originations of business lending. 18 basis points in net charge-offs over those 19 years, so less than 1 basis point per year. A major risk mitigant, in addition to the industry expertise of our business bankers, comes with actually having a broad relationship with the client. So if we are banking, not only the firm but also individuals within the firm, and we may have that mortgage or we may be managing their investments, it's much more likely they reciprocate, consider it a full partnership. And they're going to be that much more transparent about any challenges they are encountering. So that's been a major risk mitigant for us as well.</p><p>And then finally, to give you even a little better color on how these relationships evolve over time and become multidimensional, let me introduce Jeff Bruce, Managing Director for -- here in New York. Jeff?</p><p>JEFFREY BRUCE, DEPUTY REGIONAL MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR NEW YORK REGION, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thanks, Chris. So as Chris said, I'm a Senior Relationship Manager here in New York. I've been with the bank for 15 years. And so I'm going to walk through this, which is a particularly busy slide, but what it is designed to do is it allowed -- to allow you to understand how a typical relationship might evolve at First Republic.</p><p>So it begins 20 years ago at another bank where I was working. I had a relationship with 2 senior private equity individuals, and I was doing banking and mortgage lending for them. I came to First Republic, and I moved them over as clients. And we began to work with them in the same avenues: deposits and mortgages. And this is where the client service element really lays the groundwork. After a couple of years, they were very pleased with the service level they were getting. And when there was an opportunity for us to step in and think about doing business banking, I was able to leverage that service level I had given them to introduce a business banker like Scott.</p><p>So we arrived, and we opened up deposit accounts for them. They were moving their firm to a new location. We did the standby letter of credit. They needed to build out office space. We offered them a term loan. Then they said, \"Well, we're going to have some expenses as we build out our firm and they're not going to be even, even though we got a nice regular management fee stream.\" So we offered them a line of credit on the management company. And that continued to evolve to different fund credits as well.</p><p>With operating accounts, were also an opportunity for us. Not only for the balances, but we realized this is a company or firm that was doing large deals abroad. And we realized they were doing large FX transactions, and we have the capability to do that. So we stepped in and demonstrated to them how we could add using the team to provide both spot transactions on very large scale in very limited time frames, but also forwards and other solutions for them as they thought about their portfolio companies abroad. That success piggybacked and allowed us to come in and talk about their 401(k). They have started with the firm and set up a pretty small program. And we were able to explain to them how we had better opportunities and offerings for them, but would also partner to educate their employee base. So we won that business.</p><p>Finally, I want to share with you, really, which is kind of a hybrid product between business banking and individual banking. We came in and we did a professional loan program for them. What is that? That is allowing the employees to borrow from First Republic in order to meet their funding obligations to the firm. Now this is a fantastic opportunity. Why? Well, every one of those employees who wants a loan from us, we ask to open up a checking account. They need to share with us their balance sheet and income statement so that we can assess their creditworthiness.</p><p>I'm looking at a road map of the whole financial picture. So from there, not only do we get a number of employees, now grown to 16, who are now clients, but it allows us to have a leg up on providing other financial services to those individuals. Mortgages; investment management; financial planning, if they want to go even deeper than what I can do in just a sit-down meeting; and finally, even trust services. So that evolution turns a starting relationship with 2 principles into, today, over $100 million asset relationship composed of both individual opportunities and business banking opportunities.</p><p>And so this is the time I'm going to hand it over to Scott to talk a little bit more about his opportunities in what he provides in capital call lines.</p><p>SCOTT ALEALI, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF PRIVATE EQUITY FINANCE, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. I'm Scott Aleali. I lead our Private Equity Financial Assets here in New York. I've been with First Republic for 2.5 years and have been in the funds finance business since 2011.</p><p>So the plan is we're going to continue growing in private equity. I'm excited about it. I know how you guys are excited about it as well. So some of the trends that are happening in private equity. The firms are raising bigger funds, and they're raising them faster than they have in the past. They're also expanding out their platforms. You look at what's happening in private debt markets. Firms are going out, they're raising new platforms, raising new -- and executing on new strategy, and they're doing it well. These larger firms, they have ambitious people. Those people are spinning out, and they're creating new firms. They're raising a first fund and they're raising them successfully.</p><p>When you look at the amount of uncalled capital that's in the industry today, it's over $2 trillion. That and the growth of the private markets over the last few years sounds like a really big number, but it really only represents less than 5% of the entire world market cap. It means private equity is still a young asset class and has a ton of room to grow.</p><p>So with all of this uncalled capital in the market, what does that mean for us? It means demand for capital call lines of credit secured by those unfunded commitments. If you look back 5 or so years ago, these facilities were not nearly as popular as they are today. They were used as a simple cash management tool, a fund that closes on an investment, calls capital from their investors, then they pay it back, they revolve that through the life cycle of the fund. Now firms are using those facilities much more strategically. Examples of that are ways to mitigate their J curve of their fund, which you also get a nice IRR boost. There's been a lot of press around how those funds are using these facilities both good, both bad.</p><p>We're very disciplined in our approach. So the majority of our portfolio is in the shorter-term bucket. We'll look case-by-case on letting our clients use lines to establish some of those trends they want to establish in terms of J curve management and enhancement to IRR.</p><p>When you look at the middle market U.S. private equity, that's our sweet spot. There's about $300 billion in credit commitments. First Republic has $16 billion of those credit commitments. And with only 6% of our balance sheet and loans outstanding and capital call lines, it gives us a healthy balance sheet and a lot of run rates to continue to grow.</p><p>The capital call line is a lead product in this sector. So when a firm goes out, they raise the fund. This is on the forefront of their mind. But we really view it as an opportunity to showcase all the other things that we can do for a firm. The conversation then goes from just the capital call line product to ways that we can work with the firm's management company, providing them short-term working capital or growth capital secured by management fees. It's our professional loan program where we help partners and their employees finance their commitments to funds. And as the conversation starts drifting in that direction, you start talking more about our private banking capabilities. The way it's presented is presented as a team, with Jeff and myself, going and seeing a client, in that example, delivering the entire bank to the firm. The bank is not -- or the firm is not directed to different departments. It is all done through one cohesive team. This approach leads to strong cross-sell across loans, cash management, foreign exchange, private banking and wealth management.</p><p>So it's super competitive out there. In the funds business, there's literally 60 banks that are active or at least trying to be active in the space. So why First Republic? I'll really put it in 3 different buckets. The first, reputation and commitment to the sector. We've been in this business for 20 years. When I'm on the front line, looking to get something done, I'm working with credit members who have 20 years of experience. And so that means we're able to execute quickly, get back to our clients quickly and our clients value that.</p><p>The second is our platform. I mentioned the ability to bring the personal and the commercial solutions to our clients within one team that stays with that relationship in perpetuity. That last point is super important in this sector. Private equity professionals are long-term thinkers. So when they make an investment in a portfolio company, they're in that portfolio company for several years. When they're looking at a capital call line provider, they're looking at the broader relationship. They're looking at who the team is, is looking at the stability of the team, and they like that their team is not going to turn over.</p><p>And then last and not least, and I'll consider it the most important, is the people. The way we have our teams set up, every person that's inter-facing with our client is an expert in our clients' industry. So our foreign exchange professionals, our cash management professionals, our private bankers, our business bankers, they all speak the same language as our clients. And that makes it easier for our clients to do business with us. And when we make it easy, they want to do more business with us.</p><p>So the consistent theme here is just delivering a superior experience to our clients. It'll lead to organic growth within our existing portfolio and lead to opportunities to work with new firms.</p><p>I'm going to pass it back to Mike to talk a little bit about the safety, soundness and the economics on these loans that we're originating.</p><p>MICHAEL D. SELFRIDGE: Great. Thank you, Scott. The business bank, overall, I don't know if we mentioned this, it's about 13% of the total loan portfolio of First Republic Bank. The capital call lending is about 6% overall. And if you look at our credit track record, as Scott mentioned, we've been in this business for 19 years. We've seen the number of economic cycles. We have had 0 credit losses. I should note these are loans to the fund backed by the limited partners, which tend to be pension funds, endowments, maybe some of your firms in this room might be invested in some of these venture capital and private equity firms, short-term and outstanding credit quality. But it leads really to what Scott and Jeff talked about, the ability to serve the individual and the firm. And that's what we get up and do every day at First Republic.</p><p>Our second biggest vertical in business banking is our nonprofit. Segment. And so I'm going to have Chris just briefly talk about that, and then we'll close it up.</p><p>CHRIS COLEMAN: Great. Thank you again, Mike. So in our nonprofit sector, it's actually after private equity and venture capital, the second largest industry segment that we're doing lending in. And this comes to us very organically. The bank has always worked with nonprofits, always worked with all elements of our communities around the country. And part of that or the way that really got started was very organically with happy private banking clients referring us to the organization where they may be on the Board. That is the Board of local museum or a school where their kids attend. And that's how we first got into the business.</p><p>After the recession and in 2009 and '10, this is when our nonprofit work really elevated itself and started taking off. And that was principally because we found a way to streamline the tax-exempt financing that so many nonprofits were trying to get and so many banks were in a position where they could not do that kind of lending. So that's when we very much took off. And here you see 3,500 clients today in the nonprofit sector. It cuts across all sectors of the nonprofit arena. Museums, performing arts, schools and social service organizations, which by unit count, or number of clients, is more than half of our nonprofit sector.</p><p>It's a sector that resonates well with us. I've come to see that our colleagues relate to it very well. If there's one criteria, we hire people for, it's service and care. And I think our nonprofit clients feel that, and in turn, our colleagues relate to it well.</p><p>To give you yet another aspect or facet of our community commitment, let me turn it back to Mike to close this out.</p><p>MICHAEL D. SELFRIDGE: Thank you, Chris. Just to leave you with one last thought. The business bank has done many things for us. You know our values. We live and breathe and walk the values. Do the right thing, is core to us, that means many things. But the nonprofit clients that we have has given us an extraordinary opportunity to serve. And when you think of service, being the fundamental differentiator, social responsibility is just as important to us. And if I could leave you with a thought, it's not that we just serve one part of a community, we serve the entire community. And with that, these nonprofits allow us to serve. We give employees, every employee at First Republic, 2 paid days of vacation to volunteer. Many of them volunteer to those nonprofits that Chris talked about. Almost 13,000 hours of volunteerism by First Republic employees, year-to-date. And that's up quite significantly as compared to the same time last year, and over 450 nonprofits to which we've given the philanthropy or sponsorship to. So it, again, is very important to us. And again, social governance and social responsibility is important to us.</p><p>So with that, I would like to thank you and thank -- gentlemen, thank you very much. Introducing our next-generation of clients, I'm going to hand this over to Patrick Macken.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Hey, Mike, can I just have one -- just one quick moment.</p><p>Jeff, you've been with the bank for how long, 15?</p><p>JEFFREY BRUCE: 15 years.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Have you transferred any of your clients to anyone else?</p><p>JEFFREY BRUCE: No. I've added many members to my team because, obviously, my client base has grown dramatically, but they all still deal with me and the folks around me.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: And when you came in, you came in as a Managing Director, basically, a relationship manager. Now you're Deputy of New York. But you're still doing all the clients.</p><p>JEFFREY BRUCE: I still spend 70%, 75% of my time working with clients, correct.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: The stability -- This is obviously just making this point. The stability factor is a big difference. Think about other institutions and whether they promote people away from clients or move them up or transfer. We do not. We have people that have the same clients today they have 30 years ago.</p><p>MICHAEL D. SELFRIDGE: Thank you. So I'd like to introduce Patrick Macken, James Herbert and Aaron Fitzsimmons to talk about the next generation of First Republic clients.</p><p>JAMES HERBERT, CO-HEAD OF EAGLE LENDING, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thank you very much. As you've heard, the bank has a big emphasis on how do we attract the next generation of clients. We're going to talk today about 2 of the primary products that we view -- that we use to do this. Importantly, what I think you'll hear is nothing new, hopefully: that we are attracting the same great clients using the same service with the same focus on credit and the same focus on building organically. So I'm going to pass it off to Erin Fitzsimmons to talk about the first product.</p><p>ERIN FITZSIMMONS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thanks, James. As James mentioned, one of the ways that we're trying to attract the next generation of clients to the bank is through the Professional Loan Program. The Professional Loan Program is a customized lending solutions for partners and employees of professional service, private equity and venture capital firms to make their individual required commitment. A few years ago, a group of clients approached the bank, and they were looking for a lending solution to meet their individual needs. We realized quickly that we could put together a structured financial solutions for them, which we now call the Professional Loan Program or PLP.</p><p>As we started to develop this product more, we realized that the partners in the more senior level employees of these firms were already being very well served. Who wasn't being addressed were the non-partners and the rest of the employees of these firms, and the Professional Loan Program seemed to be the perfect fit for this sector.</p><p>Fast forward a few years later, present day, the non-partner that came to us came to the bank through a Professional Loan Program has now just been promoted partner. And they have gone back to the firm and encouraged the rest of their partners to engage with us so we could provide a solution for them as well. We can now see the organic growth of not just the client following them through their career now 10 years later, but we can also see the organic growth of the portfolio. A lot of these clients move and they go to different jobs, and they're taking the professional loan program with them attracting more clients back to the bank.</p><p>As you can see by the slide, there's still a very significant opportunity for the bank to do more with a professional loan program in both private equity and professional service firms. So we're very excited to continue their growth, develop customized lending solutions for these clients and expand their relationship with banking and other financial needs like the student loan refinance product.</p><p>JAMES HERBERT: In true First Republic fashion, we came to the student loan refinance product by following our clients. When we work through the number of the professional loan program clients, what we surprisingly discovered is despite the fact that they were working at great firms, making great income well on their way, they still actually had student loan debt. And so that caused us to take a step back and understand whether this was something larger that we could help with more systemically. And when we looked at this, we discovered that absolutely, yes, this was. We started doing our student loan program back in 2014, very late -- end of 2014. And over the last 5 years, it has been hugely successful. What we do, the student loan refinance is a refinance of educational loans for people who have continued or completed graduate school or undergraduate. We don't do any in-school lending in that perspective. And what we found is that a great customer profile. This is, in fact, the same First Republic client just 15 years earlier.</p><p>As Jim talked about, when we hung up the shingle in 1985, it was the 35-year old who is trying to buy a home. Well, that is now 45 on average, but this 31-, 32-year old, has also a same emotionally resonant problem, which is their student loan debt. The average loan size for us as well in the 6 figures. And we are able to get a great client. You can see 90% of them have graduate degrees. They're FICOs in the 770s, and they've got really, really strong income. And they are just really starting to hit their stride. And what we're able to do with the student loan refinance and the professional loan program is we're able to attract these clients before they have developed that long-term relationship with another bank. And we're able to kind of take that and build that relationship with them over time.</p><p>We're really excited about the way this is growing, and there's a huge potential opportunity in front of us. If we look for our credit in our geographies, there are over -- we estimate about 400,000 people that we could address and more of them, unfortunately, being minted every year as they graduate from that perspective. So we -- given where we are now at about 24,000, we're very, very excited about the opportunity in front of us.</p><p>As we think about where these 2 products have gotten us in combination, it really has been transformative. As you've heard over the years, First Republic takes a long-term view. This was a debt that has been made over the course of the past decade or so in Professional Loan Program and not quite 5 years in the case of the Student Loan Refinance product. And what we're seeing is we're starting to see it change underlying demographics for the bank. In not quite 5 years, we have gone from 6% of the consumer borrowing households having SLR or PLP, up to 34%, which is a massive change. And what we see is we're seeing these seeds kind of start to blossom. We're finding clients that we did a Professional Loan Program loan for who came with an SLR who are now doing a mortgage, who have taken us their business or for a PLP at the next firm. And when you look at this, we say, okay, 36% -- sorry, 34% of this so far. What's actually impactful of that is not quite half of those are new in the last 18 months.</p><p>So when we think about the long-term value creation from these clients, we are in the early innings. And while we're starting to see them deepen our relationships with us, that's really important and really exciting as we think about the next 5 and 10 years. So this will only work if these clients experience the same great service that all the rest of our clients do, stay, grow and refer more clients. So talk a little bit about kind of the service model, you might go ahead, Patrick Macken.</p><p>PATRICK MACKEN, CO-HEAD OF EAGLE LENDING, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: So one of the things that we found that was interesting is we had heard all the hype from the media about millennials don't want to talk to a person and they don't feel that, that's an important value or aspect to a relationship. They just wanted digital. And what we actually found was like our regular client base, this resonates with them. It's important to them. So -- and you can see on the slide here that, that's illustrated in the Net Promoter Score that's a 75. That's the relationship. It's the same client. It's the same service that resonates with the younger generation. So it also allowed us an opportunity to build a new relationship manager development program to serve these clients.</p><p>So over the last -- since 2017, I guess, it is. We've added an opportunity to bring on 45 new relationship managers. And that, again, with the 75, that same service model and same delivery to the clients that just happen to be younger, is working.</p><p>So this is probably, for me, my most important or exciting slide is, along with the same service model, we're getting the same credit results. So in the -- over a decade since we provided Professional Loan Programs, we've had 0 losses, similarly to the bank's overall credit quality. In the Student Loan Refinancing, it's only when -- it's been only 3 points over the last 3 years -- 5 years. So it's -- again, it sounds repetitive, but it's the same story. It's the same clients, the same credit culture, the same need for relationship, and it's working.</p><p>JAMES HERBERT: So as we heard about right out of the gate, if you have differentiated service, particularly for a younger clients that, that may not know what that means or have experienced it. The key is get trial. One of the things that we really like about these products is that, as we think about being efficient with capital and balance sheet, this is a very efficient way for us to get trial for this new younger generation. If we look at the typical mortgage size versus the typical SLR or PLP side, we'll see that we're able to get many multiples, almost 4 and just over 9 of these new clients to -- versus the same average loan size from that perspective.</p><p>When we think about the potential lifetime value of these clients, when we think about the potential referral -- number of referrals that could come off with this, there's a huge opportunity buried inside this, which is one of the reasons why we've been excited about its growth while being careful to do so one at a time, the same way we've always done it.</p><p>So let's talk a little bit about how we're actually doing with these clients. The overall answer is we are doing great. We are very excited about the results from the PLP and SLR clients that we've seen to date. On the left, we've got -- we picked some cohorts of PLP and SLR clients and looked at the first 3 years of their growth. And what we saw was deposit growth. That was as strong as, if not stronger than the traditional mortgage client that comes in from our perspective, which we're very proud of.</p><p>In the middle column, what we're seeing here is a very strong liquidity, to loan ratio for these clients. And that's really a factor from 2 things. One, we're now starting to see the ratio of old clients to new clients kind of mature. So we have a handful of clients who've been with us 3, 5, 10 years and a larger percentage of those versus what we gained in, let's say, the last 12 months. So as those clients stay with us and grow, this level is being helped. The second thing that's helping is we're learning. Just like we've done with other places in the bank, we have introduced relationship pricing, basically encouraging people to bring over more of their business at the time of origination, something we've been doing for decades on the mortgage side of things. That is increasingly helping us build that deeper relationship right out of the gate with these younger clients and have a better chance of building that lifetime client from our perspective.</p><p>Then on the right column, talking on mortgages. Now across the 28,000-or-so clients that we have, we've done about 2,000 mortgages. But again, something to keep in mind, I think when we think about the number which we're already very proud of is, in fact, we've only had just under -- sorry, I'll say it differently, 45% of our clients are new in the last 18 months. So when we think about the amount of time that we've had to move towards these clients and offer these mortgages, we're very, very pleased about what this looks like.</p><p>All in all, these 2 products and Eagle Lending as a whole, are a nicely profitable business for the firm as well as planting the seeds for future growth for the bank, which we're extremely excited about. At the end of the day, I really do hope that this reflects the fact that we've done what the bank has done historically. We've identified a great client set. We've figured out ways to get trial. We've structured everything and brought on new relationship managers to ensure the same high level of differentiated service that we have. The clients are growing with us, both in the products that we have and across as they go into mortgages, as they've taken us into their businesses, as we follow them into PLP, we follow them to nonprofits. And they're giving us referrals. So this is the same First Republic model applied to newer segment. We're very excited about that.</p><p>PATRICK MACKEN: Great. Thank you. So I'd like to introduce Private Wealth Management, Bob Thornton, Kristin Ashman and George Fuchs. Thank you.</p><p>ROBERT LEE THORNTON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; PRESIDENT OF FIRST REPUBLIC PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Good morning, everyone. My name is Bob Thorton. I'm the President of Private Wealth Management, and I'm pleased to be joined by 2 of my New York colleagues, who will introduce themselves.</p><p>KRISTIN ASHMAN, NORTHEAST REGIONAL TEAM LEAD, FIRST REPUBLIC TRUST COMPANY: I'm Kristin Ashman. I'm the Northeast Regional Team Lead for First Republic Trust Company. I'm an attorney by background with 20 years of trust and state administration experience.</p><p>ROBERT LEE THORNTON: George?</p><p>GEORGE FUCHS, MANAGING DIRECTOR &amp; PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGER, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Good morning. I'm George Fuchs, and I'm with First Republic's Private Wealth Management division. I lead a team of 9 here in New York, providing both private and institutional wealth management services in the same capacity for over 22 years.</p><p>ROBERT LEE THORNTON: So today, many of you are probably familiar somewhat with wealth management and our strong growth. But we want to talk about today is what makes us unique, why that has really contributed to our growth and why we continue to believe we have very strong growth opportunities ahead.</p><p>So the first slide we want to talk to is why we think we occupy a unique position in the wealth management world, and I'm going to ask George to address that.</p><p>GEORGE FUCHS: Thanks, Bob. So I came to First Republic a little less than 1 year ago from a large global wealth management firm. And in my professional history, I've either worked at, partnered or collaborated with or canvased, both the global wealth management firms and also the smaller boutique registered investment adviser RIA shops. And what I'd like to do is to explain First Republic's unique advantage containing both the aspects of global private wealth management firms. And also the benefits of akin -- more akin to the smaller boutique RIA shops.</p><p>So First Republic provides wealth managers really akin to what you would see with global wealth management firms, really, several things, but 2 in particular. We provide wealth managers access to best-in-class, thoroughly vetted menu, an open architecture menu of investments, both all in the equity, fixed income and alternative asset class products. This is also coupled with, two, a strong, capable -- strong and capable global research team. And I guess, more akin to what you would see in the smaller and boutique -- smaller boutique registered investment advisory shops, we also maintain several similarities and advantages that are akin to there as well. One being our access to senior management. Whether it's internal through development, guidance and strategy or external for client acquisition and relationship management, the key in connectivity to our senior management delivers us a strong ability to provide good and quality service to our clients.</p><p>And secondly, I would say it's our culture being most akin to the smaller firms, we really have a strong culture of collaboration. It's ingrained in our DNA. And we're taught early on to collaborate and partner with other members of our team of differing in different skill sets and service solutions. And we think this as well as our large firm-style capabilities, the marriage of the 2 allows us to have a very competitive advantage in not only client acquisition but also relationship management.</p><p>ROBERT LEE THORNTON: And I'd add one more thing. There's -- I don't believe there's a firm anywhere in our universe of $100 billion to $0.5 billion -- or $0.5 trillion that has the banking capabilities we can deliver to our clients as well.</p><p>Kristin, let's talk a little bit about how we actually work with clients.</p><p>KRISTIN ASHMAN: Okay. I think one of our main competitive advantages is our ability to meet all of the needs of our clients and uniquely position ourselves to cover the breadth of the client relationship. As Bob and George were talking about, our investment platform is flexible. It's robust. It's open architecture. It allows us to work with clients of all different levels of investment sophistication and wealth. Our financial planning team can help our clients work through that process of wealth creation to wealth preservation through financial planning. And my team and I come in to work with clients exclusively when we've been named in our estate planning documents to serve as a trustee, as an executor, as an agent for either of those 2 roles. Marry that with our First Republic, high-touch, high-service experience on the banking and lending side, offer advisory solutions that help mitigate risks such as insurance and foreign exchange, and we've got it all under one umbrella. I think that's what makes us win. So what we're able to do is really provide a customized experience for each of our clients in a very seamless way.</p><p>ROBERT LEE THORNTON: Thank you. So how does this model and how does the ways we serve the client translate itself into growth and benefit of the enterprise?</p><p>So since 2010, you can see the fee revenue contribution to the bank has grown from 6% to 14% through the third quarter of this year. That's come not only through the growth of investment management and brokerage, but increasingly greater growth from insurance, foreign exchange and trust. So we've continued to diversify the bank's revenue growth as well as doing that while the bank business is still, as you know. So we've had to grow actually at a higher rate than the bank to represent a higher percentage of our growth, and we expect that we'll have a good opportunity to do that as we move forward.</p><p>One thing I want to chat a little bit about is our asset growth. You can see that we've increased our assets under management about 8.5x since 2010, and this has largely occurred through organic growth rather than RIA acquisitions. There are 2 things that really drive our asset growth. The first is market appreciation and the second is what we call net client flow. Net client flow is simply the amount of new assets that come in less assets that leave.</p><p>So on the next page, I'm going to talk a little bit about how each has contributed to our growth. So since the beginning of 2013, we've grown about $100 billion. Almost 70% of that growth has come from what I'd describe as net client flow and about 30% from market appreciation. We can't -- we haven't found a way to control the market yet, but we do focus very much on net client flow. And we have found that's typically quite strong regardless of market conditions.</p><p>One of the things that allows us to have such strong net client flow is that I believe we have more sources of growth than many of our competitors. First, we have very capable advisers who are very engaged around growing their client base, either from getting assets -- more assets from existing clients or developing new clients.</p><p>Number two, we have a very strong referral model, where our relationship managers and our other bankers are very focused on referring their clients to wealth management. And last but not least is new teams. We've generally hired 7 to 9 new wealth management teams around the country, generally 1 or 2 per market, consistently over the last several years.</p><p>I want to focus in a little bit on the bank referral model because I do think that's one of our unique strengths. I remember an adviser and his partner joining us about 3 or 4 years ago, and I had lunch with them a year later, and they've been quite a recipient of bank referrals. And they said, you know, Bob, when we joined, you told us about these bank referrals, but we didn't really believe you. We've heard there are things called platypuses, we've seen pictures of them, but we didn't know they really existed. And we've been the benefit of a lot of bank referrals.</p><p>And the question is why. How did a little over $6 billion of referrals come from about 150 bankers to our wealth management professionals? And that's almost pretty much doubled just since 2014. Well, one, as Mike and others have talked about, we really work on having people collaborate together. They sit together. They sit across the hall from one another. They know each other. That's no small matter. They respect the professionalism of their colleagues. Our compensation structure rewards that not only for closing the business, but our bankers receive a trailer in perpetuity to ensure that the wealth management part of the relationship remains strong alongside the wealth professionals supporting the clients. We do train and training in the sense of not only how do you get comfortable talking about wealth management but our products and services. And last but not least, we have a professional called a wealth adviser, about 20 in the country, whose principal focus is really working with our bankers to refer bank clients to wealth management based on the nature of their clients' holdings, what firm they may have their assets at today, their investment style, who's the best matchup.</p><p>But I'm going to turn to my 2 colleagues to briefly share 1 or 2 examples of referral activity you've been involved in and why this has worked. Maybe, Kris, I'll start with you.</p><p>KRISTIN ASHMAN: Not only do our bankers bring us in to be the subject matter expert and the experienced fiduciary on my side, but they also bring us in to help close the business and to help expand that business. And in my case, in particular, a banker called me because his long-time client needed an executor of his estate. We won the mandate and through that estate settlement process, we increased assets under management extensively as well as created a very long-term relationship on the trust company side by serving as trustee. So I think what works well is that the bankers trust us. They bring us in early, and they know we're there to help close and to help grow that business.</p><p>ROBERT LEE THORNTON: Next, George?</p><p>GEORGE FUCHS: Thanks, Bob. I'd like to mention a recent win that we've had akin to the collaboration that you mentioned. So our team, our direct team was asked to partner with the relationship manager by a wealth adviser. And the relationship manager had a client relationship, providing banking and lending services to the client. And the goal -- the first goal of the meeting was to generate more banking services and also more lending opportunity from this client, who we understood to be of pretty good means -- pretty well means, had a large net worth and also was the business owner of a midsized company here in New York City. So we entered the meeting with that knowledge, and the initial second target was a private wealth management acquisition, including both asset management and financial planning for this client. What we uncovered during the exploratory stage of the meeting, and it's the 4 of us at that meeting, was that there was also a need for wealth management, significant opportunity wealth management services for the clients' organization. The client did mention to us in viewing our team as being cohesive and decided to refer us to his investment committee for this potential corporate mandate. And so at the close of the meeting, we were able to get the private wealth opportunity, which was smaller but being referred to the investment committee then allowed us to meet with the committee and close the business shortly after. The total business under assets under management and acquisition was about $90 million, and our whole team continues to service the client. We will not disband.</p><p>ROBERT LEE THORNTON: Let me turn to deposits. While assets under management and wealth management fee revenue is very important to our efforts, deposit growth is equally important. We're about 10% of the bank's deposit base, and that has increased -- our overall deposits have increased year-to-year. You can see that in the last year, we've grown about 21% in terms of deposits from sweeps and referred deposits.</p><p>Again, question, why is that working? Well, number one, we have fantastic banking services. A lot of the colleagues who join us from other firms are not used to being quite as comfortable with referring their wealth management clients to banking. And here, it's a layup, and they're very excited to do that.</p><p>In addition, we've really made it just an important focus in terms of recognition. A lot of the good things I talked about with respect to bank referrals to wealth management apply when we're referring wealth management clients to banking, teamwork, compensation, long-term investment by the team in terms of maintaining the banking relationship. So again, I see this as being a continually important part of our wealth management focus.</p><p>We talk about household growth, the new household growth of the bank, and that's very important. One of the things we see as a great opportunity continuing for wealth management is our existing clients. Even though we've had a very high growth rate in terms of assets under management, just over 90% of our bank clients do not have a wealth management relationship. And you say, well, \"Bob, better get off the stick. You kind of can't get that number.\" Well, the reality is, again, we've doubled in the last 2 years, we did $6 billion. Overall, obviously, our bank base is growing significantly, but we see this as still a great opportunity for our overall growth before adding new additional clients or households.</p><p>Somewhat similarly on the wealth management side, 61% of our wealth management clients are not yet banking clients. But again, that effort is very strong, 95% of our wealth professionals preferred banking last year. So it's just continuing to introduce clients to the bank, and those numbers will continue to grow.</p><p>I want to finish talking about some specific opportunities that we have identified as we move through the next year or 2. I talked about bank referrals, which I think will remain strong. We continue to be a very attractive home for new teams, new wealth managers. If you've been watching our press releases, we've announced 3 very prominent wealth management team hires just in the last 6 or 7 weeks, including one on Friday from UBS in Los Angeles, and I think we'll continue to be attractive because of our model, because of our culture and our ability to serve the client's full relationship.</p><p>We also have increasingly turned our attention to engaging later generations. As clients age, they generally have their wealth set, not that we're not happy to continue to manage that, but the complexity in their lives continues to grow. There's more trust planning issues that can arise. They may want legacy planning. They want to set up more foundations. They want to educate their kids. So that's a big opportunity for us. And I think one of the secrets to that is one of the things that Gaye has shared, which is our retention. We have very high retention of clients. So that makes our job easier to try and maintain the family.</p><p>I also want to just draw attention, as I mentioned at the outset, to foreign exchange trust and insurance. Those are increasingly significant for us and, again, a reflection of continuing to serve the entire client relationship. About 2 years ago, we introduced Eagle Invest, which was our online investment management service. That is something that we expected that we're still quite pleased is growing. It was always meant to be both a way to serve clients who maybe didn't have the wealth to really support a day-to-day wealth manager, but it's also a way to engage our younger clients, our student loan refinancing PLP clients, and that's had, I think, a meaningful impact in those areas as well.</p><p>So I want to thank you -- we want to thank you for your attention. We hope you walk away with a better sense of why we're different and unique and why we think that'll continue to support, which we think is a terrific growth opportunity in wealth management. Thank you.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: Thank you, Bob, Kristin and George. Thanks, everyone. We're going to take a 15-minute break now. So if you could please just be back in your seats at 5 till noon. We would appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>[Break]</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF PEOPLE OFFICER, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: I'm Mollie Richardson, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief People Officer, First Republic Bank, and I'm thrilled to welcome a great panel of clients who are here with us today. They're going to share their personal stories about the relationships and experiences with First Republic.</p><p>But first, as required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, I must mention that First Republic investment management does not allow the use of client testimonials and they will not be represented on this panel. We've got a brief bit of time for this client panel. So the way we're going to structure it is I'm going to ask our clients a few questions, and then we're going to open it up to the audience for some Q&amp;A.</p><p>And to kick things off and get right to it, I'm going to ask each of our clients just to introduce themselves to the room. And Rahul, why don't we start with you?</p><p>RAHUL TRIPATHI: Rahul Tripathi. I'm CFO and COO of The Brearley</p><p>School here in New York City.</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: I'm Barney Walker. I've been in the institutional asset management business for about 25 years, four firms, primarily raising money and servicing clients.</p><p>RAJVI PATEL: I'm Rajvi Patel, I'm an in-house attorney at Mizuho Bank, and I just joined 2 months ago. Formerly was a banking and finance attorney at a law firm, Skadden, Arps.</p><p>DAMIEN DWIN: Good morning, everyone. My name is Damien Dwin. I'm Co-CEO of Brightwood Capital, a $5 billion asset manager here in the city.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Excellent. Thank you. Damien, why don't we start things off with you? Can you tell us how you were first introduced to First Republic and what the initial need you had in which we helped with?</p><p>DAMIEN DWIN: Sure, of course. We founded our business in 2010 with 0 AUM and no outside capital. Today, we manage roughly $5 billion all from large public pension funds. But in that very first vehicle, which was a small business investment company, an SBIC, we hired as employee #3 a CFO, who came from a famous manager called Golub Capital, which is known to most people in the room. And so this alumnus from Golub shared with us if he had to start with a banking relationship, it would be with First Republic because of one person, in particular, Ruth Aronowitz, who served him with distinction at his prior employer.</p><p>And so there we were, literally, some guys with a PowerPoint presentation and no money, subletting space, and coming out with this vision following the financial crisis to create an asset manager that, in our case, will focus on lending to small, medium-sized businesses owned and controlled by families, founders and entrepreneurs. So I would offer up the first hint that we could have a promising relationship with First Republic, and that our models were similar. We were focused on entrepreneurs, how to serve them in a differentiated way. And in that first fund, Ruth was just gracious, provided us with banking services. The deposits obviously grew over time. And today, we have 3 or 4 different product lines with First Republic. We could easily do business with other banks. We borrow from about 15 different major banks to provide leverage at the fund level. But when it comes to our management company and what we as the partners think about in preserving our wealth, we have a trusted bond with this institution.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Thank you. Thank you for that. Rahul, maybe this next question is for you. As we know, First Republic is passionate about serving our communities and supporting the business needs of nonprofit organizations. In what ways have we lived up to our commitment and supported The Brearley School?</p><p>RAHUL TRIPATHI: In a number of ways. I introduced First Republic to the school in the context of a very complicated financing for a capital project. And I think Todd and team did just an excellent job in terms of understanding our needs and helping us think about a model that was going to speak to long-term sustainability, which was the interest of the school in our consideration of how we would finance and achieve that project. I think the true value-add was that of thought partnership. It wasn't just here are the set of opportunities, and here's how you might consider financing this project. We really had a lot of conversations that enhanced our thinking about how we might go about executing this project.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: You're also, I believe, a founding board member on our Financial Executive Alliance, one of our affinity group. Would you mind telling us how you got involved with that? And what piqued your interest in that?</p><p>RAHUL TRIPATHI: I am. I'd be happy to talk about that. So the FEA, or Financial Executives Alliance, is a consortium of nonprofit executives. It's sector-agnostic. So we have people from museums and health care and education and all kinds of different nonprofits who are primarily either in financial or operational roles, typically C-suite. And we meet, I think, probably 4 or 5 times a year to talk about a variety of topics of common interest, mostly related to best practices in the sector.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Thank you.</p><p>RAHUL TRIPATHI: Sure.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Rajvi, over to you. Relatively speaking, your relationship with the bank is somewhat new. Can you share with us the story on how you were introduced to First Republic and how your relationship has evolved with us?</p><p>RAJVI PATEL: Yes, a fairly new relationship last couple of years. It started shortly after I graduated from law school. I was just having a casual conversation with a colleague at the firm, and he was telling me about how he had recently refinanced his student loans. And he was speaking with an enthusiasm that you don't really hear people talking about especially with student loans. But he had, had a great experience and so I decided to look into the services that were offered. And I think what struck me was how personal of a relationship that I quickly developed with Jessica Decker, my relationship manager. And I didn't really think that there could be financial services out there that were truly differentiated and tailored for an individual customer. I often found that when I looked into other offerings, it was more of a one-size-fits-all approach, and so this is something I didn't know existed. But I felt like First Republic really worked with me and catered to my needs. And I developed a really personal relationship with the bank.</p><p>And going forward, I think, 2 years or so after that, I -- it just made sense to me to go back to First Republic for my mortgage, too. And that sort of personal touch and that relationship that I had with Jessica, it made the process of buying a home, especially for the first time, especially in New York City of all markets, which can be a little overwhelming, much easier. It's funny. Recently -- a couple of weeks ago, I was talking to a coworker about his home purchase and he was saying how somebody from his financing team and wherever it was from was supposed to show up at this closing, and he just didn't show up. And I -- I just was like, \"Well, my relationship manager from First Republic was at my closing with a box of cookies for me.\" So he did not appreciate that. But I think that story is very -- it's symbolic of, I think, the relationship that First Republic tries to cultivate with all of its customers and symbolic of my relationship with the bank over the last couple of years. And cookies never hurt.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: So Barney, can you tell us a little bit about your background and how you came to First Republic? And then on top of that, can you share with us the experience that you've had with the bank thus far?</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: I came to First Republic about a year ago. I was looking to make a shift away from the private bank I was working with. First Republic, I knew of because a lot of people in the asset management business are clients here. They enjoy a good reputation. So when my private banker from Goldman Sachs made the move over here, it made sense for me to follow him. So I've been their client for about a year. Even though I'm in asset management, I'm mostly on the client servicing side and distribution side. So I'm always interested in having someone really manage my personal assets for me. But really, they through their arms around me as a bank, took a free review of my entire estate planning and drew a number of red flags there and really took it upon themselves to manage me, if you will, on fixing a number of problems that are there. None of us expect to get hit by the bus tomorrow, but they really managed me in trying to fix a number of things so my children will be well taken care of if there was a negative event associated with myself down the road.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: What's the experience been like with your -- the local team that you work with in Greenwich?</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: That's been great. In addition to the individual in charge of my investments, they introduced me to the local banking staff in Greenwich, Connecticut. I've only been in the bank twice, but they knew who I was both times I went in, which surprised me. And more recently, one of my hobbies is antique wooden boats. So I sent out a wire to one of my boat builders in Northern Maine. And in Northern Maine, this group, -- they're much more artisans. Cybersecurity is really not an important thing to them. So they were hacked and I ended up getting a phish e-mail from that boat builder. Everything looked official. It was basically talking about the wire had just sent through, that it was kicked back and a new set of wire instructions were provided. And if it wasn't for that one space in the email address, I wouldn't have noticed it was a phish. So I immediately called the local bank and said, \"Listen, I'm worried about this.\" They assured me the transfer went through to the correct account. And then to my surprise, they offered to send out one of their, I guess, tech guys to come take a look at my personal computer to make sure there was nothing funny going on, on my laptop.</p><p>So it sounds really corny, but they really welcome you in as a family or maybe a better way to say it is they really care about my family and making sure we're doing the right things across the board for them.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: That's great. Thank you. So Damien, you mentioned your banker, Ruth Aronowitz, and Ruth is here today. Putting you on the spot, what's been the key differentiator in working with First Republic and in working with Ruth and how she serves you?</p><p>DAMIEN DWIN: Well, empathy, to begin. So there is real insight into what we were creating. It helps that First Republic has dealt with a lot of asset managers, is active in that business itself. And so Ruth very quickly understood the glide path that we were on, and cross-selling is a bit of a hackneyed term. But in a sense, we knew a single point of contact who could provide all the goods and services of the bank with eloquence, with respect to how we could move on to the next step as we hit our marks. So very simply put, what starts as checking accounts and basic wire services graduates to -- we have a senior person who needs a mortgage, which can very quickly turn into your management company is worth a lot of money. You need to put up a GP commit and future funds. Do you want to do that with cash or leverage? And how can you help your employees grow their wealth in an accelerated fashion? So the conversation suddenly became very nuanced and sophisticated, but we had the benefit of a single point of contact.</p><p>Ruth has a terrific bedside manner. I'll point out despite fobs and encryption and all the digital stuff, it's really great to pick up the phone and just say, \"Ruth, can you make sure this gets done? And please give me your best ideas.\" And to her credit, she's always able to diagnose the issue, so to speak, and bring to bear other of her colleagues to help with specific situations. So we've had terrific dynamic conversations with folks in the risk department at First Republic, people in the credit department, people in the asset management business. It's been a great partnership. And I like the fact that we have someone who, as I said at the beginning, is empathetic and really understands what we're up against.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: So in all the different ways that you can choose to interact with the bank, is there a preferred method that you choose to interact with us?</p><p>DAMIEN DWIN: Human touch, God, it's so massively underrated. The firm has a big balance sheet and a great following, obviously, as we see in this room. But ultimately, it's comprised of people. And having someone you trust, especially in my case, I own 50% of our management company, my partner owns the other half, we have a lot at stake. So having someone that really understands and is responsive and recognizes how much I care about my people and that they get the best at First Republic, and that she can deliver that, it's terrific. It's frankly a privilege to have someone at the managing director level who actually provides that level of customer care. I think it's a little bit unusual.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Great to hear. Thank you, Ruth and team.</p><p>Rahul, this next one's for you. We had the privilege of chatting. I think it was last week. And in that discussion, you described yourself as a fan of First Republic, which is fair to say it's not necessarily a common way. Most people describe their relationship with their bank. What is it about First Republic that makes you say that you're a fan?</p><p>RAHUL TRIPATHI: So much like what Damien just shared. I mean, I've had a relationship with the bank for 15 years, a number of institutions, organizations, personal banking, a lot of different relationships. I think the focus on customer service is really what would cause me to say I'm a fan of the bank as opposed to just thinking it's a good bank to bank with, right? I mean, that's -- I think that's probably the differentiator. I am not reluctant to give reference to First Republic to any of my peers who say, \"Look, I met bank X, Y or Z, and I feel like I'm not being served well.\" I think that's really where First Republic has stepped up. Much like Damien just said, I have no reluctance about picking up the phone and calling Todd or who or Drew here in New York or whoever it is on my client service team and saying, \"Hey, look. This is something where I could use your help.\" And it's -- it has always been the case that whoever that person is on the other side of the phone call has really stepped up. So I think that's why I would say I'm a fan.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Okay. Thank you. Thank you for that. So Rajvi, on the topic of word-of-mouth referrals, 26% of our loan growth comes from referrals by our existing clients. And I'm definitely putting you on the spot here for this one. Have you ever referred anybody to the bank? And if so, can you give us some context and background?</p><p>RAJVI PATEL: I have. Multiple people, actually. And as I mentioned earlier, that's how my relationship with the bank started. And I think over the last couple of years, I definitely talked about it to several people, and I know for a fact 3 people have engaged with First Republic, either for the student loan refinancing and also just for basic banking needs as well. And I cant say I'm going out of my way to advertise it, but it sort of just organically comes up. And yes, they all sort of have the same experience that I did. Whether it be with the student loans or with the -- just banking needs, generally, they have their own person, they -- what everybody is saying, a personal touch, no matter what their needs are and sort of those catered services. And I know they've told other people for a fact, too. So I don't know what the number comes out to be.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Thank you for that. So Barney, what has surprised you the most about being a client at First Republic?</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: I think for me, it's just the kindness. I guess I wasn't used to people really caring about my family and the impact of the investment decisions we make and the estate planning piece and if my wire transfer actually went to where it was supposed to go. Definitely, the kindness, the high level of touch. I also prefer to talk on the phone and they seem to be -- the representatives of my team are happy to talk to me as well.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: There was something that you had said when we were chatting earlier that really resonated with me. I hope I'm attributing it to you correctly. It was -- so it's -- \"I wouldn't call it high-touch, Mollie, but I would call it a nice touch.\"</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: I think that's accurate.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: It was a nice touch. You are greeted warmly when you come in, but you're not -- you don't feel like you're overwhelmed.</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: No one's pushing products, but they're there. They want to help and want to make sure that things are taking place, putting you on the right glide path.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Great to hear. Great to hear. With that, we do have some time for some audience questions. Thank you. What we're going to do, if anyone would like to ask a question of our clients, please raise your hand and a runner is going to provide a microphone. We ask that you please say your name and the name of the company that you're with before asking the question.</p><p>STEVEN A. ALEXOPOULOS, MD AND HEAD OF MID-CAP &amp; SMALL-CAP BANKS, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hi, everybody. So Steve Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. So I have 2 questions. First, I'm curious what you each think of First Republic's technology. I get it that you like the personal touch. But do you feel like you're getting that and great technology or instead of great technology? That's my first question.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Damien?</p><p>DAMIEN DWIN: I'm happy to start that. I happen to have a checking account at your institution. So...</p><p>STEVEN A. ALEXOPOULOS: Thank you.</p><p>DAMIEN DWIN: You guys have great technology, and it's public knowledge you spend a lot of money on it. I would say, I've discerned no difference between what I'm seeing from the elite money center banks and First Republic in terms of the quality of the technology. The #1 focus for all of us is cybersecurity. So it's really all about just making sure we have checks and balances and that inevitable phishing expedition, so to speak, does it come to haunt us. And some of us have actually lost money in these situations. So First Republic has been great. I think the technology is at the cutting edge. But yes, the fact of the matter is I don't think any of us can settle and feel too comfortable. There are all sorts of public examples about why we have to continue spending and innovating, and there will be change. But the good news is in that change, there is one constant, and that is the personal touch of, in my case, Ruth, but whomever you're dealing with at the human level at the firm.</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: I think they have a great app for the iPhone. So I do a lot of things right out there. It's really easy. Obviously, cybersecurity is important to all of us. But it's very important -- it feels very important to First Republic, but it also doesn't feel like it's preventing business from taking place. So maybe it's more behind the scenes. I don't feel like a criminal myself trying to access or make a transaction.</p><p>RAJVI PATEL: Yes, the technology is actually one of the things that stood out to me, in particular, when I was going through all the various paperwork you have to do when you're getting a mortgage. And I was actually very, very happy with the sort of user interface and both on the website, both on the mobile app and all of that. I've definitely dealt with the technologies for very big organizations. That actually surprises me because it's not quite so seamless. So that was definitely something that stood out to me.</p><p>RAHUL TRIPATHI: I'd say the technology seems robust to me. I'm also a client of JPMorgan for another reason. And I think -- I don't think that those are differentiated goods amongst banks. I think the network security is extraordinary. My banker here has called me perhaps 2 or 3x related to wires that seemed unusual for the typical set of wires that we issue. And so it's that level of interface where there's a check internally for them in addition to the controls we have in-house. That's a value add. And I think that really is -- again, that's not an issue of technology per se, but it's sort of the security provisions that are in place.</p><p>STEVEN A. ALEXOPOULOS: Just a quick second question. So one of the slides that the bank had up earlier showed the Net Promoter Score. It showed what First Republic's clients care about like service was very high. One of the things that was very low was interest rate. Do none of you really care about interest rate?</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: I certainly care about interest rate. I'm in the debt business myself, but I'd be remiss in not pointing out, Ruth has told me no many times. So it is not the type of relationship where the answer to every question is yes or false promises are made, and I have a lot of respect for that. It actually builds trust and intimacy when someone can tell you a thoughtful no, a quick no as opposed to a fake yes or a maybe and information on what you would need to have in place to get to yes. That's very helpful and I think comes with the carrots and sticks of a proper relationship, and interest rate obviously falls into that dynamic.</p><p>RAJVI PATEL: Yes. I would agree. I certainly care about interest rate. I imagine that the other softer or maybe factors or things that people point out when thinking about First Republic is probably just because it does stand out so much. But yes.</p><p>DAMIEN DWIN: I haven't borrowed money from the bank. I don't use a lot of leverage.</p><p>RAHUL TRIPATHI: We borrowed very favorably. So I really don't -- I don't -- I wouldn't share that concern.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Any other questions from our audience? Down in the front. Just for the webcast, if you wouldn't mind.</p><p>GARRETT ANTHONY HOLLAND, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD &amp; CO. INCORPORATED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hello. Garrett Holland with Baird. Are there any products that First Republic does not currently offer on the personal or business banking side today that you wish they did?</p><p>DAMIEN DWIN: Well, at Brightwood, we are a credit shop with 6 to 10-year locked money from pensions and insurance companies. And what we're observing and all the analysts in the room see it plainly, insurance companies are buying asset managers, asset managers are buying insurance companies, and we're seeing really a bit of a changing of the guard in the banking industry with respect to how you provide leverage to asset managers at all levels. So it's not just your management company per se, but it's also at the fund level. We have now 15 plus/minus institutions that provide us with fund level leverage, and many of them are names that you just would not expect to see. Some, you would say, were actually competitors. I think, First Republic, owning and controlling this space of being aligned with entrepreneurs, not oligarchs who are a part of large public entities, but rather entrepreneurs in middle markets is the wrong term but people who own smaller enterprises that are actually founder-led, will find itself going in a bit of a barbell approach of finding things that really gets you intimate with all the things we've heard already about estate planning and what's going on with the family's lifestyle and how it spends money. I think First Republic already has a premier relationship there.</p><p>The other end of the spectrum is all things fund finance, and your ability to look at the next vehicle and provide gearing at an asset level or at a fund level with the fluidity of a bank that's active in structured products doing CLO technology. We have that intelligence with First Republic. We're having those conversations, and we're working on certain transactions. But to me, the bank's balance sheet is going to ultimately adjust over time to what we're seeing with the convergence of insurance and asset management. With that level of sophistication and that balance sheet capacity, it's going to be very valuable to entrepreneurs who are on their own with businesses that are worth hundreds of millions or billions of dollars but not tens of billions or much bigger numbers in the public space.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Anyone else? Any products or services?</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: None.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Okay. It's time for another question from the audience. Okay. I'll go ahead and ask another question. What's the -- and I'll ask this of each of you. We are always focused on continuous process improvement or continuous delivery of our service. What's the one thing we could do for you to improve upon?</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: I don't think -- I've only been here a year, and so far, I don't think there's much to improve upon. Sorry.</p><p>DAMIEN DWIN: I've got a kid who's going to need a summer internship in a few years.</p><p>BARNEY WALKER: That's a good one.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Damien, we have a robust internship program with a great minimum wage. Anything else? Okay. All right. Before we wrap things -- Jim, sorry?</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: I don't know if this is on or not. I want to say thank you on behalf of everybody here and myself to be here, and thank you for your business. We really, really appreciate it. This is a great -- it's a great summary. And this is the reason this is working, and if we can't continue to do this for clients of this caliber, then we're in real trouble.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: I, too, want to thank each of you for being here today and taking the time out of your busy schedules. Thank you so much, and it is a privilege to serve you. That's going to wrap our client panel, and we're going to give a round of applause, but then I think I'm going to pass it over to...</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Thank you very much. Enjoy lunch. Okay? We'll take a quick break about 30 minutes. We'll go back. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: So thank you very much, everybody. We're going to take a break for lunch now. Lunch is going to be served out here, and you can -- you're welcome to eat outside the room or bring your lunch back to your seat here. And if you could just please be back at your seat at 12:30. We have a special guest speaker, Ian Bremmer, coming in as well. So thank you and enjoy lunch.</p><p>[Break]</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Good. Okay. Great. Thanks.</p><p>Hopefully, you've enjoyed the morning and the panel. We're going to keep working on our technology, Steve, but we're getting there.</p><p>It's a real pleasure to introduce our guest speaker for -- over the now post lunch-hour period. Ian Bremmer. Ian is a leading political scientist. He provides very much needed objective opinion with great knowledge in a number of areas around the world and has access to a tremendous number of leaders on the global scene and travels endlessly as near as I can tell.</p><p>He got Phd from Stanford. He was the Founder and President of the Eurasia Group, which he is still leading after many, many years now, 20 if I'm not mistaken. And it's really one of the leading, if not the leading political risk advisory firm in the world.</p><p>He's also the Founder and President of GZERO Media, which we -- First Republic's had a great deal of involvement with to -- much to our great pleasure. There -- and they also -- there is also a GZERO World on PBS now. It's in about 50 markets, I think. And you can see it here on WNET in New York. He's a frequent guest commentator on Fox, CNN, BBC, Bloomberg, many others and is a foreign affairs columnist and editor at large for TIME magazine. He's authored 10 books, the most recent one, Us Vs Them: The Failure of Globalism, is out, a New York Times Best Seller, and he teaches at Columbia University. Other than that, he's just hanging around. It's a real pleasure to have Ian Bremmer with us today. Thank you.</p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP, LTD.: Thank you, sir. Thank you, and hello to everybody. It's great to be doing this for First Republic and with Jim. We've been working together for over 5 years now. It's been a fantastic relationship. Jim said that he's been a big supporter, but actually when we decided to launch GZERIO Media before -- when it was a concept, there was no business plan. Jim was the guy that said, \"You have to do this. We're with you.\" That makes a big difference for an effort that is increasingly necessary, I think, because -- I mean, he said, I'm on Fox and I'm on CNN. It's increasingly hard to do that, to do both.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, Trump re-Tweeted a video of mine on CNN. I was on for 10 minutes with CNN New Day, right when impeachment started, but he just picked the 50 seconds when I was talking about Hunter Biden and Burisma and not the full 10. You can't do both. It's getting harder.</p><p>And of course, that's not just true in the U.S. It's true in the U.K. It's true across Europe. It's true in Canada. We even see it now in various emerging market democracies around the world, the massive demonstrations that you've seen in countries like Bolivia and Ecuador, in Iraq, in Lebanon. The number of people that feel like their political systems are not legitimate. Do not work for them. And that's a structural driver that is coming at an unfortunate time.</p><p>I say an unfortunate time because it's happening at the same time that the Chinese have a much stronger consolidated leadership, and they are building a competing set of structures.</p><p>The big news today globally is RCEP, a new trade organization, primarily in Asia, one of the largest in the world. In Bangkok, you have agreement today from all of the countries around the table, except the Indians. This will really hurt Modi, if he doesn't get across the finish line. They've agreed on terms. They will sign it in 2020. There is no United States.</p><p>If you remember, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Chinese developed it. All sorts of other countries around the world joined on board. The Americans told our allies, \"Don't join because it's not global standards. It's Chinese. It's state-driven. It's a authoritarian country.\" Every U.S. ally, except for Japan, joined the AIIB as well. So increasingly, you don't have a global free market. Increasingly, you have a hybrid global system with competing architecture that's not only less efficient but it also means that it's harder for global corporations in certain types of industries to be global.</p><p>So let me break that down for you for a moment because this is how it links to the markets. It's how it links to Investor Day, right? I think that the decision that was taken by the Chinese government over the last few months to decouple their technology standards and their supply chain from the U.S. is the most consequential geopolitical decision taken by any government since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Let me explain that again. The decision by the Chinese to decouple in technology.</p><p>Now you can argue that they took that decision because the United States has been pushing them, hitting them on Huawei and ZTE and saying we're not going to work with you. You could say that Chinese had been planning on doing this for a long time because they weren't allowing Facebook and Amazon to have access to the Chinese market. But we have now, in my view, passed the point of no return.</p><p>The single lesson that the Chinese have taken over the past year of trade negotiations and non-negotiations on the security and tech side has been that they can never be this vulnerable again to the Americans being able to cut them off. And that means building their own semiconductors. And when they can't, having control of the markets that are critical to their infrastructure and inputs: Taiwan and South Korea, first and foremost, some others as well.</p><p>So in the same way that we have RCEP and AIIB that are being done, the Americans aren't there, the Japanese and the South Koreans are now fighting on technology. You may have seen that the Japanese put a large number of South Korean firms on their so-called black list where they cannot actually engage in trade and investment with the Japanese.</p><p>Historically, when the Japanese and South Koreans had problems like this, the Americans are the ones that are engaging good offices, trying to keep 2 allies together. This time around, the U.S. has not done that. The 2 foreign ministers met recently in Beijing because the Chinese understand that's useful for their efforts on the tech side. While the Americans say, \"Why are we spending all this money on troops in South Korea and Japan?\" That is a dramatic change in how we think about the global marketplace.</p><p>Now does this mean the end of globalization? And the answer is, no. It really depends on what part of the global economy you're talking about. It's really problematic for high tech. It's really not for commodities. So let me take you through that for a second.</p><p>If you think about oil and gas and rare earths, even food, I would argue despite everything I just said, despite all of the questions of illegitimacy and polarization in the west, despite all of what the Chinese are doing, actually the commodities markets are becoming more global, more efficient. We had Iran strike Saudi Arabia's most important oil processing facility. In fact, the most -- the largest in the world just a couple of months ago. 50% of their oil production was taken off the markets and the impact on price was comparatively small.</p><p>And the reason for that is because we have an increasingly global energy market, so much so that OPEC influence isn't only at the margins. The Americans are now the largest producers of oil and gas. It's a lot harder to actually put politics into that mix. The Chinese threaten the Americans and say there may cut off rare earths. But they know if they do, that the investment that will come in infrastructure from advanced industrial democracies very quickly will undermine China's long-term interests equally quickly.</p><p>So if you ask me about basic commodities, I actually think we have more global demand, more global supply and a marketplace that isn't going to look all that different in the next 5 or 10 years than it looks right now. You won't need me. The politics won't matter so much.</p><p>Now if you take a step up and look at the piece of the global economy that has developed so much of the middle class around the world over the past decades. Here, I'm talking about basic services, basic manufacturing. This has gotten more global, and now it's kind of stalled. And it's stalled in part because emerging market labor is a lot more expensive. Because you don't have rule of law in China and because they've got national champions that are more powerful. And also because technology is displacing a lot of jobs. So labor doesn't matter as much to capital as it did 10, 20 years ago, and that's a big trend.</p><p>Now if you recognize that, that means that so many Western CEOs, if they could snap their fingers and change their global labor footprint overnight, they would. They'd probably have fewer people, and they'd certainly have them closer to where their markets are. They wouldn't be producing everything in China. They wouldn't be outsourcing as much in emerging markets.</p><p>Now they don't want to make those decisions overnight because they're tough decisions. And if they're hitting their quarterly numbers, they've got enough to worry about. But when we get to a point that we have softness in the global economy and they need to suddenly make tougher decisions about bottom line, I think that they will \"rationalize\" their supply chains very quickly. In other words, you'll have a lot fewer laborers in these sectors in a lot of emerging markets, particularly China over the next 2 to 3 years. Still, I would argue that's an incremental change for more globalization to slightly less. It's not a sea change.</p><p>But then you look at AI and big data. Then you look at 5G, the Internet of things and individuals with data ecosystems determined by companies and countries, and that is not global at all. It's breaking into 2: an American-dominated system and a Chinese-dominated system.</p><p>Now part of the problem is that the Europeans don't recognize this yet. They're still talking about going a third way: The French wanting to build out their own AI capabilities. The Germans wanting their own regulatory environment through the EU, through the European Commission that will have Europe with a lot of strength. But of course, the companies are overwhelmingly American and Chinese, and they're not cooperating. They're creating alternative standards.</p><p>The Chinese have now decided to create their own operating system for smartphones and for 5G. That's new. But anyone you talk to in the Valley sees this as a sea change. What that means is that over the course of the next, not 20 years, not 10, 2 to 3 years, a lot of other countries around the world that have been trying not to have to decide between the U.S. and China will have to decide.</p><p>In the last 12 months, China has exported their data surveillance and cloud systems to 18 countries around the world. Most of them are not countries you care that much about as investors, sub-Saharan Africa and lesser developed Southeast and South Asian economies.</p><p>In the next 2 years, they will include economies you care a lot about. And it's important because not only are we talking about AI and big data in the digital economy, but increasingly, that part of the economy is growing. It's becoming smart infrastructure, smart cities, autonomous driving, pharma and biotech. As we move to the Internet of Things and anything with a chip in it becomes part of the advanced industrial economy, you will see that part of the economy not globalized, but split into 2. It is a game changer in how we think about politics and economics together. Add to that, the fact that increasingly, technology is not driving countries to become more democratic but is actually facilitating authoritarian regimes to have more surveillance and use big data for their own political stability, and you see why I'm kicking off my talk to you with that topic.</p><p>It's the single biggest game-changer for the markets out there. I mean, I believe -- for example, I don't think Apple has a market in China in 5 to 10 years. I just don't. I mean, smartphones that are really expensive. They work really well, and they provide insured privacy for citizens, fantastic for wealthy people outside China. Antithetical to what the Chinese are trying to do.</p><p>Tim Cook just became Chairman of Tsinghua, so he knows he's got a problem. He's thrown personal money at it. That is going to work, in my view, as well as Mark Zuckerberg asking Xi Jinping what he should name his son, okay? I mean, it was worth a shot. He didn't get much love from Xi Jinping on that. It was just a symbolic name, but still he asked. I thought that was kind of -- it's worth an effort.</p><p>Okay. So that's the big geopolitical picture. Before I go to Q&amp;A, let me now talk about a few other things going on. I haven't mentioned domestic U.S. Usually, domestic U.S. doesn't drive a lot of political instability. That has been true with 2019. It has been true with the Mueller investigation. It will not be true in 2020 because impeachment process in 2020, the overwhelmingly likely outcome is that Trump is impeached in the House. It's not convicted in the Senate. And so therefore, he's running, and he feels empowered to continue to abuse power in ways that he had involving Ukraine and Biden and all the rest. That is a problem, and it's worse than nonimpeachment or not holding impeachment hearings because it means that there are many people that will feel that the 2020 elections are themselves not legitimate.</p><p>In other words, if you have elections coming up in November and there are inadequate security mechanisms to ensure that you do not have foreign intervention in the U.S. election and Trump feeling like he can continue to push that without legal consequence, you will have people taking that to court. You will also have people probably calling for boycotts. Hopefully, those people aren't running for office, though I can imagine a situation where Bernie Sanders and his supporters, having not gotten the nomination, would make that argument.</p><p>In other words, I actually think that there is a reasonable likelihood in 2020 that you'll have a short period of time where a constitutional crisis occurs. Not martial law, not troops in the streets, but a feeling that the election itself is not legitimate and, therefore, the outcome should not be recognized as such by whoever lost.</p><p>If it's Trump having lost, certainly hard to see him recognizing it as legitimate. If it's a Dem, given that impeachment process, same. And I think that means for a few months, you can imagine Congress refusing to play ball on things like getting stuff funded, working on a day-to-day basis. A general congressional strike in this environment with the global economy deteriorating is a significant risk in 2020 in a way that U.S. domestic risk in 22 years since I started Eurasia Group has never been significant.</p><p>I was with Larry Fink, client, friend, a couple of weeks ago, who was asking me what worried me the most. I sort of talk broadly about some of this stuff. This was what he pointed to. He said, \"I absolutely agree with those concerns. The markets are not thinking about it yet. So I felt like it was worth addressing for a few minutes with this group.</p><p>Beyond that, I'm actually much less worried about a lot of the tail risks that are in the headlines. Iran, the likelihood that we have military confrontation between Iran and the Saudis or Israel or the U.S., it's actually really low. Trump doesn't want it. Iranians don't want it. I mean, you can argue that they're taking all these exploratory measures.</p><p>But what's really interesting is that they waited for over 15 months before they hit that Saudi oil facility. Despite 10% contraction of their economy on the back of the U.S. withdrawing from a nuclear deal and hitting them with some sanctions. I mean, let's stipulate that most of us in this room probably don't like the Iranian regime. Let's stipulate that. They're bad. We don't like them. We want them gone. But you can make an argument that actually they've shown incredible restraint. And from a market perspective, that matters. So I think the likelihood that we end up at war with the Iranians is really quite marginal.</p><p>I feel the same thing with North Korea. They're testing some more missiles, some submarine launch missiles even. But the one thing that Trump had been agitated about before he had that meeting in Singapore, the fire and fury speech, was ICBMs that could hit the lower 48. They've never tested those. And in fact, there's been no activity in the previous facilities where they were developing them, implying that the North Koreans know that they've got a better potential deal with Trump. They want a third summit, maybe see if they can get some sanctions being reduced. The Chinese are now calling for sanctions reduction just as of 2 weeks ago. I see that moving in a more peaceful direction. I mean, they're not going to get rid of their nukes. But do I think the South Korean market is going to get hit by the potential of the U.S. flexing its muscles militarily against these guys? Absolutely not.</p><p>Venezuela, when Bolton was there, they were talking about 5,000 troops off the border. Now looks like Maduro is not going anywhere despite all the problems of the economy, despite the implosion of Venezuela, the lack of any middle class, the extraordinary hunger, the refugees that are streaming across the border, almost 2 million now in neighboring Colombia. Big problem for them, real cost on the fiscal side. But do I think that Venezuela is heading for a regime change? Do I think that could lead us into a confrontation, military or otherwise? No.</p><p>Syria, so much we've heard from Trump pulling these troops out of northern Syria. Number one, most of the troops are still there; number two, the fact that the Turks have taken over some of that territory, the Kurds immediately did a deal with the Russians and Assad. How could they do a deal so quickly when Trump suddenly told them that he was pulling out? And the answer is because they were expecting the Americans to forsake them for years now. It's a time-honored American tradition to let the Kurds do the fighting and then not support them, right? This has been many administrations that have actually done that.</p><p>And so no, there's no genocide against the Kurds. And no, there's no major instability in Syria. In fact, you're slightly more likely now to get a UN deal, brokered deal, allowing Assad to fundamentally control all of Syria because he feels much more confident. I mean, he won the civil war, largely under the Obama administration. And I'd like to say that Trump is so angry about giving Obama credit for anything that he won't even give Obama credit for failing in Syria, which seems a little unfair. But nonetheless, that's kind of where we are. Do I think that that's going to create an expansion of civil war in Syria or the potential of a fight between the Russians and the Turks or the Americans and the Turks, the answer is no.</p><p>So interestingly, in 2020, these individual geopolitical issues that have driven a lot of headlines over the last couple of years, I think, are very unlikely to cause market-moving impacts. Meanwhile, the structural issues between the U.S. and China do not get resolved. They actually get worse. Even as we have the potential for a signature of this phase 1 deal on trade and the Chinese end up buying some more ag from the United States, getting back towards the status quo ante doesn't change my view at all of that broader relationship. Domestic U.S. politics is now a risk in a way that had not been historically, and you get more populous risk domestically inside an awful lot of democracies.</p><p>That's the final point here. Whether you look at Europe, or whether you look at emerging market democracies, we've seen a rise in anti-establishment sentiment and governments over the last several years, while the economies have done comparatively well. Now that the economies are getting softer, and these governments will not have as much money to throw around to respond to that, it's going to become much more challenging. That means the numbers that you get for the Greens and for the Alternative f\u00c3\u00bcr Deutschland in Germany go up. Merkel doesn't go anywhere precisely because the Alternatives are worse. But long term, next time you get German elections, they're going to be more market negative.</p><p>I suspect that you're going to see that in Spain, and the demonstrations you've had around Catalonia have only made that more likely. Italy has a new government that's holding together only because everybody hates Salvini and the League, but everybody knows that they're only getting more popular. When you do have elections, they'll probably do better.</p><p>So because of that, we are storing up a lot more anti-market populism and political instability in a bunch of both developing and developed democracies with a more challenging economic cycle over the next couple of years. So that's where those are the places I see the political risk. But for 2020, interestingly, not some of the headlines that we've all seen driven.</p><p>So I've got about 15 minutes left. I'd love to take all of that, have you push me wherever you like. Feel free to disagree. It's not a problem. We're all friends here and see what's interesting. We have roving mics, and I'd love to take a bunch of questions. Who would like to start? Start here.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ERIKA NAJARIAN, MD AND HEAD OF US BANKS EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: So as we think about next year, if you think about the different platforms that have been portrayed by the top Democrats in the race, what are the tail risks for the banking industry specifically If we do have a democratic president? And is there a specific tail risk to a bank that perhaps focuses on high-net-worth clients?</p><p>IAN BREMMER: So I hope you don't have any bank in particular that you're thinking about. I mean, first of all, very clearly, Elizabeth Warren, her focus on enforcement, her focus on the banks, she talks about them a lot, and her focus on a wealth tax, which would apply not just to individual billionaires, but also to a lot of the people that are critical to this industry. Those are all things that imply she would be a truly problematic President.</p><p>She is clearly the front-runner right now. Biden has not run a good race. He -- those that are close to him say he's lost a couple of steps personally in -- compared to a year ago, 2 years ago. I certainly don't think he's going to get the nomination. But I don't think it's a slam dunk for Warren at all. I think that big tech, big industry, hedge funds, banking, finance broadly, the amount of money that they will now put towards other plausible candidates from the center to ensure that Warren doesn't get the nomination is high. And she's going to take an enormous amount of friendly fire on those issues as she did on health care, for example, in the last democratic debate, and she hasn't had to face that heretofore in the nomination. So that's one thing. I don't think -- she's the front runner, but I don't think she's 50% to get it by any means at this point.</p><p>Secondly, time-honored tradition in the United States, you run to the left or the right when you're running for the nomination. Once you have the nomination, you run to the center. I understand that a lot of people think, no, no, Warren won't do that. If Warren wants to win as opposed to win by 4 million popular votes but lose in swing states, she needs to move to the center. I mean, everyone talks about Trump's national numbers and how bad his national numbers are. When you look at Trump in those swing states, he is much better. When you look at how impeachment plays in those swing states, it's not a majority, there's a majority opposed to impeachment. It doesn't help the democrats in those swing states. And if you look at Warren's policies in those swing states, she's very vulnerable on fracking, on labor even. I mean it's just no. I don't believe it. So I think that she would have to tilt.</p><p>And then final point is the United States ultimately prevents a lot of aggressively anti-establishment policies from getting passed. I mean, Trump said he was going to drain the swamp. He is not draining the swap. On some occasions, he has tried to drain the swamp. It is not possible. This is a country that is vastly more captured by special interest, left wing and right wing. You can't fix the school system in the U.S. despite how much is spent on it because of the importance of teachers' unions state by state. You can't do it, right? You can't change the tech environment because of the power of big tech compared to what you see in Europe, right? You can't do it.</p><p>So if you ask me, even if Warren were to be President and she were to stay to the left, I think her ability to pass a lot of these policies in a way that would be meaningful through Senate would be seriously constrained. So I expect that the market will overreact to the dangers of Warren and it will not be warranted for all 3 of the reasons that I just suggested. But a fantastic and very relevant question.</p><p>Who else would like to go? One over here.</p><p>MICHAEL YOUNG, DIRECTOR - EQUITY RESEARCH, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY: Sure. Michael Young with SunTrust. I was curious, you kind of mentioned the bifurcation of the technology that may take place over the next 3 to 5 years. What role do you think that will play in terms of cybersecurity for companies and for the banking institution in the U.S.? And then maybe as a follow-up, too, just what percentage do you think that U.S. will capture as a whole of that sort of overall market versus maybe a Chinese-led offering?</p><p>IAN BREMMER: So the right thing -- I'll start with the last question. The right thing for the Americans to do would be to support a two-pronged process if they want to maximize what they get. The first would be, in the same way for climate change, you have an Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, IPCC, that created the baseline understanding of, okay, what are we talking about? What do we need to accomplish? Because if you don't agree on the basic facts, it's really hard to create policy. So you need an intergovernmental panel on AI and IP AI that needs to be set up a hell of a lot faster than the climate change because you don't have decades to figure this out. You've got a few years, right, max 2 to 5 years.</p><p>Then you need architecture that is -- that has teeth. You need a world trade organization for data, a world data organization, which the Chinese will not be a part of, but they would be invited to be a part of if they were to align with western standards, right? And over time, it would be so important for the Chinese not to be left out of everybody in the world data organization that they would need to adapt and align. Now you need the Europeans to join that, the Americans, the Japanese, you need the Indians.</p><p>The good news is that China is causing enough backlash on data and on tech that lots of countries are worried about it, and they would be aligned on this. The bad news is Trump doesn't like multilateralism. We hurt ourselves with Snowden even before that, and a lot of the European see the Americans as not having transparency on the stuff that they would trust, and not just Americans, Mexicans, Brazilians, others, right? And this massive tech lash happening, not just in the U.S. with Warren, but much more significantly in Europe with Margrethe Vestager and others who see these big tech companies as outside forces that they can tax and tax and tax, right? So it's really hard to get from here to there.</p><p>If you did what I just suggested, I think the U.S. would end up with a majority of the global marketplace in the near term and would be on a path to getting everybody back in place within 10 to 15 years. In other words, 100% functionally, right, give or take North Korea.</p><p>But if they don't do that, I think you're going to start losing significant countries. So the Europeans will split, and you'll have a bunch of countries like Italy and Greece and Poland. They will say, \"Well, we want to be with Western Europe, but we need this Chinese money, and they're the ones spending on Belt and Road. So we're going to join.\" And they get backed in; and the South Koreans, they get backed in; and the Indonesians, they get backed in; the Philippines, they get backed in; the Malaysians, they get backed in. That's a real problem, right?</p><p>Even countries like Brazil, where Bolsonaro was saying I won't work with Brazil, where do you think he went last week, right? You've got to work with the Chinese. There's no choice. So I do believe that -- and if that's the case, then the Americans are getting more like 50% of the global market, and they might lose eventually. There's no guarantee between the U.S. and China in a decoupled tech market that we win. We might. I hope we do. But the AI specialists I talk to aren't sure. And we're talking a 10-, 20-year fight.</p><p>But then -- and when I say, I don't mean the Chinese techs men. I don't mean like Kai-Fu Lee, who's in Beijing's pocket and has to be. I'm talking like Eric Schmidt, Reid Hoffman, Satya Nadella, Mustafa Suleyman, those guys. They really don't know. They really don't know. So this is a game changer in my view.</p><p>On the cyber side, I don't think it changes the way Americans think about cyber. The Chinese have been engaged mostly in using cyber to steal stuff. That will continue. There's no agreement between the U.S. and China on that. The Russians have been using it to break things. And that, for me, is the growing danger.</p><p>In the 2016 election, you guys remember Black Lives Matter. The most popular Black Lives Matter site on Facebook, 500,000 followers, was a fake Russian site. That's a disaster, right? The Chinese are not trying to take advantage of racist divisions inside the United States. The Russians are, and we don't need help, right? So that's a real problem.</p><p>And the fact that we, as a government, are unwilling to police that, and while Twitter just said they won't take political -- they'll take political ads off, Facebook has not said that because there's too much money to be made. And they don't want to be made into a political football, so as a consequence, let everybody take advantage of it, and we'll just be the neutral -- no arbiter, not our problem. That's a problem.</p><p>So I do think that I'd worry less about the cyber, are they going to break the financial institutions. I think the people that are vulnerable there, spending an awful lot of money trying to get ahead of the curve, I am more worried about what happens with fake news and algorithms where people are believing things that just aren't so. A very small amount of money can weaponize information in ways that cause serious problems for government and society. We have not figured it out. We're not close to figuring that out.</p><p>I've got time for, I think, 1 or 2 more. Who wants to go? One over here.</p><p>STEVEN A. ALEXOPOULOS: It's Steve Alexopoulos, JPMorgan. So on China, first, what do you think the odds are of a phase 2 deal ultimately getting done? And second, how do you think Hong Kong resolves with China?</p><p>IAN BREMMER: I think the chances of a phase 2 deal are functionally 0. The Chinese are actually offering less in this phase 1 deal than they were offering to Trump and to Lighthizer, et al, a few months ago when we had the back and forth. The Chinese, number one, believe that they've already expended political capital with Trump, and it hasn't gotten them very far, so Xi Jinping doesn't want to do that again. Secondarily, they understand the impact of the trade war is growing on the U.S. economy, 2020 compared to 2019, and Trump really wants to avoid that in the run-up to the elections. So for both of those reasons, the Chinese are really unwilling to go farther than where they are right now. They think it's in their advantage to wait Trump out. They're probably right.</p><p>Now I'm talking about a phase 2 deal in the remainder of the Trump administration. I'm not talking about what would happen in the next administration. I don't know. It depends on who's elected. It depends on where the Chinese economy is at that point. But I feel very confident about that pre-election call. The kinds of things that the Trump administration have demanded for the Chinese for a phase 2 deal, which means basically changing their legal system in terms of state subsidies and the ability to have sovereignty and autonomy over tariffs in an asymmetric way, the Chinese simply will not accept. Those are red lines. Those have been from day 1. So I don't think we're moving anywhere on that.</p><p>But let's keep in mind that the Huawei issue and the tech issue isn't part of this anyway. It's separate. And you now have just 2 weeks ago, 8 new Chinese AI companies, including national champions in the space that have been placed by the blacklist by the United States. And Congress saying that they will not allow Trump to put those companies back in play, even if he wants to. So really tying the hands of the President what happens to matter strategically most to the Chinese.</p><p>Your other question was about Hong Kong. I think the fact that President Xi in the last week has indicated that he is willing to let Carrie Lam go as Executive of Hong Kong implies that they now feel fairly confident that in the near term, they've broken the back of these demonstrations, close to where Macron eventually got by giving a little -- but generally also waiting them out with the gilets jaunes, the yellow vests. I think that's right.</p><p>School is back in session. The numbers we're seeing in Hong Kong on the streets are so much lower than they were. About 1,000 demonstrators have been arrested. Some have been released. Most are still in jail. It's a leaderless movement, but still, they got the people that had the most influence on the ground, those that played a bigger role in social media. And the Chinese said that they would fully withdraw the extradition law, which they have now done. So I think when you put those things together and the fact that tourism to Hong Kong is down over 50%, it's been a big hit on the economy, they feel pretty confident.</p><p>Now last week, you had the Fourth Plenum in China, which is a very important Chinese communist meeting. And coming out of that meeting, there was a press conference that I watched, and it was quite something to see the statements that were made about Hong Kong, which were not in any way talking about how we're going to find a modus vivendi with these people. It was, we are going to integrate them into our new Silicon Valley of China.</p><p>The role that Hong Kong used to play is not the role they're going to play in the future. Now this will lead to more demonstrations of young people long term. They don't care. Hong Kong in 1997 during the handover was 13.5% of the entire Chinese economy. Today, it's 2%. And that really changes the way you think about Hong Kong if you're in China. It really changes the way.</p><p>And it also means that for those international companies that have thought that they can do their China business out of Hong Kong, the answer is no. You should either be doing it in China, of which Hong Kong might be a China play, but you need to have reasons for that, or you're in Singapore. But the idea that Hong Kong is going to continue to play this conduit role over the next 5 to 10 years, no one -- they should be disabused of that.</p><p>Last question, who has the last one? Don't make me make something up, because I'll do it. We haven't talked about Russia, Brazil, Latin America is off. Who else? Nothing?</p><p>I'll tell you a final point then, give you something upbeat on. So populism, as you know, goes both left wing and right wing. Anti-establishment works in both directions. I want to be clear that in Brazil, you have an extraordinary populous movement that was really deeply angry at how the establishment in government, in congress, presidents were caught up with this strategic nasty corruption around infrastructure and Odebrecht and the rest. And as a consequence, they actually elected this complete outlier, Bolsonaro, who offends people on social media and he's close to the military and isn't really a lover of democracy. And yet, you now have, by far, the broadest economic structural reforms of any emerging market in the world being put into place by Bolsonaro, not just on pensions, but microeconomic reform, administrative reform, privatizations, sanitation measures, you name it. Brazil's economic outlook is going to be dramatically better as a consequence of that populism than what you had under Dilma Rousseff or Lula.</p><p>So let's not pretend. Just in the United States, a number of Trump's own policies, which he -- which came in on anti-establishment but would have been seen as very positive for the corporates, very positive for investment, that actually has the ability to happen in other countries, too. Anti-establishment sentiment just means you're going to throw the bums out. But what you end up with can be radically different from country to country.</p><p>In Argentina, it's pushing in one way. In Brazil, it's pushing in exactly the opposite. Really important to dig into those countries and be aware of that as opposed to just take this as a broad anti-market phenomenon. I think it's politics are playing a much greater role, but they're playing a greater role in opportunities in addition to risk.</p><p>That's my 40 minutes. Hope you have a great rest of your day. See all you, guys.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Ian, thank you so much. Terrific.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>DAVID B. LICHTMAN, SENIOR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: I want to thank Ian for assuring us we live in a calm and peaceful world. Now we're going to talk about credit a little bit. I'm David Lichtman, Chief Credit Officer of First Republic Bank. And as Jim had mentioned, I've been at the bank since 1986, my first job out of college, and I became Chief Credit Officer in 1995.</p><p>And with me today are Ruth Aronowitz. You've heard Ruth's client at the client panel earlier rave about her services, her responsiveness and how wonderful she is. And also with me is Garrett Sokoloff, who is one of our star relationship managers here in New York. So we're going to talk about our credit track record, performance and results and how we're able to achieve them.</p><p>This first slide here talks about our credit quality, going back for the past 8.5 years. If you look at the x-axis, it's compound annual growth rate of assets of First Republic compared to the top banks in the United States. On the y-axis, you see charge-off percentages. Most of the banks are concentrated in one area, 4% to 6% asset growth per year and about 50 to 100 basis points of charge-offs. You see First Republic in the bottom right, where we're at 20 basis -- 20% per year asset growth and only 2 basis points per year of charge-offs. In fact, we're the only bank over 10% in asset growth and under 25 basis points in charge-offs. So let's -- and this is, obviously, the last 8 years or so, has been a very good economic time.</p><p>So let's go back a little bit further. Let's go to the past 20 years, where we had the dot-com bubble burst, and we had The Great Recession, the financial crisis about 10 or so years ago. And we compare First Republic to the top 50 banks in the United States. First Republic are the smaller green bars, this is in terms of charge-offs; and the larger gray bars are the top 50 banks. First Republic averaged 6 basis points a year of charge-off, while the top 40 -- I'm sorry, the top 50 banks averaged 40 basis points a year. So we are about 6 to 7x better than the top 50 banks.</p><p>And let's even go back a little bit further to when First Republic started in 1985. And in that time frame, 34 years, we've originated a little over $250 billion of loans and have lost cumulatively 13 basis points in that time frame. About half of what we have done are home loans, and we've lost cumulatively 6 basis points in that 34-year period.</p><p>So how are we able to do this? There are a few key reasons why. One is we keep our standards high. Through the good times and through the bad times, we've always kept high standards. And one way to measure that is through a loan-to-value ratio. So look at our 5 real estate secured loan types: single family, home equity line, multifamily, commercial real estate and construction. And we looked at loan-to-value at origination and in 2 time segments: 2010 to 2014, the lighter green bars; and then 2015 to the present, the darker green bars.</p><p>And you can see in all cases, in the last 4 years, the loan-to-value ratios have dropped, and that was a conscious decision we made 4 years ago when real estate was getting very expensive, and we didn't think that trees could grow to the sky, and we got a little bit more conservative. Now in hindsight, we're a little bit early and a little bit maybe too conservative, but we still grew a lot, and we cut our loan-to-value ratios back in all loan types. This is just one measure of how we keep our standards high.</p><p>Another reason for our success has been the markets that we're in. We're in a small handful of markets. Look at our 4 key markets we've talked about: New York and Boston on the East Coast, and then San Francisco and L.A. on the West Coast. We've been in those markets for a very long time. And those 4 markets comprise about 85% of our loan portfolio. So we know the markets well, we know the employers, we know the neighborhoods, we know rents, we know cap rates, we know the key drivers of those local economies. And we're able to make smarter, more intelligent lending decisions client-by-client.</p><p>Additionally, we have a very small group of loan products: home loans and home equity lines, multifamily real estate, commercial real estate. We do a little bit of construction. And on the business lending side, as you heard earlier, we do primarily capital call lines and nonprofit lending to our clients. About 80% of our loans are real estate secured, and the real estate markets are doing quite well.</p><p>So let's -- let me turn this over to Ruth for a minute to talk about how it works on a day-to-day client-by-client situation. So Ruth?</p><p>RUTH ARONOWITZ, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thanks, David. I'm going to talk about the role of a relationship manager. I can remember about 20 years ago, my first day at the bank. I walked into the Park Avenue location, which was the only location we had in New York at the time. Walked into my office, sat down and said, \"Great. I have a computer, I have a phone, I have a desk, but I have absolutely no clients.\" My boss turned to me and said, \"Make it happen.\" So I have to say, over the last 20 years, all the RMs come into the bank every day and they make it happen.</p><p>To be a successful relationship manager, you really have to be an entrepreneur. You have to be able to build the business, you have to find your own clients and then you have to grow that business within the First Republic framework. Over the course of all these years, we've obviously hired a lot of entrepreneurs. As the slide indicates, we have booked over $200 billion of loans.</p><p>So RM is really the point person for the relationship. A client or a prospect will come in and ask for a mortgage, and you'll do a mortgage and you'll open up a checking account, but you really want to do more than that. I'd like to focus on the business that my client works at. I'd like to start talking about all of our depository services, what their day-to-day banking needs are and then we'll probably move on to maybe doing a loan. Or as you heard my client talk about on the panel, we provide leverage from certain employees in a credit fund. So we'll do a partner loan program. Now all of this can't happen unless we really are partnering with people in our preferred banking teams, business banking group and our credit folks.</p><p>Now as the client becomes more and more successful financially, they want to do more things with us. Most of my clients have come to me because they want to trade up and get a more expensive primary home, so we'll work on a mortgage for that. Then they'll want to buy a vacation home, a second home. So they'll come back to me again and talk about a mortgage. Then they'll have a liquidity event. Maybe they've sold the business. Maybe they've had a distribution or they got a very large bonus. So we have the opportunity to introduce them to a portfolio manager from the First Republic Investment Management. And from there, we certainly work on financial planning with them, we work on estate planning and then they'll start using our trust services. Remember, over 50% of the new loans that we do are from our existing client base. Now all this new business is great for the bank, it's great for the clients and it's also great for the relationship managers because their compensation will increase as they do more things with their clients.</p><p>Our comp program is unlimited. It's uncapped. In my mind, that is very, very motivating. And it also makes for a lot of very happy employees who never want to leave the bank. I'll also say the people and the culture make it a great place to work. Getting back to the comp plan. If there is a problem loan situation, we do have a clawback provision that's built into the plan.</p><p>When you have a problem loan, it really is your problem and you try to avoid it at all costs. So as a result, relationship managers really do spend the time with credit in structuring deals. And a relationship manager is not going to recommend a loan unless they feel it's a very, very safe credit. So overall, the relationship managers, they know their clients very well and they really do more and more business with them over the years.</p><p>I'm going to turn it over to Garrett now.</p><p>GARRETT SOKOLOFF, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thanks, Ruth. So I think one of the keys to success is the interaction between the Executive Loan Committee and relationship managers. I joined the bank 8 years ago after spending the previous 13 years at Bear Stearns and UBS, different cultures, different places. I was having dinner one night, about 9 years ago with a client at UBS at the time who I'd sold about 25 properties to. And over dinner, he and his wife and my wife and I, he said to me, you don't seem happy. Let me introduce you to this great little bank on the West Coast. Never in 1,000 years could I have imagined that I'd be working at First Republic today, but it was that dinner that brought me here to First Republic.</p><p>So the relationship between David's world, the Executive Loan Committee, and Ruth and I on the relationship manager side, it's a partnership. It is not adversarial. My success is bringing the ELC into the process early.</p><p>Education. We think about what ELC does on a quarterly basis. We hold quarterly ELC meetings to learn what's going on in all the various markets that we're operating in, so that David and the team can make choices as to maybe it is the right time for us to pull back our LTVs a little bit.</p><p>We do training. So ELC will lead every year a residential loan underwriting class. They do the same thing for commercial real estate. Most recently, right here in New York, we had a tax return analysis class. So all those things are stemming from what's going on at the top of the bank in the Executive Loan Committee.</p><p>Besides -- excuse me, for ELC members, we have full-time Executive Loan Committee members in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, L.A., Newport, San Diego, Boston and New York. And again, their job is to interact every day, not just with relationship managers, but with our clients as well. That's really one of the key things that we -- how we differentiate ourselves, is we bring our credit or Executive Loan Committee team out with us on the road.</p><p>I want to give you a story, an example of how this really works. So about a year ago in an annual check-in with someone who had around $75 million of loans outstanding, myself and a senior member of our Executive Loan Committee went to visit them, just to check in, to say thank you for the business.</p><p>What we learned was a few things. First, unfortunately, both of his parents had recently passed away. As terrible as that was, one of the things we wanted to ensure was, was he okay from a liquidity perspective for the estate tax that was going to be due. Fortunately, this is a very well-heeled individual. He can get it covered. But we also learn the parents were the glue. And with the parents both passing away, these 4 siblings no longer wanted to work with each other, which was pretty sad. So the gentleman we were in front of said, \"Can you help me figure out a way to buy out 2 of my siblings?\"</p><p>The good news is the loans on our books are around 30% LTV. It was around $85 million at the time, and we had $10 million of deposits. So because I was there, and we listened. And of course, we need to do our due diligence, but we were able to give that client the confidence in that moment that we were going to be there for them, that we were going to deliver.</p><p>Fast forward about 6 months ago, we made both of those 2 new loans. That client today has outstanding balances of $32 million in deposits and $136 million in really well-yielding loans for the bank. So that is just a practical example of how the partnership works with relationship managers like myself and Ruth and David and his team.</p><p>One thing I wanted to stress is unlike most banks where there is this constant struggle between credit and loan originators, First Republic has this unique partnership between the 2. Executive Loan Committee members, they're not scary. They are our colleagues. They sit with us. We tour properties together. They help teach younger, newer relationship managers. We see them in the FRB Eagle Caf\u00e9. We think it's a partnership. And every day when we work together, it ensures we provide the client with great service, fast responses. And at the end of the day, we're making lots of safe loans.</p><p>So that's -- last 3 things I should just cover as I look at the slide. The ratio between ELC and relationship managers, there's 1 ELC member to every 6. That's an astonishing ratio. And that's what helps keep us safe every day. And then the average experience for members on David's team is 29 years in this banking industry. So we are really proud of what we get to do every day. And as long as we continue to think of it as a partnership, I know we've got a bright future ahead of us.</p><p>DAVID B. LICHTMAN: Thank you, Garrett. Garrett's example of the client and the increasing of the relationship and meeting their needs, we have thousands, literally thousands of those examples throughout the bank. And that's how the bank got built, as Jim started from bank number 14,000 with no assets to where we are today, one relationship like that at a time.</p><p>I want to go back to one point that Ruth talked about in terms of the credit clawback that we've had since 1986. If you're a relationship manager, like Ruth and Garrett are, and if they did make a loan, they're at risk for approximately 5x the bonus they made on that loan. So they have no incentive to make a bad loan and have it go to the workout group, which is what happened at most banks. They have a strong incentive to work with the credit team to make sure we're making good, safe and sound loans. And that's the way we've been functioning for 30-plus years.</p><p>Lastly, I want to talk about giving back to the community here and doing the right thing for our community, which has been a focal point for the bank, not just in lending, but in all aspects. So on the lending front, about 13% of our home loans are to low- to moderate-income borrowers. This is across all of the markets, all of the regions. And almost 30% are loans -- home loans in low- to moderate-income census tracks. So these are people -- helping getting people into their homes, into their first house. And over the past 7 or 8 years, we've originated almost $5 billion of community development loans. These are loans going into the community to -- for nonprofits, to help businesses, to help organizations grow and expand.</p><p>And then lastly, on the investment side, we invest in low-income housing tax credits. And these tax credits are used to build or renovate low and moderate-income apartments throughout the country, and we have approximately $1.6 billion of those outstanding now.</p><p>And that concludes our presentation. Let me turn this over to Mike Roffler and Olga.</p><p>OLGA TSOKOVA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: So David just talked about our pristine credit quality, which we have demonstrated throughout our history. And now we're going to talk about something new, CECL, which is an accounting change. When you think about how CECL impacts First Republic, 2 things are important: one, history and our low historical losses matter; and second, the life of the loan, which is the expected life of the loan adjusted for prepayments.</p><p>And just to remind you the way how CECL works, you start with a reasonable and supportable forecasting period, which now, in our case, is 2 years and when -- you revert back to historical losses for the remainder of the life of the loan, and the again, our historical losses were very low.</p><p>So how does CECL impact us? And actually, the CECL is not expected to have significant impact on our financial statements. And again, why? Because of our low historical losses and relatively low life -- relatively short life of the loan portfolio. Directionally, if we look at the single family and multifamily, commercial real estate and student loan refinance portfolios, we expect CECL's going to increase the reserves because those portfolios have longer life compared to our current methodology. And CECL will decrease quantitative reserves for some of our shorter-lived portfolios. And again, we're talking here about the quantitative reserves, which doesn't include the qualitative component of that.</p><p>So during 2019, we have completed 3 parallel runs. And based on the results of the last parallel run we had for September, we expect that CECL will change our reserves by approximately 5% to 10%, and the impact on the regulatory capital will be less than 10 basis points.</p><p>Importantly, the actual impact of CECL will impact -- will be impacted by economic conditions, forecasts, macroeconomic forecasts as well as portfolio composition at the time we adopt the CECL. And as I mentioned, we have completed 3 parallel runs this year, but we continue to refine our models and methodology. We continue to refine some of our qualitative framework and address some other implementation steps, which include finalizing and refining the controls over CECL process as well as data, but we are well positioned to complete those steps by January 1, 2020.</p><p>And just to recap, CECL is just an accounting change. It does not impact the way how we do business.</p><p>And now I'll turn it over to Mike, and he will talk about how our financial management supports our exceptional client service.</p><p>MICHAEL J. ROFFLER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thank you, Olga. And the last point, I think, you made was an important one there because you're going to lend money, and you're going to collect when you collect. This is just a difference in sort of how it runs through over time, and safe credit will matter in all periods.</p><p>So you've heard a lot today about the bank's business model, and so we thought we would talk a little bit about how that then interacts with how we think about financial management overall of the company. On the left side here, you see the things we've talked about and then how, on the right, we think about it financial management-wise. So what is it about acquiring great households, giving a differentiated service? You heard from clients earlier today and the experience they've had. And then grow with them over time. So how does that work from a financial perspective? Get trial. We have to be competitive on pricing. There was a comment about rate. Home loan rates have to be competitive, but get them here to experience what Ruth has to offer, what Garrett has to offer, and they'll do more with you over time, and that creates a lifetime value. And when I say lifetime value, I'll show you a visual of that on the next page, but not one that thinks about client ROE. It's not about the individual client ROE. It's about the value that they bring from a relationship over a long period of time.</p><p>Again, you want to be that lead bank to grow over time. Ruth talked about the compensation and being unlimited, retaining client, deepening relationships. It's not about a transaction, right? We're happy to pay you for the value of a client over a long period of time because you're deepening that relationship, and history has shown, they will grow with us over time.</p><p>Now you saw the teamwork also. Everybody talked about that, wealth management, the people who talked about professional lending, the clients, frankly. Again, it's about the holistic view of the bank and bringing everything to the client from all disciplines with inside. So you operate with that team. We don't worry about cost accounting or most importantly, cost allocation. It's a bit of a taboo subject because it gets in the way of what's best for the client, right? A wealth person, a relationship manager, in a lot of firms, they'll argue about who pays for the lunch or who pays for the cost of the event. It doesn't happen here. We think about it holistically from the overall relationship standpoint. And at the end of the day, what that has helped is you've got financial results consistently over time.</p><p>David talked about our credit standards. That helps us maintain those consistent financial results with a growing balance sheet because we are maintaining very high standards through all cycles. And finally, it's important to be there at all times for our client base, right? They are active. Including in times of downturn, there will be opportunities. It's important for us to be very well capitalized to enable them and be there for them when those opportunities arise. So it really all fits together nicely when you think about the business model and then how financial sort of supplements that.</p><p>Okay. Here's a bit of an example of a visual of why it's important to gain trial early. So you've heard about professional lending, student loan refinance, also the client base we have. This really shows what we're doing today is planting seeds for the future.</p><p>So on the left side, we've got the millennial and generation X, which is about 70% of our total households, be it borrowing, deposit-only, wealth. So it's a big chunk of the bank. But they're earlier in their life, right? So their liquidity, if you think about it from an assets and deposit standpoint, you know it's only about, call it, just under 40% of the bank. But as they mature, and the baby boomer and silent generation are examples of this, they become more liquid and all of a sudden that skews. So think about all the households we have today becoming the next generation from a liquidity standpoint. When Jim talked about doubles within size, that's what one of the things we referenced. There is great -- because we have urban professionals who are going to continue along in their life, they'll generate more liquidity. Frankly, they borrow less as they get out here. And now liquidity then gets put to work where the new next generation will come from. And so this is why lifetime value and sort of the way we think about it is really important and why those future seeds of growth will lead to liquidity growth out in the future. And whether it's deposits or wealth, we're a bit agnostic because, again, its relationship with the client.</p><p>All right. So you heard us talk a lot over the years about investments that we make for exceptional service and future growth as a franchise. We're always thinking about this because the opportunity is so great, which you heard about earlier today, right? It would almost be wrong of us not to keep investing when the next opportunity comes along because the markets that we're in are so vibrant and the client base is so willing to refer and tell their friends about us and do more with us.</p><p>Okay. So along a couple of avenues, exceptional service. Hiring is really important to First Republic. Culture, values, focus on service. Not just anyone comes in. It's a really robust process. Last week, I heard someone, I think they're on their fourth visit, and we're still not quite sure, and they've met with probably 20 people. You just have to be sure.</p><p>But then, I think Jeff talked about this earlier today. Yes, producers are serving clients, but they need a support team. And so you help them. You fill the team with younger, up-and-coming people who want to be in the client service business also. That helps Jeff, Ruth, Garrett grow their books even more. And so that's a modest investment that we make, but the teams are really key to answering when the clients call sometimes also.</p><p>And then finally, we're going to hear about a little bit about this, I think, towards the end of the day, but investing in our technology and operations to make sure we can scale this high-touch business model as we continue to grow and add clients.</p><p>Then there are some other things we do that really help drive growth and also our seeds for the future. So earlier today, Bob mentioned, we just announced wealth management teams who are attracted to the bank's holistic view of how we serve a client, from a deposit, lending and wealth perspective and a good fit, and that's really been done in all of our markets. Also, you heard about student loan refinance, next-generation client professional lending. Again, future growth. And then also, preferred banking offices. We don't -- for a bank our size, we don't have very many offices. However, they're strategically placed. They are very good service points for our clients. They also drive new business. And lastly, it's a reinforcement of our brand, right? If you go down Madison Avenue, you know first Republic is there because we look for visibility where we can reinforce the brand, and it makes us appear as if we're in more places than we probably are because it's so visible.</p><p>All of these things do require us to spend money, right? You can't grow at the rates you've seen on the charts today without that investment in people, technology, location, and we're very thoughtful and methodic about where the best place to do that is and when.</p><p>Okay. So capital Markets, we've been very active over the past 3 years, common, preferred also several preferred redemptions. Really, as the market has improved, it's allowed us to even further optimize our preferred stock cost and sort of our capital structure. I can go back at least today in 1985, I'm looking at Jim, maybe in 1980, we've always had an incremental approach when we think about capital, right? Small, bite-size approach don't upset the market too much. Really, don't go too far and make a bet all at once either. This will continue in the future. Our approach is always like this. When is a good question. And I know you'll probably want to ask it in Q&amp;A. But it's always about opportunity and when we think the timing is right to fortify the capital base. And also, it's a signal about our prospect of growth, too, because the capital we're raising is offensive for growth, right? It's not from a defensive standpoint. It's really supporting the future and as we look out in the bank.</p><p>Okay. So we want to show hypothetical because I think of this as sort of a growth expense, right, provision for loan loss. Right now, we provide about 12 basis points of average loans in any given period for the last 5 or 6 years, roughly. Charge-offs are 0.5 basis point, right? Now I probably can never provide just for charge-offs, but there is a bit of a drag, and that difference is about $34 million a year. And if our credit stays high, this still exists for us even when we go to CECL. But people talk about, \"Oh, it's going to be more to your income statement.\" We already have this. Other banks may not have this today. But this is sort of a growth cost that eventually, over time, gets paid because you weren't on the loans.</p><p>You can see here, we've gone through several inversions over the sort of life of the bank and managed through quite well. This last inversion has mostly corrected. I think we're back to what I'd call relatively flat, but it was pretty quick, and it was pretty sudden during the third quarter. But importantly, we were there for our clients. Right now, the terrific refinance opportunity, right? It's a great moment for client acquisition. Are the margins less than maybe we had thought? Yes, but that doesn't mean you walk away, and you're also there to serve your existing clients. Yes, the margin is down from where it was at the start of the year. But importantly, net interest income is growing, and the growth of net interest income allows us to make all those investments I just talked about because the balance sheet continues to grow at a very good pace, just a little bit less of a margin than maybe we would have hoped.</p><p>All right. Importantly, it's about a consistent balance sheet management over a long period of time. I can almost put this chart up in any given 10 years. It's probably pretty close to how we operate, right? Lending, focused on the full relationship, tight credit standards, make sure you're there all the time. Investments, 12% high-quality liquid assets. I think we said that a lot, but also opportunistically add to the portfolio when time -- when there's a good time to do that, and we've built a very good municipal bond portfolio over the years.</p><p>Largely deposit-funded. You've heard almost 59% checking. Again, the last sort of 2 years, we've used a bit of a barbell instead of repricing money markets focused on CDs, coupled with a checking relationship because, again, it brings a household to the bank or it deepens the relationship with the bank. And that's been a good way for us to manage sort of the cost of funds over the past couple of years.</p><p>And lastly, we do use the Federal Home Loan Bank as a source of fixed-rate term funding. I will tell you today, rates today are better than they were a year ago. And so that also -- as things start to mature, rates for our new borrowings should be a bit better.</p><p>All right. Just a couple more. So a couple of pages ago, we talked about what happened with the sharp drop in interest rates during sort of the summertime. And we had to sort of reset where the margin was going to operate within. There wasn't a lot of time, right, to adjust your expense base. Now you've had this -- are we in a new normal? Maybe. And so we look at our expense base from a few different lenses to see where can we optimize or manage a little bit differently, if, in fact, this is the new paradigm we're going to be under. And we sort of have 3 buckets that we think about. First is really, I'm going to say, they're off limits. If it's tied to exceptional service, risk management or long-term growth initiatives, we're not going to sacrifice that. So even in the last 90 days, 3 or 4 wealth teams we've hired because that has great long-term potential for the bank.</p><p>Now then there's sort of opportunities that exist. And the biggest one is around -- this is always about the pace of growth. It's never about announcing the cost reduction program, right? You hear lots of people talk about that. This is about the pace at which we grow. And obviously, personnel is 2/3 of our costs. So can you grow a little bit slower? Can you wait a little bit without sacrificing service, risk, et cetera? And so we look at that, and we manage it, and we talk about it. And so I think that's a place where we go very thoughtfully. And are there places we could do that to deal with a more challenging rate environment. And I have some listed here, sublease some real estate that we're going to -- again, we took, we'll grow into over time, but we can sort of spread the cost out over time.</p><p>And then lastly, if there's quick wins with vendors, licenses, maybe some internal events, we'll try to deal with those very quickly. If -- to more aligned, this is about aligning our expense growth and revenue growth, right? Revenue growth, still very good, and I'm going to show you some charts to close that show that, but it's slower than it's been, which is a function of the margin environment we're operating in. So how do we rightsize and adjust our growth of expenses to better match that? And that's really what happened in the third quarter, most recently, but something that we'll obviously be focused on.</p><p>So these last few slides are sort of some metrics and comparisons against the bank index. But the thing I would harken is there's nothing more than one client at a time, one interaction at a time, one relationship, one referral. Every day, it's a culmination of what those relationships are and what they bring to us.</p><p>So this compares to the KBW Bank Index on a couple of growth metrics. You can see, on a 5-year basis, loan and deposits, multiple of 6x the annual growth. Revenue, about 5x -- no, 8x, I can't do math, 8x annual growth. Significant outperformance from a growth perspective. And importantly, as you see charge-offs, essentially negligible for the past 5 years. And this has been a good market environment. I mean those credit metrics are good for everybody. But they're essentially negligible here at the bank. And so you've been growing while keeping credit clean. And what has that led to? Growth in tangible book of about 14%, which is an ultimate measure we think about because, as Jim said earlier, that's cash, that's real. And then obviously, the shareholder return is what others have thought.</p><p>So with that, I think it's a good 5-year summary and where to go and how we've done in the last few years. Mike is going to, I think, take us out to maybe a short break.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: Yes. Thank you, Mike. We're going to take a short break now, everyone, for about 15 minutes. If you could please be back in your seats by 2:30. Thank you very much.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: Hi. If everyone could please take their seats, so that we can get started.</p><p>Thank you very much. I'm just going to welcome Gaye Erkan, President, back to the stage. Thank you.</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: Okay. Great. So we started our conversation this morning talking about how First Republic is a service organization that just happens to be a bank. And our secret sauce is our culture of extraordinary service delivered by empowered teams. And joining me here today are 2 of our empowered team leaders and trusted advisers, entrepreneurs, Fatema Arande, our Head of East Coast Deposits; and Samir Kaji, Senior Managing Director, leading our venture capital and technology practice.</p><p>Just like anything else at First Republic, it all starts with the client, and it's all about the client. And when we talk to our clients, yes, they love banking with First Republic. But most importantly, for them, for our clients, it's all about their trusted advisers. It's about Ruth. It's about Samir. It's about Fatema.</p><p>And in that context, the role of technology is really about empowering our people. Scaling First Republic is through scaling our entrepreneurs to perform at their peak. It's not technology for the technology's sake. It is technology to empower these entrepreneurs. How do we do that? We'll talk about the empower program that basically is driven by these main pillars: Eagle Intelligence and continuous process improvement, we'll talk about it more in-depth next. Innovation is all about rapid prototyping to ensure what we deliver fits the needs and expectations of our bankers, of our entrepreneurs as well as our clients. And trust and delegate. We are a growth company, so it is important that we hire the right people and trust them and delegate them with the client accountability. Of course, what are better ways than making an investment into our people through lifelong learning.</p><p>So I'll turn it to Fatema to walk us through the continuous process improvement initiatives, please?</p><p>FATEMA ARANDE, HEAD OF EAST COAST DEPOSITS, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Gaye. Thank you very much. Continuous process improvement. It's one way that we encourage and empower our colleagues to bring forth their ideas to life. We started this in 2017. Over 900 ideas were generated. Almost 200 of those has already been implemented. The ideas came from our colleagues from all the different channels, especially our frontline. And what did they do with this time? They use the time that they saved. That was 230,000 hours that they have gained. That is equivalent to a 2.4% equivalent workforce expansion.</p><p>Let me give you an example of how successful this initiative has been. Deposit client onboarding. It's a platform that we have formed to build to take care of our -- to open accounts for our clients. Our clients, what took them about 40 minutes to open an account, today, takes them less than 20 minutes. So our colleagues are saving over 20 minutes. That's a 50% reduction. And what are our colleagues saying? Well, here are some of the testimonials. Simplify the process. I had the support to get it done. Email the bot. Relationship managers on the go. Quick response, and second to none. Our clients love it.</p><p>And if I could speak personally here, I've been here for almost 20 years. All the greatest ideas have always come from our colleagues. Their ideas that we just talked about, the deposit client onboarding, which allows us to open accounts to the cookies, the fresh-baked cookies that you guys just ate outside and the reading glasses in the offices. Our colleagues know our clients really well. And our colleagues are enabled and elevated through CPI to service them.</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: And the great ideas do come from our grassroots, from our frontline, right? The cookies and the eyeglasses.</p><p>FATEMA ARANDE: Yes.</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: They have been. So listening to our colleagues who are actually serving the clients and leading the continuous process improvements with their feedback is a game-changer.</p><p>So switching to Eagle Intelligence. Thank you, Fatema. Switching to Eagle Intelligence. Eagle Intelligence is about the power of data and analytics. But what is data? Data is just a history of some information. Data is most powerful, however, when used by caring people like Fatema to guide client service, and that's what Eagle Intelligence is all about. Eagle Intelligence is at the service of our trusted advisers. What does it do? It provides our entrepreneurs, our trusted advisers, with tearsheets to enable them to prospect more effectively, to talk to our clients knowing which nonprofits, which missions they care more about.</p><p>What is Eagle Miner? Eagle Miner is a client insights engine. It takes information, and it turns it out to actionable intelligence at the fingertips of our bankers. It could be as easy as which client to call, when and why. And it could be as simple as birthdays or First Republic anniversaries or it could be as complicated as which client may need a consultation because they may be going through a liquidity event soon.</p><p>Not only is it an actionable intelligence engine, it is also self-learning. Because just like anything else at First Republic, it's got to be customized to our banker's liking. So every banker has the option to either like the recommendation or to dismiss it. And based on their choices, the engine self learns, so that it's customized going forward to our banker's preferences.</p><p>Quant for Banker. Before I explain what it is, let me just share that it's concierge, quant analytics services for our bankers. Those bankers who have been paired with quant partners since the launch of the program in June 2018 have grown their deposits 2x faster than those who are not paired to their quant partner.</p><p>So let's dig into it a little bit more. What is Quant for Banker? And what's the mission of that? Majority of our teams are serving 200 to 600 households each. There are some teams who are serving way more than that in terms of households. So we basically observe those top-performing teams. We observe everything. We observe which report they read most. We observe which type of alert that they use most, what type of team structures that they have. We learn their best practices, and we advise others at First Republic, basically harnessing the collective wisdom of First Republic through the quant partner.</p><p>The best way to explain that for you, actually, is to hear firsthand from one of our beneficiaries, from one of our entrepreneurs, Samir.</p><p>SAMIR KAJI, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: Thanks, Gaye. And it's fantastic to be here, and thank you for allowing me to speak on a topic I'm very passionate about.</p><p>Before I dive into that, however, I want to point everyone to the word hospitality. It's an important one. For me that means a service culture that's centered around highly personalized client experiences and ones that are highly predictive and proactive in nature. How do we achieve that? Well, we ask ourselves some key questions, how do we do it at scale? Are we truly being proactive with our relationships? Are we consistently creating meaningful and relevant client touch points? And when we do go after new business, are we prospecting effectively as not to take away important time with our existing clients?</p><p>So how do we do that? Well, one way we do that is data and information. I think those 2 are important components of allowing us to continue the service model. Our team, for example, since we started using analytics, has doubled our business in 18 months. And we have a quant, his name is [Ali], who's fantastic. He is an embedded part of our core relationship team.</p><p>I want to walk you through some examples of how this works in practice. As everyone knows, the venture capital and private equity industry are core business segments of ours. We also know from experience that the best firms in the world call capital from their limited partners no more than 3 to 4x a year. So we created a dashboard that tracks capital call activity for all of our funds. And for the funds that have called capital more than 3x in the preceding 12 months, we reach out to them and offer them a solution to optimize their fund operations through a capital call line of credit. By doing this, we've created a lot of wow moments with clients that know that we're constantly looking after their needs and more importantly, our trusted team member that sits on the same side of the table.</p><p>The graph on the right relates to our deposit-oriented technology start-up banking business. While we don't perceive the same lending strategy as other institutions, it doesn't mean we can't add value. So one of the things we know about start-ups is their financial life cycle is fairly predictable. They raise money from investors. Over time, that depletes until the next equity round. Instead of waiting for the next equity round to occur, we reach out because we have a dashboard that shows monthly cash burn for these companies. So we know those rounds before they happen. We reach out and offer them relevant products, cash management solutions and the benefit of our vast VC network.</p><p>Shifting gears to going after new clients. While we operate in a virtuous cycle where many of our new clients come from our existing happy clients, we look to augment that with our own business development efforts. However, given our focus on the existing portfolio, me and my team have limited time to go after new clients. And the onuses is on us to be effective with our time and go after the highest-value targets. So we created a model within the VC industry, which is a prospect-ranking model. We determine a number of inputs that we believe speak to the attractiveness of a particular prospect and the probability of conversion. These inputs are things like signal strength, of LinkedIn contacts, whether they have a loan with another institution, and by looking at their current funds' dry powder, when they might be coming to market with their next fund. This feeds into an algorithm, which produces a ranking model that allows me and my team to spend time with the highest-value targets. We've only been using it for 3 months. But it's already produced an opportunity where we secured a $25 million deposit opportunity with a brand-new client, a client that we otherwise wouldn't have seen.</p><p>The really important thing here that I want to impress on everyone is these models that I just spoke about are foundational pieces that can be applied across business segments and client types. And I'm very excited to be part of the team that is putting the data infrastructure in place to allow us to execute on hospitality at scale.</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: And now putting the models aside for 1 second, if you put it all together, the entire empower program, what does empower mean to you and to your colleagues?</p><p>SAMIR KAJI: Put simply, it's simply providing me the ingredients to be a successful entrepreneur. Now there's a lot of ingredients, but there's a few that I want to highlight. One is the strength and stability of the First Republic brand, a brand that stands for our best-of-breed client service. It's the ability to have an open architecture where I can bring the right group of clients for each specific client. And it's the data and information that gives me the actionable intelligence to spend my time wisely and offer the most value to my client set.</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: And to sum it all, it's really going back what Jim started today with happy people, when empowered, happy clients. He also mentioned happy shareholders. And when our clients are happy, deepening relationships and more referrals, that is the fulfillment of satisfying our clients and happier people. So the empower program is really to amplify First Republic's service model. It's to scale our people to scale our service culture as we go forward, fueling the virtuous cycle of happiness at First Republic.</p><p>Let's hear what our colleagues have to say about empower.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: And with that, I would like to thank Fatema and Samir for joining us, and I would love to welcome Jason Bender and Scott Finder to talk about tech-ops. Thank you.</p><p>JASON C. BENDER: Hello again. Jason Bender. Again, I'd like to reintroduce Scott Finder, our Chief Digital Officer. For those of you who may recognize him from the video earlier, he is also our Chief Carnival Barker. Scott's team was the one that won the Halloween costume last week when we had that down at San Francisco.</p><p>What we wanted to do this afternoon now is just take a few more minutes to dive in a little bit deeper into technology and operations, namely to try to explain what our priorities are. There's a lot of talk in the industry about technology and priorities and budgets and spend and across a lot of different banks. I want to share with you what's important to First Republic, what our priorities are, and then give you a little bit of a sneak preview of some things that we're working on in the digital space.</p><p>So let me start with a quote from Steve Jobs here because I think it's particularly relevant to how we look at technology, \"You have to start with the customer experience and then work backwards to the technology.\" We would add to that, the customer or employee or colleague experience because as you heard from some of the prior presentations, we focus almost as much on internal technology as we do on external technology. The reason for that is pretty simple. I mean if we have 1 advantage as a bank, it's the human relationships that we've developed over time. It's that single point of contact, that trusted adviser and the relationship that those people have with their clients. And in a world that is increasingly about digitization and self service and squeezing the humanity out of those relationships, we want to be a little bit different. We want to use technology, really, to leverage and to promote and to encourage and empower those relationships. And so that's really the lens that we view all of our technology and all of our operations activities through just as it's the lens that we use for almost everything else we do at First Republic.</p><p>So you heard this earlier in a presentation that Gaye made. When we think about technology, we think about technology as empowering that high-touch service model. For us, our tech-ops priorities are really threefold. Number one, we want to make sure that we're using technology to delight our clients. We want our clients to have a good experience, and we understand that in today's world, some of that experience takes place online or on mobile devices. So we want to make sure that our technology reflects that.</p><p>Number two, and equally importantly, we want to use technology to empower our colleagues. You just heard from Fatema and Samir about ways in which we're doing that. We'll dig in and give you a couple of other examples here, too.</p><p>And then importantly, we also are behind the scenes investing very methodically in upgrading our infrastructure. We started this process about 2 years ago. We're making good progress. There's probably another 2 years left to go. But for us, this is important because we're a company that grows every year, and we want to make sure that we have a foundation that scales with the company and accommodates that growth well into future. So that's an important component and focus for us.</p><p>All right. Let's go through each of these 3 things briefly. So delighting clients. You've already heard some good examples of that, but let me give you a couple of other ones. So number one, digital mortgage applications. So we launched this about 2 years ago now. And the reason that I highlight digital mortgage applications is because we've approached it a little bit differently. We're not out there trying to be a nationwide lender through our digital mortgage application. Instead, we use the digital mortgage application as a tool between the relationship manager and the client to make for a smoother and better, happier experience. And what's interesting is even for a bank that does about 60% of its lending and mortgages and emphasizes that human relationship and channel between 50% and 70% of our mortgages today are being completed online, that's pretty powerful. And that's creating efficiencies to the client. It's also creating efficiencies for the banker. It's allowing the bank and the client to spend their time together on higher value-add conversations.</p><p>This one is more of an internal way that we use technology. But again, it's a great example of how we deploy technology to improve the client experience. So this is a homegrown application. It's built off of our own client databases. And what it does is when there is any kind of natural disaster, we can very quickly highlight the regions or the zones that are impacted by that disaster, generate a list of clients and employees that may be impacted and get that list out to the bankers right away. It also provides a way for them to very quickly acknowledge whether they've reached the client, does the client need help? Everybody okay? Anything we can do? That's what you see there on the -- in that click-down box. We use this for real all the time. In fact, just last week, we were using it to address some of the wildfires in California.</p><p>Now the good news is that our clients are okay, but this is unique. This is an interesting way to take technology and turn that into a client-service proposition. And we hear from our clients all the time, the gratitude that they feel, when they've got bankers contacting just to make sure their families are okay when there's an emergency.</p><p>We've also used it, by the way, to address our own employees. We can see very quickly with the same map whether we have any employees that are impacted by these things. And it's not just limited to California wildfires. We can use it during hurricanes. We can use it during blizzards, storms. It's been a great tool for us.</p><p>Empower colleagues. So this was what Samir and Fatema we're talking about here, to give you a couple of other quick examples of this. And Gaye took us through the 5 different pillars of the empower program that we have at First Republic, which is really a concerted and disciplined effort to make sure that as we grow, we are scaling that culture and that we are continually empowering and rethinking how to empower our colleagues.</p><p>The 3 you see highlighted here are the 3 elements of empower that really have a tech component to them. Now you heard a lot about Eagle Intelligence already. You heard about continuous process improvement. What about a couple of examples of innovation, how are we doing that? Here's 1 example. So if you think about that continuous process improvement program that we have, that's really a homegrown program, and it's very grassroots. What we said about doing process improvement at First Republic, we decided we wanted to do this a little bit differently, because let's face it, in a lot of places, process improvement is about downsizing. And that's the perfect way to make sure that you don't get the best ideas from the frontline about the processes that actually need to be improved. And so we said we want to do this a little bit differently. We want the best ideas. We want this to come from all corners of the organization. And so we've approached it that way.</p><p>What you see here is the use of technology to create a platform where ideas can be submitted, shared, reviewed and voted on by every employee in the company. We just launched this about a year ago, and already today, about half of our employee base has logged in and have voted almost 5,000 times on a variety of different ideas submitted. The idea that we just talked about, the natural disaster app, that was an idea submitted by an employee into this platform voted on by the company, prioritized and then rapidly developed and implemented. So again, this by itself is the use of technology and innovation to empower our employees, make them feel part of the process and to make sure that we're acting on the best ideas.</p><p>SCOTT D. FINDER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF DIGITAL OFFICER, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: So you're beginning to see how we're using technology. But I'll take a moment now and talk about how we approach the technology itself. So just a few weeks ago, we migrated our debit card processing system to a new system provided by Visa. This is the system that handles our ATM transactions and purchase transactions. And with this came an opportunity for us to build something on top of it internally. We wanted to create a card notifications engine, an alerts engine to tell clients when they made purchases. And so we decided to try something a little different that we've been working on, which is a more modern software development methodology.</p><p>So normally, to build an alerts notification or a similar type platform, it would take about 3 to 6 months. By using a more modern methodology and developing it securely in the cloud, this project was conceived, prototyped, developed and launched in just 2 weeks. And now that platform can be used for other notifications across the bank. So this is something that's exciting for us as we think about how we rapidly develop and innovate.</p><p>JASON C. BENDER: Let me comment briefly on some of the investments in infrastructure that we have made and are making. And then I'm going to turn it back over to Scott who's going to share with you some of what we're working on in our digital space.</p><p>So infrastructure. As I mentioned earlier, a couple of years ago, we came up with a list of the core pieces of infrastructure that we really wanted to make sure that we upgrade it over time. Now the good news is that we are steadily working through that list. A lot of them are already done and rolled out. 2017, we rolled out brand-new ACH system with much expanded capacity. We've already talked about in some of our calls about the loan origination system that we upgraded in early 2018. That's actually driven a 25% reduction in turn time in mortgages despite the fact that volume has picked up over that same time period. We also rolled out a new performance-reporting engine for PWM, and along with that, asset classifications now standardized across all of our wealth management platforms. And then, as Scott mentioned, we just rolled out last month, actually, a new debit processing system. That's largely behind the scenes, but that's the engine that takes care of all card transactions, all debits and our ATMs, and so that was a big transfer for us, and that will enable other technology developments down the line.</p><p>A couple of big ones that we have coming up in the next year. We've mentioned these on calls, but just to reiterate, number one, we have a new wire system that we'll be rolling out this quarter. It's already in production with a pilot group at the bank. It's going very well. Something we've been working on very methodically over the last 18 months. That will bring with it much greater capacity, faster throughput and integration with their KYC, OFAC systems.</p><p>And then finally, modern core banking system. Many of you know, this is something that we started working on about a year ago that's progressing very nicely. It's a multiyear project. But we've moved steadily through the due diligence phase. We know who we want to partner with, although we haven't announced that publicly yet. We expect that next year will be much about planning and testing for the conversion, which will then probably take place in 2021. So right now, that is on time, on budget. We're quite excited about how that's going. I can tell you this about the system that we'll be moving towards, it is a much more modular and much more open system than the one that we have now. It's tested, it's true, it's already in implementation. But we're delighted by the fact that it's got a lot more open APIs, it facilitates many more integrations, not only with their own modules, but with other partners, which will allow us to partner with fintechs where we want to, with other providers, allows us to choose best-in-breed services and facilitate a true omnichannel experience. Because all of the transaction data comes into one place and can then be used to populate things like CRM systems or other means of tracking transactions and taking care of our clients.</p><p>Okay. So let's turn now back to Scott, and Scott will take us through a few things that we've got coming up for you in digital.</p><p>SCOTT D. FINDER: Great. Thanks, Jason. So as relationships are at the heart of everything we do at First Republic, we look at the opportunity for digital to enhance relationships, to complement relationships. At the same time, when we ask our clients how important is digital to the First Republic relationship, about 80% of them say it is important to them.</p><p>In fact, just a year ago, we finished migrating our consumer clients from our old legacy digital banking platform to our new consumer digital banking platform. And in just the last year, we've seen a 19% increase in active digital banking users. And when we look at the mobile app, specifically, that we launched last year, 25,000 of our clients have taken the time to go to the Apple App Store and rate the mobile app, and overall, have given it a 4.8 stars out of 5. So we're pleased with the progress. And we've seen the data backs it up internally because 29% -- we've seen a 29% increase in active mobile users in just the last 12 months. And lastly, when we look at dollars, clients who have -- who are depositing dollars, checks through the mobile check deposit feature, the dollars have increased by 31% in just the last year.</p><p>When we pivot to the business banking space, it's no different. In the last year, we've seen a 27% increase in digital active business clients. So adoption of the platform and new clients using it are all moving to the platform. When you look overall at usage of our digital banking in the corporate space, we've seen a 42% increase in engagement or overall online sessions in the last 12 months, which is really quite massive. And on the dollar side, we look at payments that are made through the corporate online space, and we've also seen a 42% increase in payments created through the corporate online platform.</p><p>So I'd like to talk about 2 key elements of our digital strategy. One is the digital-to-human connection, really where our people, our clients and our technology all intersect; and two, frictionless money movement. Both of these are really about supporting our clients and giving them the control and peace of mind over their financial lives.</p><p>So many institutions use digital really as a tool to reduce the number of interactions between their bankers and their clients. And we value self-service. We understand it matters, particularly for simple transactions, for basic reporting and some everyday needs. But we also know that a big part of what makes clients loyal to First Republic is they know there's always a person one step away, whether it's by phone, whether it's in a branch or otherwise.</p><p>Now we don't believe digital should be any different. So I wanted to show you a tool that we actually are piloting right now just to bring our people and our clients and digital that much closer together.</p><p>So this is our mobile app. And you can see in the bottom right corner, there's that round hockey puck. And if a client clicks on that, that is access to their team, real people. So Margaret, your relationship manager; Fatima, your preferred banker; Dan, your wealth manager; or the general support lines are all accessible right there. So I click on Margaret, I choose how I want to contact her, do I want to call, e-mail, text, schedule a video chat. In this case, I'll choose to e-mail her, talk to her about some mortgage options, and right there, my message is out. Then I can go back, view my team. Maybe I have something that I want to talk to Fatima about on the preferred banking side. But Fatima and I tend to text more, so I shoot her a text and let her know that I have a large wire coming in. She lets me know she'll tell me when she sees it. Thank you, Fatima. And we're all set right there in the app. So that's something we're piloting right now.</p><p>JASON C. BENDER: We just contrast that with other mobile apps that we've used, where to get to any kind of contact field is buried screens-deep in the mobile app. For us, we want our banker team to never be more than 1 click away in that mobile app. So again, just a means of bringing technology and people together.</p><p>SCOTT D. FINDER: So frictionless money movement. Money movement is obviously very important to our clients. And when we look at our consumer clients, the most common type of money movement is typically purchases. So here's a new capability that we are in pilot in right now related to purchases. So say it's a Sunday and you're out and you want to make a big purchase, a computer or a new car, but your debit card has a low limit or a limit lower than purchasing a car. So instead of having to call someone, you go into the app. You have 2 cards there that you can control. You click on the one that you want to use to purchase this car. You've got a number of different controls and alerts there. But right now, you want to buy that car. So you change it from a $10,000 limit to a $75,000 limit and you're set. You can purchase the car on the debit card on the fly. After that, you don't need a $75,000 limit, so you can quickly go back in and change it back to the limit that you want it to be at from day-to-day. This is a common occurrence, believe it or not.</p><p>Then you get a text, then your son in college says, hey, dad, I can't find my debit card, sorry. This is not the first time that John's lost his debit card. So before we call it officially gone and cancel the card, let's just go in the app and lock the card. Now we can give him time to look for it, but nobody can spend on this card because we've locked it.</p><p>So we spend a lot of time talking to our clients on a daily basis. And we're trying to understand what their needs are so that we can figure out what matters most that we can enhance of our digital offerings. And we know our millennial clients really appreciate tools that help them track all their finances. But increasingly, we've seen that our net worth -- our higher net worth clients' value similar types of tools. Because if you have multiple accounts, multiple credit cards, checking accounts, savings accounts, investment accounts, we hear from clients that they're afraid that things can happen in their account. It could be fraud, it could be a mistake. Across all these different financial institutions, would you even catch it? So we're piloting a new capability, although I'll first point out our existing capability, which is, right now, you can add an external account from any financial institution into our app. So you can see your balances, your transactions, if you click in for your American Express credit card from a checking account or investment account somewhere else. But we're taking it a step further. So if you click here on More, and then the Budgets and Spending. The first tool in here is a consolidated transaction feed. So in one place, across all your financial accounts at different financial institutions, you can see your transactions. So that's not one checking count, that's checking accounts, credit cards, everything. You can also choose which accounts you actually want to see. So if some accounts you're focused on that you really want to look at, you only want to look at credit cards today or something else, you can filter and really focus on what matters most to you.</p><p>Additionally, you can choose the time frame. So I use this myself. I tend to only look back past the last couple of days. That's the easiest way to keep track of what's happening with my own transactions. But you can customize the time frame to weeks, months or however you want to do it. Across the top, it's showing you projected transactions that we expect to see hit your account. This is a real one that happened to me last weekend, where I said, \"Why am I paying Audible twice?\" And that was when I learned that my wife and I had subscribed to Audible on 2 different cards in the same short period of time, and that was why we were paying $30. Sometimes the examples can be bigger, but that was kind of a wake-up call that we don't really -- we need to talk more. Or I need to track my wife better.</p><p>The other thing beyond transactions then is what's happening with my money at a category level. Where am I spending my money? So in this case, I'd say, \"How is it I'm spending $3,400 a month on auto and transport? That doesn't really make sense to me.\" So I click on that category and say, okay, auto insurance, auto payment, gas, ah, there it is, car rental. That's right. I rented a car for work, cost me $1,100, and that's really skewing the tracking because it's a work expense not a personal expense. So I click on it, and I see the category just says car rental. But let me dig into that further. So I click on the category. And now I have choices on how do I want to categorize this. So I look under travel, because this is really work travel, not personal travel, but there's no work travel category. So I create a work travel category, and now it's set. So the category is right there. And then it asks me, do you want to categorize all your Hertz charges backward and in the future as work travel or only categorize this one? So I say, well, this is pretty much what I use for work. So I say yes, always do this. And then when I go back in, now the auto transport category, now the spending is categorized in the way that I think about my money. So this is something that if you're a First Republic client, you'll be seeing in the near future.</p><p>Lastly, I want to talk about corporate. We continue to spend in the consumer digital space, but equally, we're investing in the corporate space. So we are right now rolling out to our corporate clients, a new user interface for our corporate online platform. And a key component of that is delightful design. It's a key part of our broader digital strategy as well. But delightful design doesn't just mean a nice user interface or generally easy to use. It means it's really tailored to the workflow of our clients. So we don't just survey clients or talk to them occasionally. We kind of move in with them. We'll go to their offices, and we'll spend up to 2 to 3 days sitting with some of their employees and really understanding the workflow of how they use our capabilities. And where it really comes together is when we figure out what matters most. And in this case, we found ways to make them complete -- to enable clients to complete transactions up to 5x faster. So when you can take a task from 30 minutes to 5 or 6 minutes because we understand exactly how you do your job, it's really impactful for the client, and it shows the client that we're listening, and that's really what matters.</p><p>JASON C. BENDER: Thank you, Scott. So I think we'll wrap the update on technology and operations there, but maybe just leave you with one thought here. In fact, I think one of our client panellists said it best. Technology is -- and technology investing is one of those things that it's never over. I mean, you just -- you have to keep doing it. You have to keep staying fresh. And for us, the important thing is to stay really close to the client, make sure that we understand what it is that they need or employees need and let that drive the prioritization. But one fundamental thing will remain true always and true to our First Republic business model, and that's that technology for us is really designed to enhance, not to replace those human relationships. Those are here for good.</p><p>So with that, thank you. We appreciate your time. We're going to take a very brief break, although I think we ask that you stay in the room, we're just going to reset the stage here for the Q&amp;A panel. So thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: Thank you, everybody, for waiting patiently till the end of the day for Q&amp;A, I'm very impressed by your restraint. We also have, in addition to the executives here, I think you know all of the executives. And for those of you following on the webcast, we've got the names on screen. We also have the other presenters from today sitting in the back of the room here. So feel free to ask anything and we would love to answer that question for you. I see some hands going up already.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: Mr. Zerbe over here on the side. And lastly, just please introduce your name and company.</p><p>KENNETH ALLEN ZERBE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ken Zerbe, Morgan Stanley. I guess, Jason, maybe just a question for you. You talked about the new core deposit or core system that you're putting in place next year. Can you just talk about what impact that might have on the efficiency ratio when we think about your '21 -- or '20 or '21 or '22?</p><p>JASON C. BENDER: Sure. I'll be happy to. So our core banking system, obviously, we began spending on that this year, we'll spend again next year and the year after that. But we don't really expect it to have a significant impact on the overall efficiency ratio. It's already kind of baked into the projections, it's baked into the priority road map.</p><p>KENNETH ALLEN ZERBE: Got you. And in terms of the efficiency ratio that you are expecting for 2020?</p><p>JASON C. BENDER: I'm going to defer that to Mr. Roffler.</p><p>MICHAEL J. ROFFLER: So I think we'll give more formal guidance in January at earnings. Obviously, the efficiency ratio we've talked about in the past, there's obviously a denominator side of that with net interest income and the margin. This most recent guidance we gave on the fourth quarter is that we'd sort of be right around 64.5%. But the outlook for interest rates are going to have a part of that, sort of, as you look into 2020. And so we'd rather talk about it then when we have better outlook on rates and what the shape of the yield curve is, because it's such an important driver.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: I think I see maybe Brock over here on the side.</p><p>BROCK CLINTON VANDERVLIET, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR BANKS ANALYST OF MID CAP, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Mike, you mentioned in your presentation in terms of the change in the rate environment and how that was evolving in the third quarter, lower rates, flatter curve. Was that how -- should we think about expenses around that? Was your harder line on expenses more of a tactical reaction to what you saw in the third quarter and limited to that? Or is that sort of pointing toward a harder line on expenses and expense growth going forward?</p><p>MICHAEL J. ROFFLER: Yes. I mean, I think it's we like to take a thoughtful approach in everything we do. I mean, I think of the last presentations we just had on technology and operations and how we think about going forward. So we're never going to do anything from an expense standpoint that sacrifices the long-term vision of the bank and the long-term sustainability supporting clients, acquiring households. But are there things we can do to slow our growth rate? And can those be then sustained, if this is the new normal, right?</p><p>What you don't know is that at that point was the inverted yield curve going to stay for a long time and were we headed lower. It has gotten better, right? But it allows us a chance to sort of step back and really focus on where are the most impactful things we can do from an investment in the franchise standpoint. And there are other things that we just need to slow the pace of growth, and we can sustain that probably for a while.</p><p>ERIKA NAJARIAN: Erika Najarian from BofA. This question is for Mike Selfridge. I'll give Mike Roffler a break. So the -- if you look at the projections, it's clear that there has been a structural change in terms of the role that private capital has in terms of financing U.S. corporations. And I think most of the folks in this room are very confident in the credit quality metrics for First Republic, just from a cultural standpoint and the structure of a capital call line. But in your experience, what could we expect from the alternative asset managers that you service in a downturn? Is it just going to be an issue with volume? Or are you picking really the best managers that they would actually outperform in terms of performance? I guess we wanted to think about it from a cyclical perspective.</p><p>MICHAEL D. SELFRIDGE: Yes. No, it's a thoughtful question. A couple of things to note. Yes, there's a bit of a secular change in companies staying private longer. In the sort of the dot-com meltdown, the average time to IPO was between 3 and 5 years, today, it's more like 8 to 12 years. In some ways, that's healthy. I think we're all reading the headlines of some of the unicorns and valuation adjustments and what does that mean. The market is still robust. Our credit standards have not changed. And correct, in a downturn, I think you would expect to see strong credit quality. And the pace of investment would change, in my -- from my perspective, for both venture and private equity. Having said that, I think that our ability to grow by gaining market share could allow us to increase in a downturn.</p><p>STEVEN A. ALEXOPOULOS: Steve Alexopoulos, JPMorgan. So first question on market share. It's been a couple of years since you guys published the market share in the individual markets, Boston, L.A., San Fran, New York. Can you give us a sense of how market share is trending in each of those, first?</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: We -- well, we do a Capgemini study every 2 years. And '19 is -- the study -- there'll be a '19 study basically done in the middle of '20. So the '17 study is still the most current one. Its life is about to end, and we'll have a new one.</p><p>Intuitively, the market share probably hasn't changed very much. I'm going to guess, if you look at that 4.2 on the chart, maybe 4.5. And the reason is the markets are so strong. I mean, the truth is we've had trouble keeping up. The question we get, quite frankly, all the time for a couple of decades is how do you keep growing this way? The answer is the markets we're in. At least part of the answer is the markets we're in are so incredibly strong. We actually have trouble keeping up in some of them. We actually went backwards in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1 year, 1 time. That was '13 or...?</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: A couple years ago.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: A couple years ago, went backwards. It was all share, and we grew like crazy. So these markets are so powerful. And so I don't expect much change actually.</p><p>JASON C. BENDER: Just to add that. I mean, we are posting positive client acquisition in all those markets. But if the denominator is growing a bit faster than the numerator, it may slip back. But in general, it's very strong.</p><p>STEVEN A. ALEXOPOULOS: I know in terms of new markets, I know you don't need any new markets because your market shares are still low. But when you think about Jackson Hole or Palm Beach, they work pretty well. What are your thoughts on a branch-light model in a Seattle or in a Houston, in some of those markets that were on the upper right of that slide you had up earlier?</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: We don't need them. We get drawn to them every once in a while by either an opportunity or just a client call. Jackson Hole is in that category. We've been able to -- actually Jackson Hole, interestingly enough, first 9 months it was the fastest-growing office we ever opened.</p><p>But the -- but Seattle has called for a long time because of the proximity and the flow between Seattle and San Francisco and L.A. But it's complicated. It's very well banked. And if we can gain market share where we are, why go into another big market? Jackson Hole is a small service point market for our other markets. It's going to be pretty good size actually. But per se, it's not that large. It's the flow from other places. Palm Beach is not quite that way. It has much more of an intrinsic market as well as the flow.</p><p>STEVEN A. ALEXOPOULOS: And then finally for Jason. Just following up on the increased use of digital. As your clients use digital more, are you seeing them rely on the RMs less? What is the trend in human interaction?</p><p>JASON C. BENDER: Yes. So let me answer that one and then come back to Jim's comment for a second just to add some color there, too. With regards to digital, we're seeing that digital usage does not eat into the relationship with the RMs. What it does do is it changes what they take the time to talk about. And so the interactions tend to be slightly higher value as opposed to, can you just transfer money here it's let's talk about new business. Let's talk about a referral. And so we're finding that the interactions are just as strong as they've ever been. And in fact, in cases like what Scott showed, that digital usage sometimes even facilitates additional conversations, and that's really the goal.</p><p>If we go back to a second to Jim's comments, too, about market share. I'd say also, when we're looking at markets, whether that's the big ones or even the smaller more ancillary markets, we're not only looking for the relative attractiveness of the markets, but looking for interconnectivity with our other markets. And so one thing that we really maybe didn't talk as much about today is that the markets that we're in now are very tightly connected. People that work in L.A. are frequently ones who move to San Francisco or move to New York. People who are in Boston move frequently to New York. And so that kind of interconnectivity plays well to our referral-based and relationship-based kind of networking model. And so we really take that into account when we're looking at any new markets.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: You know Steve, if I can add on that question, what you ask about is applicable and has been applicable in the company from the beginning. Continually, we try to find the standard that can be done automatically or simplistically to save the IQ for the more complicated thing. Generally, think credit. We now we have single-family home loan credit, about half of our business goes through a single signature channel, okay? And we -- to the best of my knowledge never had a loss in that channel for 18 years or so. And so that leaves the gray matter IQ -- time for the more complicated deals. The same thing is happening here, exactly. And that's usually what the client is more interested in your time on. They'd rather have their time, automatic, down here on the transactional and the time face-to-face, saved for the important things. And so it applies to technology, but it also applies to credit. It applies to how we spend our time. It applies to what happens when someone comes into an office. The more we know about them before they walk in with the artificial, the AI now or the Eagle intelligence, rather, sorry, the faster that you get to the point, and it's the point they want to talk about. And so everything we do is continually -- that's really what the empowerment activity is all about, to get them to the key segments, either on their mind or needs to be on their mind.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: John?</p><p>JOHN G. PANCARI, SENIOR MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: John Pancari, Evercore ISI. Just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your ROE outlook here. Just given I know you talked about -- you've cited some pretty good growth trends here, but we also know we've got a tougher rate backdrop and you also acknowledge your opportunistic view to capital. So I wanted to get your view on how we should think about the ROE trajectory. We're right around 10.5% right now. How would you think about that over the next couple of years?</p><p>MICHAEL J. ROFFLER: Yes. I mean, we -- if you look at our history, we've sort of been at 10.5% to 12% pretty consistently. Right now, it's been sort of at the low end of that range. This feels like the right place for us to be, 10.5%, 11%, maybe a little bit higher. And it allows us to continue to, again, we're growing, and so we are periodically accessing capital. That does cause an impact to your ROE. But it feels like we're in a pretty good place right now, absent anything really unusual happening like sort of started to happen and then stopped.</p><p>JOHN G. PANCARI: Okay. So I guess, so what does that mean in terms of your opportunistic view then on capital? I know you kind of referred to that.</p><p>MICHAEL J. ROFFLER: I don't think it's changed, right? Preferred markets we've accessed, common we've accessed. It's all a matter of the right time. And when that opportunity arises. And then what our sort of outlook is for growth as we go into the future. But there's no like date certain, I'd say.</p><p>JOHN G. PANCARI: Okay. And then if I could just ask one more, Mike Selfridge. Just on the capital call line side of the business. I know it's indicated that a lot more of the production is more towards -- increasingly towards a return enhancement in terms of how funds are using the lines, or at least the industry is also shifting that way a bit. How are you managing the business a bit given that context? Are you being more selective around who you're bringing on? And how do you think about the risks for the business further out if that migration continues?</p><p>MICHAEL D. SELFRIDGE: Yes. So to reiterate what Scott Aleali mentioned, he mentioned more in the competitive world there is this he called it J-curve management. People are borrowing -- firms are borrowing longer, up to 1 year, sometimes even 2 and 3 years to boost the IRR, and that's the reference of the IRR enhancement. We are seeing more competition, and competitors provide more of these IRR enhancement lines. It's not the core of what we do. The average outstandings are paid back in 60 days, as you can reference back on my slide. Occasionally, for the very best managers, we will extend terms maybe up to a year at most, but it's not going to be a core practice of ours. And if we have to pass some business, we'll pass some business. There's enough out there for us to have. We appreciate the relationship for the core of what it is. It's a little bit of a debate in the industry right now, and we'll see how that shakes out.</p><p>From a credit perspective, it's still the backstop of the limited partners, the strong institutions, longer duration alone, more risk, theoretically, but the same credit backstop. So it's a little bit more on the edge, riskier on the credit side, but not too much.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: We have Aaron in front here, maybe.</p><p>AARON JAMES DEER, MD, EQUITY RESEARCH AND EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, SANDLER O'NEILL + PARTNERS, L.P., RESEARCH DIVISION: Aaron Deer, Sandler O'Neill. I have a question for you, Bob. We've seen a lot of folks in the brokerage industry and this price competition, it's really brought it down to 0 and amongst some of the products. Obviously, your business is very different. The platform is very different and brokerage is a small part of that. But when you think about pricing and competition, generally, is that becoming a bigger headwind to revenue growth over time?</p><p>ROBERT LEE THORNTON: Well, first, let me talk about the brokerage world, specifically our competitive move to 0 commission brokerage. And that's something that we provide for our clients if they have an overall meaningful relationship with First Republic because that's the type of service we provide in the brokerage side and for our new clients.</p><p>In terms of the broader fee spectrum, we have not -- it's interesting. We've looked very closely at our fees over the last 5, 7 years, and we've seen no change in fees. And I think that's one of the major reasons is we -- while we very much care and take care of our clients and their investments, we really believe what our clients are paying us to do is to help manage their lives. And that's why I think we continue to see strong fees and no erosion of fees. I can't predict the future, but I think that's an essential part of what we offer to clients.</p><p>LANA CHAN, MD &amp; SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. Just another follow-up on the wealth management side. One of the slides had 91% of banking clients did not have -- does not have wealth management assets -- with the First Republic. What's preventing that number from being higher?</p><p>ROBERT LEE THORNTON: I think, first, I think one thing we have to recognize is the pie keeps getting bigger and bigger. So even though we keep referring more and more people to wealth management, new clients come in. I think that's number one. Number two, a lot of it is, frankly, just bandwidth of our bankers. They're very busy. The refi market has been really huge. We've had 20% loan volume growth year-over-year. Wealth management is not a onetime, 1 meeting sale. It's a discussion with clients. So we're very pleased to continue to see very strong growth in referral activity but we have a lot of clients. Those continue to grow. So it's just really a matter of time until we get to all those clients.</p><p>MICHAEL J. ROFFLER: Yes. May I just add, I think you heard from James and Patrick on this. We're also bringing in a lot of younger clients who also maybe aren't necessarily ready for that at that stage of their lives, but it's good to know that it's there for when the time does come, that we can -- we can partner with our colleagues in wealth management.</p><p>ROBERT LEE THORNTON: Although I would say, even of those clients, we've been very successful in taking them from a single -- a student loan refinancing client, for example, to becoming an Eagle and best client, where they can do that with a minimum as low as $5,000.</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: It does speak to the opportunity, though. To put it into perspective, private wealth management households represent about 15% of our total households in the entire First Republic, and they're growing at a faster pace for various -- because of various initiatives. It is a great opportunity for wealth managers at First Republic, your backyard is still people who are actually getting more and more ripe for those type of services. When the bank started in 1985, those folks who were in their 30s and 40s are perfectly positioned right now to take care of the holistic platform that our teams have built.</p><p>MICHAEL D. SELFRIDGE: And maybe just a plug to Gaye's team. This goes back to data and being able to now mine, say, a mortgage loan client. We have their whole balance sheet. Before we didn't really know what the wealth picture looked like. Now we do, so we can serve that up to the bankers to what you saw earlier, and create the opportunity for them.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: Erika has another question over here.</p><p>ERIKA NAJARIAN: Now that the Fed is potentially in a more prolonged pause, what does that mean for deposit competition?</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: So the competition is still quite fair, quite fierce when it comes to deposits. And relationship banking is the one that's unlocking value for us. That's why we're very pleased that our checking deposits remain where they are, even though we have modeled around 55% in our NII simulation, as you know. So the competition continues. What we do is we do a more of a holistic funding optimization, then we'll look at the growth of deposits and the wholesale borrowing sources. And over the last year, especially, or 1.5 years, we have actually expanded the toolkit quite a bit in terms of funding sources in addition to deposits, just to be able to tap into the markets. So we give mid-teens guidance, and we're pleased that our deposits have grown around mid-teens so far. And as the short-term rates have been coming down, that actually makes them -- some of the other funding sources more attractive. So as part of the dynamic optimization we run on the liability side in line with the organic growth that comes from our lending and wealth management clients, so we are very pleased how it's turned out so far despite the competition.</p><p>And to your point, because the competition, even though where the Fed rates were and where other money market rates in the markets were, so we didn't necessarily want to play that money market game because we are a relationship bank we are not a transactional bank. So in that regard, as you will have observed this since end of 2015, Q4 of 2015, when the Fed started the hikes, we have seen more of a barbell approach of CDs and checking in terms of adding in terms of the deposit growth. And our preferred banking officers have been in this type of environment for many, many years across different rate cycles. And given their service half of the time, those CD deposit clients are cross service into checking relationship once they like the service. So that worked out perfectly.</p><p>KENNETH ALLEN ZERBE: I have a broader question. On Slide 114 in the deck, you mentioned that you have about 13% of your borrowers are low to moderate income, I guess, 29% in low to moderate MSAs. There's no arguing with your underwriting, right? You do amazing underwriting, no credit losses period, back. Can you help us just understand, like I wouldn't have thought this particular cohort would have the same, literally, 1 basis point of losses over time as the rest of the doctors and lawyers of the world with very low LTVs. Can you just talk about how you underwrite to this particular cohort? And how is it the losses have been so exceptionally low there?</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: It's actually the same way we underwrite everything else. The loan-to-value ratios may be slightly higher because it may be for probably a slightly higher percentage of first-time purchases. But philosophically, there's good credit everywhere. You just have to take the time to understand the situation and the circumstances. And as you properly point out, Ken, the losses, the loss history of the bank in single-family lending includes all those loans, whether we sold them or not, it includes all of them. And so we've had a very good experience. It takes a little more time sometimes, have to pay a little more attention, have a little more flexibility, but you can do good underwriting in every situation.</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: If I could add, the very first credit call that I had attended at First Republic, we spent about 45 minutes of an hour call to understand the character of the borrower. It's really the -- it's not about your wallet, it's about the character, the prudent risk management of the person. And it's more of a chicken and egg situation. If you have a good trusted adviser who is incentivized to make the safe credit decisions for you and the bank, so that goes hand-in-hand, and it's really the character that's driving the payment behavior.</p><p>DAVID JOSEPH LONG, SENIOR ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Dave Long from Raymond James. Jason, I think it was one of your slides that showed the 2% attrition rate. And just curious if you get any feedback there as to why somebody may leave First Republic? Or if you don't get the feedback, maybe can you speculate as to why a customer may leave First Republic?</p><p>JASON C. BENDER: Sure. I think it was on a couple of slides. But the 2% attrition rate, I mean, that -- sometimes people move out of market. They may move overseas. Sometimes you see deposits or relationships that are built around a single purpose, maybe to make an investment in something, and that investment may come to its end, come to a fruition, and that will roll off until it's replaced by something else. So the point, though, is really that for the most part, that's a pretty low number, obviously. I mean, occasionally, people leave, but it just doesn't happen that often as long as we're doing our jobs right.</p><p>STEVEN A. ALEXOPOULOS: First for Mike Roffler. So the 210 spread right now is 20 basis points. At about what level of steepness do you need for the NIM to stabilize?</p><p>MICHAEL J. ROFFLER: So the steepness, a little bit steeper would be better. But the real question, I guess, is what's going to happen with the large money center banks that we compete with when it comes to pricing on home loans, right? And so how is Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Citibank, BofA going to react? Or are they going to follow that or not? Because at the end of the day, clients, prospects have options, and the other banks are largely highly competitive for the client base that we're adding every day. And so I think that probably is -- it's better, don't get me wrong. But it's still going to be really dependent upon where the -- where the competitors are sort of pricing and what their appetite is.</p><p>STEVEN A. ALEXOPOULOS: So if the Fed does stay on hold here, how do you think about the NIM, just say, the rate environment holds where it is, are we under modest pressure?</p><p>MICHAEL J. ROFFLER: Yes. I think in the fourth quarter, we provided some numbers that thought we'd be approximately [2 75%]. And that's a good place to sort of start off as you go to January. That did include one rate cut, which has happened. And so the question is you do bounce around that level, a little bit lower. It's really going to depend on what's the steepness and what does the competition bring, coupled with what -- a little bit of what Gaye said, we are funding a growing balance sheet and so you cannot always be ultra aggressive on sort of liability funding because you're funding a portfolio that's growing in the mid-teens.</p><p>STEVEN A. ALEXOPOULOS: Okay. And then separately, if we look at the student loan refinance business. At what age do you think that cohort will primarily start buying their first home? And if you look at the 2015, which was the first year of real vintage, if you will. Have many of those already converted to first home loan customers?</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Some are beginning to. The 2,000 number you saw, that's obviously coming from that primarily. But the first-time home buying in the urban settings we're operating in, remember that by definition, the cohort has a student loan, okay? So that's going to happen in the late 30s, late 30s, early 40s. And so the average age of the cohort, call it, 32, 33 has got 4, 5 years to go.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: Erika up front here.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: James, do you want to add to that?</p><p>JAMES HERBERT: Sure. I think we're seeing really strong progress, thus far, from the 2015 vintage, is what we talked about up there. As I said, the average age at origination for us right now is about 31. So we've got those people who are now 34, 35. As we looked at information around -- in our markets for income and demographics and ages, we think that we are nicely on track in terms of the penetration for the mortgages thus far. I think the other thing I'd say, particularly for the early cohorts, is that we didn't have the next-generation of relationship managers in place at that point. And so that's something that's really been rolled out in the last 7 quarters. And so I think that's really helping accelerate it. And as we develop those deeper relationships, I think we'll see that penetration pick up.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Most important thing that they said about this cohort is, it's exactly the same client base we've always had, just younger. And actually, they're better educated. Generally speaking, our single-family home loan portfolio, if you consider them somewhat parallel, on the average, kind of has about 50% have graduate degrees, 45%, the student loan refinance, about 90% have graduate degrees.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: Erika?</p><p>ERIKA NAJARIAN: Jim, this question is for you. As we look out longer term, as we think about knowing the bank a long time, it's clear that the culture hasn't changed. But also, what I think you get not as much credit for is you have changed in response to what's different, right, whether it's technology or growing business banking or growing Eagle lending. So 5 years from now, if you're -- you've gathered us again in a room, what would be a little bit more -- what would be different about the bank in 5 years, in response to the changes that you do see?</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Actually, we have changed a lot. But I think of it more as adjusting to circumstances on the one hand and then taking opportunities that become more than self-evident in some cases on the other.</p><p>I think that the technology that Gaye and everybody, all the teams, Jason, everybody's leading to take us to, is going -- I think you're in the second inning of that at the most. I was delighted to hear our clients talk about how they saw our technology. That was -- thank you, Steve. That was a good leading question. That was very helpful. But also, I was very pleased by the results. Now 2 years ago, you wouldn't have had that same answer. So we're just around the corner on that, I think.</p><p>Internally, we have a ways to go, yes, but it's happening very rapidly. So I think the power -- I would predict that the current relationship managers, business bankers, wealth managers, 5 years from now, will be approximately 50% more productive as a result of what's going on.</p><p>And then I think the other thing is that the student loan refinance and the professional loan program, think of the seeds that are being sown right now. They will be 50% to 70% of the consumer base of the bank. And 5 years now, from now, to Steve's question, I would guess, 40% to 50% of them have bought their home. And then they're really in the bank. So those are the things that are obvious.</p><p>What isn't obvious, I think, is there an existential challenge to banking. I think at the individual consumer service level and at the individual private company level in 5 years, I don't see it. In 10 years, possibly. And it comes in my mind primarily from the payment system side first, Stripe, Square, et cetera. And then secondarily, it comes from the question of, is there an alternative currency and now I'm out about 10 years probably, but maybe not.</p><p>One of the nice things about the enterprise, though, is that we operate -- we have a barbell. We're going to -- if you look forward 5 years and you say 50% or 60% of the clients are millennial then, of course, 5 years older, but still that generation moving through, it's still somewhat axiomatic, and it will always be the case that the older generation has most of the money. And the reason is that if you take the group as a whole, they have more time to compound. It's not inventing anything. And so about 60% to 65% of the money in the bank is 55 plus. I don't think that changes, except in our case, because we started at a certain point, it gets a little older, okay? And probably, thereby, is more stable rather than less in terms of if we've done a good job. So I think the other thing that, that last point leads me to is I believe that the 3 -- 5 years ago, wealth management was equal to about 70% of the assets of the bank. It was not 1 to 1. Now it's about 1.25, 1.4 to 1. I would guess that wealth management because it comes and stays and grows, okay, and the cross-sell increases will be 2.5 to 3 to 1, 2.5 to 1 -- 2 to 2.5 to 1 in 5 years. 10 years? Maybe 3 to 1.</p><p>Northern Trust, the old JPMorgan Private Bank, states for any of these trust banks, they're 100 years old. We're only 34 years old. What they did in their early generation was to help families gain wealth and do well, save and begin to move their assets residually as the generations passed to the bank. We're in the very first round of that. And so what I see coming is much more of a trust bank. Almost inevitably. But with the feed at the young end because what happens is those banks get smaller relative to the trust, the trust takes over the situation, and the bank is just a little facilitator. I don't want that to happen. I want the bank to grow continually. And the #1 thing we've done is this PLP, the Eagle banking, PLP and SLR, to keep feeding it. And the single-family home, they keep feeding that way, too. If we turn away -- we won't turn away from those. And those are really powerful. So you can put those 2 together, you have a balance tipping towards trust, but a very powerful bank still.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: I think we have one over here on this side. Urmas, maybe, do you want to go first, and then we can go to this gentleman over here.</p><p>URMAS WOMPA: Oh, okay. Could you please give us an update on Gradifi? I'm missing those beautiful commercials. I haven't seen one for a while.</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: So we have over 800 employers now on the platform, quite a few landmark marquee names now, in addition to where we started. We started to disrupt some of the smaller enterprises. Now it's much larger organizations that are on the platform. So the team has done a really, really great job in terms of bringing those on to the platform. And we also had a product switch in terms of get trial, it is much easier to get trial from an employer when you talk about hey do we have a solution. It doesn't cost you anything, and it makes the financial health of your employees much better. Do you care about them? And that is the theme on refinancing. If it's in our footprint, within our credit guidelines, it would automatically come to us, but if it's not, they are partnering lenders that is the Gradifi Refi platform. So it's a small marketplace or -- for 4 different lenders that includes First Republic and other lenders as well. They are at a threshold of the service quality. We want to make sure that everybody is providing the great quality of service. So that has been a switch in the last less than 1 year that we have done building that platform, which didn't exist, then we built Gradifi at the end of 2016. So that is the reason for only seeing a lot more and bigger sized employers coming on to the platform to get trial. And then cross servicing into other products like student loan paydown or a benefit that helps the 529. All you need to do really as an employer, and all of us here are employed somewhere. All you need today as an employer to do well by doing good is some of the monthly benefits we all provide. Give your employees the option. Do you want to spend it for gym membership or you want to spend it to pay down your student debt through the principal pay downs and you also get to refinance? Or if you have kids, and you don't have student loan refinancing, you may use the monthly benefit to do 529 saveups or tuition reimbursement, if you want to learn Python and grow as a person. So it's really adding to the menu of the HR benefits platform. One of our clients that Gradifi student loan pay down and refi is Mollie.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: Yes, absolutely. Pretty demanding too on the team with my levels of service expectations, but it was 1 of the reasons why we decided to go with Gradifi in the first place. And about 25% of our workforce is either taking advantage of the student loan paydown benefit that we offer or the 529 college saveup plan as well.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: I think we have a question over here, if you're still...?</p><p>JOHANNES MOLLER: Yes, Johan Moller, Fitch Ratings. A question for Jim. I'm just curious, so you obviously don't offer a credit card currently. I'm just curious as to sort of, from a strategic standpoint, why you've chosen to stay out of that product?</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: We're really not -- credit cards are a massive scale product. And we have clients who use their credit cards quite actively, but we don't have very many clients. We've tried credit cards twice actually. We did it with 2 different purveyors. And quite frankly, we also had the issue of their service became us and we weren't completely happy with that.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: Maybe do we have time for one last question or maybe 1 or 2 more if anybody has one. Okay, Brock. I see Brock over on this side.</p><p>BROCK CLINTON VANDERVLIET: Brock Vandervliet, UBS. So I think from an investment perspective, one of the best and strongest parts of the story is that the guides you've so frequently given on loan growth end up being conservative, sometimes materially so, due to the continued success in mortgage or the build-out of business banking or a combination. With higher rates now beginning to strike housing, do you worry that, that becomes more difficult? Or that -- are there offsets that you'd point to?</p><p>I tried to word this in a way that you wouldn't just remind me about no guidance and still answer.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Well, no guidance. They -- you have to take it apart a little bit. The business banking loan growth is quite separate from the single-family home loan business. Single-family home loan business does have a rather meaningful rate level driver component to it. The business banking doesn't. It's just who we are able to establish new relationships with primarily. The -- and even the usage in business banking doesn't -- isn't rate driven. The home loan business has only got about a, from our perspective, only has about a 90-day forward view that we can be pretty accurate on and because of the rate component. And it's still -- as we said on our call, this last call, it's still quite strong. I think our backlog going into the fourth quarter as we covered on the call was strong.</p><p>HAFIZE GAYE ERKAN: And maybe if I could just combine Erika's question with your question about growth, and then there was a digital -- Steve's question on digital. So the growth pillars are still the same as it was 5 years ago. So markets that are vibrant, a Net Promoter Score that is differentiated, which leads to growth from within. And that is why we don't set artificial loan targets. We don't have artificial loan targets. We just wake up, take care of the clients of their needs and great quality of clients and whatever great safe business there is, we do that. So mid-teens, that's why we're comfortable guidance that we're still providing. And if we see good business to do, we end up doing that. But what's happening in addition to those. So Erika mentioned and Jim mentioned about in the question about business banking growing faster than the bank, about Eagle lending growing faster than the bank, and the wealth management growing faster than the bank. Those growth pillars are now on solid foundation. The seeds are planted, and they're growing. On top of it with digital, there is yet another when you look forward ahead, there's a digital scalable platform that is forming at First Republic. You take robo-advisor. You take Gradifi. You take the deposit client onboarding, that's the team I talked about. You can -- if you're an existing client, you can open your accounts online digitally through your phone app. Financial planning soon to come, financial planning [light] soon to come. So that's the digital and lending cost that Jason mentioned, digital scalable platform. But we're in a customization business. So how do you bring those 2 together?</p><p>If you choose to customize, and we are just doing this with one employer right now, we are -- they are in our footprint, one of their financial wellness partners. And if you choose to customize further, you have a person, you have a quarterback of that relationship that you can pull and further do investment management or other complicated credit decisions can be made to your trusted adviser. So that's really exciting to bring everything together but staying true to the First Republic customization model.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: Maybe one final question over here with Garrett.</p><p>GARRETT ANTHONY HOLLAND: Garrett Holland with Baird. Just a couple of follow-up questions. On the Net Promoter Score, how does that score trend as digital engagement increases? And then separately, over your next 35 years and $100 billion of assets, how do you sustain the entrepreneurial spirit that's instilled for so many of the larger banks?</p><p>JASON C. BENDER: I'll take the NPS piece first. So NPS, we've done since 2013, and through that period, we've seen a great increase in digital usage. We've also seen a doubling in size for ourselves. And so, for us, the thing that's most important, I think, is the relative stability of that Net Promoter Score and the underlying service model, even through growth, even through changes in digital and other influences, frankly.</p><p>And so, for us, when we think about our client service model, what we're really trying to do is make sure that that's very stable, that's very sustainable regardless of the trends that are coming at us.</p><p>MOLLIE M. RICHARDSON: I'll maybe tackle the culture question, and it's culture, culture, culture, culture. And frankly, it starts with all of us here, how we act, how we interact, how we lead, doing so by example. It starts with a vigilance on we are who we hire and being focused and committed to that. It's about -- it's not just about communicating with our workforce. It's about interacting with our people and making the time commitment to do that so that they can continue to deliver that extraordinary service to our clients.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Let me add to that for a second in terms of they used the word entrepreneurial. The -- it is an entrepreneurial organization. I would note that all organizations started sometime. So they were all entrepreneurial one day. But the maintenance of it is actually built into the model. And it's not something that we talk about very much, but you heard it here today several times. Several of the people that were up here talked about they're entrepreneurial. They're dealing with their clients, Ruth Aronowitz, Todd (inaudible). And we have a whole row of entrepreneurs sitting in the back here. And our model empowers them. Jeff mentioned it a couple of times. Garrett mentioned it. Garrett is sitting back here. This kind of -- the model is built around the people. And the entire job that we have is to say, here's where we're going. Here are the tools to get there. Here are the rules inside our organization, rules, culture, okay? Go get them. We'll support you. And we don't move them around. I've said that a couple of times, I'll keep saying it. We don't move them around, unless they want to be moved, which just happens sometimes. And we're glad to accommodate. But empowering each one of them to be an entrepreneur in their own business.</p><p>And then I got the question a couple of times today, which we always get, which is how large can it be? I've been getting that actually for 30 years. But the answer is if you think about the business and the way I just described it. And then you put another entrepreneur and another entrepreneur and another entrepreneur, that isn't bigger. It's the same empowered. And so our job is to create an environment where we can allow for somewhat different styles but operating very much in our culture and doing the clients who, in many cases, select them. A lot of clients would select Gaye, most would probably, versus me. But the point is that they choose their relationship manager, and the manager finds them. They run into each other. They try it on, it fits. So don't get in the way of that. Leave it there.</p><p>And then, by the way, we haven't mentioned this, but if Ruth has a wealth management client and she thinks that's the best person to serve that client, she's in New York, the best person to serve that client in San Francisco, fly them in. You're adults, figure it out. Because if you get the connection right, it's about 85% successful right out of the bat. And she knows her client. She judges them and pulls the right person in.</p><p>That entrepreneurial spirit is embedded in the structure and the culture. It's not -- we're entrepreneurial. I'm entrepreneurial, Gaye is, but it's in the structure. It's in the culture. We have hundreds of entrepreneurs in this company.</p><p>MICHAEL IOANILLI: So we do have a reception, which Shannon is going to come and tell you about. But before I turn it over to Shannon, Jim, do you have any final remarks for the day?</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: I think I just made them. Thanks all very much for your support and for being here and for sitting through the day. We hope it was useful. We may have had a few less numbers in this presentation than you're used to in banking. But what we're trying to get at is why we're different.</p><p>And actually, I can just go to the -- we're going to be out back, right, Shannon?</p><p>SHANNON HOUSTON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF MARKETING &amp; COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER, FIRST REPUBLIC BANK: We are, yes.</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: So we're going to -- are we going right to that?</p><p>SHANNON HOUSTON: We are. I have some brief instructions for folks. Is that it...</p><p>JAMES H. HERBERT: Go ahead.</p><p>SHANNON HOUSTON: All right. Thank you, Jim. Hi. My name is Shannon Houston. I'm the bank's Chief Marketing and Communications Officer. We are about to conclude our day by ending with our banker reception.</p><p>Before we do so, though, I'd like to extend a quick thank you. Many folks throughout the organization helped to support bringing this event together. But in particular, it's the leadership of our fantastic Investor Relations team: Allie Hoffman, Jake Crooks and our leader, Mike Ioanilli, who pulled off just a wonderful event.

Six months since the very first cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed in China, more than 150,000 Americans are now dead \u2013 by far the biggest toll of any nation afflicted by the raging global pandemic. The US has seen more than 4.3 million infections, with an early surge in New York and the north-east followed by outbreaks across the sun belt, which now threaten to progress to central states, thanks in part to the fumbling response of the federal government.         Alexandra Villarreal identifies the key milestones on America\u2019s grim coronavirus timeline , while we break down the shocking victim statistics to show how the disease has disproportionately hit older people, people of colour and those with lower incomes.    After six months of denials about the seriousness of the crisis, pundits claimed Donald Trump had adopted a more somber tone last week, writes David Smith. Not for long, he didn\u2019t .     It was soon enough the same old Trump, culminating in his retweet on Monday of a video in which a group of lab coat-wearing doctors pushed false and misleading claims about Covid-19.    Federal paramilitaries are being pulled out of Portland        In a major climbdown for the Trump administration, federal troops are to be pulled out of Portland after weeks of escalating clashes with protesters. Oregon governor Kate Brown announced she had agreed the pull-out in talks with Mike Pence, the US vice-president, saying the federal agents had \u201cacted as an occupying force, refused accountability, and brought violence and strife to our community.\u201d   Congress told big tech CEOs they have \u2018too much power\u2019   House lawmakers have threatened an unprecedented antitrust crackdown on America\u2019s biggest technology companies, after Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the boss of Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, were told they have \u201ctoo much power\u201d at a combative congressional hearing on Wednesday .    Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google censor political speech, spread fake news and abuse their power to crush potential competitors, claimed the members of the House judiciary\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, which has investigated the firms for over a year. Democrat David Cicilline, the subcommittee chairman, described their CEOs as \u201cthe emperors of the online economy\u201d:     These companies, as they exist today, have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.    The \u2018Suburban Lifestyle Dream\u2019 is Trump\u2019s new dog-whistle        Trump has resorted to a familiar tactic to try to shore up his cratering support among suburban voters: barely veiled race-baiting . The president tweeted on Wednesday that Americans \u201cliving their Suburban Lifestyle Dream\u201d will no longer be \u201cbothered\u201d by low-income housing in their communities, after he rescinded an Obama-era program designed to reduce racial segregation in US suburbs. Speaking in Texas, Trump said the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule had been \u201chell for suburbia\u201d.   In other news \u2026  Climate countdown: 97 days to save the planet   The hottest April day in Miami\u2019s history occurred this year, when the mercury in the city\u2019s thermometers hit 97F. There are now 97 days until the US is due to exit the Paris climate agreement; today in our climate countdown series, Fiona Harvey reports on how Trump\u2019s stance has emboldened the world\u2019s other populist, Paris-sceptic leaders .   Great reads   California\u2019s coming \u2018tsunami of evictions\u2019    California lawmakers may continue $600 weekly unemployment benefits for the state\u2019s residents if Congress fails to extend them. But meanwhile, California\u2019s key renter protections are about to expire, which could lead to a catastrophic homeless crisis in the midst of the pandemic. Sam Levin reports from Los Angeles.    Twitter announced last week that it would stop promoting content linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, which has made the leap from the internet swamp to the real-world, with dangerous consequences. But will suppressing it work, or just fuel its adherents\u2019 paranoia ? Poppy Noor asks the experts.   Opinion: Lebanon\u2019s economic crisis is a social catastrophe   Decades of mismanagement and corruption have plunged Lebanon into the worst economic crisis in its history . Naji Bakhti\u2019s father recently lost his job of more than four decades \u2013 and yet, Bakhti writes, he saves his pity for the younger generation.     Nearly half the population now find themselves officially below the poverty line, their salaries, savings and retirement funds reduced to a pittance, with the lira having lost more than 70% of its value against the dollar. Lebanon has the distinct honour of being the first country in the Middle East and North Africa region to experience hyperinflation.    Last Thing: the joys of travel \u2013 with MS flight simulator   Microsoft has updated its decades-old Flight Simulator series, with a \u201cnear-photorealistic depiction of the entire planet\u201d at a time when most of us can\u2019t travel far beyond our front doors.

That's why the Right should stand up and make the case that liberals want to stop you from taking cheap vacations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's how conservatives should describe left-wing efforts to destroy the segment of the gig economy represented by Airbnb, Vrbo, and their various competitors that allow homeowners to let rooms, apartments, or houses to vacationing guests. The populist drive to kill off or hinder these services is not at all unrelated to the result of a new YouGov poll suggesting that just shy of 50% of millennials have favorable opinions of socialism.</p><p>A great way for conservatives to rebut that sympathy is to focus on the gig economy. Millennials love ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft, and residence-sharing services such as Airbnb. These opportunities allow us to travel with greater ease, affordability, and choice. Empowering individuals to provide their human and physical capital on the free market, they show capitalism at its best. </p><p>Most left-wing politicians are too clever to openly admit a desire to destroy the gig economy or co-opt it on behalf of the union special interests that control their political fate. Instead, liberal officeholders like Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren aim to kill the gig economy with a thousand cuts. Incidentally, it's the same strategy Warren applies  in destroying our innovative technology sector.</p><p>Fortunately, there are those on the Left who aren't as clever as the politicians themselves. Conservatives would do well to shine a light on their strategy. </p><p>Take the press release issued on Wednesday by \"Airbnb Watch,\" a self-styled \"coalition of concerned neighbors.\" Airbnb Watch actually appears to be funded by hotel and union lobbyists. Although veiled by quotes from seemingly genuine city leaders, the press release makes clear what it wants: Put pressure on Congress to pass the Plan Act, which would better enable hoteliers and government to sue Airbnb and its accommodation providers. </p><p>The mechanism here is especially important because it strikes at a free-speech issue central to debates over online censorship by Big Tech companies.  The secret plan to cripple AirbnB revolves around creating new exceptions to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That provision, as the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes, </p><p>says that \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider\" (47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230). In other words, online intermediaries that host or republish speech are protected against a range of laws that might otherwise be used to hold them legally responsible for what others say and do. </p><p>This is usually discussed in the context of social media, where the traffic is all in ideas and memes. But you can just imagine how changes to this section could affect a service whose sole purpose is to connect users who request or supply rides or places to stay.</p><p>Airbnb Watch claims that the bill is about protecting communities. Fortunately, however, the sponsor of this measure in Congress doesn't appear to have gotten the memo. Rep. Ed Case's announcement of the bill offers supporting quotes from numerous hotel associations. The whole point is to protect an industry \u2014 and sadly, there are some conservative lobbyists running around town right now carrying their water as well \u2014 and its dying union.</p><p>This campaign has reached across the whole world. Right now, in Jersey City, the hotel lobby is trying to trick voters into banning themselves from using their properties as they see fit. This ties nicely to Newsom's new law, regulating Uber and Lyft out of California. These bills attacking the gig economy are all about protecting hotel and taxi special interests over the right of individuals to use their property and money in their own best interests. It is an example of socialism's immoral pursuit of command economy regulation at the expense of the rights of others.</p><p>Yes, there are those on the Republican side who also favor a planned economy. Senator Josh Hawley and Congressman Matt Gaetz have a great deal in common with Warren and company here. But at the core, the anti-gig economy movement is one being driven from the political Left. Free-market conservatives should stand up and make our own arguments clear so that millennials understand socialism is not just some pie-in-the-sky utopian idea \u2014 socialism will put people out of work and inconvenience them almost immediately.</p><p>Photo Caption:FILE - In this Aug. 28, 2019 file photoAssemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, speaks at rally calling for passage of her measure to limit when companies can label workers as independent contractors at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif.California took a stand against companies in the so-called gig economy like Uber and Lyft by passing legislation aimed at making them treat their workers like employees.

My name is Josh Resnik and I am CQ Roll Call publisher as well--as well as chief content officer for our parent company, FiscalNote. I'd like to thank you all for joining us this morning, as well as those watching live on rollcall.com. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank or presenting Sponsor Better Medicare Alliance, as well as our supporting sponsors DentaQuest and the Alzheimer's Association for making today's event possible.  </p><p>The most recent election results in states like Kentucky, Virginia, and Louisiana proved that healthcare continues to be the number one issue for voters. Similar to 2018, winning candidates made health care a centerpiece of their campaigns and 2020 should yield similar results. Will congressional and presidential candidates learn from the recent elections and make healthcare a central campaign issue? Concurrent(ph) congressional Democrats and Republicans unite on a health care bill that increases access to care. </p><p>Is there an opportunity to strengthen protections for preexisting conditions? How will the administration and Congress work together to address health care costs? Perhaps, most important of all, how can Congress and the private sector work together to support continued innovation in health care? Today's program will feature several newsworthy discussions previewing health care policy in 2020. Our newsroom experts will be joined onstage with health care's most influential players for a deep dive on the most pressing issues facing Congress and presidential candidates in the run-up to the 2020 elections.  </p><p>So let's dive in. We're delighted to have Congresswoman Donna Shalala, representing Florida's 27th District join us this morning. In 1993, Congresswoman Shalala was nominated by President Bill Clinton to serve as secretary of Health and human services. There, she created, implemented and oversaw the Children's Health Insurance Program or CHIP. Today, it covers more than 7.6 million children and has earned remarkable bipartisan support. She also succeeded in doubling the budget of the National Institutes for Health and secured the highest immunization rates in American history.  </p><p>At the end of her eight-year tenure at HHS, a Washington Post article described her as, \"One of the most successful government managers of modern times.\" In 2007, President George W Bush hand-picked her to co-chair with Senator Bob Dole, the Commission on Care for Returning Wounded Warriors, tasked with evaluating how wounded service members transition from active duty to civilian life.  </p><p>In 2008, President Bush selected her as the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award. Congresswoman Shalala has also received the Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights and was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and has more than five dozen honorary degrees. Interviewing Congresswoman Shalala, CQ Roll Call's health reporter, Mary Ellen McIntire. Mary Ellen, over to you.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for being here. Thanks for joining us, Congresswoman.  </p><p>SHALALA: You bet.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: You know, no--no shortage of things to talk about this morning so we'll get right into it. But thought we would start with the Coronavirus which is really, you know, kind of what our Capitol Hill is talking about these days. You know, I know this week there's a lot of talk about a second sort of bill covering a wide range of policy issues coming together. What sort of are you expecting this to look like at this point and might you have something--might the house have something to start talking about this week?  </p><p>SHALALA: Well, I think we read because we're concerned about the economy, obviously, but its impact on individuals. A third of our population has no paid sick leave and people who may have to stay home that are hourly employees won't get their salaries. So enhancing unemployment insurance, looking at the sick leave issue, there are--there are all sorts of restraints that the administration has put on SNAP benefits that we went to look at. But there are a set of things that affect real people and the effect of this economy on their jobs and we want to make sure that people are protected, but more importantly, that they don't hesitate to use the health care system. And there are gaps in our health care system, obviously.  </p><p>We want to make sure that federally qualified health centers can send their tests to probably the commercial insurers, not just the state labs, but certainly to the commercial labs around the country. So we have to have backup systems both in terms of income as well as in health care for people. I know the White House has talked a little bit about this and about bailing out industries but before we start bailing out industries, we better worry about the workers in this country and their families.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: One thing that a lot of health care experts have been concerned about is that costs associated with getting tested could be a deterrent. Are you guys looking at doing anything and targeting sort of out-of-pocket cost of leave and who would that be going towards?  </p><p>SHALALA: Absolutely. Certainly, you want to eliminate any co-pays for getting treatment or getting the test; initially, getting the tests down the road. If there is a vaccine or a treatment protocol, you certainly want to cover all of that without any co-pays. We know from our experience in the flu vaccine that people actually will not do this unless you eliminate co-pays. So you want to eliminate it for everyone and then make sure those that don't have insurance or have lousy insurance.  </p><p>There was a case of someone in Florida that went in to get the testing, got a $3000 bill. Now, everybody thought that was a surprise bill. It was certainly a surprise to the person, but it was really because he had a junk plan. He actually had a junk plan and that's one of the things we have to think about because these high deductible plans that people are taking, some of--they get mixed up with the surprise billing issue, but it really is high deductible plans. And that's why we have to make sure that we eliminate any kind of co-pays or deductibles for--for the tests initially, for treatment and certainly down the road for the possibility of a vaccine.  </p><p>Now, we've done this before. Remember, we filled in the gaps with the Ryan White Act for AIDS because we wanted to make sure that everybody got the treatment. So this is not a new phenomena in which Congress and the administration steps up to make sure that everybody has the right kind of coverage.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: And is this something--last week, Congress, of course, passed $8.3 billion supplemental, very bipartisan. As you get into more policy and not just the appropriations, how do you keep this as a bipartisan?  </p><p>SHALALA: We would do everything we can And I've done everything I can to make sure that people know that this virus doesn't know the difference between Republicans and Democrats or independents. Not that--this virus is not choosing a candidate in the presidential election. So it has to be bipartisan, it must be.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: What might, you know, trying to keep down costs of a future vaccine or treatment, I know that's been a sticking point in the last couple of weeks on the vaccine issue. Those typically aren't, you know, where drug companies are making their money, as my understanding. But what might U.S. be looking at in the future to try to keep those future costs down?  </p><p>SHALALA: Well, we just have to have permanent funding. The problem is that we treat all of this is an ad hoc exercise that unlike--I think in my op-ed in The Times earlier in the week, I argued that we needed the Stafford Act for public health. That is, we need something that kicked in the additional money, but we needed permanent funding for the public health infrastructure in this country.  </p><p>That's Not just the NIH, the FDA, and the CDC and the public health service. It is in fact, the state, local governments who have their places on the ground. It was very difficult when I was secretary to convince people, Congress in particular, that we needed to permanently fund the public health infrastructure, that block grant in the CDC They just kept cutting because they saw it as kind of loose money that they could move around, but without a permanent infrastructure.  </p><p>Look, I don't know the name of the next virus, but I can assure you it's going to come in the next two years. So unless we do permanent funding, unless we have a readiness that's very different from what we have now, we are simply not going to be able to protect the American people.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: You think this virus could be a turning point in getting Congress to think about that in any way?  </p><p>SHALALA: I think so. And certainly, I have colleagues on the Democratic side that where we're starting to think about how do we make this more permanent. And that means we need a public health workforce that we can slide in that are going to spend their careers worrying about on the ground issues.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: So as you noted, a lot of the commercial labs have now started testing for this. It's been a lot of talk about trying to track how many people have been tested. How important do you think that is like having those numbers? Are you concerned that those numbers aren't currently available?  </p><p>SHALALA: It's very important. And frankly, the labs are used to turning over the information to the CDC. We do have an infrast--information infrastructure in this country in which docs call their--their health departments when they see something. And that's--that's the way we've always caught things, whether it's a food outbreak, it's always been that pattern of reporting first to the local health officials and then to the state health officials and then to the CDC. And that's the way we've caught things early on in this country. And yes, the commercial labs, which have basically taken over the testing business in this country.  </p><p>I mean, everybody was worried about the number of public labs that we had around the country. The truth is it's these commercial labs that need to add this to their protocols and they have stepped up big time to--to do this. And I think--I think pharma's going to step up. We've been beating on them so much that this is their opportunity to shine. Assuming that we get a vaccine--sorry I'm getting hoarse--I've talked so much. I'm getting hoarse. So they're going to bake--you know, everybody's working on the vaccine issue, a lot of people are working on the vaccine issue. It's the treatment that we need to get first which is the same way we took on the AIDS crisis.  </p><p>We--we--when I arrived at HHS, people were just dying. My--most of my early career, people died from AIDS and we finally got a treatment somewhere in the middle of our administration, and then making it widespread was extremely important.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: So do you expect several of your colleagues have announced in the last couple of days that they are self-quarantined after coming in contact, possibly with people who have tested positively for the virus. How do you expect this to affect Congress and Capitol Hill and your day to day work up there? It sounds like you guys aren't expecting at this point for a prolonged recess, but how do you kind of see that taking shape?  </p><p>SHALALA: You know, it's hard to tell. As of now, you know, we're going to work every day. And--but everybody's avoiding large groups. I noticed that some of the fly-ins, people that fly in from around the country to lobbyists are being canceled, we do a lot more telephonically. My town, I'd finished a whole series of town meetings, but in my community, I'm going to have to do more about the Coronavirus But I'll do them electronically, I mean, with people calling in. For one thing, I'll get more people to sign up. When I do that, I'll get a thousand people. When I do a town meeting, I maybe get as many as 300. So I'm happy to do whatever we need to do in terms of communications.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: How do you feel, you know, this shift to focusing on the coronavirus might affect the rest of Congress's health care agenda in the coming months, particularly an ability to possibly get a surprise billing or drug pricing bill to come together, given that you also have this focus now?  </p><p>SHALALA: Well, I think it's brought everybody health--the entire health care system in focus because what Coronavirus tells you is what are the gaps in the health care system. And it's not just an emergency response because you have to use the health care infrastructure to respond to it. So I don't think it will slow down our agenda. We will have a big health care bill, what we describe as a big health care bill, not what I would describe as a big health care bill; that basically beefs up and fixes some of the challenges in the Affordable Care Act, for example.  </p><p>We never got a chance to make the technical corrections that we wanted to do. We knew we weren't going to get the subsidies right the first time around. So we will do some of that. We passed a very large bill on negotiating drug prices already and so I--And we just passed a huge bill, which I was honored to co-sponsored and I co-sponsored the drug bill as well but Frank Pallone and I had a big bill on vaping which is a big public health crisis.  </p><p>Shu--we brought kids smoking down to 3 percent. The tobacco companies pivoted and we now have 27 percent of all high school students that are vaping, I mean, that are using nicotine. And so we have another public health crisis that involves young people in this country.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: So couple of things in there that I wanted to touch on. First, forthcoming ACA bills. Is that tied to the 10th anniversary? </p><p>SHALALA: Yes. It's tied to the--  </p><p>MCINTIRE: What do you expect to be beefing up subsidies?  </p><p>SHALALA: It'll focus on affordability. Here's what we hear when we go out into our communities. We ran on coverage. That is a preexisting condition. That's a coverage issue. The issue for our constituents is clearly affordability. And so, we will--I expect the bill to focus on affordability and making the ACA more affordable. That means, deeper subsidies, probably going a little deeper into the middle class and when we have bipartisan support (INAUDIBLE), the Republicans are fighting us, I mean, they're in court to get rid of--this is--We're still in repeal But no one has any kind of replacement. But we're still in the repeal mode with-- because they're suing us and they're not going to be very helpful about this particular bill. Some of them will.  </p><p>Look, I have the largest enrollment in the Affordable Care Act of any congressional district in the country. There are more than 100,000 people in my district that are in the Affordable Care Act. Florida has a huge enrollment, even though we haven't expanded Medicaid. So it's very important to the people that I represent.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: What are you--on--on this price billing issue, where would you say things stand right now you've been very involved in this issue in the last few months particularly?  </p><p>SHALALA: Yeah. And I've made no secret of the fact that I favor the bill that came out of ways of being right which is from my point of view much more balanced. The one thing you want to do in good health care policy or good public policy, in general, is not tilt one way or another. The whole--the issue in politics is whose ox are you going to gore? Political scientists use that term and that is who is going to get hurt? Who's going pay?  </p><p>In this case, I want to make sure that the doctors, the nurses, the people that work in hospitals, the patient first is protected in all the bills, but we don't tilt toward the insurance companies or towards the doctor or towards the hospitals in a--in an improper way. There has to be balance in terms of who pays. And--and I think some of the bills tilt one way or the other And I think the Ways and Means Bill is more balanced.  </p><p>They're going to have to negotiate because we have three committees. Two of them came out one way and one of them, the Ways and Means Committee came out, which I think is a much more balanced. But the key is what can we negotiate on the Senate side? But the real key is what will the president accept? It looks like he'll accept anything that will solve the problem. All of the bills solve the problem for the patient. Some of them, from my point of view, are a disaster for the health care system, have unintended consequences for the people who provide health care and the institutions like hospitals, academic health centers, children's hospitals, rural health care.  </p><p>And I just think sometimes you have to have a lighter hand of government and it has to be fairer. It can't be so heavy-handed. So I'm hoping will be able to negotiate something nearer to the Ways and Means Bill.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: And at this point, if our final bill does look more similar to the Education and Labor Energy and Commerce Committee, would you consider voting against it at this point?  </p><p>SHALALA: I'm not sure it'll pass. I'm just--I think that we've got to be able to make the case to our colleagues that it's a fair bill.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: Great. I'm going to up for questions in just one moment if anyone else has anything. But given that it isn't an election year, I think I'd be remiss not to bring up sort of how health care is playing on the campaign trail. In your district, you talked a lot about people being opposed to Medicare for all, the focus on affordability. How do you think that is shaping things at this point?  </p><p>SHALALA: Well, I think it's really about affordability. It's really--But when people say affordability, they're talking about their out-of-pocket costs. And I think it's important to remember that not only have we shifted the health care system one way or another, but we have a lot more people who have good health insurance, but high deductibles And that is--that has, by the way, mixed-up this surprise billing situation. But because we have high deductibles, people are seeing their out-of-pocket costs in many times for the first time. They're seeing out-of-pocket costs because of the high deductibles.  </p><p>If they're in a plan like the one we designed at the University of Miami where we pay the upfront costs and all the primary care costs, they don't see it as much. They do have a donut hole and a high deductible, but we cover the front end. But if they just have a high deductible plans, whoa, they're seeing out-of-pocket costs and that's what they're feeling. And--and that makes the health care system very different for them but everybody is talking to us about out-of-pocket costs. That's what we have to focus on.  </p><p>They focus--The public is focused on drug costs, but drug costs are only a part of it but drug costs have become the proxy for what has unfolded from, in my judgment, the high deductible plans.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: Do you think that people having more out-of-pocket costs, often in those high deductible plans does help kind of drive support for Medicare for all in a way?  </p><p>SHALALA: I think there are a variety of things, including the simplicity of it.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: All right, my moment here. Anyone in the audience have questions?  </p><p>SHALALA: No, wait. No one who I've met is for Medicare for all understands the Medicare program. If they did, they'd probably call for Medicaid for all which is more comprehensive. A very good point.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: I think we have mikes that are coming around, if you could just wait for that and then just state your name and who you're with and ask your question.  </p><p>QUESTION: Thank you for being here Representative Shalala, and thank you for this event. My name is Richelle Friedman. I'm with the Coalition on Human Needs. And at the very end, Representative Shalala, you talked about drug pricing becoming a proxy for high deductible--deductible. I'm thinking that that might sort of say something about it's not really about drug pricing, but I think it really is about drug pricing. So could you speak a little bit more to that? Thank you.  </p><p>SHALALA: I think, you know, I've been--I've known about the politics of drug pricing and how Americans compare our prices to other countries. The fact is that the rest of the world has cost shifted on to us the cost--the lower cost of their drugs have been subsidized by Americans, that we essentially pay for the research component and for and therefore, we pay more for drugs than any other people in the world.  </p><p>And that has led to discussions about why can't we just import drugs from Canada or from Mexico? My sister lives in North Dakota and she can run across the border to the pharmacy on the other side and get drugs at a much lower cost and by the way, they'll take her American prescriptions there but every American can't do that. But drug prices are certainly higher in this country for a wide variety of drugs and insulin has been the poster child for this fee.  </p><p>The head of J and J--no, the head of Eli Lilly came in to see me when he was cutting the cost of insulin. They were about to have a press conference. And he actually said to me he could have cut it even lower. I thought, why are you saying this to me? I think he came in for a photo opportunity and he ended up saying that to me. But I think Americans are seeing drug costs. I think their drug coverage has gaps in it and so they're seeing the out-of-pocket costs, particularly if they're forced into taking a certain kind of drug if their doctor wants them to take another drug.  </p><p>But the reason I said it's a proxy is because it's a clear example of us always overpaying and--and having strong out-of-pocket cost and it's the most concrete example that we have. And so, people are reacting to it. But there's no question that we're paying more than any European country or--or--or Canada or Mexico or Australia. But--but let me say this.  </p><p>The arguments the drug companies have given us has been that we'll destroy their pipeline, we'll destroy innovation. And every proposal I've seen, including the one the Democrats passed, actually allow for that in the pricing mechanism. And so, I don't buy that. I also don't buy that they have big pipelines anymore that they produce. They're basically buying licenses from the major research universities that are producing the ideas that have come out of the NIH investments that we've made.  </p><p>But these are real costs by real people. I sit often because I--I'm kind of hands-on and learning health policy. I'll sit in a CVS or a Walgreens on the chairs and watch as people come in and find out, particularly the elderly or people that have chronic diseases and have conversations with their pharmacists about costs and about what discounts are available to them. And while Part D was an enormous improvement, it doesn't cover everybody and particularly people that don't have very good health care.  </p><p>So these are real things. And I'm simply saying it's the most concrete example for people of--of out-of-pocket costs and I--I couldn't be more sympathetic with that. And that's why I often--when I--I know everybody that provides a service for me exactly what their healthcare situation is, what their costs are, what their out-of-pocket costs are and what they're concerned about, because I learned more about health policy from talking to real people about their situations than I do, frankly, from reading the articles. Sorry about that.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: No worries. Well, we are out of time for this morning's. Sorry if anyone else had questions but thank you so much for joining us, congresswoman. </p><p>SHALALA: Welcome.  </p><p>RESNIK: Thank you again, Congresswoman Shalala, for your time this morning, and thank you, Mary Ellen, for leading that conversation. I'd like to welcome our presenting sponsor, the Better Medicare Alliance, to the stage. Former Congresswoman, Allyson Schwartz is the president and CEO of the Better Medicare Alliance. Joining the congresswoman is Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at Project Hope. Sorry, just a moment. All right, Gail, Congresswoman, the floor is yours.  </p><p>WILENSKY: Get myself together. Pleasure to be here this morning, especially to share a few minutes with Congresswoman Schwartz. Always a pleasure to spend a few minutes with her. This is an interesting time because we are going now full blast into the election and one of the things that we know, not surprisingly true for almost every election, is health care is a big issue. People sometimes will ask me, do I think health care is going to be an issue in whatever election is coming up? And the answer, even without paying any attention to the polls, is almost invariably yes, for at least two reasons.  </p><p>First is that health care, health care costs particularly out-of-pocket cost, what it costs the individual is always an issue. But politically, you can be sure that health care is going to be an issue because it's in the interest of Democrats to make sure that health care comes up as an issue in a national election, because years and years, decades and decades' worth of polling has shown that on average, people feel more comfortable with the positions of Democrats on issues like health care and Social Security. And so you can rest assured that it will come up as an election issue.  </p><p>But there are particular reasons why we are seeing health care as an even more important issue than usual. I know that the Better Medicare Alliance is releasing a new study today and one of the things I hopefully discuss is a little bit about what that study has found. But what I also want to talk about is some of the support that you are finding for Medicare Advantage as an option for people to choose and how the members of Congress are reacting to the program. So maybe talk a little bit about that.  </p><p>SCHWARTZ: Well, good morning, everyone, and pleased to see you again this year. Always good--good to do this. And yes, health care is certainly always been on my agenda, it seems for a very long time, but it is on people's minds. And I can connect the two kinds of questions you asked about, which is why does it matter so much how much does it matter politically and how--and how we actually have achieved really bipartisan support for Medicare Advantage of a place where both Democrats and Republicans or people of no political stripe actually, you know, really come together and--and why.  </p><p>So first, I would say yes, health care is always an issue for people. It's helped me--Interesting thing about health care policy is it's not a big policy It's one that really individuals can relate to. It's--it's really a part of our daily conversations, you know, whether we're healthy or not. And certainly, you just heard Congresswoman Shalala talk about what's on all of our minds right now with the coronavirus.  </p><p>And, you know, how do we act responsibly for ourselves? How do we act responsibly for our communities and at--what we do together as a nation? That's kind of a big picture question that we're facing right now around public health and personal health issues. But we--we--what we know also is that right now, increasingly individuals, consumers are very concerned about health care costs and they're not concerned about federal costs, they are concerned their costs, their out-of-pocket costs.  </p><p>You see this with prescription drug coverage. It's you know, you're at the pharmacy, can I afford that co-pay? Can I afford all my medication? What if I do if I have high-cost specialty drugs? You heard about, again, Congresswoman Shalala talking about high deductible plans and out-of-pocket costs, which is really deductibles, co-pays. This is like insurance language, but it sort of matters to each of us every day as to what do you actually have to pay.  </p><p>And as we know, more and more consumers, whether they're employees or within individual market are finding themselves--are faced with having more costs directly related to them. That's a huge issue. I think--And so it is a political issue.  </p><p>Around Medicare Advantage, what I think is particularly interesting is, you know, the goals around Medicare Advantage are to provide a more integrated system of care that can do care coordination, offer your provider of--network of providers can help you sort through what--instead of a very fragmented fee for service system, which can be confusing, can be expensive and can be hard to access. It actually helps you navigate all those health care services.  </p><p>And seniors, it's a voluntary decision. How you get Medicare when you sign up, you get to decide if you notice it. If you don't decide, you're going to traditional fee for service Medicare, but you can choose is more integrated care coordinate system and consumers are choosing it. You've been following this, of course, with a 10 percent increase in Medicare Advantage. This past year, we've been seeing 8 to 10 percent increases since the last one to five years.  </p><p>But what's interesting about it is the--in related to consumer costs and you have this report that we're putting out today, so that you are the first ones to see it. It's on your on your seat. There's report we did last year and did again this year which actually asked consumers' Medicare beneficiaries to national survey data, We didn't do the survey, that's the national Medicare data. But asking consumers if they actually are more cost-burdened or less cost-burdened if they're in Medicare Advantage compared to traditional Medicare.  </p><p>And last year, we found it was about $1,200 a year less in savings. This year it was almost $1,600 per year savings if you signed up for Medicare Advantage and it's really important data for people to take into account. And that's because we've seen premiums go down in Medicare Advantage. Half of people who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage actually pay nothing extra after they pay part B that they don't need to and cannot buy Medigap, so that is a savings.  </p><p>These tend to be MAPD plans so your part D coverage is included in that. And plus you get extra benefits. Half of the plans provide some dental vision hearing and wellness programs. All four of those are provided by 50 percent of the plans.  </p><p>WILENSKY: This is especially important because as I assume most of you know, people tend to have lower incomes once they retire, once they're eligible for Medicare. And so while it's always important to us how much we have to spend for Medicare or health insurance, it becomes extremely important as you get older. My old agency, CMS, has proposed payment rules and maybe you could talk a little bit about the kinds of payments they're proposing going forward and any thoughts you have about adequacy for the purpose at hand.  </p><p>SCHWARTZ: We--we do watch CMS very carefully, so we'll watch all of them, every regulation that put out. But there is requite--required annual rate notice they call it is when they actually decide the rate they will pay for Medicare events next year and related policies. The rates are actually somewhat by formula but so it's really about the--the--the other policies that they-- two things I'll point out. Lots of details, but two that I'll point out that we're looking at and many of our allies, BMA is an alliance of almost 150 organizations and almost 500,000 beneficiary advocates of Medicare. But working together, we're concerned about--one thing we've liked a lot which is they're proposing expanded use of telehealth.  </p><p>You've heard about this happening because of the coronavirus, the idea that you could actually maybe not leave your home and go to the doctor's offices and sit in the waiting room with other sick people or healthy people or a combination thereof but more telehealth. This has been a space where Medicare Advantage has really led in using telehealth more because it (AUDIO GAP) aid by service, they're paid in a lump sum. So that's a useful tool for them. And really funding is a really important innovations in that.  </p><p>Group sessions, you can have or mental health visit or (AUDIO GAP) interesting kinds of models, I'm not to mention just being able to communicate with your doctor if you need to or the doctors communicating to each other, which is actually very helpful as well. (AUDIO GAP) but also greater use of telehealth, so we're very positive about that. We want them to keep those rules and to move forward on that. It's a chance away from Medicare Advantage to continue to innovate in this new space and new technology and all.  </p><p>But the other area is interesting is that 500,000 people in this country have end-stage renal disease and they've always been for very long time carved out and they've been offered--  </p><p>WILENSKY: 72, thank you.  </p><p>SCHWARTZ: I didn't even know that. Is that the federal government recognized that even people under 65 who end up with end-stage renal disease and go on dialysis are very complex patients, They tend to have comorbidities, they are very expensive, They now costs about $100,000 a year to be on dialysis three times a week, typically. And so, they said, gross, if who you are, you can get a Medicare if you've end-stage renal disease, it's really recognition of the high cost of special needs of this population. So thank you CMS, going back a while. But they always were carved out of Medicare Advantage.  </p><p>And if you are in Medicare Advantage and you had chronic kidney disease and you had kidney failure, you could stay in Medicare Advantage, but you couldn't enroll in Medicare Advantage once you were diagnosed. That changes in 2021. We think that's a good idea. We think many of these patients could benefit from the care coordination and the supplemental benefits even if it's transportation to your dialysis center could be an issue. But there are issues and a big issue is often happens is payment.  </p><p>Now, plans are not paid adequately to be able to pay the dialysis provider's and facilities. And there is a sense that there needs to be adjustments in the way the payment is done. We've done some--we've asked for some analysis disparities across the country. In (INAUDIBLE) particularly metropolitan areas where many of the beneficiaries are. There are higher incidence of those with end-stage renal disease, minorities, African-Americans and Hispanics. So we're asking CMS to find other ways to make sure that there's adequate payment, that there's a smooth transition, and that is enough resources to innovate in this space, more home dialysis potential mobile dialysis, use of outpatient hospital facilities to really create opportunities to bring down the cost overall.  </p><p>WILENSKY: There's one other issue and I'd like to touch on, and that has to do with the kinds of benefits that are now being allowed as maybe in the audience I--I've (AUDIO GAP) been hearing about it again in the run-up for the election that so much of health reflects what we call the social determinants of health. The places where you live and where you're born and the circumstances that you face as opposed to only a direct medical care.  </p><p>And one of the things that happened in a very important way was the Chronic Care Act which is now just being implemented, that allowed the Medicare program, the Medicare Advantage programs to include, as you were already alluding to, some of the social services, maybe tell a little bit more than you had already discussed what you think that will mean for some of the services that they can now receive.  </p><p>SCHWARTZ: And I'll just say the Chronic Care Act was a bipartisan effort in the Senate House, which was great and made a lot of changes in recognizing that the high costs in Medicare these days is really part of those single episodes of care when you do go to the hospital. But--but also it's the treatment and care of people with chronic conditions and multiple chronic conditions. A lot of people--I went on a home visit recently was with one of our provider allies. Both the husband and wife each had six to--six or eight chronic conditions, kind of sounds crazy. But not unusual in this day and age to have people have four or five or six chronic conditions.  </p><p>So they recognized that they made some changes both in fee for service but in Medicare Advantage and they work practically to the plans to be able to pry with no extra dollars. These are just dollars that they in the monthly payments and dollars they can save from avoidable hospitalizations and avoidable ER visits. Some of those dollars and actually to be able to find extra benefits that are not covered in traditional Medicare. Because you're right, there's been increasing recognition that, yes, we need clinical medical care. But in fact, what happens to the rest of our lives with her family history we can't do much about or whether it is, you know, our environment that we live in or access to health services or income or our limitations, functional limitations, that the social determinants of health account a great deal in being able to care for people and to be able to improve outcomes.  </p><p>So if your goal is to improve healthcare outcomes, which it isn't Medicare Advantage and to keep people healthier than you--then they start to realize that it really was important to do things like care in the home or even now they can do respite care for a caregiver, which is going to be really important to offer transportation to medical appointments. Huge issue for health care providers, getting people to a doctor or clinician, including not just calling 911 in the hospital, getting an ambulance to the hospital, but actually go into that primary care doctor or the nurse practitioner or the clinician you see and do that regularly to get your prescriptions if they need to be delivered, to get you even meal delivery.  </p><p>This has been going on for several years where meal delivery after an acute illness even for two weeks actually avoids readmissions because people actually-- post-surgery, I don't know If you have that experience, you hopefully you have family support. But if you don't, if you're elderly, if you can't get out of the house to buy groceries, you can't cook food for yourself, you are not getting nourished and you don't heal as well. Huge issues or you're not even hydrated. I mean, it's just a huge issue. So that's made a big difference. So now plans are allowed. Not all plans are doing this, but we are seeing plans really want to innovate in this space, particularly around healthy foods, a meal delivery, transportation, care in the home, they were even able to do some home modifications.  </p><p>So if you need one of those chair sliders because you've just had surgery for a month or so, if you need grippers in your--in your bathroom to prevent falls, these are things that now get--not every plan is offering all this, but in fact, it is happening across this country. There's a way for us to test out what works and what doesn't, what's most important and to ask you what personalized health care for people to be able--It also allows is you can target some of these benefits to the people who need it. It's not really allowed in traditional Medicare. Although, some people have more needs than others and getting them those cares will help them get healthier and save costs for the government.  </p><p>So I don't think I answered your question about the bipartisan nature. I should say that this year, we had 403 members of Congress split evenly between R and Ds and sign a letter supporting Medicare Advantage that went to CMS. That's 75 percent of Congress; it's an astounding number. In this moment, it only seems that all we're doing is arguing about health care and how we actually achieve the goal.  </p><p>It turns out for Medicare Advantage, Republicans like it, maybe because they like it--because it's using the private sector, it's a little more nimble in getting things done, they like the competition around quality and cost. Democrats like the security and the guaranteed benefits and yes, these social determinants of health and both Republicans and Democrats really like lower costs for consumers and better costs for the government.  </p><p>WILENSKY: How to objective that combination What we'll have to look for going forward is whether traditional Medicare, because it will probably always be an important choice for some seniors, can figure out how to do a better job integrating care. It is a program that's been set up that makes it challenging, irrespective of the desires of the physicians and nurses and other clinicians providing care to be able to integrate that care because part A inpatient hospital and part B physician and clinical labs and Part D outpatient prescription drugs are very separate even so much that if you have the physicians closing a savings to occur in prescription drugs or in inpatient services, the physicians can't get credit and the saving and spending is locked into whichever part makes it.  </p><p>It's just a reminder of how stove-piped traditional Medicare is. Medicare Advantage isn't always as integrated as we would like to see, but it at least allows a structure that if the plan is focused on integrating care for seniors, it can do so and I think it's a--it's an advantage that will be even more important as our population continues to age. I know I'm more interested in seeing that than I was eight, 10 or 15 years ago. So thank you for having this.  </p><p>SCHWARTZ: It's a good lesson for the whole health care system. It really is. So thank you for your comments and also it's my question to you about what do you think about Medicare Advantage and where Medicare is going in the future. But I think you're right. Those are gonna be around but it is a way to inform and improve health care for not only seniors but maybe for all of us.  </p><p>WILENSKY: I suspect as the people who age into Medicare are even more used to having networks as the way that they receive care, that wasn't the case, say, 20 or 25 years ago, when most of the people who were over 65 had not experienced that before. They got to be on Medicare that you will see Medicare Advantage grow even more in popularity because it will be what people were used to having when they were working.  </p><p>But importantly, for some people, having traditional Medicare will always be important, if only philosophically and because it's what they're used to or because they're in an area where having integrated care is hard to come by. Some of the more rural areas, small towns of the country that traditional Medicare will be important and it'll be important as an option to push Medicare Advantage to be even better than it is right now.  </p><p>SCHWARTZ: Well, let's thank Wilensky also. She's using the speaker, not the interviewer. So let's thank her very much for doing this. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>RESNIK: Thank you, Gail. Thank you, Congresswoman, and thank you again to the Better Medicare Alliance for making today's event possible. Keeping things moving, our first panel this morning will examine the state of play of the politics of healthcare. Healthcare seems to always be an issue in Washington. Being the pressing issue at the moment, coronavirus, the White House and Congress's negotiations on drug prices, The Supreme Court's decision to hear the Affordable Care Act challenges where the presidential campaign trails aim to define where our health care future lies.  </p><p>This panel will focus on what's next. Moving forward into 2020, what particular health care issues will take the spotlight? Mary Ellen McIntire will return to moderate this discussion which features a number of political experts. Bill Hoagland, SVP at Bipartisan Policy Center. Bill directs and manages the center's fiscal, health, and economic policy analysis. Before joining Bipartisan Policy Center in 2012, Bill served as the VP of public policy at Cigna.  </p><p>He worked with business leaders, trade associations and interest groups to develop the company's policy on health care reform issues at both the state and federal level. Before joining Cigna, Bill completed 33 years of federal government service, including 25 years as a Senate staffer.  </p><p>Jim Manley is a public affairs consultant and Democratic strategist With more than two decades of experience working in Congress. He formerly served as the senior communications adviser and spokesman for then Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid and the Senate Democratic Caucus. Jim played a major role in crafting the messaging strategy and tactics surrounding the passage of the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act, as well as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  </p><p>Michael Cannon is the director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute. Michael has been described as an influential health care walk by The Washington Post and Obamacare's fiercest critic. Before joining the Cato Institute, Michael served as a domestic policy analyst for the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee, where he advised the Senate leadership on health, education, labor, and welfare. Mary Ellen and our panel The floor is yours.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: All right We've got a pretty pro-Senate panel up here today I guess so we can take away from those introductions. Thank you all for joining us. We're going to be talking, like Josh said, about what comes next on health care. And you know, we have a lot. With the congresswoman about the Coronavirus which sort of seems to be taking a lot of the attention of Congress right now but Congress is also supposed to working on some sort of health care package ahead of this May 22nd deadline for our community health centers and other public health programs. To get started on that, what do you guys think is the likelihood of Congress being able to come together and get some sort of health care package in the next couple of months and weeks?  </p><p>HOAGLAND: I'll start with my sense is that the May deadline before the coronavirus broke and big news, everybody I think thought that that was going to be the triggering point for either surprise billing or some prescription drug amendments that would carry those through. I now think that that triggering date will serve more to address some of the issues that was raised by the secretary and that is the second supplemental on dealing with providing assistance to those who are impacted, individuals who are impacted.  </p><p>And so that will pull it--pull it through and only then maybe would--maybe surprise billing be attached to it. So I do see the May deadline is critical, but it's going to be more focused on the coronavirus Second supplemental.  </p><p>MANLEY: I think I'd probably agree with that. I must admit, I haven't spent a lot of time focusing on the impact of the Coronavirus, on how to move the legislative process. As you're about to find out depending what the question is, I'm going to be very pessimistic about getting much of anything done in Congress this year.  </p><p>Having said that, you know, for me, one of the fascinating things to watch Congress is the fact that this, you know, surprise billing issue hasn't been addressed and for me, it underlines the fundamental problems with Congress in this day and age, you know, in that it's broken. And the other thing I just simply raise is that I don't know if others have discussed this, but, you know, some of these bills being discussed, including surprise billing for this--for this May 20 package, you know, could serve as pay for us as well to pay for some of the other bills that are out there and or the extension of the previous package that has gone towards May 20th. So there is an inducement to deal with this but whether it's going to be enough to get it over the goal line remains to be seen.  </p><p>CANNON: So I think I agree with Bill. Congress really doesn't do business as usual anymore. We start in the sense of meeting deadlines and passing bills and that sort of thing. They respond to crises and sometimes those crises can pull other things along with them and get people to overcome. What I do think, it has been an increase in partisanship in Congress. I'm usually skeptical of those claims, but I am--I think it is getting worse.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: What do you guys think Sort of the shift in the past couple of months--a couple of years to start talking about healthcare costs in Congress as opposed to sort of the bitter fights over the Affordable Care Act in Obamacare, particularly kind of highlighted in 2017. Michael, what do you think of that shift in the past couple of years and how does that--the election may be shifted back to that?  </p><p>CANNON: Well, that is what supporters of the ACA promised and Donna Shalala said this. On occasion is that first, you have to get everyone covered and then, we can worry about cost control. So if you think about it, it's really sort of a dessert for spinach later approach to health policy. Well--we'll hand out lots of subsidies to health care providers and--and--and--and--and insurance companies and we'll--we'll--we'll cut back on the--on the payments to them, will--the excessive--excessive prices, the waste, the fraud, we'll take care of all of that later.  </p><p>It doesn't really work that way. I mean, once you--once you expand coverage, it's very hard then for Congress to try to eliminate any of the waste to excessive pricing in the system. Look at surprise medical bills. Here is an issue that has--that is affecting just about everyone. Raise your hand, by the way, if you or someone in your household has ever gotten a surprise medical bill. Okay, so this affects a lot of people, usually in the majority of the room. And this affects a lot of people.  </p><p>There is popular support for doing something about surprise medical bills, bipartisan support, bi-cameral support for it and it--and the fixes have been proposed would really only affect a small percentage of physicians, a small percentage of healthcare providers. Congress still--still can't get it done because it might reduce someone's income or might reduce someone's access to care and Congress is just no good at this. Every dollar of wasteful health care spending is a dollar of income to somebody and that somebody has a lobbyist and that lobbyist is gonna fight to defend it.  </p><p>So--so they can try to pivot--There's all this talk about pivoting to costs and trying to do something about costs. I'm very skeptical that they're going to be able to do anything simply because no one is very careful with their spending other people's money and certainly not as careful as they are when they're spending their own and that's why we have so much excessive pricing, so much waste in healthcare.  </p><p>HOAGLAND: By the way, Mary Ellen, with Congress fiddles around about surprise billing, the states are doing something on their own. As I recall, state of Virginia just finished their session which they came up with a baseball arbitration approach to it. The longer we delay and dally about it, the states are going to go ahead and start doing it on their own.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: Right, that make sense. Jim, House Democrats are getting ready to and Senate Democrats, I'm sure as well that we've kind of heard a little bit from the congresswoman about House Democrats getting ready to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the ACA, a health care affordability package, looking at maybe beefing up subsidies coming forward. How is that helpful for Democrats to be talking about the ACA and as we're on the campaign trail right now?  </p><p>MANLEY: Yeah, I got to tell you, when I read The New York Times online last night, the leek of the upcoming speech by the speaker and to former President Obama, I was very excited that it actually would give me something to talk about especially in the context, the current political debate, because I think building on the successes of the Obamacare is exactly the right way to go. And I am--I, for one, am deeply skeptical about the support out there for so-called Medicare for all.  </p><p>So, again, I--I was through--I've been through the health care wars, not only to survive Obamacare, is going back to patients' bill of rights, as Michael pointed out when I worked for Senator Kennedy, working with his old pal John McCain. Reform is hard and I learned from Kennedy that sometimes, half a loaf is better than nothing at all. And so given the hyperpolarized environment that we're in, I think hanging our hat on modest reforms, the current health care system are--are not--are the right way to go.  </p><p>And again, not to--Well, actually, I will be critical, you know, that for--the reforms being demanded by the Medicare for all folks are just too extreme and I am delighted to see that they are beginning to realize that, you know, it's only a asper--you know, it--it's aspirational at best. I think it's deeply unfair for senators to demand Medicare for all for their constituents at a time when there's not a snowball's chance in hell. It's going to get done anytime soon. So, again, I think it's right way to go on the policy. I think it's the right way to go into politics. It's good--it gives the speaker and the Senate Democrats something to rally round in the weeks and months to come because while the real election may focus one, two and three on Donald Trump, for Democrats, health care reform is going to serve as a powerful wedge issue.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: So far Bill, do you think--Jim, sorry. Do you think that Democrats are doing a good job of following up on the 2018 playbook that, you know, put house Democrats in power as you know, I think you would hope they would be?  </p><p>MANLEY: You know, it's tricky, Mary Ellen. You know, I--I--I for one sure, I would like to start the two year--this two-year cycle by focusing on bread and butter issues, including health care and, yes, the speaker and her team had passed a long list of agenda items, all of which are going to die and or have died a quick, painful death in the Senate. But I also acknowledge that you know, for better, for worse, we had to deal with the impeachment issue. That's been done. I know the speaker very well. She's got an amazing ability to walk and chew gum. I hate that phrase, but she's got an amazing ability to walk and chew--chew gum at the same time and she is going to Hammer on her caucus to the extent she needs to--to focus on these issues in the weeks and months to come.  </p><p>Again, for better, for worse, I can talk about that as well as some of the things, the oversight we're going to lose but I'm confident she can do it.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: Michael, as Republicans are talking about health care, you know, they've tactics--the president talks a lot about trying to lower drug prices but some have criticized Republicans for not really having a clear replacement plan for the ACA. How do you think Republicans should be talking about this as Democrats are talking about, you know, building out on this Medicare for all public option or even just beating up subsidies?  </p><p>CANNON: How should Republicans be talking about health care? Gosh, talk about aspiration. If you understand the politics of health care of the United States, I have a little joke that helps people understand the politics of health care in the United States. It goes like this. What do Republicans and Christian scientists have in common? They just don't do health care and--and it--and it really shows and when I saw Amy Klobuchar's health care, her two-paragraph health care plan, you remember that Elizabeth Warren hammered against, I thought is she running for the right party's nomination? I thought she was running as a Republican, her health plan was so thin.  </p><p>It's really hard to get Republicans to focus on this. I worked in the Senate for--Senate leadership for four years. I was not a Republican at the time. They knew that before they hired me, I couldn't get them interested in health care because it's just, I mean, there are really important reasons for this. But it's, you know, I have all sorts of ideas about what they should be talking about.  </p><p>One of the problems is when they do talk about health care, often they are not talking about what they're--they're not following their principles supposedly about freedom and free markets and limited government. Oftentimes, they're just sticking up for the industry that wants bigger subsidies from the--from the federal government. I think a perfect example and sort of a man bites dog, an example of--of Republicans doing something on health care is the Medicare Part B International Pricing Index proposal that the Trump administration has put forward.  </p><p>I think just about everybody who has looked at pricing for Medicare Part B drugs agrees that -outside of the industry maybe - agrees that these prices are excessive, that the way the Congress came up with paying for these drugs is inherently inflationary, not only inflates the prices, but it also encourages doctors to pick the most expensive drugs. And what the Trump administration did was a very sensible step that would address the problem that Congresswoman Shalala mentioned or help mitigate it of U.S. consumers having to pay the--the R&amp;D costs for drugs and effectively subsidizing folks or patients in governments in other countries.  </p><p>He said, look, we'll just make the prices--the--we'll just peg them to the average price for a basket of countries rather than just the average price in the United States. That would have the effect of bringing those prices down. So I thought this was wonderful. You know, this is--this is finally a Republican administration that proposes something that would reduce health care spending. And you would think that all sorts of conservative groups would rally around this government limiting proposal. But what has happened? You see front page ads - not front page, full-page ads in The Wall Street Journal, in The Washington Post with all sorts of conservatives and even some couple libertarian groups, not the Cato Institute are calling this importing foreign price controls.  </p><p>I didn't see the one in Roll Call. I saw those two and I have them and I can put them in PowerPoint presentations and all that. And so, you know, it's--it's really hard to get Republicans to say anything sensible about it--about health care. And when they do, they're often very divided and confuse what the industry wants with what is good for consumers and what is pro-market and pro-competition.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: So Bill, as we are--I don't know if we can say we're getting to the end of the Democratic primary and perhaps tonight, we'll be a little bit instructive on that. But heading into the general election, how do you expect the health care debate to change sort of from Medicare for all versus public option camp into more of whoever the nominee is versus President Trump's health plans?  </p><p>HOAGLAND: Well, as you say, it depends a lot about the Democratic nominee, whether it's going to be Senator Sanders or senator or vice president--former Vice President Biden. Particularly as we go into the campaign to--then to the presidential debates this fall, I think that we're going to see this dichotomy about whether we build upon the Affordable Care Act. I think Medicare for all, by the way, I agree with Jim completely, I think Medicare for all should be off the table first It will never pass in the United States Senate. There will never be 60 votes for anything like that unless there's a major--major change in the makeup of the Senate. I don't think it's going to happen.  </p><p>So I think basically it's going to shift to along the lines, Michael won't agree with this, but I do think we're talking about improving upon the Affordable Care Act, building upon it. This is a selfish plug on my part. We spent the last three years at the Bipartisan Policy Center with a group that we call the Big Ten which was led by Senator Daschle and Senator Frist. And we came up with a proposal that we released about two weeks ago which basically says, come on, from a bipartisan perspective, you got to take what we've got and build--improve upon it.  </p><p>There are things in there, Michael, that you would like as it relates to a cost and controlling cost and consolidations and pricing, but it was a bipartisan approach. I would hope--maybe I'm--maybe I'm a dreamer on this, I still think that there's a possibility that depending upon the outcome this fall, that we could still see a need to--Congress could still see a need to build upon and improve upon that particular law.  </p><p>I think pricing, we talked--you talked about cost, I think the issue is price. I agree with Michael, I don't understand why Republicans didn't, quite frankly, in the Senate too take on the position that the president put forth with his proposal on this. But it does seem to me that--that--that the HR3 to some extent, it really goes down that same route, that there should have been some movement. But the whole issue to me is price and not in controlling those price and I think we're--we're going to have to come back to that in the next Congress.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: Are any of you optimistic that there could be some sort of bipartisan, meaningful drug pricing agreement?  </p><p>HOAGLAND: I don't believe in this session.  </p><p>CANNON: Not--not optimistic, but I think it's possible because the Grassley-Wyden Bill is pretty sensitive. Again, if Republicans were following their limited government principles, they would say, hey, this is an attempt to try to reduce government spending. But get them in a room with a former lobbyist and innovation, oh, we can't stop that, oh, it sounds like government price controls, never mind that it is no more government price controls than what we're doing right now or no more government interfering with pricing than what the government is doing right now.  </p><p>HOAGLAND: I would agree with--with Michael that--but I would expect this is where Jim will weigh in except the majority leader of the United States Senate does not plan on taking up the-- </p><p>CANNON: Well, right because--  </p><p>MANLEY: He stole my line actually. Yes, Senator McConnell's not in the habit of bringing up bills that picked up seven Republican no votes, How many--in the Finance Committee. I don't know if this is the right time or whatever, but I just say one word, reconciliation. Honestly, not going to happen year. Yeah, obviously not going to happen this year, but, you know, depending on how things play out, you know, the use of reconciliation will be interesting to watch.  </p><p>HOAGLAND: Can I--can I weigh in there just a second having spent it (INAUDIBLE) Well, I have to keep reminding people, you know this. I kept reminding people, you don't get to reconciliation unless you pass a budget. We hadn't passed the budget for the last four years, we're not going to pass one this year and yet getting a budget passed is-- </p><p>MANLEY: I know. that--I came up into it wrong. I mean, obviously, I was going to lay down that predicate, you got to pass a budget and it depends--you know, a lot--a lot of different variables, can't get into which one. But my only point raising is that, again, as I suggested earlier, I'm not sure how much of anything is going to be next is going to get done this year But depending on how things happen, hopefully--hopefully we'll flip the Senate. There is--There will be ability deals some of this stuff in the next--next Congress.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: Do you think that if Democrats still control the Senate, you would get Republican votes on bipartisan bill?  </p><p>MANLEY: No.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: Gonna open it up for questions in just a moment, but wanted to bring up before we wrapped up the Texas vs. Azar case. Last week, the Supreme Court said it will hear the case sometime next--in its next term. What do you guys think ends up happening with this and how does this affect sort of the summer campaign?  </p><p>CANNON: Why I like--we're talking about this because it's an issue in which Jim and I can agree because this case, even though--  </p><p>MANLEY: I just found this out, by the way, I thought we were going to come to blowers (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>CANNON: No, so even though I had something to do--  </p><p>HOAGLAND: And I had special sit between them.  </p><p>CANNON: with another Obamacare case, it made it to the Supreme Court. I think it is unconstitutional-- the whole war was unconstitutional, should be overturned by the courts. Now, I don't think they should do it like this. I think this case is terrible. I mean, the plaintiffs don't have standing, there is no more mandate to challenge and if there--if there were, it would be severable from the rest of the law. I think it's a terrible case. But then again, the courts have handed down lousy opinions before Obamacare cases and it might be that he who lives by terrible judging also dies by terrible judging.  </p><p>I don't want that to happen but I think that if that does happen, ACA supporters will only have themselves to blame. Now, I also think that it's the second most important to Obamacare case making its way through the courts or case related to Obamacare. There's another one that will be called a CAPI treasury, which is a challenge to the Trump administration Short term plans rule.  </p><p>Congresswoman Shalala derided these earlier, but the young man in Florida she mentioned who got the $3,000 bill for--for a coronavirus test because he had a short term plan. He would have paid even more under Obamacare. If he had stayed with his Obamacare plan, he would have ended up paying even more. So who's selling junk plans now?  </p><p>That--there is a challenge to the Trump administration's rules that--rule that--that added consumer protections to short term plans. It's being brought by insurance companies that want to make those plans unattractive as a way to force consumers like that young man into more expensive Obamacare plans that they sell.  </p><p>MANLEY: Succinctly, as a so-called Democratic strategists, it's the gift that keeps on giving. As long as this issue is hanging out there, we're going to run like hell against it.  </p><p>HOAGLAND: I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a constitutional lawyer at all So I can't really on can say that if it were to be struck down, the disruptive effects it would have on the currency, because I think it's--I think the way that the case has been brought, the whole law falls. There's a lot of other stuff in there besides the insurance stuff that we'd survive. I think it would be--I think it would be a very uncomfortable situation. I kind of wish--I kind of wish the Supreme Court had taken it up before the election so we can resolve this and put it before it.  </p><p>CANNON: Again, I don't think they should strike it down or at least not like this, but I do agree that it is a gift to Democrats in the election because Republicans once again have not learned how to talk about health care. If Republicans point it out that the ACA's preexisting conditions provisions are actually making the quality of coverage worse for people with a lot of expensive medical conditions and there's economic research showing this--economic research by supporters of the ACA showing this is happening, then they would get the public on their side against those provisions.  </p><p>Every poll that's ever been done shows that if you talk about the costs of those provisions and not just the benefits, then not only do Republicans and independents swing against those provisions, Democrats swing against those provisions. But Republicans would have to learn how to talk about health care And Republicans don't do health care.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: All right. Perhaps, that's as close to a kum ba yah moment.  </p><p>MANLEY: Pretty damn close.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: Does anyone have any questions for the panelists? Just wait for the microphone to come around.  </p><p>QUESTION: Hi, Paul Heldman with Heldman Simpson Partners. I want to tap Bill's expertise on the budget and maybe Jim's expertise on the Senate and ask you. If the Democrats control Washington in 21, if despite your skepticism, Bill, they get a budget resolution, what can be done on healthcare via reconciliation, specifically on the public option and negotiation of drug prices as envisioned by HR 3? Are those things that can be done by reconciliation? How do you think the parliamentarian might rule on that?  </p><p>HOAGLAND: First of all, right, we have to get a budget passed. If--I'll take--I'll take your position, first of all as to Democrats controlling the Senate. It depends who those Democrats are first of all, because it takes, of course, 51 votes to pass that budget resolution with the reconciliation. Reconciliation has been completely from my perspective, the years that I was involved in--in putting together reconciliation, it has been completely blown out of the water in terms of what its original purposes were.  </p><p>But ostensibly the parliamentarian would still only look at those things that have a budgetary consequence. So I think that a public option would have a budgetary consequence and therefore, I think it would pass reconciliation muster. I think anything dealing with drug prices would have a budgetary consequence, therefore, it would pass reconciliation. It's all the ancillary stuff that goes along with that that could possibly be struck under what we call the Byrd Group. But that's--that's the that's the difficulty. You could end up with the budgetary impact, but you would end up with a Swiss cheese type of bill that you can't implement a lot of it.  </p><p>CANNON: But wouldn't the budgetary impact of a public option be incidental to it's--  </p><p>HOAGLAND: I--I--I would--It all depends on--who knows.  </p><p>CANNON: But HR3 has provisions that would affect the directly regulated private prices for drugs. It's not just government spending for drugs. And so that would create reconciliation problems to. Now, I think Grassley-Wyden might--  </p><p>MANLEY: A thing of the pass. </p><p>CANNON: has filed reconciliation, it wouldn't be stopped by budget rules.  </p><p>MANLEY: And then, Paul, regarding the Senate, There's obviously have to be a real come to Jesus meeting between the House and Senate leaders about what exactly to focus on, you have limited bites on the apple with no inside knowledge. I assume that health care would be one track for a reconciliation bill depending on how you work it. You can get another bite of the apple--apple on another reconciliation bill and I think probably so-called infrastructure reform would be a likely topic for the second reconciliation bill.  </p><p>But you know, the Green New Deal, folks are going to be coming after you with a two by four to deal with that as well. So it's going to--it's good--It would--The debates would get ugly before it'd be over.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: Good question. Do you think whoever the next president is, healthcare is where they spend the bulk of their political capital in the beginning of next term?  </p><p>MANLEY: Well, this are shades of 2008 when Obama--  </p><p>CANNON: If it's a Republican, no.  </p><p>MANLEY: What do they focus on?  </p><p>HOAGLAND: Infrastructure.  </p><p>CANNON: Oh, God, what do Republicans focus on? I don't know. </p><p>HOAGLAND: Taxes. </p><p>MCINTIRE: Taxes.  </p><p>CANNON: Is it God or immigration?  </p><p>MANLEY: Yeah Well, again, that's an interesting point because the pressure on the Democratic administration deal with immigration reform would be tremendous. You know, there's--this is really bring bad flashbacks of 2008 trying to deal with all these competing concerns. We'll have to wait. It just depends but, you know, there's only limited bites in the apple. All of these, you know, executive orders on day one are worth a piece of paper. They're written on for variety of different reasons, but I assume for a Democratic president to be at the top of the list.  </p><p>MCINTIRE: All right Well, we are out of time for this morning. Thank you all for joining us. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>RESNIK: Thank you again, Mary Ellen, and thanks again to Bill Hoagland, Jim Manley, and Michael Cannon for joining us this morning. In keeping with the theme of today's event, our second panel will discuss a wide range of topics from changes to existing laws and regulations that are needed in order to enable machine learning technologies to identify patterns and improve health care outcomes to the role of physicians in developing new apps and how the FDA is encouraging the emergence of virtual reality drugs.  </p><p>The conversation will be moderated by my colleague, Gopal Ratnam, tech reporter at CQ Roll Call. This panel will feature a number of experts. Andy Fish is chief strategy officer for AdvaMed, otherwise known as the Advanced Medical Technology Association. As chief strategy officer, Andy overseas AdvaMed's global, regulatory and payment departments. He also coordinates the development, operations and policy work of AdvaMed's membership sectors, as well as AdvaMed's Center for Digital Health.  </p><p>Dr. Bobby Mukkamala is board-certified otolary--otolaryngologist - I'm relatively proud of myself right there - and an elected member of the American Mental Association's board of trustees. A graduate of the University of Michigan Medical School, he is in solo private practice in Flint, Michigan.  </p><p>Dr. Mukkamala, who's been active in the AMA since residency, is a past Michigan representative to the AMA young physician section, a past recipient of the AMA Foundations Excellence in Medicine Leadership Award And for the last 13 years, a member of the Michigan delegation to the AMA House of Delegates.  </p><p>Joel White is executive director at the Health Innovation Alliance. The alliance is a broad-based coalition of patient groups, provider organizations, employers and payers. It supports incentives to deploy health information technology, to improve quality outcomes and patient safety at lower costs. Joel spent 12 years on Capitol Hill as professional staff, during which he helped enact nine laws, including the Medicare Modernization Act, the Deficit Reduction Act, the Tax Reform and Health Care Act, the Trade Act and the Children's Health Act. Joel was instrumental in developing the Part D e-prescribing law and the Medicare Modernization Act and in developing legislation that passed the house to promote the adoption for use of health information technology. Gopal, take it away.  </p><p>RATNAM: Thank you. Thank you, Josh. Thanks--Thanks, everyone, for showing up at this conference despite the fears of the pandemic spreading all over. I have to reassure everyone that we've been very careful and not shaking hands with each other. We've all done this in a very dignified way to greet each other.  </p><p>I'd like us to--we have 20 minutes, which is barely enough to scratch the surface of the things we want to talk about. But I want to talk--begin by asking the panelists to talk about what if we were in a perfect tech-enabled healthcare world, how would that look in terms of how we track and prevent the spread of this pandemic that we're in the midst of? I--and I want to ask Bobby to begin that. I mean, he's a physician. He's at the pointy end of the spear, so to speak dealing with patients so why don't you talk about that?  </p><p>MUKKAMALA: Sure. Yeah, Thank you, Gopal. So it's an interesting question and an interesting time to ask that question. But as I think back of what would be different if everything was ideal and tech was perfect and did everything we needed to do, what would my office day be different and which way would it be different tomorrow?  </p><p>And so I would say as it relates to this virus, if I saw a patient that came in tomorrow morning that had the sniffles and had a little bit of an ear ache and came in to see me as a routine patient because they come every six months to get the wax cleaned out of their ear, right now, I wouldn't think much of it. I'd say probably caught a cold, no reason to sort of dig into travel history and all that sort of thing.  </p><p>But if, however, in this tech-enabled environment, that patient before recently visiting Italy had gone in for a routine physical exam with their primary care physicians office and that was captured in that physician's medical record, the patient about to go on a trip to Italy, then in a perfectly tech-enabled world, AI would be able to put together, here somebody that went to Italy, Italy is now under lockdown and comes back with a little bit of sniffles and happened to get noted when they came in for a routine visit to get their earwax checked. Their primary care physician has no idea that they have these symptoms. I have no idea that the patient went to Italy, but AI knows both, Right.  </p><p>And so how great would it be that something pops up on my computer screen that says, based on what we've assessed, this patient is at high risk for acquisition of this virus and should be monitored or tested. Right--right now that it's impossible that that would happen unless they become symptomatic and by then, the horse has left the bar.  </p><p>RATNAM: Andy so, I mean, you represent a lot of companies that are in the business of developing those technologies that connect the dots.. What would that look like if your companies could have the perfect tech-enabled world?  </p><p>FISH: Well, I think setting aside that initial ramp-up here and ideally, what you have is, you know, relaxed criteria for screening so that you could actually identify all the folks that are low symptomatic rate. It would--and--and that would be the biggest possible window on this situation, because--without that wide field of--of data, you're just never going to get ahead of this, right.  </p><p>I think that's what we're confronting right now, is we're playing catch up and testing has not yet caught up with reality. So in an ideal tech-enabled world, you have that test capacity and you have, you know, criteria that allow you to test anyone who is conceivably symptomatic and then through that kind of AI-enabled database, you've got a much more complete picture, right.  </p><p>So I think, you know, that's--some of that is a matter of policy. It's not technology(ph) necessarily but we're, you know, we have most of those pieces right now. We have yet to have a system that really can put them together.  </p><p>RATNAM: We're gonna get to the policy aspect. But Joel, I mean, you also deal with the, you know, the--the point where patients actually collect the medication, you represent pharmacies and so on. How would that look like if all of this were well connected?  </p><p>WHITE: Is I think about this I mean, you've got to think about what's the ideal way to stop the spread and to treat the patient. And, you know, ideally, it's under a quarantine type situation. You want to treat people in their home. So we need the tools and the data that enable people to be treated in their home rather than having them come into a hospital facility or physician office to be tested or, you know, a lab situation to be tested or to come to a pharmacy to pick up their medication where they may be infecting additional people, right.  </p><p>Like we want to be able to, first of all, have a rapid diagnostic test that can be delivered to the patient in their home with the assistance of a telemedicine or a physician or nurse to be able to walk that patient through that. We need to collect that safely, get it to a lab, have it tested, results need to be delivered real-time, probably by an app to both the provider and the patients so they know don't leave your house, right. And then once that's done, then we can figure out a better course of treatment to keep that person, you know, kind of out from the general population.  </p><p>Again, the last thing we want them to do is to be kind of wandering around the metro or the subway or the pharmacy infecting other people. So those tools and I think part of what we are also seeing is that kind of the failure of government policy to enable those tools in the homebase setting and we need to change that and that's something the government can absolutely, absolutely do.  </p><p>And just to underscore John's point right, we have tabletop technology to run those kinds of genetic tests looking for, you know, viruses that have a sample So, again, cost aside, if you could deploy those--those test machines actually to individual patients, consumers at home, they could, in fact, run the tests themselves.  </p><p>I mean, the other point of care test technologies that an individual could run with extremely minimal instruction and training and you can get those results right. So, again, this kind of these pieces exist but again, cost aside, just the infrastructure, right, to get those tests to the people who should have them as you know, it would be a challenge.  </p><p>FISH: To just add on to that, I think this is not Tomorrowland, right, this is not Technology to be developed, this is--as so many technology issues are in healthcare, this is a leadership issue. Right. We need to define how we're going to address this going forward and then actually move out and we need for that, we need the leadership at this local, state and national level.  </p><p>RATNAM: I mean, one of the things that I think all three of you care a lot about is, I mean, in terms of policy and in terms of leadership is the way that information on patients that are embedded in electronic health records, they don't talk to each other. And so, therefore, physicians aren't able to find out in a large group of patients in a--in a city or in a county what's going on. And Joel, I think you pointed out that, you know, that kind of lack of interoperability and lack of information sharing also affects the entire chain of actors. So can you talk about--maybe, Joel, you can talk about this. you can start with this and talk about how, you know, what we need to do to get all the health records working and talking to each other.  </p><p>We're--we're $38 billion in on for promoting interoperability program where we basically subsidize the purchase of these electronic health record systems and what we did through those systems is we digitized, we didn't transform health care. So we made the information electronic but that information is still kind of locked in These systems is not shared for treatment purposes. And, you know, just yesterday, the administration came out with a rule that basically said you can no longer block information as part of these electronic health record systems.  </p><p>It took us 10 years to get that law enacted and to get those regulations out. It was a really tough fight to say you can't lock this information down anymore if--if--if you need it to treat a patient with head neck cancer. Like I can't stop you from getting that information out of the primary care EHR system.  </p><p>I mean, the politics around this are brutal. It's absolutely brutal because people make a lot of money through data silos. And so by freeing up the data and hopefully, you know, we're still digging into these rules that were just released yesterday, the rules will effectuate kind of a tidal wave of data liquidity. And that data liquidity will foster the future of health care because I believe firmly that data is the future of health care, will help us cure cancer, will help us spot and prevent infectious disease and it will help us, you know, intervene at a--at a population and individual level to help lower health care costs.  </p><p>RATNAM: And what about Andy, what do you think the possibility looks like?  </p><p>FISH: Well, I mean, it looks like Joel kind of described it right which is freely flowing information available kind of to whomever needs it when they need it, right, and ideally powered by a number of, you know, algorithms that can make, you know, find those insights and that data to reduce the amount of time someone has to spend poring over that information.  </p><p>I guess I would just underscore, I think what Joel kind of alluded to, which is I think pretty much everyone aspires to and understands the benefits of having that kind of massive data liquidity and having interoperability actually work properly. But there's a lot of factors why people hold on to data, right and some of it is--some of it is commercial value. But there's a lot of, you know, pressures to individuals to extract something from that data and publish on it and I mean, there's you know, there's a lot of sort of reasons why people hold on to what they've gathered.  </p><p>So I think we need to keep having conversations around, you know, some of those underlying issues that have resisted, you know, a more interoperable environment.  </p><p>MUKKAMALA: And if I could just add an observation. So I practice in Flint, Michigan. I share an office with my wife. every week, we still have to go and get refills on our fax toner because that is the primary method of communication with the offices in our area. So a patient comes to see me, they've got records at another physician's office. We have probably about 10 EHRs that are in our community that somebody--that some percentage of the physicians are using and they're not interoperable.  </p><p>And so we end up faxing records and scanning them and--and then I look at them and I click off on them and I sign them. So at the same time that we find ourselves with the ability in this country to do remote robotic surgery on the battlefield, right. So that--that--that extreme evolution of healthcare and the utility of that and yet have the majority of us faxing records back and forth, I mean, I feel like I'm Fred Flintstone and George Jetson at the same time. And it's that-it's that striking on a daily basis.  </p><p>FISH: Right. Quick question. When you fat--when you scan those records in, you've got an image now in your EHR that you just read the image but it's not extracting data at a field by field basis and it's still nothing you can do.  </p><p>MUKKAMALA: Exactly. It's great for me, but it's not great for the next person that backs that same record to.  </p><p>RATNAM: What about I mean, all three of you talked about data liquidity and now obviously what that means is that data is now available to third parties as well. So who can then develop applications of the AI and machine learning on top of that data to find patterns, to find things. What are some of the benefits and downsides of that that third party is having and how do you--quickly can you talk about how do you put some parameters and boundaries on how the data will be used and should not be used? Joel, do you want to go?  </p><p>WHITE: So I, you know, I said data is part of the future of health care. I think we should make it a goal in this country that within five years we will kill the fax machine. Now, I don't want to get brutally assaulted by the fax machine industry and whatever is out there. But, you know, the platforms and the ability to manipulate data and use it so that a physician or clinician can spot a problem or challenge and then address it is huge.  </p><p>And so I'll give you one example from Kaiser. They're now using the big data to figure out optimal scheduling times for patients, right. They know from social determinants of health and other data, you know when Jim is--is going to be available on a Friday because he fills up his--his boat, right, with--with--with fuel. And they know that like Jim's going to take off Friday, Saturday, Sunday to go be at the lake. So let's not schedule that Friday for an appointment with Jim as he goes through his next round of chemotherapy.  </p><p>It's those kinds of interventions that will be able to figure out through big data that--that will help assist an optimal engagement with the patient. But at the other end, like we are using increasingly encounter data, clinical data and claims data as well as real-world evidence data to kind of extract and be able to pull through--through the scientific community, spotting problems and challenges for new cures.  </p><p>A company out of Salt Lake City right now that is one 100 percent machine data fed and they're literally going through tissue samples and other things and running algorithms on it to figure out what is the best chance possible for curing this very specific type of rare childhood cancer. It's--it's--none of it is touching a patient, right? So data literally, we'll be curing cancer through this effort in Salt Lake City.  </p><p>So the opportunities are massive. They are exciting, they are the future I think that you know, we've had a few anecdotes about, you know, Google Health is involved in this or Amazon's involved in that and look at this hospital system is using this big tech company to figure out a new system and isn't that horrible? I think what we need to recognize is those companies are the experts and they're operating within the four walls of HIPPA to assist a hospital, to either better engage with their patients or to figure out a cure for cancer.  </p><p>And so that side of the story, I think, first of all, it needs to be told. Second of all, we need to recognize that when people take that data and use it inappropriately, that there ought to be an enforcement mechanism or a tool to kind of slam those guys. And I'm not sure it's a fine or a criminal penalty, I think my sense is, is that we--we ought to be looking at preventing people from operating in markets that they want to operate in if they're going to act like bad actors. But we need to have that discussion, you know, the enforcement discussion is a very important dialog. But right now, what we need to focus on is really freeing up that data and establishing the rules of the road around how it's used and how it shouldn't be used.  </p><p>RATNAM: And, could you have anything too quick--to add to that?  </p><p>MUKKAMALA: Yeah, I guess I would also say that I can imagine patients coming in with voluminous terabytes of data about their blood pressure readings over the course of the past six months prior to their next visit, and the quality of that data is what I want to know, right. So was that data--You know, there's a right way to monitor blood pressure and there's a wrong way to monitor blood pressure. If you download an app, get a device, put it on your arm, put your fingers on it and get data, It is not necessarily useful to the people that are managing that condition, like the primary care physician that now has to look at literally thousands of blood pressure readings to figure out, does this require an adjustment in the blood pressure medication or not?  </p><p>And so, you know, we have to be careful that the acquisition of that data, the source of it, the verification of its validity, is also very robust.  </p><p>RATNAM: We're going to talk about the role of physicians in developing some of these apps. But quickly, there is obviously a big national debate going on, as well as the debate at the state level on data privacy. And to your point, Joel, so third party developers getting access to patient data, there's obviously doubts and fears about de-identified data. Can you identify an individual based on that data or is all of that metadata stripped out of it?  </p><p>To what extent are states and Congress dealing with healthcare-related data in the larger context of consumer privacy? I know both Andy and you have some thoughts on that.  </p><p>WHITE: So what are the first laws I worked on when I went to work in Congress Was HIPPA and that law was created 10 years before the first iPhone came out. It was a very different time, but it is the main law that is governing privacy as it relates to health care data. It is woefully out of date, it needs to be modernized because we never envisioned when we created that law, these different platforms and the different types of data and the different uses for the data, the applications.  </p><p>Second thing we never envisioned was the general societal and cultural changes that have evolved over time with respect to how data is out there, right. Kind of everyone in this room would say, I'm on Facebook, I'm putting my data out there, that's okay. But I also feel powerless to not walk around life without my cell phone, right. And how much data is being sucked through this, right and what am I trading off in terms of privacy.  </p><p>So a lot of these privacy laws that are--that are coming up right now literally is an effort to modernize and fill in the gaps where HIPPA no longer is adequate. But it's also a response to people feeling kind of powerless and that--and that, you know, there needs to be a new framework.  </p><p>And so states are stepping up, but really, what we need to recognize that data is kind of a global commodity or asset right now. It's not like a state by state. If we don't have a nationwide uniform structure to govern data and how it's used in health care, we will lose the applications that will get us to cures us for cancer or to spot pandemics or to treat patients in the most appropriate cost-effective way.  </p><p>RATNAM: So Andy, so the--some of--some of the companies that are part of your group, I mean, they depend on this data and so obviously to develop apps and technologies based off of that. To what extent are, you know, the absence of these national (INAUDIBLE) data privacy laws hindering that process?  </p><p>FISH: Well, I would say right now status quo is not necessarily a challenge--the challenge. The concern is that with multiple state laws that have differing requirements and are inconsistent with HIPPA and other federal privacy frameworks around research subjects and so forth, you'll end up with a--with a really tough mess.  </p><p>Our concern primarily is that you'll have general privacy restrictions put in place that affect health care, but aren't designed for health care and health care is a much more complex situation I think sort of this irony of we need to do much more with data, the promise that we can deliver better health care more efficiently and do a better job is--is there but at the same time, we need to make sure we're doing more for privacy, partly just to make sure that consumers and patients feel comfortable with the data sharing that they may be consenting to, right.  </p><p>So we've been seeing that California Consumer Privacy Act as a general law affecting health care but the California legislature saw it fit to exempt certain major areas of health care data from it, recognizing that HIPPA's covering those areas, right. So we're hoping we're hopeful that the states and Washington State is sort of following this model as well, will not touch certain major areas of health care data when they enact broad privacy laws.  </p><p>At the same time, of course, we are working with Congress and we do actually endorse having a national privacy framework. It has to take health care into specific special account or we're going to have--we're gonna--we're gonna screw up the promise of health care data.  </p><p>RATNAM: And we have a four and a half minutes or we're going to talk about some of the most exciting tech in this four and a half minutes. So FDA, Bobby, we talked about this. So there's just a whole variety of apps that deal with health, health care and collecting data directly to consumers. And you had some concerns about how as physicians you don't have a role in the development of these apps and you would like, you know, a greater involvement in how tech companies develop these apps. Talk about that.  </p><p>MUKKAMALA: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's--we don't want to fall into the trap of just collecting again, volumes of data. Not all data is going to be useful data. And so, I would much rather be on the front end, sort of looking at what the technology is doing as far as creation of that data, make sure that it's valid and clinically useful. Then on the back end, going through terabytes of data, trying to figure out which ones are useful clinically or not, right. And so we don't want to--like the EHR is that train left the station and now we're working on interoperability.  </p><p>I don't want this app based data production. I don't want that train to leave the station and then figure out which of the apps are actually useful data or not. So why not on the front end, during the creation phase, during the vetting of that, make sure that it's actually going to produce something that's useful to help us take care of those patients.  </p><p>RATNAM: So you are I mean, your association is working with tech developers to kind of help them understand how as a physician, you would view the data and so on.  </p><p>MUKKAMALA: Yeah So I mean, the American Medical Association is very much out there wanting to be a resource in the development of these products so that we don't get caught in the same way that we were with EHRs, you know, be there on the creation side instead of being consulted to help fix it and make it what we want after it's already out there.  </p><p>RATNAM: Anything you want to add?  </p><p>FISH: Yeah, I would--I would just say, first of all, let's just says pause for a moment and think about what we mean when we say digital health, right. So we take this broad view that digital health is as horizontal, increasingly embedded across technology, Healthcare, med--medical technology. It's not--it's not a vertical, certainly not a vertical anymore, right.  </p><p>So you have this universe of data-generating technologies which can be distributed outside of intensive health care settings, right all the way to someone in their home, near-patient data collection, wearables, ingestibles, implantable, etc, right. So this expanding ability to create--to generate new data, either more of traditional data or novel data, right, continuous monitoring data gives you data points you've never seen before, right.  </p><p>Instead of going in every year for your cholesterol check, now you can see how your cholesterol varies over the course of a day and we all have a much deeper insight into what cholesterol means in terms of a health care measurement, right. So that's that proliferation of data through these data-generating technologies and then you have all the passing of data you can do to find actionable insights. And then you have data-driven technologies as well, right.  </p><p>So now, we'd like to talk about continuous glucose meters and the closed-loop systems that we now have. So you can drive insulin injections automatically based on, you know, where your glucose is at any given time. That's a tremendous advance for patients, right. We're gonna see more and more of these remote and automated interventions that can be driven by these data loops, right. And that frees up health care providers to spend more time doing what people should be doing and less time trying to figure out, you know, all the other stuff in diagnosis.  </p><p>So the range of applications that are data-driven is just, you know, is just incredible. I would say one of the most interesting advances among this because you ask about sort of where is cutting edge tech is digital therapeutics. Digital therapeutics are in some ways kind of the most data, pure application, if you will, because the only device involved, the only technology involved is the platform on which the app runs. But these are apps--these are essentially apps that are collecting patient information and engaging with the patient and basically behavior modification.  </p><p>So we've seen therapy--digital therapeutics go through and get FDA approval for indications that previously are only biopharmaceutical indications, depression really, for example, pain--pain relief, opioid alternatives that are getting clinical indications, claims, FDA approved, driven solely as apps that engage with patients, collect information and give feedback to patients in coaching and so forth. And that's a really interesting advance and we're going to see that just continue to take off.  </p><p>RATNAM: In fact, I saw Mickey Hart, the drummer, kind of talk about that. I think he's involved in one of these trials where there is a virtual reality headset for people with certain mental illnesses and Parkinson's kind of thing, then that kind of sets them through this process of movement. That is one of the therapeutic apps that apparently is being developed.  </p><p>So are we going to see the future of medicine where you talked about a series of things, ingestible? I mean, a lot of the--even the therapy being driven by apps. Is that the future? I mean, quickly, just maybe 10 seconds each.  </p><p>MUKKAMALA: And I think that it will add value, It will give me one more tool to help take care of my patient. I don't think that it's going to transform the way we take care of patients but in the same way that, you know, we used to get X-rays of the sinuses and now we get CAT scans of the sinuses, we get more detail. In the same way, what we used to acquire by having a patient come into the office, now that data gets acquired and we have that to use to interpret and take care of that patient. </p><p>WHITE: Yeah, I think we've constructed a world in the physician office. I wouldn't call it artificial intelligence, I call it artificial communication where the physician is spending 40 percent of their time doing data entry and not working and looking at the patient and doing things of that nature. So, you know, I--I firmly believe that you know, in the real world we use this to communicate with people, we'll do it in the physician office very quickly to the extent that digital apps and digital tools become empowered by this data liquidity future.  </p><p>FISH: I would say, you know, that sort of (INAUDIBLE) says we underestimate or we overestimate the practice of making the short term and underestimate the progress we're making the long term. So I think these collection of technologies and data is fundamentally going to transform how we provide care to people, both health care and sick care, but over what timeframe is the question.  </p><p>Right. Healthcare is notoriously slow to adopt tools And I think one of the huge challenges for our industry and anyone who's coming forward and proposing solutions is you have to figure out how to make--how to reduce friction in a system. You can't be adding friction. You can't add time to a clinician's, you know, day. You can't make it harder for someone to adopt these tools. They have to fade into the background, they have to be supportive and they have to augment what people are--what people are doing in the system and that's a lot harder than it sounds. People make that mistake a lot. </p><p>RATNAM: Well, we're unfortunately out of time and I was hoping we could have at least a couple minutes for audience to ask questions. But if anyone has a pressing question and a quick one, maybe we can take one. Oh, I guess, there aren't any. Well, we didn't talk about a lot and hopefully, we'll have more opportunities to talk--to talk about that. I mean, this basically, I mean, I've been writing about cyber security in the context of health care as well and all of the data in the hands of so many people also means that the bad guys are looking to exploit the data and so that creates a whole new area of vulnerability as well and so hopefully we'll have a chance to talk about that in future session. Thanks for coming. Thanks.  </p><p>RESNIK: Thank you Gopal, and thanks again to Andy Fish, Dr. Mukkamala, and Joel White for their fascinating discussion on Medtech. Rounding out today's event--rounding out today's event, I'd like to welcome our second congressional keynote, Congressman Larry Bucshon. Since coming to Congress, Dr. Bucshon has been a champion for advancing patient-centered health care reforms that will give patients and their doctors the freedom to make their own health care decisions.  </p><p>He also has been a leader in the fight to end the opioid epidemic, having been one of eight lawmakers from around the nation recognized by the coalition to stop opioid overdose in 2016 for his work on the issue. Before taking office, Congressman Bucshon was a practicing physician insurgence specializing in cardiothoracic surgery and served as chief of cardiothoracic surgery and medical director of the Open Heart Recovery Intensive Care Unit at St Mary's Hospital.  </p><p>Interviewing Congressman Bucshon is CQ Roll Call's health editor, Rebecca Adams. Rebecca, over to you.  </p><p>ADAMS: Thanks to everyone for joining us. so--  </p><p>BUCSHON: Good morning, everyone. (INAUDIBLE) There we go.  </p><p>ADAMS: There we go.  </p><p>BUCSHON: All right.  </p><p>ADAMS: All right. Thank you so much for coming in.  </p><p>BUCSHON: You're welcome. You're welcome.  </p><p>ADAMS: COVID-19 is the big issue of the day.  </p><p>BUCSHON: What's that. I'm just kidding. I know what it is. I'm kidding </p><p>ADAMS: Anyone worried about that?  </p><p>BUCSHON: Yeah. </p><p>ADAMS: Donna Shalala earlier this morning talked about some of the things that might be considered going forward. Obviously, you all last week dealt with the $8.3 billion law. What do you think the next steps are? She talked about unemployment, insurance and trying to cover costs for testing and that sort of thing.  </p><p>BUCSHON: I--I didn't hear what her comments were but all those type of things are on the table. One of the things we did do in what the 8.3 billion is there was--part of that was some relief for small businesses, about $20 million for the Small Business Administration to help small businesses get through this. But we'll see, there's ongoing discussions about whether there should be a fiscal type stimulus for industries like the airline industry or the other things related to travel, you know, where their stock prices have really dipped.  </p><p>But I think that's up in the air. I think the bar--the bottom line is, is I think the money that we gave last week is going to be well-spent. Part of that is to help develop vaccines. So for this problem and also medical therapy, the current antivirals that we have, we don't know if they're effective or not, they may or may not be.  </p><p>So in the vein of what Donna said about making sure that the vaccines are available low cost or no cost, right, I think help with putting some research money in from the federal government to help the development of that will--will really dramatically help that. And also, a couple of large insurance plans this week announced that they would be covering these without co-pays and for free.  </p><p>So I think it will be--I think we'll be fine there. I do think if, you know, we're a ways away from a vaccine, we're--some are getting ready to go into human testing. But if you listen to the people from the CDC and the private sector companies, you maybe a year away, maybe 18 months before you know for sure whether these will be effective. But I agree that we have to make them cost free or affordable. And I think a combination the government and the private sector will make that happen. I really do.  </p><p>ADAMS: What do you think the timetable would be? We do have a May deadline for other health care legislation. Do you think that Congress will be acting more quickly than that to try to take care of some of these issues?  </p><p>BUCSHON: Yeah, I mean, the honest answer, it's above my pay grade. I mean, I don't know. You know, there's the leadership folks have been talking about a variety of different things. You know, the hope is and again, I want to make clear these are my opinions and not the opinion of the administration or the CDC or the FDA. I want to make that clear to everyone that this will kind of slowly drift away like--like the flu season does, right. But the answer is we don't know. We don't know the epidemiology of this so we don't know for sure.  </p><p>So I think people are talk, you know, people--there's a--a little bit of a wait and see right now. People are talking about, you know, tax breaks for certain industries or temporary low-interest loans and other ways to backup industries that are struggling because of this. But what the final answer will be, I don't know.  </p><p>ADAMS: What would you say about the fact that we now have members of Congress who are self-quarantining? Do you think that there is the chance for an extended recess?  </p><p>BUCSHON: No, I don't. I mean, I think we've talked about that and I can just speak for the Republican Conference and I haven't talked to my Democrat friends. Yet Maybe Donna said some about that but I think there's a pretty much a consensus on the Hill is--is that would set a bad precedent for the Congress to just recess and all go home because I think it would be--personally, I think I'd be the top story in the entire world, you know, I mean, the London paper, you know, Congress goes home.  </p><p>You know, and it--and the reason I say that is because I think it would--it--it--it the--you know, the more the impression than the real--reality of what that would do to the markets, to people's confidence in the federal government and governments around the world to deal with this on a medical basis. So I don't think. I think, you know, I mean and I don't--you know, I--I don't know the individual situation from each member that has decided to self-quarantine but I do know that the advice from the attending physician office which is at the capital that advises us individually on health care-related issues recommended that the--they didn't need to do that. Based on their exposure that they had, that the exposure was really minimal.  </p><p>Some had shooken--shaken hands with somebody who had shaken hands with somebody, shaking hands with somebody at CPAC that had--that tested positive. But I don't know their individual situations but I--I think that I mean, there's a little bit of optics there. I mean, I don't want to say there's little bit politics there, but--but I think there is some advice that they didn't--that--that wasn't necessarily--necessary.  </p><p>Now, I mean, I understand where certain people who are going to have direct contact with the president or the vice president or other high-level people in the near future are concerned about that. So I understand that but I don't think--I don't think it's necessary.  </p><p>ADAMS: What do you think about the messaging that came out of the White House there? It's sometimes been some inconsistent messaging. I mean, I think it--and I've talked about this with a number of people. I think the--the inconsistency is because we just don't know the answers and people I mean, it's hard to, you know, as a health care provider, I think one of the things that's difficult for to understand sometimes is health care providers don't always know the answer to the question you're asking.  </p><p>I mean, in this particular case, it's a novel virus. We don't know the epidemiology of it. We don't know, for example, you know, we think it may be a little more contagious than the regular flu, but we don't know. We think there may be a slightly higher mortality rate, but we're basing that off Chinese data, just hospitalized patients. So we don't know. I mean, Dr. Fauci has said, has recently, that--they--they believe this can be less than 1 percent. The regular flu is .01 percent or something like that.  </p><p>But right now, for example, in China, if you're over 80 years old and you have it, the mortality rates is 15 percent roughly. So we--we don't know. That's why I think you see initially I think you saw some inconsistent messaging because the agencies--different agencies, there wasn't a, you know, a quick coordination on--on the message and that created a little confusion. But I think--I think that's turned around somewhat.  </p><p>But again, people don't know and sometimes people give their opinions when they--when they probably shouldn't. If they don't know the data, all of us, whether members of Congress, administration people, when you don't know because people really want us to give them answers But we just don't--don't know. Even the health care professionals don't know the answer. And that creates uncertainty and it creates fear.  </p><p>I mean, medicine is not an exact science, right. It's an art and I found I practice heart surgery for 15 years and people want you to be able to tell them, hey, this is what's gonna happen. And most of the time, you can but not all the time because there's all kinds of factors that come into play that you don't expect and that might change the dynamics of whatever subject. And this is--this is a great example of that, right.  </p><p>And so I think--I think once the White House, you know, got a more cohesive team approach with a--with a defined leader of that, I think it improved. But once you had individual agencies talking without a more cohesive message, it was--it was somewhat confusing.  </p><p>ADAMS: So I do want to give time to the audience to ask a question to you but I need to ask you about surprise billing. Why do you think it's going to happen with that? there's been some sticking points over arbitration and other things?  </p><p>BUCSHON: Yeah. I've been involved in that. I'm on the Energy and Commerce Committee and we passed legislation unanimously out of committee, we're on a voice vote. As really a benchmark, just to put you know, just put a marker out there knowing that we have a long way to go. Okay. And I think, first of all, you know, we have to define the problem. I think most people in a room know what surprise billing is, but it's basically just for discussion sake. It's I'll give you what--I mean--It's--if you go to a hospital, it's in-network, your doctors in network. But it turns out one of the providers that read your pathology slider looked at your x ray, turns out they were not in your insurance network, right.  </p><p>And so you didn't know that and so months later, you get a bill for the radiologist to read your X-ray and you're like, what's this? Because your insurance denied payment, right, because it was out of network. So that's a surprise bill. One in five Americans get a surprise Bill. We had testimony, one young lady who heard her husband had a child had to go to the neonatal intensive care unit. In an in-network hospital, turns out the NICU--the NICU was a contract--was a contractor, wasn't actually part of the hospital, the hospital had contracted out that service out of network. All of a sudden, they get a bill for 50 grand. You know, that's--that's a pretty substantial surprise bill  </p><p>So I think there's a couple of things. Some of the states are addressing it And I want to make it clear that whatever we do at the federal level, we've decided not to be preemptive. And the reason is, is because some states have addressed this and I firmly believe in states' ability to address these things at the state level, insurance coverage is historically been a state issue. So I want to make that clear. So California has addressed it, Texas, New York. I personally think the New York model is more close to what we're gravitating towards at the federal level with some nuance differences.  </p><p>It is controversial, It is difficult to get consensus. But I think--I think you'll see something similar but different or nothing. I doubt if you'll find anything in between. I mean, the initial approach was just a benchmark payment that you probably know, that came out of--that was the NC bill, that was the Senate health bill.  </p><p>Most of us believe that would be a reimbursement race to the bottom for providers and was an unbalanced approach just to set a federal benchmark as price-fixing and that alone was not palatable to anyone really on both sides. And I don't know what Secretary Shalala said, but I think she's kind of in that camp.  </p><p>ADAMS: Yes, it's much more in favor of the ways and means approach.  </p><p>BUCSHON: Yeah. And the ways and means, the main ways and means situation has a, you know, has a fair market value, but then has an arbitration part of it. I think you'll--you'll see, like I said, somewhere in the middle there but--but more towards an approach, more typical, like to New York, which has arbitration in there versus California, which doesn't. But we got a ways to go, and I think we are--the bottom line is all of us want to make sure it's balanced. We don't--I mean, I do--I'll just speak for myself.  </p><p>I don't want--I don't want, number one, that the citizens are taken out of this equation, that nobody gets a bill that's a surprise bill Now, if you go to a visit, if you go to a physician you know is out of network. That's not a surprise bill. This is not going to authorize you to go to a doctor that you know is out of network. You're going to--you're going to be stuck with that bill.  </p><p>Again, that's--that's important for people to understand. It doesn't sol--it's not gonna fix that. But we don't want people to have to get these bills. And I think we're all trying to solve that problem in a way that doesn't advantage the plans, doesn't advantage the providers and it is a balanced approach that everybody can live with and that's a hard place to get to.  </p><p>ADAMS: So medical providers are probably happy in the shift that's happening but I wonder if you think that you'll just run out of time, you won't have time to get this done this year. Yeah, I think more than that, not necessarily time. I don't think time's a factor. I think we could accomplish it. I think it depends on, you know, whether or not people have the political will to do it.  </p><p>And the reason is, is because it's--it's controversial, number one. And if anybody's lives in DC, they see the TV ads on both sides of this, right. And now you have conservative groups and liberal groups coming out with this view and that view. And so at some point, congress, you know, I hate to say it congress will go and they'll punt. And that would be the--I don't think time's the factor. I think whether or not we have the political will to do it, in my view.  </p><p>ADAMS: Okay, so let's take it to the audience. I see a hand back there.  </p><p>QUESTION: Good morning, Thanks for being here. I am Julie (INAUDIBLE) with Prime Therapeutics. In the Senate HELP Committee bill which addresses the other side of the Capitol but they did reach a compromise with ANC in early December. There was a lot more than just surprise billing in that package and many of us are following these other provisions. Can you put on your prognosticator and say what you think might travel with something on COVID-19 and surprise billing because many of these other provisions are controversial?  </p><p>BUCSHON: Yes, surprise billing, a lot of the legislation, you know, has been scored by the CBO to save money anywhere from 18 to $25 billion, roughly somewhere in that ballpark. And as anybody follows, this town knows if there's money out there, you know, people go on oh, there's money. What are we going to do with it, right? Health care extenders--the health care extenders package that was--is--and I don't have a list of those things in front me, but one of the big ones is like, you know, federally qualified health care centers, right which I have them in my district, we have them all over the country, I support them. They need a reauthorization in funding, right.  </p><p>Those type of things I think it's very likely to be in a surprise Medical billing legislation, healthcare-related things. COVID-19, I don't see as much cause that's more of an acute problem. I see more. Again, I don't have the list in front of me, but there's--there's a laundry list of healthcare-related things like community, you know, federally qualified health care centers that need to be reauthorized.  </p><p>I think it's likely that if a surprise billing medical bill legislation comes if those will be in there and the say--the CBO score savings will be used to--to fund those. I mean, that's my best guess.  </p><p>ADAMS: One can argue with COVID-19 that the health centers might need more funding.  </p><p>BUCSHON: And they might, yeah. yeah, right. So in the savings and the surprise medical bill may not be enough, right. So I just don't know.  </p><p>ADAMS: Do we have another question? Here we go.  </p><p>QUESTION: Hi, my name's Rachel. I'm finishing up my anesthesia residency in Miami right now. Something we're concerned about, especially with the Energy and Commerce bills, the median and network as insurance companies are becoming aware that legislation might come up with the median and network especially, they've been reducing our rates first up, 30 percent, 40 percent and then just forcing out a network because they're giving us contracts that are 60 percent lower than what we were being reimbursed. And they're hoping that by lowering these rates, the median network will be artificially lowered as well. And I'm wondering if it's something you guys are looking at.  </p><p>BUCSHON: So here's the factor and there's a couple of things. I mean, it's complicated, but that's why the NC bills set--they start at 2019--2019 rates and then increase that with an inflation area an inflator to try to prevent that from happening. But I think and I don't know the exact numbers, but, for example, California that just put a benchmark bill and that's exactly what's happening, right, there--you're going to see that people getting--dropping people from networks and offering lower contracts.  </p><p>So in my view, an independent dispute resolution process, whatever that looks like, if you don't have that in some form, you will absolutely get--get this for sure. The ways and means legislation is different but in--at the end of the day, when you look at the IDR process or the arbitration process, it says that the arbiter can consider meeting in-network rate as in statute in the law. And so the CBO has said it will gravitate most of the arbitration would pass--probably gravitate towards that rate.  </p><p>So it's really difficult--It's really a difficult situation to try to solve. That's why I say I'm not sure whether we'll have the political will to do it, because honestly, there's no right answer because, you know, the best guess we can have is, well, what happened--what's happened in New York in four years. About half the arbitration is gone for the provider, half for the plan and we haven't seen this mass exodus of people being kicked out of their--their networks, right? That's best guess based on that history.  </p><p>But other states that have addressed this, there's not a long enough time period to really see what's the long-term result. But I'm very concerned about that exact problem, right, and I've mentioned this to the insurance plans. You know, and you know, I think it's a--it's a something we're going to try to prevent and that's one of the things we--we know that's happening and we've got to do-- For example, the way it--Ways and Means Bill, again and I think there's a lot of good things in both. I'm not trying to be critical of ways and means just because I'm on NC, although that's what the NC members do sometimes. I'm not, because I think there's a lot of good things in both--both of those.  </p><p>They sound like a three--a five-year reset, for example. At the first time, it'd be a three year reset and that's exactly what will happen if you do that. In three years, everybody will be kicked out of their networks and there'll be a--there'll be lower or lower in-network rate so that the benchmark--so that the median and network drops. And so my concern about having--not having an inflator on there, that happens based on a certain plan year, which would be in ANC 19, but having a reset would--would cause more problems like that. But the hon--the honest answer is we don't know. So we're--we're still working on it.  </p><p>ADAMS: All right, well, that's all the time that we have today. Thank you so much.  </p><p>BUCSHON: Oh, you're welcome. Thank you.  </p><p>RESNIK: Thank you to Congressman Bucshon and Rebecca for that insightful discussion. I want to thank my colleagues, all our speakers, our sponsors, Better Medicare Alliance, DentaQuest and the Alzheimer's Association and most importantly, you, our audience for joining us this morning. As a reminder, if you missed any portion of the program, you can watch the video on rollcall.com. Enjoy the rest of your day.

Both CQ Roll Call and FiscalNote are actively monitoring the coronavirus outbreak and the effect it's having on our politics and policy environment.  </p><p>You can check out our up-to-date and comprehensive information on the virus and how the U.S. is responding at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:coronavirus@fiscalnote.com\">coronavirus@fiscalnote.com</email> One thing I should mention is we've made a lot of our coverage available here, free of charge, to help you navigate through this crisis. </p><p>You can also sign up for our daily newsletter and learn more about how FiscalNote can help your organization monitor the policies and politics around COVID-19. </p><p>I've got just a few housekeeping items, before we start. You'll see a Q&amp;A box and a chat box on your screen. You can use those to submit questions, during the webinar. Feel free to submit your questions, at any time, and we'll try to get to everyone. </p><p>Also, after this webinar is done, we'll send out a recording. </p><p>Everyone should be muted on entry but, if you're not, except for us, panelists, please go ahead and make sure your microphone is on mute. </p><p>Today, I'm joined by four health policy experts, who will help guide the conversation and will be able to answer your questions. </p><p>Eliot Fishman is Senior Director of Policy for Families USA. Eliot leads Families USA's policy analysis and advocacy agenda development at the state and federal levels, working with the policy department and other members of senior leadership. </p><p>Jim Kaufman is Vice President of Public Policy for the Children's Hospital Association, representing 220 hospital organizations and pediatric programs, dedicated to improving child health through innovation in care, education and research. </p><p>Tom DiLenge is President of Biotechnology Innovation Organization's Advocacy, Law and Public Policy Division. Before that, Tom served as BIO's General Counsel and Head of Public Policy. </p><p>Shawn Martin is Senior Vice President for Advocacy, Practice Advancement and Policy at the American Academy of Family Physicians. In this role, he directs legislative and private sector advocacy on issues, such as physician payment and medical liability reform. </p><p>Thanks so much for joining us. I'd like to kick us off by telling you about the legislation that Congress has already enacted to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as upcoming legislative and regulatory development. </p><p>So, let's talk first, about the $100 billion that was in the CARES Act for medical providers. Jim, I know that Children's Hospital has had some concerns about the first $30 billion in funding that was distributed, based on Medicare reimbursement. </p><p>HHS Secretary, Alex Azar, then announced his additional information about the second round of funding in that $100 billion. So, what's your take on the way funding has been allocated, so far, and have your hospitals seen any problems in receiving their allotment?  And what are you hearing about how the funding allocations that haven't been announced, yet, will be distributed? </p><p>KAUFMAN: Rebecca, that's some great questions. First of all, we're very grateful that HHS, supported by congressional advocates, broadened the relief efforts in the second round of funding to recognize more of the financial impact of the COVID-19 surge response on all providers. </p><p>As you noted, that first round of funding went strictly to Medicare providers, based on their fee-for-service revenues. And we understand that because it was needed to be done quickly and get the funds out, as fast as possible. </p><p>However, you know, children's hospitals, pediatricians, family docs, generally, don't treat Medicare patients. So, we were pretty much excluded from any financial relief, even though that we were seeing significant financial losses, due to deferred procedures, increased cost for PPE and, you know, other efforts to deal with the surge capacity. </p><p>The one thing people don't realize is a lot of children's hospitals, you know, we are some of the largest Medicaid providers in the country, with more than 50 percent of our patient environment is being on Medicaid. So, that second round of funding focusing when total patient revenue was greatly, you know, greatly helpful in getting some dollars to the children's hospitals and other providers. </p><p>However, it didn't get to everybody, I should note. I mean, pediatricians are a great example. They are not serving anybody, and I've heard they're not receiving any support, from the second round of funding. So, we really look forward to HHS working with others to make sure additional funds go to pediatricians, as well. </p><p>And I should also note, for children's hospitals and others, the money that we received will be helpful in avoiding or delaying layoffs, or elimination of services. It doesn't close the gap. </p><p>We're still looking at more than a billion-dollar losses, a month, and we're only about 2 percent of the hospital industry. And our losses are, actually, increasing. When the crisis first hit, we saw revenue losses of 20 percent to 30 percent. We're now looking at revenue losses of 50 percent to 60 percent. So, while we're grateful for the funding that has been received, we still need more. </p><p>And I have heard one or two hospitals that are having some technical problems getting funds. We're trying to figure out what's going on in that space. So, while we're grateful, we're not done yet, on these efforts. </p><p>The other funding that we heard on going out, through the remaining of the $100 billion, is going to be going to hotspots, you know, helping deal with the uninsured and some other efforts, like D&amp;E and health service. But that still leaves a lot of dollars that are being allocated. We look forward to working with HHS to continue to ensure that hospitals, pediatricians and other providers contain and receive support, especially, as states are now starting to talk about budgetary cuts, which means Medicaid cuts, which is going to directly impact children's hospitals, pediatricians and others. </p><p>So, Rebecca, hopefully, that helps clarify a little bit of how the dollars have gone out, so far. </p><p>ADAMS: That's very interesting. Thank you very much. Eliot, do you want to jump in here and share your thoughts about the distribution of money? </p><p>FISHMAN: I certainly agree that the second round of funding was distributed somewhat more broadly. But those gaps are pretty severe. And I would highlight, in particular, the lack of allocation for Medicaid providers. </p><p>National Association of Medicaid Directors sent a letter, a couple of days ago, to Secretary Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services, that's obviously, a bipartisan organization, represents all the Medicaid directors. That letter was signed by Medicaid directors and two Republican gubernatorial administrations in Florida and Arizona. </p><p>And what that letter points out is that, leaving out Medicaid, in addition to services like children's hospitals and pediatricians that see a lot of Medicaid, there are swaths of our healthcare system in which you have providers who take almost only Medicaid to before, serve people, without insurance at all. </p><p>For example, the behavioral health sector is really segmented by payer, so that there are lots of important mental health and substance use providers who are almost, exclusively, dependent on Medicaid funding. Same for long-term home and community-based services that you have providers who, basically, are exclusively, Medicaid providers. And if you don't start to allocate funds, based on Medicaid, they are dealing with all of the revenue losses, associated with social distancing and lockdowns, without any support and are really in grave danger. </p><p>So, that is, potentially, something that can be resolved with future allocations. That is what the Medicaid directors asked for. </p><p>Something else that some states have proposed is to use emergency Medicaid waiver authority to direct some payments to those Medicaid providers. And that is another possibility. And maybe something because it involves state flexibility, that the Trump administration is more amenable to. So, that's something we're keeping our eye on, as well. </p><p>ADAMS: All right, that's very helpful. Shawn, let me bring you in. What's your perspective? </p><p>MARTIN: Hold on, I'm kind of--I think I'm muted.  </p><p>ADAMS: We can hear you, Shawn. </p><p>MARTIN: I agree with the comments that have been made. I think the initial outlay of cash from HHS was more focused on seed than, probably, on comprehensiveness. I think there was a desire to just get cash into the hands of physicians and hospitals, across the country. </p><p>I would echo the concerns about Medicaid, particularly, in certain regions and states. Medicaid is a far more dominant payer in the, you know, coverage, a payer in the healthcare system, than Medicare. I also think it is a place where maybe the most vulnerable in the population have their healthcare coverage through Medicaid and those positions that provide services to that patient population placed in severe downward economic pressure and, potentially, closing. </p><p>I think--I think the thing we need to be mindful of that we're, you know, constantly working is being appreciative of the efforts today, while also being really forceful, if you will, about the need for how much more needs to be done. </p><p>We know that about 80 percent of our family physician practices report that they are within two full weeks of sustainability issues. And this is just going to continue for months in the, kind of, aimed more toward practice setting. </p><p>So, really appreciate what Congress and the administration have done today, to just continue to point out that much more needs to be done. </p><p>ADAMS: So, Shawn, let me say on that point of what more needs to be done. And that's still that Congress may consider to be able to assist COVID-19 response package may be more difficult to negotiate. </p><p>So, what are you pushing for Congress to include in this bill and what do you think will come out of these discussions? Look into your crystal ball a little bit. </p><p>MARTIN: Yeah, I think Congress is looking in the next package at some economic stability type provision. So, you know, kind of what post paycheck protection program to kind of create some economic stability of like small businesses. And I think healthcare will be part of that, physician practices. </p><p>So, we're really talking to a little about two things. One is continuing to provide financial assistance in the form of cash flow to physician practices and hospitals and long-term care. The healthcare system, you know, just broadly just needs massive amounts of cash flow to sustain it. </p><p>And then, the second piece is really looking at a kind of create a payment model--sorry--how can we create a payment model to put us on a better trajectory to a better playing field in the future, so that we can have future capable discussions healthcare we don't have as a survey that results decreasing revenue that happened in our previous system. </p><p>So, those are the two approaches they're taking off on. </p><p>ADAMS: Okay. I'd like to bring in Tom. Can you talk about your current needs for the next round of legislation? </p><p>DILENGE: Sure, thank you, Rebecca, and thank you to FiscalNote and CQ Healthcare for doing this forum, today. I hope all of you and all your listeners are doing well and staying safe. </p><p>BIO represents, mostly, startup R&amp;D intensive companies that rely heavily on the private market. </p><p>So, picking up on Shawn's comments around kind of like market liquidity, economic stability, we represent really hundreds and hundreds of these small startup companies. A lot of them are actually working on COVID related treatments and vaccines, which I'm sure we'll talk about later. </p><p>And a lot of these companies are having trouble raising money in this market environment, as you can imagine. These companies live, you know, day to day, burning huge amounts of capital. They do not have product revenues, yet. These are pre-revenue companies. </p><p>And so, they really rely on liquid markets that where money is flowing to keep and sustain all of these R&amp;D programs that are so critical to COVID and non-COVID serious diseases. </p><p>So, we're going to be pushing for tax and regulatory reforms that can free up capital for these companies. This is a critical issue. The PPP belongs helped in the first round. But those were really geared more toward the kind of small mom and pop kind of retail establishments. Our companies are going to be facing longer term economic stability issues, as we go, unfortunately, I think into a recession and the capital markets freeze up a bit. </p><p>So, we need to be helping these companies spend less of their money on regulations that aren't necessary and we also have to let them keep more of their--more of the money that they have, rather than taxing it in certain ways that the tax code does, right now, which are really unfortunate for our smaller companies. </p><p>So, we're going to be looking at those kinds of reforms, as we move into the next package. </p><p>ADAMS: All right. And let me add in Eliot and then, we'll go to Jim because I'd like to hear everybody's priorities for the next bill. So, Eliot, why don't you jump in. </p><p>FISHMAN: Sure. So, our first priority has to be getting health insurance to the, as many of the tens of millions of people who are losing employer coverage on a day-to-day basis, as we can, right. </p><p>We just saw, earlier this morning, another several million people file for new unemployment insurance claims. And a significant number of those people are losing employer coverage. </p><p>We, building on the Democrats, who's all for the third COVID package, or the CARES Act proposal that the Democrats put forward in the House, are looking at using both subsidies for COBRA coverage that is to maintain employer coverage, during a period of unemployment, enhanced subsidies for nongroup coverage on the marketplace and more flexibility for states to extend Medicaid for COVID treatment for the uninsured. </p><p>Right now, you can add a state option with 100 percent federal funding coverage, as COVID screening and testing. That ought to be extended to cover COVID treatment, as well. </p><p>This is really like an all of the above approach, right. So, continuing employer coverage, market place coverage, Medicaid coverage. And that's not an accident if, historically, it has been very hard to leave people who are losing a job to available health insurance coverage, even when there have been federal efforts to subsidize that coverage in a financial crisis. </p><p>It's just--it's a time when people are dealing with a lot. We've seen that just filing for unemployment insurance, given just the huge tsunami of unemployment insurance applications is a lot for people to work through. We need to make it as easy as possible and we need to fund enrollment assistance, which is something that was funded, under the Affordable Care Act. Trump administration has cut that way back. It's desperately needed now, if we are going to keep people insured. </p><p>And we need to think about insurance as a part of pandemic response. We just heard as Families USA, my organization, we were on the phone with a congressional office from New Jersey on Tuesday. And heard from them that people are in the community in New Jersey, who are un insured, are not going to get tested, even as testing finally is becoming available, and New Jersey's a very hard-hit state. It desperately needs people to get tested because they have heard that you need to bring your insurance card and they are uninsured and they are worried about what the financial implications will be if now, they have no unemployment income, they're limited to, you know, a modest, if supplemented unemployment insurance and they can't deal with a bill for healthcare. </p><p>Obviously, we have decades of experience that people don't get healthcare, if they don't have health insurance. And this is a time when we need people not having financial barriers to getting tested or, potentially, getting treated, if they are symptomatic. </p><p>Second thing that we see as a major priority is aid to states, preferably, via enhancement to the federal matching person mentioned for Medicaid that targets it to the parts of the state that most need support. </p><p>And I just note, that's also a pandemic response. So, it's not just an economic issue. But for example, the state of Minnesota reported, over the weekend, as they're getting asked about staffing up, to do testing and quarantining and contact tracing. Their Department of Public Health said, well, we have a hiring freeze now because of the economic crisis. So, we're just going to repurpose a few dozen people, within our public health department to do that, which is grossly inadequate. </p><p>States are not going to be in a position to do what we need to do in pandemic response, if they have giant budget holes and hiring freezes. </p><p>And third related priority is more funds for COVID testing and for contact tracing. There was a significant hunk of money that was just included in the fourth COVID package. However, that's not going to be enough. There's increasing evidence out there and bipartisan analysis out there that shows that we need significantly more money, particularly, given how many people likely have COVID, nationally, and how much testing and tracking is going to be involved to get that under control. </p><p>ADAMS: So, Jim, I'm sure you have some thoughts on that. And can you also talk about what you think is likely to happen in this legislation, what's likely to cross the finish line? </p><p>KAUFMAN: Thanks, Rebecca. And I would echo a lot of the comments that folks have said already are very, very important and we would support, as well. </p><p>For the children's hospitals, what we're going to be focusing on this next package is one, continuing to get more funding to the frontline providers like hospitals and pediatricians with more funding into the provider fund that was referenced earlier. </p><p>And as Eliot and Shawn noted, we've got to make sure that those funds also go to high Medicaid providers, which is absolutely critical. </p><p>I think one of the things that a lot of people don't realize is the testing that was referenced is going to be, absolutely, critical, as providers start to reopen and get services going again, which will definitely help alleviate some of the challenges. But that's going to vary, very much, from state to state and even local communities. So, that's why continued funding through that provider find will be absolutely critical to keep children's hospitals from avoiding layoffs, or reducing staffing issues and elimination of key services in the short run. </p><p>In addition to that, while that's a short-term relief, we also need to look at the long term. And this is one going back to Medicaid. We're also going to be supporting additional funding to the states for the Medicaid program. As I noted, the average children's hospital is 50 percent Medicaid. So, any cut at the state level, basically, will reduce any efforts to sustain those programs, long term. And we already recognize that Medicaid, on average, reimburses providers about 30 percent less than what Medicare provides. </p><p>And a lot of the Medicaid providers children's hospitals, pediatricians, OB/GYNs, didn't see any of the benefit that Congress provided in some of the previous bills for Medicare patients, like the 20 percent plus up, for treating COVID patients, the elimination of the Medicare sequester, efforts like that. </p><p>So, that's why those additional funds going to the states will be absolutely critical. </p><p>With that said, we also need to support policies at the federal level that will prevent putting money into the states and, at the same time, allowing the Fed to take money away from the states, such as blocking the implementation of the Medicaid fiscal accountability rule. </p><p>One report, before the COVID crisis started, noted that that rule, if implemented as drafted, can reduce federal funding to the states to the tune of $50 billion, annually. So, we can't be putting money in one pocket and taking it out of the other. So, we really need to look, comprehensively, at the funding going to the states and how we can support those efforts. </p><p>Now, what gets across the finish line at the end? I wish my crystal ball told me because it would make my job a lot easier. But I do think support for the frontline providers like hospitals, pediatricians and other, you know, healthcare professionals, will be included. And I'm optimistic that Congress will look to provide more funding to the states through an enhanced effort, some type of Medicaid support. </p><p>But that's one that's going to continue a lot of advocacy efforts to make sure policymakers on both sides of the aisle see how important Medicaid is. </p><p>ADAMS: I wish we had more time to talk even more about this topic. But let me turn to a new issue. </p><p>Tom, scientists around the globe are racing to find a vaccine to develop anti-viral treatment. And we've written a lot of these stories, over the past few weeks, about this, including yesterday's NIH announcement. </p><p>What can you tell us about your realistic expectations for the timing of the deployment of a vaccine? And what should we be watching for next, in terms of which ones are therapeutic? </p><p>DILENGE: Thanks. I'm happy to answer. Let me first, just back up a little bit and just kind of give you a sense of this unprecedented industry response we're seeing to this crisis. </p><p>There's about 350 R&amp;D drug development programs under way that have been launched in the last 15 weeks, around the COVID. </p><p>You heard about a lot of the big ones that have been getting a lot of attention in the media. But the breadth, depth and creativity of this industry is really shining through, at this pivotal moment. </p><p>The speed is remarkable. We're doing things that, normally, take months and weeks. We're doing things that, normally, would take years and months. Companies are putting aside their own competitive and commercial interests. They are collaborating in a way that I've never seen before in the 15 years that I've been in this industry. </p><p>They're jumping right into deals and partnerships, before the lawyers can even write it all down. They're not worrying about things like intellectual property and other things, at this point. </p><p>The companies are making huge investments in capacity and production, often with the government's help, to build infrastructure to produce drugs that we don't even have yet and that we're only hoping will, someday, prove safety and efficacy. That's a huge risk that companies and the government are taking but we can't approach this, sequentially, like we would normally do in drug development, during a crisis. </p><p>So, this has really been, I think, a very hopeful kind of approach that people are taking. Some of it already, it's a bit chaotic, a bit unorganized. Then, maybe we just need to pick one or two that look most promising vaccines and have the government do a Manhattan project. We're hearing a little bit about that in the news, today and yesterday. </p><p>Unfortunately, that's not the way drug development works. We know most of these projects will fail; 90 percent of projects tend to fail. We also know that viruses can change. They adapt, they mutate. Not all drugs, or vaccines, are going to work in all populations, or in different stages of the disease. </p><p>So, we need many shots on goal, using many different approaches and technologies. And that's what we're seeing, right now, which is great. Frustrating but takes time. There is no substitute, really, for regular science and data analysis. Vaccines in particular, take time to develop the right safety data. And we know that not all vaccines work for everybody. </p><p>So, when you're thinking about a vaccine where you are thinking about a little longer term, you've heard some of the reports that there are, well, there's about 11 vaccines that are already in human trials, which is good. Again, unprecedented speed. But what we're really looking at is, probably, this fall, that we can have some emergency use vaccines for frontline workers, those who are at greatest risk of exposure, or who have been exposed, and we can use it, afterwards, as a prophylactic post-exposure. </p><p>To get to mass production, to do populations in the United States and around the world, we are probably looking at, at least, a year. It's hard to imagine we can do it much quicker. But you know, everyone is working really hard to do that. </p><p>The good news, Rebecca, is that, in the meantime, we have a whole bunch of therapeutic treatments that are coming, hopefully, on line, in the next couple of months. We've all heard about Gilead's antiviral that had great data from yesterday. We expect that to, probably, get an FDA emergency use of authorization, pretty soon, could even be this week. </p><p>We have other ones that are also, a lot of antivirals that are in clinical trials that are in, you know, late stage trials. So, we're really optimistic that, over the summer, we're going to start to see kind of a broadening of our tool box to help treat patients that are infected. And that's really important to buy this time to get to a mass population vaccine. And it allows our healthcare workers to be protected. It allows the economy our start to reopen and allows patients to, hopefully, not progress to a really serious disease with COVID. </p><p>So, we're really optimistic that all of the approaches that are being taken that some of them are going to work. We're going to have more tools in this toolbox for our healthcare providers and were going to, hopefully, be in much better position to reopen this economy and know that we can treat people who might get infected and become sick. </p><p>ADAMS: And that's an (INAUDIBLE) questions on that and, if you have a question, please go ahead and submit it. So, let me stay with you for a moment and just circle back to the CARES Act funding. There was some funding in there that you have been watching closely. Can you tell us a little bit about how the implementation of that funding has been proceeding? </p><p>DILENGE: Yeah, so, HHS has had a program called BARDA, which is mostly focused on bio defense work, for years. It's never been funded enough. The good news is, is that Congress gave them a lot more money in several of the COVID bills that passed, over the last two months. </p><p>We have, probably, somewhere between $8 billion and $10 billion now, that's available for the government to partner with biotechnology companies to push forward allowing this promising research I was talking about. </p><p>The problem is, you know, with everything else, is that it's never seems to be fast enough, right. There's--the HHS has done some big deals. You've read about them in the paper. A couple hundred million dollars for this project, a couple hundred million dollars for that project. These are mostly projects that are building off of past work that we've done for other outbreaks and infectious diseases. </p><p>There's so many new approaches out there for COVID. And we have about 2,500 submissions for funding right now, from companies into HHS. Very few have been funded, to date. </p><p>And I think, what we'd like to see, is HHS give out more money as seed money to a broader group of companies and approaches because, as I was saying earlier, we need many shots on goal. We'd like to see a broad-based approach to getting money out the door, quicker, in smaller amounts. We don't need hundreds of millions of dollars. We need smaller amounts that can catalyze some of the private capital that's holding back, waiting to see where the government experts may place some of their bets. </p><p>There's just are so many different programs out there, potential R&amp;D programs. We do need to work with the government to figure out how we can get money to catalyze different approaches. </p><p>Think about it almost like a Chinese restaurant menu. You want a couple from column A, a couple from column B. You want some treatments; you want some antivirals, you want some vaccines. And even within vaccines, for example, there's five or six different types of approaches and about 80 different programs going on. </p><p>So, you need to kind of, strategically, look at the funding proposals, across the board, better than one offs. Look at them, strategically, and say, are we, do we have a holistic strategy about making sure that we're going to have enough shots on goal in the different areas that matter, so that, hopefully, come the fall, or early next year, we have a very good toolbox of treatments and vaccines available for people. </p><p>That's what we'd like to see, in terms of improvement in the funding for R&amp;D partnerships. </p><p>ADAMS: All right. Just a reminder, we will be turning to audience questions in just a few moments. And there will be a recording of this webinar that people can look at, later. </p><p>Tom, one more question. What are some of the longer-term issues that might result from the laws that have been enacted, so far, this year? </p><p>DILENGE: Yeah, well, you know, we're really hopeful that this pandemic, I mean, you know, it's so sad, in terms of the toll economic and on patients and the deaths in families, a terrible pandemic. </p><p>I hope that one silver lining from this is that Congress and the administration, and we've had trouble over bipartisan administrations and bipartisan congresses, getting enough focus on long-term pandemic preparedness. </p><p>BIO has been a leader in this, for years. And I'm the first to say, we have not done a good enough job and we have not convinced enough people in Congress that they need to focus on pandemic preparedness, as a long-term sustainable infrastructure that we need, year end and year out, rather than just in crises. </p><p>For example, Rebecca, we have done so much, in the last couple of months, to build systems to just share basic information between the government and companies, in terms of these types of viruses and, particularly, COVID. </p><p>We have the virus, itself, data sharing around the sequencing of it and all these different types of approaches to treating it. </p><p>We're doing that on the fly now, in a very ad hoc way. We could have been, we could be a month or two ahead, in terms of the diagnostics in some of these early treatments, than we are today. </p><p>If we had had these systems built for better surveillance, better information sharing and better partnering, between industry and government, right when something starts to hit, as opposed to trying to build it on the fly, during a crisis. </p><p>ADAMS: We do see the hearings around these discussions when they already test the crisis and then it seems like the momentum fades. </p><p>I want to turn to the rest of the panelists and bring everyone in. I wanted to just talk a little bit about some of the steps that federal officials have taken, change regulations and policies during this pandemic. </p><p>Which of those do think will actually continue, after all of this is a few years in the background? Are there additional regulatory actions, also, that you're looking for and that are your priorities for the Trump administration? </p><p>So, Jim, could you address that question? </p><p>KAUFMAN: Sure, like I said, the first thing we'll be looking at is as we're trying to provide some more Medicaid funding to the states, trying to prevent some of the things that was on the table before the COVID crisis hit. </p><p>Medicaid fiscal accountability is a great example. Some opportunities now, is with the telehealth, is there may be some opportunities to keep those in place, long-term. We've seen a patchwork of efforts at the state level with Medicaid reimbursement for that. So, hopefully, we will see, as a result of this, some opportunities to keep things in place longer and make it easier for kids and other Medicaid recipients to receive care, through telehealth. </p><p>ADAMS: All right. Shawn, what are your thoughts? </p><p>MARTIN: Yeah, I think it's a really interesting question. And maybe we'll head turn at the fear. I'm not real sure how to answer. </p><p>So, I think the--I think on telehealth, I would echo that. I think we jumped forward about a decade, on telehealth and virtual health platforms. And I think many of the regulations, although, I think they will be dialed back, slightly, or right sized, if you will, to kind of correct some over reaches, I do think telehealth and virtual health is here to stay in a more robust manner. </p><p>I think the challenge will be how do you incorporate that into the, you know, work flows of the entire healthcare system and not just of an episodic nature of acute telehealth lenses on. And--but I think the regulations will be designed to support that. </p><p>I think the other place where we're going to see kind of a continuing effort on a policy front is the relationship between healthcare systems, particularly, in rural America, the dependence on the public health preference of Medicaid and Medicare, the kind of lack of robust private insurance markets in those communities and the impact that has on hospitals, long-term care, physicians, of course, but I think an increased spotlight was put on rural delivery healthcare systems. </p><p>And then, in a more kind of controversial way, I think we've reignited the discussion about the relationship between individuals and their lawyers and health coverage. And I think that's a discussion that's going to continue to kind of build, as we move to the fall into the future as individuals that rely upon their employers for healthcare coverage, when there is an economic downturn or a personal event, what that means sort of  in an economic sense, a healthcare sense that individual and family. </p><p>And I think this debate is coming back. </p><p>ADAMS: All right. Eliot just a few thoughts from you on this. </p><p>FISHMAN: Well, I certainly agree that the debate around health coverage is going to have a major new reexamination. Of course, this pandemic is happening, during an election year. </p><p>And the first way in which the discussions are going to play out, will be in presidential debates of, literally, an end, figuratively. </p><p>And I think that, not only the timing of (INAUDIBLE) employment, the automaticness of insurance in the United States is really the only country in the advanced world, even in terms of countries that have mixed systems between public and private insurance, like we do, in which you can have tens of millions of people falling through the cracks and having to make the application processes to get help coverage. </p><p>Another major policy area that is not new but, certainly, has had a harsh light thrown on it by the pandemic. And I anticipate will be a major new policy discussion, or renewed policy discussion, is inequities in health and inequities in access to healthcare. </p><p>And if you look at the racial and ethnic distribution of COVID hospitalizations and COVID that's in the major hotspots around the country, there are very stark disparities really, breathtaking disparities, by race and ethnicity. </p><p>And that is not a simple problem. But it is an urgent one. And like a number of the problems that we've been talking about here, it should always have been urgent. And the pandemic is, hopefully, a silver lining, is that it is throwing such a prominent light on that problem. </p><p>ADAMS: All right, we have a few questions from some listeners. So, the first question is, do we know anything more on the potential buy American, or international pricing index executive orders? Who would like to address that question? </p><p>DILENGE: I can. This is Tom. So, first of all, on the buy American, we do anticipate the administration will be issuing some type of executive order to look at the U.S. medical supply chain, right, and to kind of make sure that we have, domestically, the ability to serve our people, right. And making sure that we're not overly reliant on unstable sources of supply, whether it's for drug substances, or manufacturing capabilities, etc. </p><p>This is an issue that has been percolating for a while. I think it's going to get a lot more attention, certainly, on Capitol Hill and with the administration. And I would just urge that we all think about this very deliberately because these supply chains are very complicated for medical products, not just drugs, but also, it's medical products. </p><p>And we have to really resist the temptation to think that we can build everything here in America and keep it all, here in America. You know, there is--we see some countries, around the world, that have tried to limit exports of critical supplies. Unfortunately, our own administration has kind of dabbled in that, as well. </p><p>And that's a really dangerous situation, when you're dealing with a global pandemic. So, we need to make sure that the supply chains are robust and resilient. But we also have to make sure, at the same time, that we're not kind of creating a too nationalistic approach to supply chains in this global economy. It just won't work. </p><p>It doesn't mean that we shouldn't be secure in knowing that we've got some excess capacity redundant supplies, within the boundaries of a country. We have a national stockpile. It's woefully, inadequate for our needs. I think we realize that, now. </p><p>States and hospitals and the federal government all need to do a better job of making sure we have that capacity available and ready in the supplies. But we do expect to see a lot of movement on this with the administration and with Congress, </p><p>On the international pricing index, I think that's a reference to the Trump administration's proposal, from a year or so ago, to try to tie drug prices to foreign drug prices. We haven't heard much about that, recently. I think the focus, obviously, now is on making sure we have robust research and development of new treatments and vaccines for COVID. And our companies, as I think you've probably seen in the press, repeatedly, we have committed to making sure that these products are affordable and accessible to everyone that needs them. </p><p>I don't think drug crisis is the time is the time be talking about drug pricing. It's never been an issue in pandemics, before. And our companies are leading the way in developing these cures and will make sure that they're affordable and accessible to everybody. </p><p>ADAMS: So, we have a question following up on the CARES Act money. Perhaps, Jim, you might be able to handle this one. Will there be situations where some providers receive too much money in the first allocation, based on Medicare revenue, compared to the allocation based on total revenues and will providers be required to pay back the difference? Jim, have you heard anything about that? </p><p>KAUFMAN: A great question. I'll be honest, I have not heard any provider talk about getting more money than what they've lost. </p><p>I mean, what we've been seeing, so far, is the amount of funding that we've seen from some of our hospitals, it's covering, you know, less than a third of losses that have incurred, already. And we're not talking about the losses that are continuing. </p><p>So, I think the dollars that are going in are critical to help keep hospitals, providers operating and avoid some cuts. However, it's not going to plug the holes from you know, being created the national response. </p><p>ADAMS: We have a question about testing. Is enough testing worth it, given many false positives? Shawn, would you be able to take that one? </p><p>MARTIN: Yeah, I'd be happy to. I'm not an epidemiologist so, you know, it's necessary to say that up front. </p><p>I do think mass testing is a critical component of our national strategy, to kind of reopen the economy and create the free flow of people. And I think there's, you know, more data coming out about the individuals that do not have visible symptoms, or either have symptoms that are identifiable that probably are able to participate in viral spread. </p><p>But I think the testing is going to be really important to identify and isolate people, so that they, you know, can protect the general population. I just worry, until there is a vaccine, it's encouraging the progress we're making towards a vaccine and antivirals, absent some type of herd community or a vaccine, testing is going to be their only way to isolate individuals from, you know, their families and general population, moving forward. So, I would answer yes, I think it's very much worth it. </p><p>ADAMS: Okay. There's a question on billing legislation. Is there a chance that surprise billing provision could be included in the next phase of coronavirus legislation? Has anyone heard anything about that? </p><p>MARTIN: So, this is Shawn. I would jump in here, as well. I think surprise billing has been front line for a number of congressional committees and members of Congress for well over a year, now. I think it continues to be a priority issue, generally speaking, in the healthcare policy realm on Capitol Hill in the administration. </p><p>I don't know that it bubbles up. I think there's just a lot of competition for dollars and attention, right now. I think, if you did a poll, everybody would say that they should do something about surprise billing. But I think it's always going to kind of be in that after, you know, a couple of bullet points down from the other urgent healthcare issues that are being discussed, right now. </p><p>ADAMS: We will have other vehicles later in the year, including appropriations and also from the extenders I think expire in November, if I remember correctly. </p><p>I wonder if it might be something that could be attached to another bill later on. </p><p>FISHMAN: This is Eliot from Families USA. I think, if were thinking about just huge vulnerabilities in our healthcare system that are getting a harsh light thrown on them, that is certainly one of them. And it is true that there ought to be a healthcare extenders must pass kind of legislative vehicle that would require and offset that surprise billing reform can provide, in the fall. </p><p>But this is, also, a barrier to people accessing healthcare, both for COVID and other kinds of healthcare between now and the fall at a bad time for there to be barriers. </p><p>And certainly, it is helpful that the Trump administration has said for and that providers who are receiving CARES Act funds and related funds cannot engage in surprise billing practices. That's not really a comprehensive solution and it's notable that there's no real way for consumers for patients to know which providers those are. </p><p>So, if we can't get this done in the next package, that's bad news at a bad time. And certainly, at a minimum, we're hopeful that we can get to it later this year. </p><p>ADAMS: Okay, alright. Let me stay with you for this next question and others may want to jump on this, as well. It's about Medicaid expansion. Will Congress include incentives for states that have not expanded Medicaid to move forward with expansion and any chance that Florida, or Texas, might move forward to expand Medicaid? </p><p>FISHMAN: There's certainly a chance in that the, unfortunately, the population of people who are uninsured and in states that have expanded Medicaid can get Medicaid and in Florida and Texas and the other remaining expansion states can't and aren't really eligible for anything realistic, in terms of insurance coverage. That population is growing, rapidly, in the middle of a pandemic. </p><p>And the other thing that really should be noted, is that states can undo an expansion. No state has ever done that. But if Florida, or Texas, were to pursue an expansion on an emergency basis, if, at some point later on, they felt that it was a mistake, again, I think it's unlikely that any state would ever conclude that but they do have that option. And perhaps, that can provide some cover for an emergency expansion measure and the remaining on it. </p><p>ADAMS: Okay. We have a couple of questions about artificial intelligence. And Tom, I'm going to direct this one to you. </p><p>Can new technologies, such as AI machine learning, help speed up some of the R&amp;D, in terms of finding vaccines and treatments? </p><p>DILENGE: The short answer is, yes, it already is. So, I believe that there are a lot of the big tech companies and other, even smaller ones with AI capabilities, are already working with our companies in the biopharmaceutical space to help that, to help speed those processes along.  </p><p>Absolutely, I think very important, when it comes to things like testing, in particular, but I think even for other drug development work, absolutely, the short answer is, yes, and it's already happening. And I think that that will be another outcome, long term outcome of this pandemic, is a speeding up of those kinds of partnerships, going forward, across the board, on other types of diseases, as well. </p><p>ADAMS: Interesting. Another AI question. Can technology, such as robotics, be used to do COVID testing, without exposing medical personnel? Who wants to take this one? </p><p>MARTIN: So, this is Shawn. I will try. </p><p>I think it's possible. I mean, I would never rule out anything in kind of this area and the ability of technology to be deployed to improve patient care. </p><p>I do, I have a hard time visualizing that a cotton swab with somebody's nose being delivered by a robot but I think, if you got to more finger prick, you know, saliva type testing, you might be use AI and robotics in a kind of porta care patient directed testing environment. I can certainly visualize that. I can see that working. </p><p>ADAMS: I actually wanted to circle back a little bit on telemedicine and telehealth. We talked about this a bit but I wonder if we can talk a little bit more about what you might see, going forward, and what kind of conversations are happening, right now, with the administration on that. Could someone build on that a little bit more? </p><p>MARTIN: This is Shawn. I'd be happy to go first. I think we, I think there's a couple of things on the deployment of the technology side and I believe it was Eliot, earlier, that talked about how the COVID pandemic, or crisis, has brought the light in a number of disparities and trying to accessing healthcare and securing equal healthcare, across different geographies and socioeconomic classes. </p><p>And I think telemedicine is, obviously, one of those areas. Not everyone has access to broadband, or Internet, or a smart phone that makes telemedicine possible. Then a lot of, you know, older people certainly do not have the capabilities because of their health conditions, can necessarily, engage in a telemedicine visit, without a caregiver, or somebody else being there.  </p><p>So, I think we have a lot of opportunities to think about how to make tele-medicine work, equitable, across all geographies and socioeconomic classes to kind of eliminate some disparities, there. </p><p>I think, as I think about telemedicine, when it's real, I think we're framing it as more of a 21st century house call. I don't know that it's in the pandemic modality of care that will, you know, kind of render everything else not important, or unusable. </p><p>I think it's going to be a modality of care that gets incorporated in care plans, gets used in a more robust way, as house calls have been at various points, throughout history, with physicians. </p><p>But I think it's exciting about expanding access to care in the home, certainly, considered a convenience. And I think anything that connects people with healthcare in a more equitable way is going to be a really good thing, moving forward. </p><p>I think we have to work on some payment issues and I think we have to work on some licensure legal issues about the location of the patient, location of the physician and state licensure laws. But all of those things seem really achievable, now. </p><p>ADAMS: All right. </p><p>KAUFMAN: And this is Jim, if I could jump in on that. A couple things to add. I mean, there's been some great opportunities with the administration, even in the TRICARE program, which is the Department of Defense health program. They're making some steps, when improving access, using telehealth services. </p><p>But one of the big challenges that we continue to face in pediatrics is the 50 different flavors of Medicaid and every state having its own policy. So, having more consistency, across the country and that would be hugely helpful. </p><p>And it goes to the state licensure piece and, actually, the registration of the programs because, not every state has every provider and having to have a provider register in every state Medicaid program creates just huge administrative burdens. </p><p>But the one thing is telehealth is not a panacea. I mean, although it's being used for behavioral health services, especially as this crisis is creating more challenges in that space. Sometimes, it's not appropriate to have a behavioral health visit at the home with a child, when they really should be in a more protected location. </p><p>So, this is when it's a definitely help improving access but it's not a solution for everything. </p><p>ADAMS: Okay. And regarding telehealth, there's another question from the audience. Where we headed with state-based licensing for providers? Are you expecting changes that are just following up on what was previously said? </p><p>Tom, you haven't talked about this. Do you want to jump in here and does anyone else want to address this? </p><p>DILENGE: Yeah, I believe I can address that question about state licensure. I do want to add that, relatedly, on the telehealth, is the issue of Medicare, Part B patients-Part B, as in boy. These are drugs that are administered, usually, in a physician office for very serious diseases, complicated chronic diseases, cancers and others. </p><p>What we've seen, so far, is some good initial steps by the Trump administration to make home infusion of these products more readily available for patients, so they don't have to go into hospital settings, or doctor offices to get these treatments. </p><p>Very important, right now in COVID, but long term, it provides an option, as well, that can help lower costs of medicine, generally speaking. And I think that's a good trend, hopefully, one that can continue but we do, as, I think it was Shawn, or Eliot alluded to, we have to fix some of the regulatory and payment structure issues, within Medicare Part B, to make sure we can do that kind of home infusion safely but also, and that it makes sense for providers and for the patients, themselves, to get it done that way, which I think will lower system costs, overall, </p><p>I'm sorry, I can't answer the state licensure question. </p><p>ADAMS: Anyone else want to jump in on that question. Tom, thank you for your insight. </p><p>MARTIN: Rebecca, this is Shawn. I'm happy to cause controversy. </p><p>I think this is a really, you know, this is a difficult issue, just kind of built upon principles of federalism and the ability of governors and state legislatures to determine commerce in their states. </p><p>And at the end of the day, you know, who's licensed to provide healthcare services in a state has, you know, historically, been under the jurisdictions of governors and state legislatures and state oversight agencies. And I just, although there is the ability to relax those provisions for the purposes of a pandemic, and I think we should explore how to streamline that more in the future, I just, I struggle with state 50 governors giving that up on a permanent basis. </p><p>But I would be happy to be further along their, potentially, but it just seems like a, maybe, a step too far for the governors. </p><p>KAUFMAN: Rebecca, related to that, what's not state licensure--this is Jim-- there is legislation up on the Hill that would allow enrollment in Medicaid programs a little bit easier, by allowing providers to register with Medicare and then, the states would accept that for registration in their Medicaid program. </p><p>So, it's not perfect under the state licensure peace but it does reduce an administrative burden for providers to help improve access. </p><p>ADAMS: Very interesting. Well, thank you all so much. I really appreciate this. Just a warning to the panelists, you may be hearing from our recording team to follow up on some of the things that you said, today. </p><p>Thank you so much. This has been a great conversation. I'd like to thank our audience, as well. We know your time is valuable and we appreciate you spending it with us. </p><p>As a follow-up, we will be sending out a recording of today's webinar. So, if you're looking for resources that can help you monitor the politics and policy around COVID-19, please visit coronavirus.fiscalnote.com. </p><p>Thank you, everyone, and have a great rest of your day. That's all for now. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YV3-PN81-F15W-H0MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

So how much more is Philip Hammond forking out?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the end of the current Parliament, the government will spend an additional \u00a317.9bn while raising just an additional \u00a3280m in taxes. </p><p>But remember, this is relative to the spending plans already set out. That's crucial to assessing the validity of Mr Hammond's proclamation that \"austerity is coming to an end\". It is no more than rhetoric and the politically-neutral Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR's) report tells a different story. </p><p>                      Mr Hammond previewed the spending review by announcing that day-to-day spending limits will rise by an average of 1.2 per cent a year.                    </p><p>At best, fiscal policy won't be getting any more austere in 2019 to 2020, but the OBR's numbers clearly show that the cyclically adjusted budget deficit will tighten again from 2020 to 2021. And that's after eight long years of extraordinary fiscal tightening. As a result, we are not changing our outlook for the UK economy. Low growth and tight fiscal policy is here to stay.</p><p>                     The 'giveaway'                   </p><p>Nevertheless, public sector net borrowing is likely to be 1.9 per cent of national income this year, back in line with the 70-year average, albeit still above the 1.3 per cent average seen during the Tony Blair years (1997 to 2007).</p><p>But a net giveaway Budget does not reverse eight years of austerity. Sure, total real spending has fallen by just 1.5 per cent from a peak of \u00a3800bn in 2010 to 2011, but this must be seen in the context of an increasing, aged population that requires more government services. In this context, eight years of cuts were deep and unprecedented. The average department's budget was cut by 20 per cent.</p><p>All told, total public spending as a share of GDP has fallen from 45 per cent in 2009 to 2010 to 38 per cent, close to the US's 36 per cent which has always been viewed as disconcertingly low.</p><p>Mr Hammond previewed the spending review by announcing that day-to-day spending limits will rise by an average of 1.2 per cent a year. However, the OBR clearly illustrates that real expenditure limits per capita will not rise at all once we exclude the NHS. Moreover, the government has discretely slashed the money set aside for long-term capital spending in the coming years. According to the OBR, the capital spending budget has been cut by \u00a37bn per year in 2020 to 2021.</p><p>                     The fiscal rules                   </p><p>The chancellor delivered his net giveaway Budget while lowering the national debt to GDP ratio by 2020 to 2021 and keeping the structural deficit below 2 per cent of national income. But he had to jettison one of his fiscal rules and a manifesto pledge to run a fiscal surplus from the mid-2020s.</p><p>Reneging on the rule shouldn't concern investors; we have had 12 fiscal rules since 1997, and 10 of those have been broken or abandoned. Markets rarely bat an eyelid. It's been seven decades since there were four consecutive years without a deficit.</p><p>Gilt yields were unmoved. Unsurprising given that the UK has the second lowest public debt to GDP ratio among the G7.</p><p>                     Raising the minimum wage                   </p><p>The 4.9 per cent rise in the national living wage will help lower-income households. Someone, somewhere must pay for higher minimum wages. Either domestic firms make less profit, cut jobs or other benefits, or pass the costs onto households in the form of higher prices.</p><p>In practice, there's precious little evidence that firms cut jobs as a result of higher minimum wages. But that may be because the historic examples start from a relatively low base. Theoretically, there must be a point beyond which higher minimum wages lower employment, but that point is unknown.</p><p>We do not expect the higher living wage to exert significant pressure on inflation - historically this relationship has been very weak.</p><p>                     Tax on big tech                   </p><p>The new \"tech tax\" is aimed at technology platform providers with large revenues. A new tax on business is not something one would expect from a Conservative Chancellor, especially one designed with explicit interventionist intentions. However, it could be seen as correcting for a market distortion created by the tax loopholes that online companies use so deftly. </p><p>After a year with a net outflow of foreign direct investment, one might be concerned about disincentivising investment from globally dominant companies. But it is a sign of the times for techs. The next decade is likely to see a tightening of regulation in all jurisdictions and we are keeping an eye on long-term earnings projections.</p><p>Having said that, big tech appears committed to maintaining UK headquarters, despite Brexit uncertainty. </p><p>                     Do we need Brexit 'headroom'?                   </p><p>The Chancellor maintained headroom of around \u00a315bn against his fiscal rule to reduce the structural budget deficit to 2 per cent of GDP by 2020 to 2021. </p><p>We sometimes hear that forecasts of economic deterioration were wide of the mark after the referendum, so pessimistic forecasts may be similarly wide of the mark after a \"no deal\".</p><p>That said, those post-referendum forecasts may not have been as wrong as you might think.</p><p>For example, after the referendum the Bank of England estimated that GDP would increase by just 0.5 per cent over the 12 months to June 2017, after which the economy would gather more steam and increase by 3 per cent to September 2018. Actually, GDP increased by about 2 per cent over the first 12 months, before decelerating to grow by 1.5 per cent to September 2018 (we've estimated the final quarter based on the monthly data available so far).</p><p>So, while the popular narrative has it that the initial forecasts were way off, the 27-month forecast was actually spot on; the economy just took a different route.</p><p>At the time, we thought other forecasters' initial estimates were too pessimistic but the first 12 months beat even our expectations, largely because households unexpectedly decreased their rate of saving. </p><p>                     Key Points                   </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The outlook for the UK economy remains unchanged, with low growth and tight fiscal policy ahead.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The new \"tech tax\" could be seen as correcting for a market distortion.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The Chancellor has maintained some fiscal headroom in preparation for Brexit.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The size of the UK's trade in services relative to its economy is bigger than any other large advanced economy's. Its manufacturing is one of the most specialised, involving above average use of overseas supply chains. Even if Brexit eventually turns out to be a great change of direction, the disruption to regulatory regimes and supply chains that a hard Brexit would entail over the short to medium term means that the likelihood of investment surprising to the upside is very low indeed. </p><p>So, in short, the Chancellor is wise to keep some fiscal headroom. </p><p>We believe the most likely outcome next year is a deal de minimis with the salient details still to be hammered out during an extended negotiating period. Indeed, in the past fortnight the EU and UK have reportedly considered a year's extension to the two-year transition period, taking us to December 2021.</p><p>However, that would overlap with the start of the EU's next seven-year budget cycle, and could leave the UK liable for a bigger 'divorce bill'. </p><p>Economically, by preserving 'business as usual' for another three years, a transition extension would likely be positive for the economy. That said, it sustains the cloud of uncertainty and could potentially hold back investment decisions for longer.</p><p>The bottom line is that neither the Budget nor Brexit are globally important events, and the global revenue streams underlying most investors' portfolios should be unmoved. </p><p>                     Ed Smith is head of asset allocation research at Rathbones                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTAONL-48998198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTAONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNR-NXS1-JCJY-G51N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1383\"/><timeReceived>12:43 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FTAdviser.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59853\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 7, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

So how much more is Philip Hammond forking out? By the end of the current parliament, the government will spend an additional \u00a317.9bn while raising just an additional \u00a3280m in taxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But remember, this is relative to the spending plans already set out. That is crucial to assessing the validity of Mr Hammond's proclamation that \"austerity is coming to an end\". It is no more than rhetoric and the politicallyneutral Office for Budget Responsibility's report tells a different story.</p><p>At best, fiscal policy will not be getting any more austere in 2019-20, but the OBR's numbers clearly show that the cyclically adjusted budget deficit will tighten again from 2020-21.</p><p>And that is after eight long years of extraordinary fiscal tightening. As a result, we are not changing our outlook for the UK economy. Low growth and tight fiscal policy is here to stay.</p><p>The 'giveaway' Nevertheless, public sector net borrowing is likely to be 1.9 per cent of national income this year, back in line with the 70-year average, albeit still above the 1.3 per cent average seen during the Tony Blair years.</p><p>But a net giveaway Budget does not reverse eight years of austerity. Sure, total real spending has fallen by just 1.5 per cent from a peak of \u00a3800bn in 2010-11, but this must be seen in the context of an increasing aged population that requires more government services. In this context, eight years of cuts were deep and unprecedented. The average department's budget was cut by 20 per cent.</p><p>All told, total public spending as a share of GDP has fallen from 45 per cent in 2009-10 to 38 per cent, close to the US's 36 per cent, which has always been viewed as disconcertingly low.</p><p>Mr Hammond previewed the spending review by announcing that day-to-day spending limits will rise by an average of 1.2 per cent a year. However, the OBR clearly illustrates that real expenditure limits per capita will not rise at all once we exclude the NHS. Moreover, the government has discretely slashed the money set aside for long-term capital spending in the coming years. According to the OBR, the capital spending budget has been cut by \u00a37bn per year in 2020-21.</p><p>The fiscal rules The chancellor delivered his net giveaway Budget while lowering the national debt to GDP ratio by 2020-21 and keeping the structural deficit below 2 per cent of national income. But he had to jettison one of his fiscal rules and a manifesto pledge - namely to run a fiscal surplus from the mid-2020s.</p><p>Reneging on the rule should not concern investors; we have had 12 fiscal rules since 1997, and 10 of those have been broken or abandoned. Markets rarely bat an eyelid. It has been seven decades since there were four consecutive years without a deficit.</p><p>Gilt yields were unmoved. Unsurprising given that the UK has the second lowest public debt to GDP ratio among the G7.</p><p>Tax on big tech The new \"tech tax\" is aimed at technology platform providers with large revenues. A new tax on business is not something one would expect from a Conservative chancellor, especially one designed with explicit interventionist intentions. However, it could be seen as correcting for a market distortion created by the tax loopholes that online companies use so deftly.</p><p>After a year with a net outflow of foreign direct investment, one might be concerned about disincentivising investment from globally dominant companies. But it is a sign of the times for techs. The next decade is likely to see a tightening of regulation in all jurisdictions and we are keeping an eye on long-term earnings projections.</p><p>Having said that, big tech appears committed to maintaining UK headquarters, despite Brexit uncertainty.</p><p>Do we need Brexit 'headroom'? The chancellor maintained headroom of around \u00a315bn against his fiscal rule to reduce the structural budget deficit to 2 per cent of GDP by 2020-21.</p><p>We sometimes hear that forecasts of economic deterioration were wide of the mark after the referendum, so pessimistic forecasts may be similarly wide of the mark after a 'no deal'.</p><p>That said, those postreferendum forecasts may not have been as wrong as you might think.</p><p>For example, after the referendum the Bank of England estimated that GDP would increase by just 0.5 per cent over the 12 months to June 2017, after which the economy would gather more steam and increase by 3 per cent to September 2018. Actually, GDP increased by about 2 per cent over the first 12 months, before decelerating to grow by 1.5 per cent to September 2018 (we have estimated the final quarter based on the monthly data available so far).</p><p>So, while the popular narrative has it that the initial forecasts were way off, the 27-month forecast was actually spot on; the economy just took a different route.</p><p>At the time, we thought other forecasters' initial estimates were too pessimistic but the first 12 months beat even our expectations, largely because households unexpectedly decreased their rate of saving.</p><p>The size of the UK's trade in services relative to its economy is bigger than any other large advanced economy's. Its manufacturing is one of the most specialised, involving above average use of overseas supply chains. Even if Brexit eventually turns out to be a great change of direction, the disruption to regulatory regimes and supply chains that a 'hard Brexit' would entail over the short to medium term means that the likelihood of investment surprising to the upside is very low indeed.</p><p>So, in short, the chancellor is wise to keep some fiscal headroom.</p><p>We believe the most likely outcome next year is a deal 'de minimis' with the salient details still to be hammered out during an extended negotiating period. Indeed, in the past fortnight the EU and UK have reportedly considered a year's extension to the twoyear transition period, taking us to December 2021.</p><p>However, that would overlap with the start of the EU's next seven-year budget cycle, and could leave the UK liable for a bigger 'divorce bill'.</p><p>Economically, by preserving 'business as usual' for another three years, a transition extension would likely be positive for the economy.</p><p>That said, it sustains the cloud of uncertainty and could potentially hold back investment decisions for longer.</p><p>The bottom line is that neither the Budget nor Brexit are globally important events, and the global revenue streams underlying most investors' portfolios should be unmoved.</p><p>Ed Smith is head of asset allocation research at Rathbones</p><p>\"We sometimes hear  ;  ;  that forecasts of  ;  ;  economic  ;  ;  deterioration were  ;  ;  wide of the mark  ;  ;  after the  ;  ;  referendum\"  ;</p><p>KEY POINTS  ;  ;  \u2022 The outlook for the UK economy remains unchanged, with low growth and tight fiscal policy ahead.  ;  ;  \u2022 The new \"tech tax\" could be seen as correcting for a market distortion.  ;  ;  \u2022 The chancellor has maintained some fiscal headroom in preparation for Brexit.  ;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINADV-143375097</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINADV2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNX-8YX1-JCBW-N2BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">242817</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1208\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Financial Adviser</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59208\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 8, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001959</classCode><className>PUBLIC FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000253</classCode><className>CAPITAL EXPENDITURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

It's a premium piece on their site for some reason and you have to hence register to read it - I did that, and have read it, and this blog is the result of analysing it paragraph by paragraph. Bear in mind however that this is not a fisk[3] in the classic sense - there is so much waffle in the piece I cannot take apart every single paragraph. So think of this as a kind of fisk of the best and worst of it. Also - as a summary of sorts - there is little new in Boris's piece. </p><p>He is committed to hard Brexit. He says nothing about transition periods. He makes nice noises but says nothing of substance on citizens rights. And he fills out the rest of the 4000 words with nationalist guff. But anyway, this is a fisk. So let's get to it. There are some media observers - in this country and around the world - who think we are going to bottle it. Strike me that this is off. No-one thinks the British are going to bottle it. If anything it is the opposite - that the UK has excess confidence, not too much fear! And then there were dyed-in-the-wool Europhiles, who thought Brussels was going too far and the only way to get change was to vote Leave. This is just ridiculous, and I'd be fascinated to meet such a person. I think I can even count of the British Europhiles I know on the fingers of one hand. Before the referendum, we all agreed on what leaving the EU logically must entail: leaving the customs union and the single market, leaving the penumbra of the European Court of Justice; taking back control of our borders, cash, laws. This is absolutely, totally, categorically NOT the case. The referendum means the UK must leave the EU, but there was nothing in the referendum itself to be that prescriptive. I explain this in more depth here[4]. Overwhelmingly, I find that Leavers and Remainers are coming together I would like to see some evidence of this. Opinion polls look as split as ever. Parliament is perhaps more united than it was, but this idea that there is a unity of purpose is miles from the mark. Also even if there is a consensus that Brexit has to happen I am pretty sure there is no consensus on what sort of Brexit. you may remember how we were repeatedly assured that even if we were unhappy with the direction of the project, even if we disagreed with the concept of ever closer union, it was none the less worth putting up with it all for the sake of the influence we would have. This implies that the EU was something done to the UK. As @EmporersNewC pointed out in this classic Twitter thread[5] the UK was indeed successful at making major changes to the EU and how it works, but then changed its mind and blamed the EU instead. That is exactly what Boris is doing here. Of course we should pay tribute to the patriotic British men and women who went out to Brussels and got stuck into those institutions [] And it is notable that today their numbers have diminished to the point where the UK represents 16 per cent of EU GDP and 13 per cent of the population but only 3.6 per cent of EU officials. That says that the UK officials were pretty bad at passing the entrance examinations. And do not speak enough languages to be recruited. And the negative attitude towards the EU from people like Johnson himself surely did not help either. If we had been asked to design the EU ourselves, on a blank sheet of paper, we would have nothing like the body that exists today. We tried so often to frustrate it. This is such a ridiclous line. What would a UK designed EU look like? Oh, and the Single Market, a core component of the EU to this day was rather driven forward by Thatcher. Again this idea that the UK cannot change or influence the EU, denying when the UK actually did do that. we tried to stop the expansion of majority voting. No. Majority voting was central to the development of the Single Market through the Single European Act, and here Thatcher was in favour. Background here[6]. And were unanimity to still apply in an EU of 28 Member States then Boris would be bemoaning the EU's slow decision making and inefficiency. it was about trussing the nations together in a gigantic and ever-tightening cat's cradle of red tape Yes. The big evil Delors cat's cradle red tape monster! Waaah! when push comes to shove, that apparent willingness to support the UK position is less powerful than the great centripetal force of integration. To every question, to every crisis - whether it is the euro or immigration - the answer is always the same: more Europe! Again we have this assumption that the EU always does things to the UK, as if the EU somehow drives this integration aside from its Member States. Look at responses to Juncker's state of the EU speech this week - loads of scepticism all over the place[7]. I look ahead over the next 15 years at what may be coming down the track: the push to create an economic government of Europe, the activism of the ECJ in all the new competences of the Lisbon Treaty Is that it? The UK has an economic opt out from the Euro, and hence would play no role in economic government. So judicial activism of the ECJ is the biggest fear? the logic of their ambition means trying to construct what is effectively a single polity out of 27 countries This is such a straw man. Look at Scotland - it has been in a union with England since 1707, but it does not have its own polity? Or are the political methods and traditions of Spain and Lithuania subsumed into one? We have spent too much time trying, and often failing, to exert influence in the meeting rooms of Brussels. That exercise has diverted massive quantities of the intellectual energy of the British government, and it has not helped us to address the real challenges this country faces. UKRep has a couple of hundred staff. Add perhaps a couple of thousand who do EU work in part or full time in Whitehall. And those scant resources could have put Britain on a better path? That's rubbish. And even out of the EU the UK cannot not deal with the EU, so resources will still be needed. And meanwhile Brexit itself needs masses of civil service resources[8]. On the contrary: unemployment is at record lows, and manufacturing is booming 'in spite of Brexit', as the BBC would put it. Boris, you are the Foreign Secretary. And you are having cheap shots in a newspaper column about the BBC? Oh and meanwhile the UK has the slowest growth in the EU[9] - unsurprisingly that was not mentioned by Boris. But, of course, this country still has chronic problems, and at least some of them have been exacerbated by the rigidities of EU membership - and certainly by the way we have chosen legally to apply those obligations. Our infrastructure is too expensive - and takes far longer than France or other countries. France is in the EU. How does Boris even write these sentences one after the other? Successive governments have failed to build enough homes [] we have yet to find a way of persuading middle-class kids that they might be just as well off getting a skill as a degree [] We do not conduct enough basic research in science [] The result of all these failings - over decades - is that we have low productivity: lower than France or Germany. Repeat after me, Boris: France and Germany are in the EU. Britain does have those problems but NOT because of the EU! I believe we have an immense can-do spirit. I have seen it in action. But we also have a truly phenomenal ability to delay and to rack up cost. We have been able to blame bureaucracy and to blame Brussels, and my point is that after Brexit we will no longer be able to blame anyone but ourselves. Agh I despair. So Brexit is actually necessary because until now Britain has been incapable of coming to terms with its own problems? While a few sentences earlier you blamed the EU for the UK's infrastructure costs. We would not expect to pay for access to their markets any more than they would expect to pay for access to ours. Note 'access to' here. Canada does not pay to access EU markets either. But if the UK had a Canada option that's a very hard Brexit and has associated economic costs. Sounds like a nice line, but belies the complexity of this. And yes - once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly \u00a3350 million per week. It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS This is just about true actually, as the UK contributes roughly that amount gross to the EU. And he loosens the commitment to how much of it would go on the NHS. As I point out in point 6 here[10], giving the NHS \u00a3350m a week more is going to happen within a decade anyway - it just won't be money saved from the EU. Our systems of standards will remain absolutely flush with the rest of the EU [] But over time we will be able to diverge from the great accumulated conglomerate, to act with regulatory freedom. (note: I diverge from the chronological order of the piece here) So which is it then? Are the standards the same, or are they to diverge? whether you believe such notable authorities as Peter Mandelson, who once claimed that EU regulation cost us 4 per cent of GDP, or Gordon Brown, who said the cost was nearer 7 per cent Mandelson seems to have said this in 2004, and I can only find it quoted on UKIP blogs and from Roger Helmer[11]. I can't even find a source for the Gordon Brown figure. Plus were these figures even true, how much of this would UK businesses still have to deal with after Brexit? And what about the economic benefits of the Single Market? At the stroke of a pen, for instance, the Chancellor will be able to cut VAT on tampons. This is often demanded by Parliament but - absurdly - it is legally impossible to deliver. This issue was sorted between David Cameron and the Commission[12] before the referendum. Next. business will no longer be able to use immigration as an excuse not to invest in the young people of this country Is business actually really genuinely doing this? I am not sure businesses would use that line in that way. The state also has a responsibility here. And I can think of obvious ways in which Brexit can help us tackle the housing crisis [] There may be ways of simplifying planning procedures, post-Brexit, and abbreviating impact assessments, without in any way compromising the environment. Boris: do other EU countries have housing crises like the UK's? No, not in the same way. So perhaps have a think about what else the UK could do? And which country was keenest of impact assessments in EU law? Oh, the UK. Well I never. We should seize the opportunity of Brexit to reform our tax system. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist, argued in 2015 that our system is currently skewed so as to discourage investment. He believes that reform could raise output by around 20 per cent. Output of what? By whom? And is the EU at fault for it not happening? This is our chance to catch the wave of new technology, and to put Britain in the lead Do tell me, please tell me, why is the EU stopping this? People often ask themselves why the EU has failed to produced a single major tech giant on the scale of those found in America. Well, part of the answer may be found in the statist and top-down approach that characterises the thinking of the Commission. Or not. This is just prejudice. Yes, all EU countries could be better here, but slating the Commission for this is just cheap. Have you ever wondered what happened to Minitel, the state-owned and managed French equivalent of Google? Have you ever wondered what happened to the Amstrad 64? Or the Atari? Or the BBC B Micro? There are in fact four zones of the world where big tech investments are made: Boston, Silicon Valley, Shanghai and the triangle formed by London, Oxford and Cambridge. Oh. While the UK was in the EU. But you just said that Brexit was to help the UK make a success of its tech. Now I am lost. we will be able to get on and do free-trade deals, to campaign for free trade that has lifted billions out of poverty, which so badly needs a new champion So that EU that has sorted a deal with Canada, is finalising one with Japan, starting with Australia and New Zealand no advocate? And the UK can be a champion of that having ended the deepest trade relationship it ever had - with the EU? Britain's success will not be a bad thing for our friends across the Channel. On the contrary, it will mean a bigger market in the UK for everything from Italian cars to German wine. Ah. Innovative! It's Riesling and Fiat today. Prosecco and BMWs are so yesterday. Seriously though, the economic consensus is that Hard Brexit is bad for the UK economy[13], so how is Boris claiming this? We have a glorious future - but hardly any of this would be possible under the bizarre and incoherent plans of the Labour Party [] Now it appears he wants to remain in the single market and the customs union. In other words, he would make a complete mockery of Brexit, and turn an opportunity into a national humiliation. Ah. Not leaving the Single Market is a national humiliation. That's even stronger than the usual saboteur language used against the Remain side. The rest of the EU if anything would see this as sensible - the UK not burning all its bridges. I look at so many young people with the 12 stars lipsticked on their faces and I am troubled with the thought that people are beginning to have genuinely split allegiances. [] You don't have to be some tub-thumping nationalist to worry that a transnational sense of allegiance can weaken the ties between us; and you don't have to be an out\u2011and\u2011out nationalist to feel an immense pride in this country and what it can do. So Brexit is essentially nationalism, and exclusionary nationalism. Again all of this is so us-versus-them. Is it really impossible to have some allegiance to Glasgow, Scotland, the UK, and Europe? Is that such a bad thing? But at least here this gives some insight into Boris's mentality. Look at Canary Wharf - a banking district now bigger than Frankfurt itself. Oh. I assume he doesn't mean geographically? Or does he? I was proud to be mayor of the greatest city on Earth, and I believe we can be the greatest country on Earth. Make Britain Great Again!

The announcement, however, comes at a time when Google is under regulatory scrutiny for potential privacy and antitrust violations, and some lawmakers have already voiced concerns about the tie-up.</p><p>'Natural fit'</p><p>Alex Fuhrman, an analyst at Craig-Hallum Capital Group, a research, trading and investment banking firm, called the Google-Fitbit combination a \"natural fit.\"</p><p>\"The deep health and fitness data, coupled with the 28 million active users on the Fitbit platform, offer a tremendous value,\" the analyst wrote in a research note.</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at market research firm IDC, who has expertise in wearables, augmented reality and virtual reality, said Google has much to gain from Fitbit's customer base as the tech giant looks to expand beyond its online search and advertising businesses.</p><p>\"Fitbit has one of the most locked-in communities,\" Ubrani said in an interview. \"That's something Google has struggled with, not just when it comes to health and fitness, but in general. Google hasn't done a great job at social. It's essentially a data grab for Google.\"</p><p>In hardware, Google is better known for its growing product line of Pixel smartphones, Chromebook laptops and smart speakers. The company does provide a free wearable operating system called Wear OS for other companies to use but has yet to build its own smartwatch.</p><p>Fitbit product lineSource: Fitbit</p><p>Google's \"deep pockets\" should help Fitbit acquire more customers and tap into more hardware-related channels, Ubrani said.</p><p>Fitbit has recently had difficulty stabilizing its financials as it competes against similar offerings from Apple, Samsung Electronics Ltd and lower-cost Chinese vendors, such as Xiaomi Corp. and Huawei Culture Co.Ltd. The company in July lowered the midpoint of its full-year 2019 revenue guidance by $95 million to $1.455 billion, following lower-than-expected sales of its new model, Versa Lite, the company said.</p><p>For the first three months of 2019, the company held just 6% of the wearables market, according to IDC. That compares to market-leader Apple, which captured 26%, followed by Xiaomi with 13%, Huawei at 10% and Samsung's 9%.</p><p>Privacy concerns</p><p>In a blog post confirming the deal, Rick Osterloh, Google's senior vice president of devices and services, said the company will not sell users' personal information to anyone, and Fitbit's health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads. Fitbit users also will be able to review, move or delete their data whenever they choose, according to the blog.</p><p>Alphabet and its peers have been facing increased regulatory scrutiny. In September, for instance, Alphabet disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice was probing potential antitrust violations at the company. Fifty state attorneys general also are investigating alleged monopolistic behavior by Google in the online advertising marketplace.</p><p>Despite the pressure, the deal should not face insurmountable regulatory challenges, said Michael Kramer, founder of New York-based investment advisory firm Mott Capital Management, who pointed to the already-robust competition in the wearables market and the fact that big tech is much more aware of data privacy issues than in the past. According to Kramer, Google likely will not have more regulatory concerns than \"what they're currently dealing with.\"</p><p>But some lawmakers say the type of data involved with the Fitbit purchase should raise more alarms. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who has long been an outspoken critic of big tech, for instance, noted that the acquisition would give Alphabet \"deep insights\" into consumers' \"most sensitive\" information.</p><p>\"This proposed transaction is a major test of antitrust enforcers' will and ability to enforce the law and halt anti-competitive concentrations of economic power. It deserves an immediate and thorough investigation,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., also voiced his concerns in a Nov. 1 tweet, wondering if Google should be able to acquire more companies \"while they're under DOJ antitrust investigation.\"</p><p>The transaction is expected to close in 2020, subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals, among other customary conditions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-55253598</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFJ-2GV1-JDVW-N4RG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

The company received an 510(k) designation for its app to assess AFib, a condition that affects more than 33.5 million people globally. According to the company, the new ECG app allows people to take on-the-spot readings to check for AFib at any time. It adds to the expanding suite of applications Fitbit has been racing to incorporate into its wearable devices such as blood oxygen measurement and early detection of COVID-19 .    Why it matters    The news builds momentum for Fitbit which has been propelled center stage of big tech competition. Last year Google announced its intention to acquire the activity tracker company for over $2 billion . Since then Fitbit has been expanding its suite of applications showing they are serious about developing more medically-related features. Recently, Fitbit released early results for predicting symptoms of COVID-19 . The company has partnered with research organizations to show that wearables provide a valuable role in detecting infection. If Fitbit gains traction in the fight against COVID-19 it could be a key player in global health and gain a valuable edge in wearable consumer technology.     Earlier this month Fitbit rather quietly introduced another capability\u2014 an estimate of blood oxygen saturation\u2014but only in select markets . Apparently its sensors measure the relative reflection of red and infrared light from blood via the wrist, and using variations in heart rate can estimate blood oxygen levels. Such a feature would be valuable in tracking health and respiratory status and both wellness and disease. The company had possibly hoped to gain some excitement for an application still in testing, and scoop Apple Watch\u2019s approaching next series debut.     Big breakthroughs    This week the A pple Watch Series 6 made headlines with the announcement  of \u201cbreakthrough wellness and fitness capabilities\u201d  including a \u201crevolutionary\u201d feature that measures oxygen saturation, or SpO2, similar to the capability being tested by Fitbit. In its announcement Apple also noted collaborations with researchers to conduct health studies such as exploring how the device\u2019s blood oxygen measurements and other physiological signals can help manage and control asthma.    The FDA had granted Apple de novo status for its elegant ECG app in 2018. This was lauded by the health tech industry as a breakthrough product with the equivalent of a lead I tracing from a traditional ECG. Embedded in the app is Apple\u2019s proprietary algorithm which is able to determine the presence of AFib or sinus rhythm on a classifiable waveform. Some doctors and investors hailed the innovation as a \u201cbig breakthrough\u201d  with high expectations to expand the wearable diagnostic market and reach more at-risk populations.     Competitive follower    The AFib app was based on the Fitbit Heart Study which was launched in early 2020. Fitbit Heart was a large-scale, virtual study to validate the use of its wearable technology to identify episodes of irregular heart rhythm suggestive of AFib. The company stated that it had enrolled more than 400,000 participants in just over four months.    The study bears striking resemblance to a high profile trial called the Apple Heart Study  which was done in partnership with Stanford and had the goal of identifying irregular heart rhythms such as AFib. Launched in 2017, the study was proudly proclaimed as an unprecedented virtual study with over 400,000 participants in only eight months. Results were published last year in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine .         Healthy tech      Fitbit built its reputation as an easy-to-use health tracker since 2008 with its iconic step counter in a discreet wrist band. The simple, intuitive gadget helped solidify the company\u2019s reputation as the healthy lifestyle device-of-choice for millions of people keeping an eye on their daily steps. Over the years the company packed more technology into its tracker in order to gain access to bigger consumer markets. Along the way, it built larger devices that eventually morphed into smart watches. Fitbit became a favored wearable diagnostic in over 500 clinical research studies due to its excellent battery life and high patient compliance.    Headwinds    Some healthcare experts are skeptical that Fitbit wearables can continue to play the fast follower and maintain a strong market position in the face of increasing innovation from Apple Watch. Distinguished Harvard Professor Regina Herzlinger questions the Google and Fitbit marriage in a recent posting, \u201cWill Google's purchase of FitBit succeed? Chances are not terrific,\u201d and she suggests the company\u2019s data is potentially more valuable than the activity tracker business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43084361266</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VF-KFC1-F07F-80WD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"854\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Global Health Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Global Health Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>GLH</className><className>ASX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>WSY</className><className>BER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: AU000000GLH2</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISIN: AU000000GLH2</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000037</classCode><className>AGENCY RULEMAKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkRFNDkwODkxNDVGNDI1NDg0RUU3RjREMTgwNEJEQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM</classCode><className>Agency Rulemaking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000259</classCode><className>CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000C4A1</classCode><className>HEART DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1GQ</classCode><className>MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS, SCREENING &amp;

The imposition of major structural changes could be disruptive to operations but strong cash flow and relatively low debt levels should limit credit risk in the near term.</p><p><br/><br/>The US government split up antitrust oversight of Facebook, Amazon (A+/Stable), Apple and Google between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) last month. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee is currently assessing the effectiveness of current laws in regulating these companies. We believe the situation could take years to unfold and formal FTC or DOJ investigations could potentially lead to hefty fines, new laws limiting the reach of these firms, or, in the extreme, forced divestitures.<br/><br/>Facebook's social media dominance reflects a global user base that is about 5.0x larger than Twitter and Snap combined and a near 25% market share of global digital advertising spend, ex-China. Approximately 2.7 billion, or 90% plus, of global internet users, excluding China where Facebook's platforms are banned, use one of Facebook's platforms (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp) monthly. However, Facebook risks losing the trust of users due to legal and regulatory risks related to unauthorized sharing of personal information and cybersecurity issues.<br/><br/>WhatsApp and Instagram are important to Facebook's growth strategy but renewed scrutiny about the 2012 purchase of Instagram also raises risk the FTC could reverse prior approval of the acquisition. We would not expect a forced divestiture to dilute Facebook's brand in the near term but its growth prospects and market position could eventually be impaired. Integrating platform architectures might produce efficiencies and help thwart future regulatory actions.<br/><br/>Apple could also face significant antitrust risk, despite a more limited market share vis-a-vis other big tech companies, due to its App Store because Apple does not permit third-party marketplaces to sell apps for iOS and earns a 30% commission on sales of all apps through its marketplace. EU regulators are examining this arrangement in the context of Spotify and the US Supreme Court ruled customers can sue Apple over monopoly claims last month.<br/><br/>We believe Apple's App Store could be painted with the same brush as Microsoft (AA+/Stable) in the United States v. Microsoft case that led to the unbundling of the Windows operating system and Internet Explorer to promote competition. A similar move forcing Apple to open its iOS to third-party marketplaces could harm its growth strategy.<br/><br/>Google has faced legal challenges with the European Commission (EC) levying approximately $ 9.5 billion of antitrust-related fines since 2017. The EC has indicated forced break ups of tech titans is not the best way to counter their power due to network effects likely allowing them to regain dominance. However, we believe such views could change under new incoming EC leadership. Google has a near 70% market share in global digital advertising, ex-China, and offers internet-related services and products such as cloud computing and video streaming via YouTube.<br/><br/>Antitrust risk may be relatively less significant for Amazon. The company's leading e-commerce market share has been organically built through low consumer prices and good customer service, so the risk of Amazon being labeled as monopolistic appears low. Furthermore, while Amazon's online product sales are well above its competitive set, Amazon's total market share in many categories is significantly less than competitors. We estimate Amazon Web Services (AWS) has about 50% market share of Infrastructure-as-a-Service compared to nearly 20% for Microsoft and a high-single-digit level for Google. However, AWS's scale may not be a regulatory concern if Microsoft's near 75% operating system market share is considered.<br/><br/>Contact:<br/><br/>Alen Lin<br/><br/>Senior Director, US Corporates<br/><br/>Fitch Ratings, Inc.<br/><br/>70 W.

Rating implications would depend on deal structure, assumed revenue and cost synergies, intermediate-term leverage expectations, financial policy and the business risk profile of the combined entity.<br/><br/>Consolidation in declining markets is not unusual, particularly when emerging technology disrupts traditional business models. Therefore, MA event risk is elevated in sectors experiencing disruption and secular change as companies look to transform business models and remain competitive. Transactions are often leveraging with long-term value creation that is uncertain. Rarely do smaller entities acquire larger companies but, if financing is available, it is not inconceivable, as evidenced by Dell's purchase of EMC in 2015. Xerox is expected to receive $ 2.3 billion of proceeds from the sale of its 25% stake in it Fuji Xerox JV and, according to media reports, has an informal funding commitment for the potential HP acquisition.<br/><br/>Assuming Xerox offered $ 17 per share in cash and $ 5 per share in stock, as reported by the media, incremental debt financing could be about $ 20 billion and pro forma core leverage between 3.4x and 4.2x, depending on synergy capture. HP and Xerox have relatively low stand-alone leverage of around 1.5x and 1.8x, respectively, but have different revenue growth, profitability and FCF prospects. HP is solidly investment grade while Xerox is speculative grade. Investor appetite for such a sizable debt issuance in a secularly challenged industry is an open question.<br/><br/>Xerox is experiencing midsingle-digit revenue declines due to weakness in its installed base. The company's core business has been in decline for several years as a result. Conversely, HP has been generating low single-digit revenue growth due to an ability to take or maintain market share by pursuing adjacencies and shifting the mix of its business to capture pockets of growth, particularly in PCs. The company's print business has recently been challenged.<br/><br/>Xerox could benefit from the cash flow dynamics of HP's PC business, despite its lower margin. Gaps in individual product lines might be closed, given a combined company would have a complete A3/A4 product offering plus managed print services and leasing capability. Xerox's market dominance in A3 would complement HP; given HP's market penetration is only in the low teens even after its acquisition of Samsung's printer business in 2017.<br/><br/>A transaction could potentially result in substantial cost synergies of $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion on top of savings from existing restructuring programs at each company. HP plans to save around $ 1 billion over the next two years to invest in software and services to boost revenue while Xerox is on track to achieve over $ 600 million of gross savings this year and at least $ 450 million in 2020. Shared RD expenses for 3D printing, aaS offerings and commercial/graphics would also be a benefit.<br/><br/>If a deal materializes, regulatory risk should theoretically be low because market overlap is modest given differing A3/A4 market share and mostly foreign competition. Recent government scrutiny around large acquisitions, such as T-Mobile/Sprint and ATT/Time Warner, and increased rhetoric around big tech market power appear less relevant in this case. Xerox and HP's combined print business would have significant scale with about $ 30 billion of annualized revenue, about equal to the next largest print competitors combined and possibly greater pricing flexibility. Consolidated revenue for the combined company would approximate $ 70 billion.<br/><br/>Contact:<br/><br/>Kevin McNeil<br/><br/>Director, US Corporates<br/><br/>+1 646 582-4768<br/><br/>Fitch Ratings, Inc.<br/><br/>33 Whitehall Street<br/><br/>New York, NY 10004<br/><br/>David Peterson<br/><br/>Senior Director, US Corporates<br/><br/>+1 312 368-3177<br/><br/>Carla Norfleet Taylor, CFA<br/><br/>Senior Director, Fitch Wire<br/><br/>+1 312 368-3195<br/><br/>The above article originally appeared as a post on the Fitch Wire credit market commentary page.

For close to six hours, Congressional representatives pelted Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Sundar Pichai with queries on everything from data privacy to online ad exchanges.   Even for the most sophisticated group of askers, this would be a lot of ground to cover: The four tech companies have different business models, and different practices inviting the scrutiny of Congress. Past hearings\u2014in particular Zuckerberg\u2019s 2018 appearance before Congress \u2014didn\u2019t inspire much confidence when it comes to politicians\u2019 grasp of the businesses they\u2019re interrogating.   Wednesday, too, had some doozies, like when Rep. Greg Steube asked Pichai why his campaign emails were hitting his constituents\u2019 (and dad\u2019s) spam folders. But on the whole, the hearing was a pleasant surprise: Many of the questions were nuanced and thoughtful. Here are five of the most pointed questions posed to the world\u2019s most powerful CEOs:  Rep. Mary Scanlon, D-PA  Scanlon took a traditional\u2014but effective\u2014line of attack against monopolies: She dredged up an example of anti-competitive practices driving up prices for consumers. To Jeff Bezos, Scanlon cited the example of Diapers.com: \u201cIn an email that I reviewed,\u201d she said, \u201cone of your top executives proposed to you an \u2018aggressive plan to win\u2019 against Diapers.com, a plan that sought to undercut their business by temporarily slashing Amazon prices.\u201d   After acquiring the company, though, Amazon raised its diaper prices again. \u201cYou said that Amazon focuses on customers,\u201d Scanlon followed up. \u201cSo how would customers, especially single moms, new families, how would they benefit when the prices were driven up by the fact that you eliminated your main competitor?\u201d  Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-ND  Armstrong cautioned against regulating with too blunt an instrument, arguing that laws can counterintuitively help monopolies grow. When questioning Pichai, he walked through the ways Europe\u2019s 2018 GDPR privacy law allowed Google to gain ground against its competitors in digital advertising: By restricting other platforms\u2019 ability to work with Google\u2019s data, it could actually make them less competitive.   \u201cUsually in our quest to regulate companies we end up hurting small companies more,\u201d said Armstrong. \u201cThe consequences of GDPR have been to further entrench large established actors like Google, leading to regulatory capture that exacerbates competition concerns.\u201d  Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-NY  Nadler, the Judiciary committee chairman, used a series of internal emails to probe Zuckerberg on Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram. After asking what Zuckerberg meant when he wrote that \u201cInstagram can meaningfully hurt us without becoming a huge business\u201d and that Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram was meant to neutralize a competitor and incorporate its features, Nadler asked:   \u201cMergers and acquisitions that buy off potential competitive threats violate the antitrust law. In your own words, you purchased Instagram to neutralize a competitive threat. If this was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction, why shouldn\u2019t Instagram now be broken off into a separate company?\u201d   Zuckerberg answered, simply, that the deal had been approved in 2012 by regulators looking at the same documents the committee had.  Rep. Ken Buck, R-CO  Points for cross-disciplinary thinking: Buck asked all four CEOs about the role of slave labor in the production of their goods or those sold on their platforms. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that given Amazon\u2019s allowance of counterfeit goods on its marketplace,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially counterfeit goods from China, that Amazon\u2019s marketplace may be knowingly or unknowingly furthering China\u2019s use of forced and slave labor conditions.\u201d   His question, though, was more of a request: \u201cWill you certify here today that your company does not use and will never use slave labor to manufacture your products or allow products to be sold on your platform that are manufactured using slave labor?\u201d (All answered yes.)  Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-WA  Representing Amazon\u2019s home district in Washington, Jayapal was clearly in her comfort zone while questioning both Bezos and Zuckerberg about anti-competitive practices. She came with receipts, referencing emails from 2012 in which Zuckerberg suggested that copying others\u2019 products could \u201cprevent our competitors from getting footholds.\u201d In clear, yes-or-no questions, Jayapal asked whether Facebook has ever copied competitors\u2019 products, or threatened to clone the products of another company while attempting to acquire it. She used the same tactic to ask Bezos if Amazon gives itself a leg up by using third-party seller data to inform its own business decisions.   In questioning Bezos, Jayapal also gave one of the clearest summaries of the hearing\u2019s aim: \u201cThe whole goal of this committee\u2019s work is to make sure that there are more Amazons, that there are more Apples,\u201d she said. \u201cThat there are more companies that get to innovate and small businesses get to thrive and that is what we\u2019re trying to get at, that is why we need to regulate these marketplaces so that no company has a platform so dominant that it is essentially a monopoly.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42716693412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-45X1-JCSC-J0K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Quartz</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000CUVE</classCode><className>QUIDSI INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

According to the fintech pros more deals, swirling IPO rumors and a continued steady stream of checks from venture capitalists. Here's a wrap from industry experts</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2018, a number of financial technology startups came into their own. Free trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc., for example, added new services and billions to its valuation. And Stripe Inc. was valued by investors at a price higher than the market caps of 249 of the companies on the S&amp;P 500 Index. But the industry is also maturing and consolidating, and larger industry players, hoping not to be left behind by the new era of digital finance, are stepping up their hunt for acquisitions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What should we be on the lookout for in 2019? According to the fintech pros more deals, swirling IPO rumors and a continued steady stream of checks from venture capitalists. Here's a wrap from industry experts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IPOS LOOMING</p><p>Up to this point, financial technology startups have been hesitant to enter the public markets. And who can blame them? Most fintech companies that have gone public in recent years have seen their share prices tumble, and ample venture capital funding has</p><p>buffered balance sheets. Still, a major IPO isn't unthinkable in 2019. Credit Karma and Robinhood are cited as two possibilities, and other large companies may get serious about at least laying the IPO groundwork next year.</p><p>Vanessa Colella, head of Citi Ventures</p><p>at Citigroup Inc.: \"I do not think we'll see any major mergers, acquisitions or IPOs in fintech specifically. Stripe has done some incredible work and has the potential to be one to watch for the IPO track, but ultimately we expect to see continued growth in the private market.\"</p><p>A major IPO isn't unthinkable in 2019. Credit Karma and Robinhood are cited as two possibilities, and other large companies may get serious about at least laying the IPO groundwork next year</p><p>Lindsay Davis, analyst at CB Insights: \"Fintechs have been focused on scaling up, and on products over profit. That mentality is fundamentally flipped when a company goes public. As a result, many have taken the slow approach to an IPO, and that trend is likely to continue since many of the rumored candidates have enough runway to stay private after record financing rounds in 2018.\"</p><p>Matt Harris, managing director at Bain Capital Ventures: \"In terms of 2019 IPOs, it will be interesting to see if Credit Karma decides to go public. They certainly have the scale and profitability.\"</p><p>Kyle Lui, principal at DCM Ventures: \"Many fintech companies have gained</p><p>traction and are ripe for acquisition. Truly breakout companies like Robinhood will likely go public in 2019.\"</p><p>CONSOLIDATION PICKS UP</p><p>Our experts were unanimous on this one. There are plenty of startups out there that have gained enough footing for incumbents to take notice, but have stayed small enough that an acquisition is still feasible.</p><p>Lindsay Davis: \"Digital-first 'challenger' banks are prime acquisition targets for incumbents. We'd also expect to see the largest fintech unicorns become more active on the M&amp;A front, as we saw firms like Stripe and Credit Karma make more acquisitions in 2018.\"</p><p>Kyle Lui: \"Major U.S. banks have over</p><p>$100 billion of excess capital and a major appetite for technology. Meanwhile, many fintech companies have gained traction and are ripe for acquisition.\"</p><p>Arjun Sethi, co-founder of Tribe Capital: \"We think there will be a continued increase in M&amp;A interest from large finance companies. I think you'll</p><p>see much larger transactions from traditional industry players as well as they evolve and become more tech stack-enabled.\"</p><p>Zachary Aron, principal in the payments and banking consulting practice at Deloitte: \"It's quite possible to see fintechs looking to continue to combine, to both create scale and a deeper and richer set of capabilities.\"</p><p>BIG TECH VS. BIG FINANCE</p><p>While more big tech companies are testing the waters in the finance industry, don't expect to see the emergence of the Bank of Facebook anytime soon.</p><p>Vanessa Colella: \"Alibaba continues to make progress there with its large stake in fintech affiliate Ant Financial. And Google has been deepening their work in Asia with Google Pay, which is experimenting with QR codes for peer- to-peer payments. These players are digging in, and we expect that trend to continue.\"</p><p>Matt Harris: \"I'm skeptical that big tech will be more aggressive in fintech in</p><p>2019 ... privacy concerns will make that hard for many of them. Amazon is the notable exception. Never bet against them!\"</p><p>Kyle Lui: \"Big tech will get into finance, but it will happen slower than people think. Financial services is both slow- moving and highly regulated. It will take time for major tech companies to understand the landscape. Their initial focus will be providing key products for their customer or user base.\"</p><p>PAYMENTS GET FASTER</p><p>Next year, expect banks to speed up customers' experience at checkout lines with contactless cards, which allow consumers to tap the plastic</p><p>at point of sale, rather than inserting a chip or swiping. Our experts also predict that large banks will continue their push into real-time payments in the U.S., letting more clients transfer money instantly.</p><p>Peter Gordon, chief executive officer of the consultancy Payment Relationship Management: \"The large banks want to reclaim the payments and do not want Amazon, Apple, Google and others to displace them. The banks understand that the current payment system infrastructure is broken, like our roads and bridges in the U.S. They'll work to create new rails that are more efficient.\"</p><p>Linda Kirkpatrick, executive vice</p><p>Privacy concerns will make it hard for big-tech to be more aggressive in fintech. Amazon is the notable exception. Never bet against them</p><p>president of merchants and acceptance at Mastercard Inc.: \"We're professing the benefits of contactless payments to our financial institution customer base and our merchants. Getting a market to move is a Herculean effort, but I do think we're there. This is it. This is the inflection point we've been waiting for.\"</p><p>THE FUTURE OF FUNDING</p><p>Fintechs can thank the likes of Soft- Bank Group Corp. for the ample supply of capital, allowing more companies to expand quickly and test new products while remaining private. Most experts said they thought the money would keep flowing, though a turn in the economy could change that dynamic.</p><p>Vanessa Colella: \"2018 was a year for massive funding rounds, and I can see that continuing into next year. There is a lot of capital in the private sector right now \u2013 venture funds have risen up to compete with SoftBank's war chest, so we're seeing more venture capital firms like Sequoia raise several billion dollar vision funds, which I anticipate will only continue to increase in size. Those funds will likely be deployed in the next two to three years, resulting in more fund- ing and big valuation bumps in 2019.\"</p><p>Lindsay Davis: \"In the second half of 2018, the data started to show a bigger pull-back in early-stage fintech deals and funding in the U.S., and that could continue heading into 2019. However,</p><p>there is no shortage of big-pocketed investors like SoftBank actively looking to make fintech investments.\"</p><p>Frank Rotman, founding partner at QED Investors: \"There are a growing number of mega-funds that need to deploy capital in nine-figure chunks so I see the valuation trend continuing for the best businesses in the space. But, if the economy shows any significant signs of slowing, I think the U.S. market in particular will see a modest reduction in availability of capital and rationalization of valuations as VC and PE firms become a bit more cautious in their outlook.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OERDOS-141472067</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OERDOS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSN-7K91-JDJN-619M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399257</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1280\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 United Press &amp; Publishing LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Morgan Chase. It's a Chinese lender \u2014 the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. In fact, five of the top 10 firms on Forbes Global 2000 list, which comprises the 2,000 largest public companies, are Chinese \u2014 mostly old, well-established banks. In recent years, China has seen an explosion of super-valuable tech firms, the most notable being Alibaba Group BABA, 0.18%[1] and Tencent Holdings Ltd.</p><p>TCEHY, 0.36%[2] 700, -0.13%[3] , whose combined market valuation is nearly a trillion dollars. Don't miss: This number provides the most compelling reason to add emerging-market stocks to your portfolio[4]  But lesser known privately held Chinese startups have made waves recently, with rapid growth and global ambitions. Here are five you should know about: \u2022 ByteDance Ltd.  Founded: 2012 Headquarters: Beijing Valuation: $78 billion as of August 2019 Stock listing: Privately held ByteDance is often called the world's most valuable startup. The tech behemoth runs one of China's most-read news aggregators, Toutiao. But its biggest draw of late has been the wildly popular [5]short-video app TikTok (known in China as Douyin), with over a billion active users worldwide. It has been especially popular in the U.S., with one study estimating that one in eight Americans aged 18-24 uses the app \u2014 many of whom don't know it is owned by a Chinese company. ByteDance has recently come under the scrutiny of U.S. regulators, with the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) reviewing the company's purchase of the app Musical.ly and its subsequent merging of the app with TikTok. U.S. senators have repeatedly said the current incarnation of TikTok may pose national-security risks as it allegedly censors content and could exert foreign influence through a far-reaching platform. \u2022 Didi Chuxing Technology Co.  Founded: 2012 Headquarters: Beijing Valuation: $65 billion as of early 2019 Stock listing: Privately held Didi is China's version of Uber. In fact, it acquired Uber's UBER, -2.70%[6] China operations in 2016 after a bitter price war and the expenditure of billions of dollars by the American ride-hailing giant in its failed attempt to win the China market. Though Didi won the war, now controlling nearly 80% of China's ride-hailing market, and counting some of the country's biggest tech companies as investors, its forays into noncore areas such as food delivery and bike sharing have failed. Didi is thought to still be a money-losing operation, after reportedly going $1.6 billion into the red in 2018. Last week it relaunched its Hitch carpool service, nearly one year after closing it when two drivers murdered their female passengers in separate cases. One Beijing-based analyst told MarketWatch that investors are pushing for an IPO, which could happen as early as next year. \u2022 Cainiao Smart Logistics Network  Founded: 2013 Headquarters: Hong Kong Valuation: Recently estimated by Reuters at $28 billion Stock listing: Privately held Alibaba and eight other companies founded Cainiao in 2013 to modernize logistics and delivery in China and abroad. Since the founding, Alibaba has gradually upped its stake in the firm, to a controlling 51% in 2017. Last week, it announced it was investing an additional $3.33 billion in Cainiao, which will give the e-commerce giant a 63% stake. Alibaba's vision for Cainiao has become increasingly ambitious, aiming to ship goods domestically within 24 hours and to harness rapidly improving smart technology to automate and expedite services. Alibaba is deep in the process of creating an entire ecosystem for its business lines \u2014 with Cainiao in logistics, affiliate Alipay in handling digital payments, and investments in a slew of related ventures. Barron's on MarketWatch: Alibaba clarifies Jack Ma remarks on Singles Day[7]  \u2022 Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors Technology Company Ltd. (Xpeng)  Founded: 2014 Headquarters: Guangzhou Valuation: Unconfirmed estimate of $4 billion Stock listing: Privately held Electric-car startup Nio Inc.NIO, -7.89%[8] had initially seemed like Tesla's TSLA, 0.94%[9] biggest roadblock in China. That was until the Chinese company began bleeding cash \u2014 some measurements put its loss at $5 billion \u2014 no small feat in a mere four years of operations. Meanwhile, Xpeng, which had seemed like a distant second among domestic players, announced Wednesday it had secured a new Series C round of funding[10] valued at $400 million. Whereas the U.S. has but a handful of car manufacturers, China has nearly a hundred, many of which have been focusing on the electric-vehicle subsector \u2014 thanks in large part to year of generous government subsidies. But those subsidies are being scrapped, and analysts predict a bloodbath in the country's automobile market. So it came as a rare recent sign of health that Xpeng had secured this latest round of funding. Smartphone and gadget maker Xiaomi Corp. XIACF, -0.91%[11] 1810, 0.47%[12] was one of the leading investors of this round, and the two have agreed to use Xiaomi technology to develop smart-car capabilities. But Xpeng's growth has not come without controversy. Tesla has repeatedly accused Xpeng of stealing trade secrets and intellectual property \u2014 charges Xpeng denies. No date has been given, but Xpeng leaders have expressed interest in a near-term IPO. \u2022 Pinduoduo  Founded: 2015 Headquarters: Shanghai Valuation: $39 billion as of September 2019 Stock listing: Nasdaq Though arguably not a startup if one uses the absence of a public stock listing as a criterion for a company's startup status, e-commerce site Pinduoduo PDD, -0.89%[13] is a mere 4 years old, and has skyrocketed in popularity in China thanks to cutthroat prices and features like group buying and games that keep users coming back to its app. Its 39-year-old founder and CEO, Colin Huang \u2014 who studied in the U.S. and briefly worked for Google GOOGL, 1.00%[14] GOOG, 1.04%[15] \u2014 may be the success story of the past few years. He is now the seventh richest person in China, with a personal wealth of $19 billion, according to the Hurun Research Institute's annual China Rich List.[16] What makes the company's rise more impressive is that China's e-commerce landscape was thought to be so totally dominated by Alibaba and JD.comJD, 0.60%[17] that late entrants to the sector stood no chance. Pinduoduo proved that assumption wrong, blowing past JD.com in daily active users.

He said that companies like Facebook make trade-offs on \"important social values\" such as between free expression and safety, privacy and law enforcement, and between creating open systems and locking down data.

It cites two examples of norms already in place: Global Network Initiative Principles (<url normalizedValue=\"https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/gni-principles/\">https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/gni-principles/</url>) and the European Union Code of Conduct on Countering Illegal Hate Speech Online (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en</url>).

Crossing limits could lead to greater oversight or fines. The White Paper highlights three challenges to this approach: first, companies could define harmful speech more narrowly to reduce compliance burdens, thus making it harder for people to report policy violations; second, they could stop efforts to proactively identify unreported violating content; and third, a response-time based focus could mean that platforms address reports on a first-in-first-out manner, instead of taking the severity of content into account, or proactively searching for harmful content. Note that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">India is looking to impose demands for proactive monitoring and takedown of content in 24 hours</emphasis>, though the rules haven't been finalised yet.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Required to restrict hateful speech beyond what is illegal:</emphasis> Certain kinds of hateful speech require prompt action from the platforms. Thus, Facebook wants regulators to define hateful speech, which might not be illegal, so that companies can take quick action on them without the user or the company having to go through a long legal process to establish its (il)legality. Since harmful content varies across regions, the White Paper suggests that the governments:  <list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Create a practically enforceable standard that can work at scale even with limited context of speech</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Adopt a segmented approach to different kinds of platforms depending on the nature of the service (search engine versus social media) and nature of the audience (private chat versus public post)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Be flexible about regulation so that platforms can evolve policies to keep pace with changes in language trends (such as Voldemorting (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/voldemorting-ultimate-seo-diss-resident-linguist/\">https://www.wired.com/story/voldemorting-ultimate-seo-diss-resident-linguist/</url>)) and efforts to avoid enforcement.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>Facebook looks at external audit of its content moderation systems, hails its Oversight Board</h><p>Zuckerberg's revelation that Facebook is considering external audit of its content moderation systems is significant because recent reports by The Verge (here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa</url>) and here (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona\">https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona</url>)) have shown that content moderation at Facebook, most of which is outsourced to Cognizant, Accenture and Genpact, is a mentally and emotionally taxing task that has even resulted in a death. Content moderators have filed a lawsuit (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-faces-complaints-from-more-content-moderators-in-lawsuit/\">https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-faces-complaints-from-more-content-moderators-in-lawsuit/</url>) against the company, alleging \"psychological trauma and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder\". Facebook isn't alone in failing to protect its content moderators from psychological harm of their job - YouTube and Twitter don't fare well (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/25/social-media-companies-are-outsourcing-their-dirty-work-philippines-generation-workers-is-paying-price/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/25/social-media-companies-are-outsourcing-their-dirty-work-philippines-generation-workers-is-paying-price/</url>) either.</p><p>Lauding its own Oversight Board (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2019/09/223-facebook-content-oversight-board/\">https://www.medianama.com/2019/09/223-facebook-content-oversight-board/</url>), the independent body that Facebook had formed to review its content decisions, Zuckerberg said that such oversight is necessary. The White Paper wants regulation to ensure that internet content moderation systems are consultative, transparent and subject to meaningful independent oversight. Regulation could require companies to:</p><p>* Publish their content standards</p><p>* Allow users to report violating content and responding to such reports with a decision</p><p>* Notify users about content removal</p><p>* Let users appeal (non-)removal of content</p><p>* Give insight into the development of their content standards: It is not specified what this \"insight\" would look like and to whom.</p><p>* Consult with stakeholders when making significant changes to standards: The Paper does not specify who these stakeholders are and if they include (all) users.</p><p>* Get user inputs on content standards: The Paper does not specify how such inputs would be processed, especially given the scale at which Facebook operates.</p><p>* Publish transparency reports on policy enforcement: All major social media companies already publish them. The Paper warns that such reports could lead to companies cutting corners in unmeasured areas to boost performance in measured areas.</p><p>Protecting competition: The White Paper warns against any regulation becoming a barrier to entry for new competitors because of compliance burdens. It should instead adopt a graded approach depending on the size and capacity of the company.</p><p>\"Regulation can have unintended consequences, especially for small businesses that can't do sophisticated data analysis and marketing on their own. Millions of small businesses rely on companies like ours to do this for them.\" - Mark Zuckerberg</p><h>Other issues Zuckerberg raised</h><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Political ads: Zuckerberg claimed that advertising on Facebook is more transparent compared to other media because of Facebook's Ads Library and Transparency Reports. But he left the question of regulating political ads up in the air. This comes a few months after the company doubled down on its position (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2019/10/223-facebooks-continuing-woes-with-regulating-political-ads/\">https://www.medianama.com/2019/10/223-facebooks-continuing-woes-with-regulating-political-ads/</url>) to not moderate any political content - both ads and content from political candidates - even if it violated the site's hate speech rules or other policies, as such content is \"newsworthy\". But in the op-ed, Zuckerberg supported the Honest Ads Act (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1989\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1989</url>) and the Deter Act (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2313\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2313</url>) that seek to \"prevent election interference\". The White Paper does not even mention the conundrum that political ads pose.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Rules for data portability are a must: Zuckerberg called data portability as a necessary good, but left the question of ownership of data open-ended. Facebook's earlier White Paper on data portability (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.medianama.com/2019/09/223-facebook-calls-for-global-standards-on-data-portability-medianamas-take/\">https://www.medianama.com/2019/09/223-facebook-calls-for-global-standards-on-data-portability-medianamas-take/</url>) had raised similar questions about ownership of co-created data, but did not offer any solutions. This time, Zuckerberg categorically called for clear rules on portability, otherwise \"strong privacy laws\" would encourage companies to lock down data to minimise regulatory risks.

The geeks are coming to save the day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The company's NBC Universal division, which is undergoing a huge cost-cutting drive, has completed plans to auction props, costumes and set pieces from its Sci Fi Channel cult favorite Battlestar Galactica.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The entertainment goliath booked a weekend at the Pasadena Convention Center for the event, just in time to kick off the show's second half of its final season on Jan. 16, according to the Hollywood Reporter. A portion of the auction's proceeds will benefit United Way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The auction is shaping up to be one of the largest events ever planned around the conclusion of a TV series, with faithful fans jetting in from around the world for the bidding. BSG collectibles up for sale include spaceship props, the desk used by Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos), and up to a dozen costumes from each major character, including a red dress worn by Caprica-Six (Tricia Helfer).</p><p>\"We are also really excited to be able to offer both fans and collectors this incredible opportunity to own a piece of science fiction television history as the series concludes,\" says NBC Universal Television executive Stacey Ward.</p><p>How nice. Just a little something for the fans. It's not like the studio is desperate for cash after NBC Universal CEO <person><nameText>Jeff Zucker </nameText></person>announced plans last month to cut spending by $500 million next year. That wouldn't have anything to do with it, right?</p><p>Of course, Zucker is just channeling pressure from his boss, GE CEO <person><nameText>Jeffrey Immelt, </nameText></person>who is under increasing pressure to ditch the TV and movie studio after a 22% drop in third-quarter earnings last month.</p><p>Sadly, unloading useless items from hit shows is becoming a regular source of revenue for the studio.</p><p>Maybe they should skip the middleman and produce a new auction reality show. They can call it \"Immelt's Yard Sale.\"</p><p>Dumb-o-meter score: 95 -- Is Battlestar Galactica the one with Luke Skywalker? Somebody call a nerd!</p><h>Charney's Sideshow</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">American Apparel's</emphasis>(APP:NYSE) ringmaster has another legal circus on his hands.</p><p>A former employee filed a wrongful termination suit against the retailer last week, alleging he was fired for refusing requests by renegade CEO Dov Charney to pump up figures on the company's balance sheet.</p><p>Roberto Hernandez, who handled accounts payable for the company, charges that in 2006 Charney \"demanded that Mr. Hernandez pad the inventory\" in an effort to spruce up the company for sale to outside investors.</p><p>American Apparel, a private company at the time of the allegation, went public later that year. (The stock fell 35% to $4.50 Wednesday on news of the suit).</p><p>The normally gregarious Charney refused to comment on the matter, opting instead to deny the allegation in a press release, saying the company would \"vigorously defend itself and its shareholders in this contemptible action.\" Charney claims Hernandez was more involved with low-level data entry than accounting and therefore had no opportunity to cook the books.</p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"408\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">var config = new Array(); config[\"videoId\"] = 2097166001; config[\"playerTag\"] = \"TSCM Embedded Video Player\"; config[\"autoStart\"] = false; config[\"preloadBackColor\"] = \"#FFFFFF\"; config[\"useOverlayMenu\"] = \"false\"; config[\"width\"] = 265; config[\"height\"] = 255; config[\"playerId\"] = 1243645856; createExperience(config, 8);</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Moreover, Charney contends this latest legal assault is just another shot in a long war against the company by Hernandez's lawyer Keith Fink, who represents another ex-American Apparel employee suing Charney for alleged sexual harassment. That particular suit, which Charney also is fighting, alleges he conducted a \"reign of sexual terror\" at the company, parading around the office in his underwear and even taking employees to strip clubs to do market research.</p><p>Charney, who successfully mixed sex with showmanship to grow his chain to 230 locations, blames the media for focusing on \"sideshows\" instead of the company's growth.</p><p>That's a lot of blarney, Charney. This is a freak show that is freaking out your shareholders.</p><p>Dumb-o-meter score: 85 -- For a company that doesn't sell suits, it sure has a lot piling up.</p><h>Fannie Maelstrom</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fannie Mae</emphasis>(FNM:NYSE) continues to live in a house of pain -- and it can't afford the mortgage payments.</p><p>The mortgage finance giant, taken over by federal regulators more than two months ago, posted a $29 billion <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/newsanalysis/financial-services/10447047.html?cm_ven=YAHOO&amp;cm_cat=FREE&amp;cm_ite=NA\">third-quarter loss</url> on Monday due to a massive tax-related charge.</p><p>That's correct -- it lost $29 billion.</p><p>A company with a market cap of less than $700 million and a 65-cent stock price lost $13 a share for the July-September quarter as a result of a $21.4 billion non-cash charge to reduce the value of deferred-tax assets. Deferred-tax assets can emerge from operating losses -- an area Fannie's management knows very well -- and can be used to reduce future tax expenses.</p><p>Even after this quarter's mammoth charge, Fannie Mae says it may have to reduce the value of the remaining $4.6 billion in tax assets it has on its books.</p><p>What difference does it make? Fannie will be spending taxpayer money one way or another.</p><p>The company will likely tap the government's $100 billion lifeline early next year. Fannie Mae's net worth dropped to $9.4 billion at the end of September from $44.1 billion at the end of last year. If that number turns negative, Fannie Mae said it would have to obtain funding from the Treasury Department.</p><p>Fannie Mae said in a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Securities and Exchange Commission</emphasis> filing that it made the accounting change and took the huge charge partly due to \"the uncertainty surrounding our future business model.\"</p><p>So, there is a business model?

Shares of the country's largest automaker sank as low as $2.75 this week.</p><p>\"As we're in the midst of the deepest crisis our industry has ever faced, GM's priority is on seeking support from various U.S. government agencies and congressional leaders,\" LaNeve wrote in a letter to dealers.</p><p>That's funny. We thought GM's top priority should be selling cars people want to buy.</p><p>Chief executives of GM, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ford</emphasis>(F:NYSE) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chrysler</emphasis> skipped the phone calls in favor of face-to-face meetings with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority leader Harry Reid last week to discuss a $50 billion aid package. The executives requested half that sum be delivered immediately as \"emergency capital,\" with the second $25 billion going to a retiree health care trust fund.</p><p>Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.) said on Wednesday his committee will host a hearing to consider an auto-industry bailout next week.</p><p>That is, if he can avoid thousands of phone pitches from all those dealers trying to sell him last year's model.</p><p>Dumb-o-meter score: 70 -- Looks like U.S. taxpayers are going to buy a lemon of a bailout deal.</p><h>Big Tech's Tug Of War</h><p>As if tech companies weren't putting enough people out of work, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IBM's</emphasis>(IBM:NYSE) now letting jealousy keep qualified employees from getting new jobs.</p><p>Mark Papermaster, recently appointed as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple's</emphasis>(AAPL:Nasdaq) iPod and iPhone engineering chief, was <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/10446998/1/apple-ibm-tussle-over-exec-gets-nasty.html\">ordered to stop working</url> by a federal court judge last Friday amid a breach-of-contract dispute with IBM. Big Blue sued Papermaster after he handed in his notice last month, alleging that he breached a noncompete agreement.</p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, Papermaster, who spent 26 years at IBM, cannot work for a competitor for up to a year after his IBM employment ends. Judge Kenneth Karas of New York's Southern District will hear the case on Nov. 18. </p><p>It all comes down to whether Apple and IBM are direct competitors. Simple enough to figure out -- when was the last time you downloaded a song or sent a text message from an IBM device? Case closed.</p><p>That is, in fact, Papermaster's defense. In a court declaration, he said that aside from a few isolated cases, \"I do not recall a single instance of Apple being described as a competitor of IBM during my entire tenure at IBM.\"</p><p>At The Five Dumbest Lab, we accept Papermaster's recollection.</p><p>In fact, we're not sure International Business Machines Corp. really makes that many machines anymore. The company sold its personal computer business to Lenovo in 2005 in order to concentrate on hawking so-called \"systems\" and \"solutions,\" and the \"hardware\" division accounted for only 17% of revenue in the latest quarter.</p><p>IBM should drop the silly suit, lose the \"M\" from its name, and let the guy go to work.</p><p>Dumb-o-meter score: 65 -- On the other hand, Apple doesn't sell apples, does it?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-10447903</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4TXD-CSP0-TXDP-S16K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1503\"/><timeReceived>24:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 TheStreet.com, Inc.

Since then, candidates for president, political officeholders and others have debated the complicated, controversial issue of government involvement in big tech.</p><p>1. Big tech holds a monopoly of power.</p><p>\"Big tech\" like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple were named the five companies that hold a significant monopoly of power across the economy. These tech giants dominate other companies and leave little opportunity for competition and consumer choice. Consumers are provided limited options and are therefore going to use the services of big tech rather than their smaller competitors.</p><p>2. Antitrust laws and policy in the U.S. are outdated.</p><p>The Clayton Antitrust Act, the current policy, is more than 100 years old. Created to address monopolization in the industrial era of U.S. Steel, Standard Oil, and the American Sugar Refining Company, the policy bars companies from acquiring one another to create monopolies and lesson competition. Because the act was not directed toward social technology, it is tough to apply to current social media. An article by Vox analyzed the acquisition of Instagram by Facebook, whether it breached the antitrust act, since Instagram had fewer than a dozen employees and 30 million users at the time.[1]</p><p>3. Big tech can influence politics.</p><p>In 2018, the political data firm Cambridge Analytica was hired to gain access to 50 million Facebook users and their information ranging from their likes todetails about their identities. This information was used to target certain people and audiences through ads. Facebook claimed that no sensitive information or passwords were retrieved by the firm, and all data has since been deleted.[2]</p><p>Ultimate Guide to the 2020 Election</p><p>DOWNLOAD NOW!</p><p>No Labels' Ultimate Guide will help you cut through the noise this election season.</p><p>4. There is some skepticism that big tech firms can police themselves.</p><p>Since the breach by Cambridge Analytica, Facebook has faced questioning by Congress about whether people can use the platform to spread fake news and propaganda. Facebook was part of a consent agreement in 2011 with the Federal Trade Commission to keep the data of users private; whether the agreement was violated is currently under investigation. Privacy laws come into question, and this breach opened the possibility that data may be protected better if the government were involved.[3]</p><p>5. Democrats and Republicans both agree that the tech giants need to be better policed.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (MA) suggests breaking up these big tech companies along with their mergers (like Facebook's purchase of Instagram) because they \"have too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy.\" An unlikely ally, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz (TX) shared her opinion, saying Warren was right, and big tech has too much power to silence our free speech and threaten our democracy.[4]</p><p>[1]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/3/18520703/big-tech-break-up-explained\">https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/3/18520703/big-tech-break-up-explained</url></p><p>[2]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html</url></p><p>[3]Ibid.</p><p>[4]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/03/14/tech-giants-face-new-threats-from-the-government-and-regulators\">https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/03/14/tech-giants-face-new-threats-from-the-government-and-regulators</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122929924</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W42-S871-DYTH-G0X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 14, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Previously, she led operations and strategy at digital wallet startup Blockchain and was a bond trader at JPMorgan. Forbes spoke with her about the past year in fintech and her top predictions for 2020. The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes: </emphasis>For fintech in 2019, what events or milestones stand out as the most important?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Desai Weiss:</emphasis>There were a few big themes. Financial services incumbents took notice of fintech startups, and some parts of the fintech industry matured. There were several mergers and acquisitions around payment processors [like Fiserv acquiring First Data] these companies are coming to terms with Stripe and Square s success in payments. There was also a great reckoning around trading fees. Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Etrade all dropped their trading fees to $0, matching Robinhood and Square. This all counters the notion some held that fintech has a ceiling.\u00a0</p><p>Second, everyone is becoming a bank. Big tech made its presence known, with every tech company trying to be a bank and every bank trying to get into tech. Apple, Google and Facebook all entered financial services, or at least announced their entry. Fintech startups Acorns, Betterment and Dave launched checking accounts. Uber and Lyft are adding banking features. There s huge saturation in banking services.\u00a0</p><p>Third, blockchain made inroads within large enterprises. Fidelity launched a crypto custody service. For Facebook s new digital currency libra, many big companies came to the table, regardless of where they ended the year. JPMorgan created a digital coin [to speed up payments]. Bison Trails, a startup we recently invested in, is helping companies build blockchains. Think about what Amazon Web Services did for cloud computing years ago. Bison Trails is trying to do that for blockchain, so that any app developer or enterprise that wants to create access to a blockchain can do this easily without needing to hire a blockchain team.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes: </emphasis>Regarding the adoption of blockchain technology over the past couple of years, how has that played out compared with your expectations?\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Desai Weiss: </emphasis>You always think these things are going to happen faster than they do. I thought things were going to move more quickly. But I ve realized that they have to move slow and then fast. You need a certain level of regulatory clarity. There needs to be technological stability on the underlying blockchain. We re starting to see that come into place. On regulation, there s still a lot more to be done, but with projects like libra, sovereign digital coins [like China s] and other things, it s going to push the conversation forward such that we ll get more clarity in the next year or two.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes: </emphasis>How would you summarize what happened with blockchain technology in 2019, and what will 2020 be like?\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Desai Weiss: </emphasis>2019 has been a year of building and consolidation. Funding has been harder in the industry, so you ve seen a bunch of companies like Coinbase starting to make acquisitions. That s probably a good thing if there s still a lot of investment needed before we get to mass adoption, it s probably better to be with a well-capitalized player. I think that trend will continue.\u00a0</p><p>My theory is that in the background there has been a lot of building. People are starting to embrace the need for a better user experience for end users. People are starting to build apps that are easier to understand.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes: </emphasis>What predictions do you have for fintech in 2020?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Desai Weiss: </emphasis>First, there has been this great unbundling around everyone offering a bunch of different product lines, and around narrow wedges like payday loans and payment financing. I think we re reaching a point where it will become overwhelming for people. Consumers can t keep up with 10 different applications to manage their money. I think there will be re-bundling. It could be like a  super app,  akin to what you see with Grab or Alipay in Asia, [where the app handles payments and many other functions, like serving as a digital wallet and hailing a taxi]. It could be the return of personal finance management apps. Or it could happen through automation. Some apps can remove some of the headache of financial services, like Tally, which consolidates credit card debt, or Pillar, which focuses on student loans.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Second, in an election year, the student debt crisis will move front and center. There s still a ton of confusion around the best path forward for people who have debt. What is the best way to repay? What if you have multiple loans outstanding? Are you eligible for refinancing?</p><p>We invested in Pillar based on the thesis that student loans are becoming an epidemic of this generation. Hopefully we ll see some evolution in government rules and regulations and in alternatives like income-sharing agreements (ISAs). With ISAs, you don t pay upfront after you graduate and get a job, you pay a set percentage of your income toward the loan. Student loan debt is becoming a bigger issue across voting constituencies, and it will become a bigger part of the conversation. We ve already seen more startups popping up since investing in Pillar.\u00a0</p><p>Third, fintech is becoming saturated. Acquiring customers is getting more expensive, and mindshare is getting harder to come by. We ll see brands that already have mindshare in other ways move into fintech. People you go to for other products and services will use fintech to make their product or service easier. Some people call this<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>embedded finance</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. You re seeing that with Uber and SmileDirectClub doing it for their teeth aligners. The natural way to do this is with features like flexible payments and insurance. Over time, I think it will go broader than that and will come from brands that you love. Brands like Glossier, Fortnite or Nike that have real loyalty with consumers will start to become bigger players because they have this natural entry point. A challenger bank or a new fintech must build that from scratch in an incredibly difficult world of customer acquisition.\u00a0</p><p>If more brands start adding fintech as a feature, all these companies will need infrastructure. I expect more investing dollars will go toward these companies that will help them manage compliance, fraud and other building blocks.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes: </emphasis>What other predictions do you have?\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Desai Weiss:</emphasis>I think companies will continue to move away from FICO and traditional credit scoring for lending to consumers. More and more data sources come online every day, and FICO scoring has become slightly outdated. Today there s more real-time, rich data available on consumers that is probably more correlated with your likelihood to repay but that you couldn t access before. With that you can underwrite better and thus create new companies, but also increase who can access these products, because you can start to underwrite people earlier in their lifecycle of being spenders or of being in the country.\u00a0</p><p>Lastly, one area we re spending time on is tools for baby boomers. Ten thousand people will hit retirement age every day for the next decade. It s a very overlooked population, but they are tech savvy. They are young in many ways, and they re going to need many more tools around retirement, estate planning and family planning. As more of the  HENRY  [high earning, not rich yet] Millennial population gets saturated, entrepreneurs will start to see this as a huge opportunity and move there.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-5e034e63b1bc1a000796cd3b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV7-0XD1-JBCM-F0M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1257\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

While democrats accused the companies of crushing their competitors by misusing data, republicans claimed that the firms displayed an implicit anti-conservative bias.</p><p>\"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable,\" the House Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman and Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline said.</p><p>Democrats accuse Amazon of using seller data to develop its own competing products</p><p>For years, governments across the world have accused prominent technology companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google of choking small businesses and stifling competition, either by acquiring their competitors or obliterating potential threats entirely by making competing products.</p><p>At Wednesday's congressional hearing, all four chief executives were asked about their alleged missteps in approaching competitors. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in particular, faced an onslaught of questions about his companies' alleged use of third-party seller data to develop its own competing products - an allegation first laid out in a report by the Wall Street Journal this year.</p><p>Quite unexpectedly, Bezos admitted that Amazon may have misused seller data to develop its products. This is the first time that an admission of this sort has been made by the company. Previously, representatives of the e-retailer have categorically denied these allegations.</p><p>Responding to a question posed by Democratic Rep Pramila Jayapal of Washington's 7th district, Bezos said, \"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\"</p><p>The company was also criticised for its aggressive approach towards acquiring small companies that it sees as a threat.</p><p>Questions were raised about Amazon's acquisition of diapers.com in 2011. When the online baby product retailer was initially reluctant to sell, Amazon began drastically cutting prices on baby products. Ultimately, diapers.com was forced to shut shop after Amazon managed to capture its market share.</p><p>\"I don't remember that at all,\" Bezos responded.</p><p>Zuckerberg questioned over emails when Facebook acquired Instagram<br/><br/>Mark Zuckerberg came under fire for emails he sent to other Facebook executives in 2012, where he stressed on the need to acquire photo-sharing app Instagram. Zuckerberg claimed the app could become \"very disruptive\" to Facebook in a series of emails, which were later accessed by the House Judiciary Committee as part of their investigation.<br/><br/>In what was then its largest acquisition, Facebook bought Instagram for about $1 billion in cash and stock in April, 2012. The app had around 30 million users at the time. Instagram now has well over 1 billion monthly active users.<br/><br/>Rep Jerry Nadler accused Zuckerberg of violating antitrust laws by acquiring a competitor to neutralise the threat that it posed. During the hearing, he said the emails exchanged by Zuckerberg and his colleagues \"told a very disturbing story\".<br/><br/>\"If this was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction, why shouldn't Instagram now be broken off into a separate company?\" Nadler asked.<br/><br/>Responding to the Democrat's allegations, Zuckerberg claimed he has always maintained that Facebook viewed Instagram as \"both a competitor and as a complement\" to its services. \"At the time, almost no one thought of them as a general social network,\" he added.</p><p>Republicans say tech companies have 'liberal bias'<br/><br/>Ohio Republican Jim Jordan claimed that the big four tech companies were \"out to get conservatives\". He claimed that conservative voices were often censored on online platforms, which allegedly favour liberal thought.<br/><br/>\"Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion, that's not a hunch - that's a fact,\" he said. He cited several instances of alleged censorship during the hearing - among them were, President Donald Trump's Twitch account being suspended over \"hateful conduct\", Google's ad platform threatening to restrict the right-leaning online publication The Federalist, and YouTube taking down videos that contain information, which goes against WHO recommendations.<br/><br/>\"We're 97 days before an election, and the power - as the previous chairman and ranking member have said - the power these companies have to impact what happens during an election, what American citizens get to see before their voting, is pretty darn important,' he said.<br/><br/>Florida Republican Rep. Gregory Steube claimed that campaign emails sent to supporters were often blocked or sent directly to Gmail's spam folder.<br/><br/>\"There's nothing in the algorithm that has anything to do with political ideology,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in response. \"We do get complaints across the aisle.\"</p><p>Google accused of stealing content from small businesses<br/><br/>The House Judiciary Committee's Democratic chairman David Cicilline accused Google of creating a \"walled garden\" and engaging in \"anticompetitive\" practices by stealing content from smaller businesses.<br/><br/>Google was accused of stealing thousands of reviews from Yelp and also closely monitoring web traffic to keep its competitors in check.<br/><br/>Denying the allegations, Pichai said, \"Today, we support 1.4 million small businesses supporting over $385 billion in their core economic activity. We see many businesses thrive, particularly even during the pandemic.\"</p><p>Apple accused of favouring developers on App Store<br/><br/>Apple CEO Tim Cook was questioned about whether some developers were favoured over others on the App Store. Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia asked Cook why the platform took down external parental control apps like OurPact soon after Apple introduced its own service Screen Time.<br/><br/>\"We were concerned, Congresswoman, about the privacy and security of kids,\" Cook said in response. He claimed that the OurPact act was vulnerable to third-party takeovers. \"So we were worried about their safety,\" he added.<br/><br/>Cook claimed that Apple's guidelines for its App Store were \"open and transparent\" and applied \"evenly to everyone\".<br/><br/>According to a tally by the New York Times, Cook was asked the least number of questions during the Congressional hearing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0054012217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-PP21-JB5M-W1BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1231\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

During the five-hour virtual hearing on Capitol Hill, the \u201cemperors of the online economy\u201d \u2014 Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple \u2019s Tim Cook, Facebook \u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Google \u2019s Sundar Pichai \u2014 were accused of allegedly abusing their power by misusing data and stifling competition in their bid to dominate the market.    The hearing in Washington marked the culmination of a year-long investigation by the Congress\u2019 top lawmakers, which raked up millions of documents and hundreds of hours worth of recorded testimony from all four tech giants.    In a rare act of bipartisanship, Democratic and Republican lawmakers were able to find something that they agree on \u2014 they collectively believe that the US\u2019 century-old antitrust laws are in desperate need of an upgrade. While democrats accused the companies of crushing their competitors by misusing data, republicans claimed that the firms displayed an implicit anti-conservative bias.    \u201cThese companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable,\u201d the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Democratic chairman and Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline said.   Here are some highlights from the historic antitrust hearing   Democrats accuse Amazon of using seller data to develop its own competing products    For years, governments across the world have accused prominent technology companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google of choking small businesses and stifling competition, either by acquiring their competitors or obliterating potential threats entirely by making competing products.    At Wednesday\u2019s congressional hearing, all four chief executives were asked about their alleged missteps in approaching competitors. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in particular, faced an onslaught of questions about his companies\u2019 alleged use of third-party seller data to develop its own competing products \u2014 an allegation first laid out in a report by the Wall Street Journal this year.    Quite unexpectedly, Bezos admitted that Amazon may have misused seller data to develop its products. This is the first time that an admission of this sort has been made by the company. Previously, representatives of the e-retailer have categorically denied these allegations.    Responding to a question posed by Democratic Rep Pramila Jayapal of Washington\u2019s 7th district, Bezos said, \u201cWe have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, but I can\u2019t guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\u201d    The company was also criticised for its aggressive approach towards acquiring small companies that it sees as a threat.    Questions were raised about Amazon\u2019s acquisition of diapers.com in 2011. When the online baby product retailer was initially reluctant to sell, Amazon began drastically cutting prices on baby products. Ultimately, diapers.com was forced to shut shop after Amazon managed to capture its market share.    \u201cI don\u2019t remember that at all,\u201d Bezos responded.   Zuckerberg questioned over emails when Facebook acquired Instagram   Mark Zuckerberg came under fire for emails he sent to other Facebook executives in 2012, where he stressed on the need to acquire photo-sharing app Instagram. Zuckerberg claimed the app could become \u201cvery disruptive\u201d to Facebook in a series of emails, which were later accessed by the House Judiciary Committee as part of their investigation.    In what was then its largest acquisition, Facebook bought Instagram for about $1 billion in cash and stock in April, 2012. The app had around 30 million users at the time. Instagram now has well over 1 billion monthly active users.    Rep Jerry Nadler accused Zuckerberg of violating antitrust laws by acquiring a competitor to neutralise the threat that it posed. During the hearing, he said the emails exchanged by Zuckerberg and his colleagues \u201ctold a very disturbing story\u201d.    \u201cIf this was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction, why shouldn\u2019t Instagram now be broken off into a separate company?\u201d Nadler asked.    Responding to the Democrat\u2019s allegations, Zuckerberg claimed he has always maintained that Facebook viewed Instagram as \u201cboth a competitor and as a complement\u201d to its services. \u201cAt the time, almost no one thought of them as a general social network,\u201d he added.   Republicans say tech companies have \u2018liberal bias\u2019   Ohio Republican Jim Jordan claimed that the big four tech companies were \u201cout to get conservatives\u201d. He claimed that conservative voices were often censored on online platforms, which allegedly favour liberal thought.    \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives. That\u2019s not a suspicion, that\u2019s not a hunch \u2014 that\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said. He cited several instances of alleged censorship during the hearing \u2014 among them were, President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitch account being suspended over \u201chateful conduct\u201d, Google\u2019s ad platform threatening to restrict the right-leaning online publication The Federalist, and YouTube taking down videos that contain information, which goes against WHO recommendations.    \u201cWe\u2019re 97 days before an election, and the power \u2013 as the previous chairman and ranking member have said \u2013 the power these companies have to impact what happens during an election, what American citizens get to see before their voting, is pretty darn important,\u2019 he said.    Florida Republican Rep. Gregory Steube claimed that campaign emails sent to supporters were often blocked or sent directly to Gmail\u2019s spam folder.    \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the algorithm that has anything to do with political ideology,\u201d Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in response. \u201cWe do get complaints across the aisle.\u201d   Google accused of stealing content from small businesses   The House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Democratic chairman David Cicilline accused Google of creating a \u201cwalled garden\u201d and engaging in \u201canticompetitive\u201d practices by stealing content from smaller businesses.    Google was accused of stealing thousands of reviews from Yelp and also closely monitoring web traffic to keep its competitors in check.    Denying the allegations, Pichai said, \u201cToday, we support 1.4 million small businesses supporting over $385 billion in their core economic activity. We see many businesses thrive, particularly even during the pandemic .\u201d   Apple accused of favouring developers on App Store   Apple CEO Tim Cook was questioned about whether some developers were favoured over others on the App Store. Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia asked Cook why the platform took down external parental control apps like OurPact soon after Apple introduced its own service Screen Time.    \u201cWe were concerned, Congresswoman, about the privacy and security of kids,\u201d Cook said in response. He claimed that the OurPact act was vulnerable to third-party takeovers. \u201cSo we were worried about their safety,\u201d he added.    Cook claimed that Apple\u2019s guidelines for its App Store were \u201copen and transparent\u201d and applied \u201cevenly to everyone\u201d.    According to a tally by the New York Times, Cook was asked the least number of questions during the Congressional hearing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42722702392</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GD-YNX1-F07F-80H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1275\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>BER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>DUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>MUN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>NYS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Here are five key moments from the hearing.  1. Mark Zuckerberg's emails revealed  Did Facebook buy Instagram in 2012 to neutralise a threat? That was the topic raised by Democratic representative Jerry Nadler.   Emails between Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and his chief financial officer David Ebersman were revealed as part of the hearing.   In one, Mr Zuckerberg said: \"These businesses are nascent but the networks established, the brands are already meaningful, and if they grow to a large scale they could be very disruptive to us... I'm curious if we should consider going after one or two of them.\"   Mr Ebersman asked if Mr Zuckerberg hoped to \"neutralise a potential competitor\".   Mr Zuckerberg replied it was a combination of that and hoping to improve Facebook's services.      In a follow-up email, he added: \"I didn't mean to imply we'd be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way\".   The slide presenting this email to Congress was titled \"Whoops!\", tech news site the Verge reported .   At Wednesday's hearing, Mr Zuckerberg said several international regulators - including the US Federal Trade Commission - had investigated the takeover at the time, and had decided not to block it.   In another email, he had said it would be a while before Facebook could afford to buy Google. At the hearing, Mr Zuckerberg said the comment was a joke.  2. Apple defends its 30% app cut  Democratic congressman Henry Johnson raised concerns about Apple's App Store, suggesting its rules were sometimes \"changed to benefit Apple at the expense of [third-party] developers\" and also discriminated between different creators.   \"Sir, we treat every developer the same,\" Apple chief executive Tim Cook responded.   \"We have open and transparent rules... we do look at every app before it goes on. But those apps, those rules apply evenly to everyone.\"   But emails between Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue and Amazon's Jeff Bezos showed that Apple agreed to halve its App Store commission to 15% to get Amazon's Prime Video onto its platform.   In April 2020, Apple introduced a scheme that let video-streaming platforms avoid the 30% fee if they integrated with other Apple products, as news site Bloomberg reported . Amazon is part of this deal.      In another email, sent a decade ago, Mr Cue suggested Apple could take a 40% cut rather than 30%.   \"In the App Store's more than 10-year history, we have never raised the commission or added a single fee. In fact, we've reduced it for subscriptions and exempted additional categories of apps,\" Mr Cook told the hearing.  3. Republicans accuse the tech giants of bias  Several Republicans made allegations of anti-conservative bias on social media.   Republican congressman Jim Sensenbrenner asked Mark Zuckerberg why Twitter had removed a post by the US president's son , Donald Trump Jr, discussing the efficacy of the drug hydroxychloroquine.   Twitter is not owned by Facebook.   \"I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter, so it's hard for me to speak to that,\" said Mr Zuckerberg.   However, he added that Facebook did remove posts that could be directly harmful to people.   Republican congressman Jim Jordan suggested Google might tailor its features to aid Joe Biden's presidential campaign.   \"Can you assure us you are not going to silence conservatives and... you're not going to configure your features [to favour] Joe Biden?\" asked Mr Jordan.   \"You have my commitment. It's always been true and we'll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way,\" replied Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai.   Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon suggested Mr Jordan had been pushing \"fringe conspiracy theories\".   Mr Jordan reacted with fury, saying: \"We have the email - there were no fringe conspiracies.\"   Later, Republican representative Greg Steube was teased online for asking Mr Pichai why his campaign emails were being marked as spam in Gmail.  4. Amazon dodges a 'simple' yes-or-no question  Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal asked Jeff Bezos for a \"yes or no\" answer: Did Amazon ever use seller data to make its own business decisions?   This was a reference to reports that Amazon has used data gathered from businesses selling products via its site to design and price its own rival first-party goods - something the firm has previously suggested had been limited to a group of rogue employees.   Mr Bezos responded that he couldn't give an answer in such simple terms.   \"What I can tell you is we have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private-label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated,\" he said.   Mr Bezos was not asked any questions for the first hour of the hearing, and was seen on the video call eating a snack.  5. Google accused of working with China  Republican congressman Matt Gaetz claimed that Google collaborates with Chinese universities that take \"millions upon millions of dollars from the Chinese military\" and noted that tech investor Peter Thiel had previously accused the company of \"treason\".   Sundar Pichai denied that his employees were acting against American interests.   \"We are not working with the Chinese military, it's absolutely false,\" he said.   \"What we do in China, compared to our peers, it's very very limited in nature. Our AI work in China is limited to a handful of people working on open-source projects.\"   The four bosses were also asked a yes-or-no question by Republican Greg Steube: \"Do you believe the Chinese government is stealing technology from US companies?\"   Only Mark Zuckerberg was prepared to say that China did steal US technology.   Tim Cook said: \"I don't know of specific cases where we have been stolen from by the government.\"   Sundar Pichai responded: \"I have no first-hand knowledge of any information stolen from Google in this regard.\"   Mark Zuckerberg said: \"I think it's well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from US companies.\"   Jeff Bezos responded: \"I haven't seen that personally but I've heard many reports of it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42721054745</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-FV21-F07F-842C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1118\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>BBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

On almost every front, 2019 has been a tumultuous year for the Indian republic. In the political sphere, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government- which returned with a bigger mandate than before-has been able to pursue its long-held sociocultural agenda even in the face of stiff opposition. On the economic front, the government has struggled to stem a slump that has hurt farmers and the poor the hardest. Even the weather saw extremes of both droughts and floods amid growing concerns about the climate change crisis. We highlight five key trends that have important implications for India's future.The year of the slowdown</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2019, economic activity slowed across the world. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy will grow by 3% in 2019, the slowest growth rate since the 2008 crisis. And at the heart of this slowdown is a slump in global trade. Trade volumes have been slowing since 2008 but the slowdown intensified sharply over the past two years, thanks to the actions of the Donald Trump-led US administration.</p><p>The slowdown in India may have been exacerbated because of the global slowdown, but it has home-grown roots. It is not just exports which are lacklustre. Consumption is falling, government finances are strained and investments remain stubbornly low. This lack of investments, especially private investments, is the most worrying since it portends slower growth and slower job creation in the future.</p><p>BJP cements national position</p><p>Ten years ago, in 2009, the BJP had won just 116 seats in the Lok Sabha and ended up with just 19% of the vote share. In the decade since, the party has risen spectacularly under Narendra Modi and cemented pole position in Indian politics, with a resounding victory in the 2019 general election.</p><p>But even as the party expands its national footprint its state presence could be receding. In November 2018, the BJP, either on its own or through an alliance, was in power in 20 states. But because of losses at the end of 2018 and more recently in Maharashtra, that figure has fallen to 17 (and could go down to 16 states following the Jharkhand verdict) (Chart 2a/2b).</p><p>Climate crisis hits home</p><p>\"People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing... And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!\"</p><p>Greta Thunberg's impassioned speech at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in September reflects a growing collective concern for climate change across the world. One measure of this comes from Google Trends, which captures search interest in different topics. Search interest in climate change across the world has gradually increased over the last five years but peaked around Thunberg's appearance at the Climate Action Summit and worldwide protests around the time. In India, climate change manifested itself in another year of extreme weather, with droughts parching parts of the country even as floods devastated others. Taking a long view, temperatures in this decade are set to be the hottest ever in the country's history.</p><p>Millennials come of age</p><p>On the internet, \"OK boomer\" emerged as one of the year's most popular catchphrases and memes. Coined by millennials, the phrase was a riposte to criticism from older generations. In India, one such criticism came when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman suggested that millennials' preference for Uber and Ola could be behind the auto industry's struggles. Interest in millennial identity surged this year, in India, and across the world.</p><p>Though exact definitions vary, millennials broadly refer to the generation who attained adulthood in the early 21st century and grew up when the world became digitally connected. Millennials now account for 24% of the world's population (considering a definition of those born between 1981 and 1996), according to UN population projections. And within this, India accounts for the most millennials ( 19% of global millennials).</p><p>Big tech battles hit India</p><p>Even as they faced pushback from regulators, Big Tech continued to consolidate its hold over the global economy, and over our lives. In 2019, technology giants Google (Alphabet), Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon were five of the six biggest firms in the world by market capitalization, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers' report on the world's 100 biggest companies. In the race for tech supremacy, India has emerged as a key battleground. Amazon is taking on Flipkart in e-commerce, while Uber and Ola are fighting for ride-hailing supremacy. But nowhere is the battle more intense than in the web streaming industry.</p><p>Thanks to affordable mobile services, video consumption has been growing fast, making the country a key battlefield for streaming services. Amazon Prime's global battle with Netflix for the web streaming space, then, could depend on how well both perform in India. Data from Google Trends, though, suggests that both still have a long way to go to catch up with Hotstar, the web streaming king in India.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Mayo;Mark Whitener</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 \"criminalized monopoly,\" writes the Open Markets Institute in a primer on \"monopoly basics.\" A Motley Fool article asserts the common misperception that \"pure monopolies are illegal.\" Yet the antitrust laws do not outlaw the possession of a monopoly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's because antitrust recognizes that the potential for economic rewards is what incentivizes investment and risk-taking. The resulting competition for marketplace supremacy can be fierce, and weaker firms often fail along the way. Those left standing should not be punished for their success - even if only one survives. As the Supreme Court said more than 50 years ago, monopolies should be targets of antitrust enforcement only when there is \"the willful acquisition or maintenance of [monopoly] power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.\" Antitrust doesn't condemn a firm for developing a universally popular search engine, ketchup or pharmaceutical drug, even if that success leads to market dominance. It's how a monopoly is obtained or preserved that matters - not its mere existence.</p><p>Much rhetoric around antitrust law takes for granted that it's about protecting the small guys. \"Amazon crushes small companies by copying the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own branded version,\" according to Warren's antitrust plan. </p><p>Indeed, small competitors are often the most vocal advocates for using antitrust to restrain their large, powerful rivals - as when local taxi companies unsuccessfully tried to block Uber's entry into Philadelphia, even though Uber increased competition and lowered prices for consumers. </p><p>But the antitrust laws were enacted to protect competition, not competitors. As the Supreme Court has said, their purpose \"is not to protect businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market.\" Consumers are the main beneficiaries of competition, and antitrust is intended to protect them from business conduct that damages such competition.\u00a0Knowing this, enforcers and courts tend to take competitors' complaints about their rivals' behavior with a grain of salt and focus on the impact on consumers. </p><p>Axios recently remarked on the \"bipartisan consensus . . . that antitrust law is antiquated, written for an analog world of railroad and tobacco giants.\" In the same spirit, Rep. David N. Cicilline (D.-R.I.) has said the antitrust laws were mainly created \"during the railroad monopolies and in the time of the oil barons. It's a different economy now.\"</p><p>It's certainly true that many of the companies - and whole industries - drawing antitrust attention today didn't exist when the first antitrust law, the Sherman Act, was passed. Does this mean antitrust doctrine can't be effectively applied to 21st-century technologies and business models, including high-tech services (such as Internet search) that are nominally free?</p><p>\u00a0In truth, the antitrust laws are no more \"outdated\" than the (much older) U.S. Constitution: Both employ an economy of language and establish broad principles that can be adapted to specific cases. In traditional industries like retail, antitrust analysis has long had to evolve to deal with shifting forms of competition, from local grocers to big-box stores to, now, online retailing. In the 1990s, there were concerns that the tech behemoth of the times (Microsoft) and its complex new products (browsers, operating systems) were beyond antitrust's comprehension. Yet the Justice Department prosecuted a successful case challenging Microsoft's unlawful actions to exclude competition and preserve its monopoly position. </p><p>Antitrust enforcers have a track record of challenging mergers and other practices involving new-economy issues, such as competition among digital platforms - as when the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the merger of fantasy-sports platforms DraftKings and FanDuel. Enforcers and courts will continue to grapple with precisely how to apply antitrust to new aspects of the tech economy, but they have shown that antitrust has the tools to remain relevant.</p><p>A narrative has emerged that U.S. antitrust enforcers have gone soft. The Economist has called antitrust authorities \"unforgivably lax.\" A report from the Roosevelt Institute recently included \"lax competition policy\" among the factors that were \"entrenching the intrinsic advantages of wealth and power in society.\" This story line has been used to support calls for more aggressive enforcement and the passage of new, tougher antitrust legislation.</p><p>Whether the American economy has become less competitive over time is a complex issue that economists continue to study. But whether merger enforcement has become increasingly slack is a more easily answerable empirical question. A study one of us co-conducted, drawing on government enforcement data from 1979 through 2017, found that regulators have become more likely to challenge proposed mergers over time. Indeed, controlling for the number of merger proposals submitted to the agencies, the likelihood of a merger challenge has more than doubled over this period. </p><p>Advocates for more aggressive merger enforcement may point to particular mergers that they believe should have been challenged (such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram), and the FTC recently announced that it is looking back at past tech deals to see if any problematic ones escaped notice. But the data does not support the idea that antitrust merger enforcement has declined.</p><p>Some critics of Big Tech, including Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), say that issues such as privacy lapses on large tech platforms ought to attract the attention of antitrust enforcers: \"One of the reasons data privacy concerns are so pressing is because these companies are monopoly size,\" Hawley has said. Mississippi's attorney general has said that law enforcement officials' \"focus is going to be on antitrust and privacy. That's where our laws are.\" Many people have concerns about privacy, data security and the veracity of online content, among other issues. Don't such worries, along with the size and power of these firms, make antitrust an obvious solution? </p><p>The link between alleged anticompetitive behavior and other questionable actions by platforms is far from clear, however. Antitrust is narrowly tailored - as the Supreme Court has reaffirmed in decisions reflecting consensus across the court's ideological spectrum - to protect consumers from business conduct that harms the competitive process itself. The question courts will ask, therefore, is whether dubious behavior by companies results from diminished market rivalry - or rather, perhaps, from firms' independently following business models that tend to lead to controversial practices. They will probe whether lapses in privacy and data security stem from reduced competition, or whether they might exist even if there were three search behemoths, a couple of Facebook clones and several Amazon rivals. (Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) </p><p>Depending on how such questions are answered, antitrust may have a role to play. But other regulatory and legislative approaches may be more suitable.\u00a0If you want to protect privacy, in other words, it may be more effective to regulate it directly than to stretch antitrust law.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mayoj@georgetown.edu\">mayoj@georgetown.edu</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mw1115@georgetown.edu\">mw1115@georgetown.edu</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-d07813fa6ac511eaabef020f086a3fab</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YG6-20W1-DXKP-J3Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1246\"/><timeReceived>4:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 20, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Republican and Democratic congressional leaders have pledged to take action on privacy this year; a number of legislative proposals have already been introduced and others are under development, and this is one of the few legislative areas where bipartisan agreement is possible. While the debate is still in its early stages, its potential implications are significant \u2014 namely, the creation of a new federal privacy regime that would be the American answer to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') and potentially head off state-by-state regulatory efforts like the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ('CCPA')[1]. This is a development that should be on the radar screen of every organization that handles personal information. The integrated team of privacy and public policy professionals at K...ates has developed the following five questions to begin your analysis of the legislative debate and start planning the next steps as it moves forward. </p><p>More likely than not, privacy is a central concern for your organization, and it will be essential to monitor the action in Congress and engage with policymakers as needed to protect and advance your interests. We can help. 1. Does this impact me? The big-tech giants have received most of the media attention so far, but the reality is that a federal privacy law would create new obligations for every organization that collects, uses, processes, stores, or shares personal information. This is an effort of a similar scale and scope as the GDPR and the CCPA. If your organization's activities potentially are covered by either regime, it is likely that the legislation Congress is considering will be relevant too. The bottom line is that the implications of the federal privacy debate cut across industries and sectors. 2. What could this mean for my organization? It is too early to say what the final privacy legislation will look like, but it is safe to assume that it will entail new obligations for organizations and potentially create new legal exposure and enforcement risk. Some of the key issues under discussion include the following: New Individual Rights and Disclosures: Policymakers have proposed significant new compliance obligations for organizations. They are expected to require organizations to disclose how they collect, use, process, share, and store personal information and give individuals greater control over their information. New requirements or standards in these areas are expected to emerge, particularly with respect to sensitive personal information and social media. Opt-in vs. Opt-out: A central issue policymakers are considering is whether the United States should follow the GDPR approach of requiring users to affirmatively 'opt-in' to data collection, sharing, and use \u2014 not only for sensitive information but beyond. The resolution of this issue could create the need for significant reengineering of Web services and architecture, as well as other compliance changes. Strengthened Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') Authority: Although the FTC is the federal government's top privacy watchdog, it lacks the authority to promulgate data privacy regulations (leaving the agency to inefficient ex post 'regulation' through enforcement actions), has no jurisdiction over nonprofit organizations and common carriers (like wireless companies), and can only impose civil penalties in limited circumstances. The agency's staff headcount and budget have also not kept pace with the scope of its authority as the digital economy has grown. Federal legislation is expected to grant the agency rulemaking authority, expand its jurisdiction and authority to impose fines, and give it additional resources to pursue its mission. Other Enforcement: In addition to expanding the FTC's ability to impose civil penalties, some policymakers want to give the agency's enforcement authority even more 'teeth.' Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), for one, has proposed prison terms of up to 20 years or significant fines \u2014 as much as $5,000,000 \u2014 for executives of organizations that violate privacy protections, as well as more significant penalties at the corporate level. Further, while virtually all agree that the FTC should be the lead federal enforcement agency, some also support giving state attorneys general authority to enforce the federal law and providing for private rights of action. Preemption: The urgency of the current debate in Congress is partially a response to last year's passage of the CCPA, which imposes significant new privacy obligations starting in 2020 and is prompting action by other states that could produce an unwieldy 'patchwork quilt' of inconsistent requirements. Policymakers in Congress are grappling with the extent to which federal law should take precedence over state statutes like the CCPA, as well as existing federal privacy statutes that apply to specific industries. 3. Is anything really going to happen? There is understandable pessimism about the prospects for sweeping legislation under a divided Congress, but the data breaches, unauthorized sharing, and other privacy violations that have dominated headlines for the past few years have led to a high level of public interest and engagement on the issue. In addition, the CCPA's looming 2020 effective date \u2014 and the potential for similar initiatives in other states \u2014 has united much of the business community around the need for federal legislation. These trends have made privacy legislation a top priority for House and Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle, as well as the Trump administration. As noted above, policymakers are pressing ahead with plans to hold hearings, draft legislation, and move a bill as early as this summer. Of course, the devil is always in the details, and there is a possibility that these legislative efforts could fall short. Although there is broad interest in privacy legislation among stakeholders and policymakers, there are important differences of opinion about its specifics that could be difficult to reconcile. However, even if the proposals under debate do not make their way into law this year, they will still set a marker for future initiatives \u2014 underscoring the importance of the present legislative debate. 4. How does this affect my existing compliance program? With GDPR implementation in the rearview mirror, many organizations are looking toward the CCPA as the next major regulatory milestone. The privacy debate in Congress adds uncertainty to this timeline and could complicate compliance strategies going forward. Federal legislation could preempt the California law entirely, introduce new or additional requirements on top of it and other federal laws, open the door to future rulemaking activities, and prompt responsive action by other jurisdictions \u2014 including U.S. states as well as foreign governments. In view of this, consider the need to monitor developments closely so they do not come as a surprise and can be factored into compliance plans sooner rather than later. In addition, early engagement in the process offers a way to advance priorities and address specific problems before legislation is baked into law. 5. What should I be doing to prepare? Preparing for changes in the U.S. privacy landscape starts with understanding your organization's exposure to personal information and following the various policy proposals under consideration to develop a clear sense of their potential implications for your business and regulatory compliance strategies. Undertaking this evaluation sooner rather than later preserves the option to engage in the legislative debate to shape the final outcome in a way that advances and protects your interests.

In fact, in the two years ending June 30, 2020, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, and Google accounted for 56% of the return in the S&amp;#38;P 500.1 However, fewer investors think of health care as a sector with similar potential to generate growth.Health care presents the opportunity to invest in companies that are constantly innovating to improve quality of life and raise productivity. It is hard to put a value on vaccines, cancer drugs, joint replacements, and pacemakers. At the same time, health care names do not dominate the market like big tech. </p><p>Johnson and Johnson (1.46%) and United Healthcare (1.07%) are the two largest health care firms in the S&amp;#38;P 500, but at a combined 2.53% they have less influence than Alphabet. (By way of comparison, Alphabet's A and C shares account for 3.36% of the S&amp;#38;P 500.)Despite its underrepresentation in the S&amp;#38;P 500 relative to technology, I believe health care continues to offer investors valuable long-term opportunity potential. Here are five reasons why.The potential for strong earnings growth. In the five years through March 31, 2020, profit growth in the S&amp;#38;P 1500 health care sector rose at a compounded annual rate of 8.1%. This pace of earnings growth was nearly 3.5x faster than that of the entire S&amp;#38;P 1500 (2.4%), and the third-fastest sector growth rate behind information technology (9.9%) and financials (8.6%).2Looking at growth potential from another angle, prescription drug spending rose at a 9.1% annualized rate between 2000 and 2018, underscoring the underlying demand for health care.Health care is a play on demographics and an aging population.Since 2000, the US population over 65 years of age has grown 62%, which equates to a 2.5% annualized compounded rate.Over the next 10 years, the US Census Bureau projects the population over 65 rising another 30%, which equals a 2.6% annualized compounded rate.3Older populations are likely to spend more on health care as their bodies mature, and medical care is needed to maintain their well-being.The pandemic sheds light on the importance of health care to national security.COVID-19 highlights the potential of a virus to shut down economic activity, potentially contribute to social instability, and hinder national defense; after all, it's hard to fight a war if the troops are sick. As a result, government policy is more likely to be friendly toward health care companies that have the resources and know how to innovate and combat the health care issues which threaten society. There is plenty of risk of policy change with an election around the corner, but it will be hard (or at least harder) for politicians to demonize and over-regulate companies that are contributing to national security, while working to solve the health care problems of the day.Medtech offers the ability to blend technology with health care and drive future growth.Medtech has opened a new opportunity for health care beyond the traditional pharmacy, insurance, facility, and device industries present in the health care sector. Medtech improves the delivery and usage of health care products and services using concepts like artificial intelligence, digitization, robotics, monitoring devices, and 3D printing. It provides a new frontier for the health care sector and investors.Health care earnings have the potential to hold up in economic downturns, while displaying less volatility.The S&amp;#38;P 500 health care sector has demonstrated earnings growth during periods where earnings for the S&amp;#38;P 500 have contracted. The following table displays the cyclical contraction in 12-month trailing earnings per share (EPS) for the S&amp;#38;P 500 and S&amp;#38;P 500 Health Care Index. 12-month trailing EPS for the S&amp;#38;P 500 declined by an average of 27.1% during the three pre-pandemic earnings recessions.In contrast, S&amp;#38;P 500 Health Care Index earnings rose by an average of 14.2% during the same time periods.The current earnings recession is ongoing, but data shows a similar pattern. \ufeff Bloomberg, L.P. as of July 27, 2020. Investors cannot invest in an index. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results An option for harvesting growth.Investors looking to capture trends in the health care sector may want to examine the Invesco DWA Healthcare Momentum ETF (PTH). PTH uses relative strength to select the stocks demonstrating the strongest performance in the health care industry. Relative strength is the measurement of a security's performance in a given universe over time as compared to the performance of all other securities in that universe. PTH is based on the Dorsey WrightHealthcare Technical Leaders Indexand can select stocks from across the market cap spectrum (small-, mid-, and large-cap), and rebalances and reconstitutes quarterly. The holdings are weighted by momentum so the stocks demonstrating the greatest strength receive the highest weight. A momentum-driven strategy has the potential to capture stocks which are demonstrating emerging strength and eliminate stocks that are showing relative weakness. PTH uses an objective non-emotional process and uses price, not fundamentals, in the selection process.Footnotes1 Source: Bloomberg, L.P. as of July 30, 20202 Source: S&amp;#38;P as of March 31, 20203 Source: US Census BureauAll data via Bloomberg, L.P. as of July 27, 2020 unless otherwise noted.Important informationBlog header image: Victor Torres / StocksyBefore investing, investors should carefully read the prospectus/summary prospectus and carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

These five companies waged an 18-month Freedom of Information battle with the Mercury News, convincing federal regulators who collect the data that its release would cause \"commercial harm\" by potentially revealing the companies' business strategy to competitors. A sixth company, Hewlett-Packard, fought the release and lost.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But many of their industry peers see the issue differently. The Mercury News initially set out to obtain race and gender data on the valley's 15 largest companies, and nine   including Intel, Cisco Systems, eBay, AMD, Sanmina and Sun Microsystems   agreed to allow the U.S. Department of Labor to provide it.</p><p>\"There's nothing to hide, in our view,\" said Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, which contacted the Mercury News to share its employment data after learning of the newspaper's federal FOIA request filed in early 2008. \"We just felt that we're very proud of the (diversity) programs we have in place and the efforts we put forth, and we don't have any trouble sharing it.\"</p><p>Experts in the area of equal employment law scoffed at the idea that public disclosure of race and gender data   for example, the number of black men or Asian women in job categories such as \"professionals,\" \"officials &amp; managers\" and \"service workers\"   could really allow competitors to discern a big tech company's business strategy. A bigger issue, they said, is the social cost of allowing large, influential corporations to hide their race and gender data.</p><p>\"One of the main ways that we track how society is doing in terms of race relations, in terms of eliminating discrimination, in terms of promoting diversity, is by looking at statistics,\" said Richard Ford, a Stanford University law professor who is an expert in civil rights and anti-discrimination law. \"But if we can't get the data, we can't know if it's a problem or not.\"</p><p>John Sims, a law professor at the University of the Pacific and an expert in FOIA law, called the objections of Google, Apple and other companies \"absurd.\"</p><p>\"The whole debate on affirmative action is based on the question, 'Is racial discrimination a thing of the past, or is it still going on?' \" Sims said. \"These companies are very interesting to look at, because they are new and they are not just in the rut of what they were doing 50 years ago, because they didn't exist 50 years ago.\"</p><p>The Labor Department data ultimately obtained by the Mercury News shows that while the collective work force of 10 of the valley's largest companies grew by 16 percent from 1999 to 2005, an already small population of black workers dropped by 16 percent, while the number of Hispanic workers declined by 11 percent. By 2005, only about 2,200 of the 30,000 Silicon Valley-based workers at those 10 companies were black or Hispanic.</p><p>In addition, among the roughly 5,900 managers at those companies in 2005, about 300 were either black or Hispanic   a 20 percent dip from five years earlier. Women slipped to 26 percent of managers in 2005, from 28 percent in 2000.</p><p>Companies such as Googleand Apple are particularly crucial to study, Ford said, because many of the nation's civil rights laws were written in the 1960s for a different workplace than the information-driven jobs of today.</p><p>The Mercury News initially asked the Labor Department to release so-called EEO-1 race and gender data for the 15 largest companies ranked by sales in the newspaper's SV150 Index.</p><p>Following an appeal lodged by the Mercury News against the six companies that objected, the Labor Department released Hewlett-Packard's data after the company failed, government lawyers said, to provide a detailed objection \"when we requested its views.\"</p><p>But the Labor Department accepted arguments filed by lawyers for Google, Apple, Yahoo, Oracle and Applied Materials that release of the information would cause commercial harm.

A day after the heads of Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook came under aggressive questioning from members of Congress as part of an investigation looking into their market size and power, all four posted strong earnings in the second quarter of 2020, even as the U.S. economy recorded one of its worst periods on record.   Each company beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations, posting earnings growth that separated it from many industries harmed by the coronavirus pandemic and illustrating just how dominant their positions are in the greater economy.   Here are five takeaways from the earnings:   $250 billion added to market value   The four companies reported a combined $205 billion in revenue and $28 billion in profits in the second quarter. The earnings helped their combined market value jump by $250 billion, according to Bloomberg News .   Apple reported $59.7 billion in net sales, marking a 17 percent bump in year over year growth in what was its third fiscal quarter of the year. Facebook reported $18.7 billion in revenue, a 11 percent increase from the same time period in 2019. Amazon experienced the most seismic growth, reporting $88.9 billion in net sales, which amounted to a 40 percent year over year increase.   Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported $38.3 billion in revenue, representing the first time since it went public that it experienced a dip in earnings. Alphabet revenue declined by 2 percent compared to the same period in 2019. Still, the figure surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations, which predicted significant drops in advertising spending due to the health crisis.   The strong three-month performances appeared to signal how integral the services and products the four countries are to a public \u2014 including during a pandemic that has kept many people at home more.   Profits jump for Amazon despite COVID-19 investments   Amazon's net income doubled to $5.2 billion between April and June, despite the company making a number of large investments associated with the coronavirus.   CEO Jeff Bezos in April warned analysts that a number of coronavirus-related expenses could hurt its overall profits in the months ahead. The company hired an additional 170,000 people to work in warehouses and had put money towards personal protective equipment for its employees and the increased cleaning of facilities. In total, Bezos said Thursday that the company spent $4 billion on coronavirus-related safety measures.   Yet those costs didn\u2019t hurt the business\u2019s bottom line. Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, earned $10.9 billion in the second quarter, a 29 percent year over year increase. The company also noted that its online grocery sales tripled.   More than 3 billion using Facebook   Amid the global pandemic, Facebook has experienced a marked increase in the use of its apps, which include Instagram and WhatsApp.   The company said that an average of 3.1 billion people around the world were using a Facebook-owned app in June, marking a 14 percent year over year increase.   Daily active users of Facebook ballooned to 1.8 billion, an increase of 12 percent from the same period in 2019. Facebook executives associated the surge with lockdown measures that confined people to their homes, though warned that the rate of user growth was stabilizing due to the relaxing of health restrictions in parts of the world.   The higher engagement helped the company counterbalance a drop in its advertising revenue growth rate, which it acknowledged was due to factors including the coronavirus and the \"Stop Hate For Profit\" campaign demanding businesses boycott the platform.   As for Apple, sales of Mac computers and the iPad also surged as people were forced to work from home and interact with friends and family virtually. A surge in online sales offset the forced closure of many of Apple's retail stores.    \u201cIn uncertain times, this performance is a testament to the important role our products play in our customers\u2019 lives and to Apple\u2019s relentless innovation,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.    Facebook ad boycott makes little financial impact   While more than 1,000 companies pulled their advertising on Facebook as part of a campaign demanding better content moderation policies, the company appeared to fend off any significant financial harm from it.   Facebook said that its ad revenue grew at an 10 percent rate between April and June and that the pace remained roughly the same in the first three weeks of July.   Facebook executives addressed the boycott during an earnings call, stressing that the platform does not make a profit off of hate speech. But Zuckerberg suggested that the efforts seemed to \u201cwrongly assume that our business is dependent on a few large advertisers.\u201d   \u201cWhile we value every single one of the businesses that use our platforms, the biggest part of our business is serving small businesses,\u201d Zuckerberg said.    The \"Stop Hate For Profit\" campaign called on advertisers to commit to boycotting the platform throughout July. Now that the month has passed, some businesses have indicated that they would begin advertising on the platform again  Other companies , including Coca-Cola and Ben Jerry\u2019s, have said that they will continue to take part in the campaign.   Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, one of the groups leading the ad boycott, said that Facebook's healthy earnings shouldn't come as a shock.   \"Facebook's market dominance means they don't need to be accountable to users or advertisers,\" he said in a tweet . \"Until Congress acts to limit Facebook's power, there will be no limit to the damage Facebook wreaks on our democracy.\"   Earnings could intensify scrutiny   Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged during a call with analysts that scrutiny from regulators isn't going away anytime soon.    \"I think the scrutiny is going to be here for a while. And so we are committed to working through it,\" Pichai said, adding that the company has faced this type of attention from regulators for some time now.    For some, the earnings from Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook seemed to bolster the case that the tech giants are too big and that Congress should confront their enormous size.    Barry Lynn of The Open   Markets   Institute, a liberal think tank championing calls for strong antitrust action, said in a statement  that the numbers reinforced that the companies \"are based on dangerous predatory actions and must be fundamentally altered.\"   In their testimonies, Zuckerberg, Bezos, Pichai and Cook argued that competition is thriving in their industries and that the services they offer is providing valuable assistance to smaller businesses.   Bezos argued that Amazon was just a small part of a \"strikingly large\" global retail market. Zuckerberg claimed on Thursday's call that regulating Facebook's targeted advertising model could ultimately harm small businesses, asking \"is that really what policymakers want in the middle of a pandemic and recession?\"   But documents released by the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee showed that the businesses have operated in anti-competitive ways, Democrats argued.   Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the panel's chairman, said that a report on the panel's investigation would likely be ready by September. While Congress does not have the authority to break up companies, the probe could pave the way for efforts to rewrite antitrust law. It could also aid investigations currently being undertaken by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general.   The same week as the hearing, Reuters reported that European regulators were readying a full-scale investigation into Google's acquisition of Fitbit Inc., illustrating the scrutiny the companies are facing in the U.S. and abroad.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

With 600 attendees, it was the largest and most vibrant edition of the event yet. Here are five key takeaways from it.</p><p><br/><br/>Diversity starts at the top, but it doesn't stop there<br/><br/>\"Everyone can play a part in creating a more inclusive culture. It doesn't just come from the top,\" Brenda Trenowden, a partner at PwC and global co-chair of the 30% Club, said during her keynote speech, kicking off the two-day event.<br/><br/>Creating a sense of belonging in the workplace starts from the top, but implementation happens at the team level, she added. In that sense, the conversations she is having with chief executives nowadays are more about how to achieve gender diversity rather than why.<br/><br/>\"I'm fed up with people wanting evidence of how having more women makes my business better,\"\u00a0one of those chief executives said. \"Who's ever asking for evidence of how many men will make my business better?\"<br/><br/>'Schizophrenia' a symptom of a late-cycle market<br/><br/>From <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.infrastructureinvestor.com/database/#/profile?id=5586\"> KKR </url>'s perspective, the market is \"definitely\" in the late cycle, the firm's head of European infrastructure, Tara Davies, said. An indication of that is the \"little bit of schizophrenia\" that surfaces at times when a high-quality asset comes to market but with few buyers showing interest.<br/><br/>Esther Peiner, managing director of private infrastructure Europe at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.infrastructureinvestor.com/database/#/profile?id=5595\"> Partners Group </url>, agreed. \"You get a lot of investor interest and excitement, but at the same time, people get scared incredibly easily,\" she said.<br/><br/>So, should the market be preparing for a correction? The answer to that question is not easily forthcoming. While leverage in the infrastructure sector has increased in the past decade, it hasn't reached 2007 levels. \"That is something we definitely don't see today,\" Davies asserted.<br/><br/>Get ready for technology risk<br/><br/>You can't have a good conference without a bit of crystal-ball gazing. So kudos to KKR's Davies, who did a good job of tackling an audience question about what infrastructure will look like in 2040.<br/><br/>\"The vast majority of the infrastructure market is energy-related, and that space will look completely different in 25 years,\" she said. \"There will be more technological risk associated with those assets. Will that risk ever be an infrastructure risk, or will it be more of a venture-capital risk? That'll change infrastructure [investing].\"<br/><br/>We couldn't agree more, which is why this month's cover story tackles how Big Tech is poised to disrupt infrastructure investing. Check it out       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.infrastructureinvestor.com/deep-dive-big-tech-coming-infra-3-0/\"> HERE </url>.<br/><br/>Regulatory risk <br/><br/>Another topic you can't not address at an infrastructure event is regulatory risk and how it's evolving.<br/><br/>\"In my experience, changes to regulation are generally seen by investors as increasing risk - whether they are good or bad changes,\" Regina Finn, a director at London-based consultancy Lucerna Partners and former Ofwat chief executive, said. So, \"by virtue of the fact that change is happening at all - the answer is yes\".<br/><br/>To mitigate that risk, Finn advises investors to engage with regulators at an early stage - when frameworks or policies are being designed or existing frameworks are being revised.<br/><br/>The stage when individual decisions affecting individual firms are being made is too late. \"Complaining at this stage is wasted effort,\" Finn said.<br/><br/>ESG: Asking the right questions <br/><br/>\"There are very few investors who don't ask about ESG, but, over time, more and more investors will ask the right questions.\" That comment from Sandra Lowe, investor relations director at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.infrastructureinvestor.com/database/#/profile?id=6322\">InfraRed Capital Partners</url>, elegantly sums up the ESG state of play. Which is to say it's high on everyone's agenda, with LPs ranking managers on their ESG prowess. But challenges remain on everything from benchmarking to data collection.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that also means, as Mercer's Catherine Lloyd put it, that there is \"still a lot of box ticking and self-certification\" going on.<br/><br/>With 78 percent of our audience saying ESG is now core to their investment decisions, expect these issues to be ironed out sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>Write to the authors at:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:bruno.a@peimedia.com\"> bruno.a@peimedia.com </url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:kalliope.gourntis@peimedia.com\"> kalliope.gourntis@peimedia.com </url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PEIII-87335</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PEIII2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFR-8V41-JCXV-K14G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">349012</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 PEI Media Ltd.

In one, Democrats focused largely on the topic at hand. In the other, Republicans used the opportunity to allege anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley and censorship of conservative voices online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The executives -- Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai -- managed to steer clear of most of those accusations, arguing that their platforms are politically neutral. But under questioning related to their business practices, including their corporate acquisitions, the tycoons appeared more vulnerable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are five key takeaways from the landmark proceedings.</p><p>1. Amazon questioned on use of sales data by private sellers (Jinitzail Hernandez)</p><p>One of the most hotly anticipated lines of questioning at the hearing didn't come right away, possibly because of technical difficulties Bezos experienced during the hearing's early stages. </p><p>But when Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., asked the Amazon executive whether his company accesses and uses data on the third-party sellers who use its platform in its business decisions, the manner in which Bezos answered was notable.</p><p>\"I can't answer that question yes or no,\" Bezos told Jayapal.</p><p>During the course of its investigation, the subcommittee questioned an Amazon associate general counsel, Nate Sutton, who testified that the company does not \"use any seller data to compete\" with third-party sellers. Sutton also said Amazon does not use those sellers' \"individual data when we're making decisions to launch private brands.\"</p><p>But on April 23, a Wall Street Journal report asserted that Amazon has done exactly that. Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the subcommittee chairman, issued a statement that if the report was accurate, Sutton's testimony would \"appear to be misleading, and possibly criminally false or perjurious.\"</p><p>Under questioning by Jayapal, Bezos said Amazon has a policy against using third-party data, but that he could not \"guarantee that policy has never been violated.\"</p><p>Amazon is conducting an internal investigation into the allegations. Bezos said he would share the results with the committee once it is complete.</p><p>2. Google accused of stealing content from Yelp</p><p>Cicilline said the committee's investigation showed Google had stolen the content of other websites, including Yelp, in order \"to bootstrap its own rival local search business.\"</p><p>When Yelp asked Google to stop doing that, the search engine giant responded by threatening to \"delist Yelp entirely,\" Cicilline said. \"In other words, the choice Google gave you was 'let us steal your content or effectively disappear from the web.' Isn't that anti-competitive?\" </p><p>Pichai said Google was focused on giving users what they wanted and offered to provide more answers after understanding details of the case Cicilline mentioned. </p><p>In addition to stealing other websites' content, Google searches also \"privilege its own sites,\" Cicilline said, adding that most web searches that start on Google also \"end somewhere on Google's own websites.\" </p><p>Taken together, \"the evidence seems very clear to me as Google became the gateway to the internet it began to abuse its power and use its surveillance over web traffic to identify competitive threats and crushed them,\" Cicilline said. </p><p>3. Facebook's acquisition of Instagram under scrutiny</p><p>In an early exchange, Nadler said documents unearthed by the investigation showed that Facebook saw Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app, as a \"powerful threat that could siphon business away from Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than compete with Instagram, Facebook \"bought it,\" Nadler said of the 2012 acquisition. </p><p>\"This is exactly the type of anti-competitive acquisition the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\" Nadler said. \"This should never have been permitted to happen, and it cannot happen again.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg defended the acquisition, saying that it was cleared by federal antitrust regulators when it was proposed and has proven to be \"wildly successful\" largely because of efforts by Facebook to grow Instagram.</p><p>\"I've been clear that Instagram was a competitor in the space of mobile photo-sharing,\" Zuckerberg said. \"By having them join us, they certainly went from being a competitor ... to an app that we could help grow.\"</p><p>Jayapal questioned  Zuckerberg about internal emails from 2012 showing that the company sought to copy features and aspects of its competitors' products, especially Instagram.</p><p>Zuckerberg said the company had \"certainly adapted features that others led in,\" as have others.</p><p>Jayapal also said she had documents showing that Facebook had \"threatened to clone the products of another company while also attempting to acquire that company,\" referring to Facebook's attempts to develop a camera app to rival that of Instagram.</p><p>Instagram founder Kevin Systrom had said in emails to some investors that he felt threatened that if he didn't sell his company to Facebook, then Zuckerberg would copy or clone the photo feature to destroy Instagram.</p><p>Zuckerberg denied he had ever threatened Systrom.</p><p>4. App Store could spell trouble for Apple</p><p>Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said Apple wielded \"an enormous amount of power\" because of the coveted app marketplace and the rules \"get changed to benefit Apple at the expense of app developers in the App Store.\"</p><p>Apple's Cook said the company evaluates every app before it is featured on the App Store, treats every developer equally and that the rules were \"open and transparent.\"</p><p>Johnson also said that Apple assigned some of its employees to help large app developers such as China's Baidu to navigate Apple's bureaucracy compared with smaller developers who had to deal with the process on their own.</p><p>Cook said he was unaware of such practices, adding that Apple executives engage with app developers large and small.</p><p>Cook also denied allegations that the company threatened or retaliated against app developers who went public with their criticisms, and also denied that Apple had increased commissions it charges app developers.</p><p>5. Republicans oppose new antitrust laws</p><p>From the hearing's outset, it was clear that the panel's Republicans would engage in lines of questioning that had little to do with antitrust. They asked about alleged anti-conservative bias, content moderation and each company's business activities in China.</p><p>And although observers could be forgiven for mistaking their interest in other issues as a lack of interest in antitrust, a key exchange between Bezos and the subcommittee's ranking member, Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., revealed a more likely explanation: Republicans are against passing new antitrust laws.</p><p>The current debate in antitrust divides those who follow theories espoused by conservative legal icon Robert Bork -- who believed that a company establishing market dominance by acquiring smaller companies was good for consumers as long as prices stayed low -- and those who apply the beliefs of former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who opposed monopolies.</p><p>On Wednesday, Sensenbrenner revealed himself to be a Borkian.</p><p>\"History shows that Congress does a poor job of picking winners and losers,\" he said. \"I have reached the conclusion that we do not need to change our antitrust laws.\"</p><p>Sensenbrenner then asked Bezos how customers would benefit from the government breaking up Amazon.</p><p>\"They would not be,\" Bezos said.</p><p>\"Right,\" Sensenbrenner replied.</p><p>Source: CQ News<br/>Copyright 2020 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

Anytime Sen. Elizabeth Warren and President Donald Trump agree on a topic, we should all be concerned about what might happen, and Bhaskar Chakravorti, the dean of global business and Tufts University's Fletcher School has an interesting take on the issue.</p><p>He writes for <url normalizedValue=\"http://theconversation.com/3-myths-to-bust-about-breaking-up-big-tech-119283\">The Conversation,</url> a media nonprofit whose content is shared on the Business Journal's website from time to time, and makes the case that the discussion around breaking up big technology firms has fallen prey to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2019/07/17/3-myths-to-bust-about-breaking-up-big-tech.html\">some serious misconceptions</url>. He suggests there are three myths worth busting before we, as a society, take on big tech.</p><p>First, comparing Standard Oil to Google doesn't work because the world economy is vastly different today. Rather than one \"big tech\" cluster in the world, there are actually two: One is in the U.S., dominated by\u00a0Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. The other is in China, dominated by\u00a0Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei. And if the U.S. tech giants are broken up, the result would be a vastly uneven global playing field, with fragmented U.S. companies pitted against consolidated, state-protected Chinese firms. The outcome for the U.S. economy would not be pretty.</p><p>Second, he looks at why price comparisons among big-tech companies are false dichotomies. For example, while Google and Facebook are \"free,\" and Amazon and Apple have market clout in pricing, \"free\" isn't really free -\u00a0we're paying with our privacy, and personal data might even come at a higher cost.</p><p>Lastly, the discussion itself might solve the issue. Chakravorti makes the case that there are more than just two ways for this debate to end, with a breakup of one or more of the tech giants or with leaving things as they are. His idea is to take a page from the history of antitrust litigation: The company that is sued is not broken up, but the fact that there was a lawsuit leads to progress. He mentions the cases against the Bell System, IBM and Microsoft.</p><p>It's worth the read, if only to complicate our collective thinking on the subject. In a world of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-attacks-big-tech-at-social-media-summit-11562880762\">144-character arguments</url>, the nuances are often lost in complex arguments.

Right or wrong, it has caused many employers to think about the risks of hiring women.

The consequence is that women will have a more difficult time obtaining employment and promotions.</p><p>Quote: \"U.S. vice-president Mike Pence appeared a Philistinic lout when it became known that he refused to dine alone with any woman other than his wife.

Depending on your tax bracket, you could wind up paying much of your money back to the government when you file your 2015 tax return, he says. \"High-income earners, who some have argued shouldn't be getting anything at all, will indeed end up with close to nothing on an after-tax basis.\"</p><p>Getty ImagesWall Street's tech heavyweights reported Tuesday night.</p><p>5.

Oil Sands in ... Utah</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BloombergAmericans will no longer have to trundle all the way up North to protest \"tar sands\" in Western Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regulators in Utah have approved a plan for the first commercial oilsands mine in the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We'll be in production later in the fall with commercial production before the end of the year,\" U.S. Oil Sands Inc. chief executive Cameron Todd told the Financial Post on Tuesday( <url normalizedValue=\"http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/utah-set-to-be-home-of-first-oilsands-mine-project-in-us-by-\">http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/utah-set-to-be-home-of-first-oilsands-mine-project-in-us-by-</url> end -of-2015 ).</p><p>The 2,000-barrel-per-day project in eastern Utah is located about 200 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.</p><p>This is a big win for Todd. His TSX Venture-exchange listed company, U.S. Oil Sands, has been proposing the PR Spring Oil Sands Project in Utah for some time.</p><p>The project has met with fierce opposition from environmental groups who are worried about the mine's impact on ground water. Yet he claims his project is safe. U.S. Oil Sands will remove oil from the sands using a non-toxic bio-solvent derived from orange and lemon peels.</p><p>BloombergMiles Nadal, founder and chief executive of MDC Partners Inc.</p><p>2.

The holding company has stakes in more than 50 advertising and marketing agencies.</p><p>MDC's stock, which is listed on Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange, has slumped since last Fall when it first disclosed the investigation. When Nadal announced Tuesday that he is leaving, the company's stock immediately jumped 5 per cent.</p><p>Peter J. Thompson/National PostFacebook is moving into the MaRS office tower in Toronto.</p><p>3. Facebook lands on MaRS</p><p>The MaRS Discovery District's troubled Phase 2 tower in Toronto is supposed to be a home to a cluster of cutting-edge life-sciences businesses and hip high tech companies.</p><p>Or so goes the plan. Two thirds of the tower remains vacant. Construction on the tower was stalled until the Ontario government ran to the rescue with a bailout.</p><p>Good news now, though. Facebook, a hip high-tech business that should be able to pay some rent, is to become the tower's first new tenant since construction resumed after the government rescue. Facebook has committed to leasing half a floor in the tower - enough room to double its current staff of 65.</p><p>Facebook is expected to move to MaRS in early 2016.</p><p>4. The Child Care Benefit giveth ... and taketh away</p><p>Those federal government child care benefit cheques are supposed to arrive in mailboxes this week. Families are to receive a lump sum of $520 per child under six, and $420 for those aged six to 17.</p><p>The federal government is sending out a total of $3 billion in payments to families.

In a column published in Wednesday's Financial Post, he basically explains that there's no such thing as a free lunch.</p><p>The new payment is taxable - and the government isn't withholding any tax from that first cheque. Depending on your tax bracket, you could wind up paying much of your money back to the government when you file your 2015 tax return, he says. \"High-income earners, who some have argued shouldn't be getting anything at all, will indeed end up with close to nothing on an after-tax basis.\"</p><p>Getty ImagesWall Street's tech heavyweights reported Tuesday night.</p><p>5.

The result was a net loss of US$3.2 billion, the company's largest quarterly loss ever. The company's shares dropped about 3.6 per cent in extended trading after the report.</p><p>Then there's Yahoo!

His TSX Venture-exchange listed company, U.S. Oil Sands, has been proposing the PR Spring Oil Sands Project in Utah for some time. He has said his project would remove oil from the sands using a non-toxic bio-solvent derived from orange and lemon peels.</p><p>Yet the project has met with fierce opposition from environmental groups who are worried about the mine's impact on ground water.</p><p>BloombergMiles Nadal, founder and chief executive of MDC Partners Inc.</p><p>2.

The holding company has stakes in more than 50 advertising and marketing agencies.</p><p>MDC's stock, which is listed on Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange, has slumped since last Fall when it first disclosed the investigation. When Nadal announced Tuesday that he is leaving, the company's stock immediately jumped 5 per cent.</p><p>Peter J.

Two thirds of the tower remains vacant. Construction on the tower was stalled until the Ontario government ran to the rescue with a bailout.</p><p>Good news now, though. Facebook, a hip, happening high-tech business that should be able to pay some rent, is to become the tower's first new tenant since construction resumed after the bailout.

In a column published in Wednesday's Financial Post, he basically explains that there's no such thing as a free lunch.</p><p>The new payment is taxable - and the government isn't withholding any tax from that first cheque. Depending on your tax bracket, you could wind up paying much of your money back to the government when you file your 2015 tax return, he says. \"High-income earners, who some have argued shouldn't be getting anything at all, will indeed end up with close to nothing on an after-tax basis.\"</p><p>Getty ImagesWall Street's tech heavyweights reported Tuesday night.</p><p>5.

Two thirds of the tower remains vacant. Construction on the tower was stalled until the Ontario government ran to the rescue with a bailout.</p><p>Good news now, though. Facebook, a hip high-tech business that should be able to pay some rent, is to become the tower's first new tenant since construction resumed after the government rescue. Facebook has committed to leasing half a floor in the tower - enough room to double its current staff of 65.</p><p>Facebook is expected to move to MaRS in early 2016.</p><p>4. The Child Care Benefit giveth ... and taketh away</p><p>Those federal government child care benefit cheques are supposed to arrive in mailboxes this week.

But that didn't stop Michael Katchen from launching an automated investment service online - now more popularly known as a robo-adviser - that didn't require a lot of hassle to open. That was five years ago and, of course, there are many more robo-advisers in the market today, but Toronto-based Wealthsimple keeps pushing the envelope to offer cheaper, sometimes even free and arguably better banking-type services such as commission-free trading and high interest savings accounts, forcing the Big Banks and financial services players to adapt.</p><p>\"The company got started out of an organic need. I wanted to help some friends invest and there wasn't a good option out there so I decided to solve it for them,\" Katchen says. \"It is so important to be smart about money and to be thoughtful about the fees you pay on the services you get to manage your money, to enable you to live the life that you want and to provide the life you want for your family. The financial service industry has done a disservice to Canadians by not pushing the envelope.\"</p><p>Pushing the envelope could almost be Katchen's mantra. For instance, Wealthsimple in 2016 won an award for having the world's best financial services company website. The next day, the website was completely torn down and redesigned from scratch. \"Our belief is that innovation and iteration go hand in hand and they're never done,\" he says. \"It's an ongoing process.\" Wealthsimple has also pushed abroad, opening operations in the United States and the United Kingdom, which have more robust players and competition.</p><p>It must be daunting, especially initially, to take on big established players even in a country such as Canada that is begging for better service, but Katchen doesn't seem to feel it. He doesn't think about being an industry disruptor, but he does think about raising the industry's bar. Either way, Wealthsimple's message seems to be resonating with consumers. Banks have responded by offering higher interest rates, and trading commissions are dropping, sometimes to zero. \"One of the things we're excited about is that we're a five-year-old company so we're still brand new, but we already are moving the industry forward,\" he says. \"Even though we're competing against some of the largest financial institutions in the world and the Canadian banks here, we continue to keep moving fast.\"</p><p>Speed is the key since Wealthsimple has but one patent to its name.</p><p>The company, similar to Shopify Inc., is evolving without worrying too much about whether someone will mimic its technologies and service offerings, especially since Katchen believes patents are just a little pass\u00e9 given how fast markets are evolving. Where once a patent, generated after years and millions of dollars'worth of research, could offer protection for 10 or 20 years, today it might be out of date before the application is even dry. \"Our belief is that it's the speed at which you iterate and innovate that is the way you keep a competitive advantage today.\"</p><p>All of which is why Wealthsimple keeps adding services. It just launched a tax service, SimpleTax, which it expects will help one million filers this year, and Katchen names responsible credit, such as houses, mortgages and student debt that help people augment their human or wealth capital, as targets. And then there's insurance. \"We're really in the square of saving and investing today, which is really the first rung of building good financial behaviours and financial freedom over the long term,\" he says. \"We've got an enormously exciting road map in front of us.\"</p><p>Kurtis McBride, co-founder and CEO, Miovision Technologies Inc.</p><p>Like it or not, and many don't, especially in Alberta, Canada is part of the Paris Accord that pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, and it's here to stay - at least until a government change anyway. Reducing our dependence on fossil fuels is tough, to be sure, but there is a Canadian-made solution that could take care of a third of that commitment and it wouldn't take much effort at all. Just solve something we want solved anyway: traffic congestion.</p><p>Rather than spend millions, if not billions, on road infrastructure, Miovision's software can simply make Canada's tens of thousands of traffic intersections operate more efficiently, cutting the time we spend idling and polluting the atmosphere. \"The opportunity to have meaningful impact on people's quality of life, the livability of our cities, the environment is real,\" says Kurtis McBride, co-founder and CEO of the Kitchener, Ont.-based company.</p><p>Reducing congestion is such a simple, yet popular idea that it's a wonder no one seems to have thought of it before, but McBride says he's always questioned why things are the way they are, and traffic was one that came to him as a co-op student at university. \"Most people assume traffic has always been bad, it will always be bad and there's really nothing they can do about it, but I don't think that's true at all,\" he says. \"When we started the company, it was really on this idea that if we just applied ideas, concepts and business models and technologies that had been proven out in other markets for completely different problems to traffic problems, then traffic doesn't need to be this bad.\"</p><p>Put simply, Miovision takes 21st century technologies such as the cloud, connectivity and edge computing and applies them to collecting data from the traffic boxes that control the lights, most of which haven't been thought about too much since the 1970s. \"Once the bridge between those two is built, then everything else we do is in software,\" Mc-Bride says. The data that is collected by the Miovision cameras is owned by the municipalities that operate the traffic lights, and can help them figure out how best to operate those lights to maximize efficiencies.</p><p>Two fundamental problems occur in a traffic network. One is called a split failure, or over-servicing one direction and under-servicing the other, causing unnecessary backups. The other is a coordination failure, which is where drivers hit every red (or every green) in one direction - nice when you hit green, less so with the red. Data can determine where those failures are occurring and then Miovision, using its tools or third-party ones, can implement a plan, whether that's based on time of day, day of the week or even seasonally, sensors or adaptive control, which McBride says is almost a real-time network-level response.</p><p>\"Think of us like a smartphone of the intersection with an app store, so we have lots of native apps and partner apps,\" he says. \"We give the municipalities access to the raw information that they can access through APIs. We focus on congestion mitigation, improving safety and improving operations, so everything from if the power is out at a signal and creating an unsafe situation all the way up to things like fixing green time.\"</p><p>The one impediment, it turns out, isn't the municipalities, which McBride says get a bad rap for not pushing innovation, but the procurement system that lends itself to vendors selling closed systems, so there's no need to ever get better. Municipalities, of course, could drive open standards, \"which would open the market up to innovation, but vendors could do a lot more to drive innovation as well,\" he says. Open systems would have the side benefit of reducing some of the privacy fears that having private-sector cameras on every intersection will no doubt generate. McBride says it's up to the cities to determine what to do with the data, though he recognizes that there's a branding issue since it's Miovision's name on the cameras. To that end, Miovision, along with Esri Canada, Geotab, MappedIn and others, created an organization called the Open City Network that addresses the need for openness when developing smart-city infrastructure. \"We don't collect any PII (personally identifiable information). We go out of our way to make sure we don't capture any PII,\" McBride says. \"Our interest is in making traffic flow better and safer.\"</p><p>Graham Taylor, associate professor, School of Engineering, University of Guelph Robots get all the attention when it comes to artificial intelligence and perhaps that's not out of line, given the fear they will eliminate millions of jobs, particularly blue-collar ones. But the power of AI is a lot more than just riveting one part to another, or answering simple queries from confused customers. Indeed, there's growing interest in Canadian AI circles, Graham Taylor says, to democratize the technology, for example, by automating database queries. \"The holy grail would be to have a spreadsheet and you're familiar with working in Excel, but you're not a programmer and there are some missing data, and you could just say to the algorithm, hey, fill in the missing data,\" says the University of Guelph professor, startup consultant and all-round AI expert. \"It would then figure out where the data is, crawl the web, write queries in databases, and do whatever it needs to do to fill in the data.\"</p><p>That doesn't sound nearly as threatening as robot overlords, but democratizing AI is something Taylor is quite interested in. Traditionally, AI, even to do something seemingly simple as generate or recognize faces, requires huge computing resources that only a handful of companies have at their disposal. For example, Big-GAN (Big Generative Adversarial Network) needs 512 TPUs (tensor processing units), which is specialized equipment that only Google has. Although Taylor says Big Tech has been fairly good about showing what they're doing, even sharing their codes, small companies and academics have been left out due to the cost. \"What we're focused on specifically is not reducing the number of examples that you have, but compressing the examples that you use to train the computer,\" he says. \"We've been able to run it on a single GPU (graphics processing unit) that costs about $1,000.\"</p><p>Perhaps more fun is the work Taylor and four undergrad students at Guelph are doing to build a generative model that creates new Lego designs based on the bricks at your or your children's disposal. He's also interested in using machine learning systems and software to do customization at scale. Many engineers use the 80-20 rule when creating products: that is, design something that will work for 80% of the population. But Taylor thinks it will be possible to use AI to reach the other 20% with mass-produced customized products, as opposed to trying to retrofit or build something entirely different. Again, the idea of AI being a democratization agent at work.</p><p>Of course, there will always be suspicion of AI's motives, or at least the motives behind the people and companies that use AI. That, too, forms a big part of Taylor's work. \"There is a lot of hype positively, a lot of hype negatively and a lot of misinformation out there,\" he says. In 2018, the University of Guelph started the Centre for Advancing Responsible and Ethical AI (CARE-AI) to help address some of that fear and anxiety. The centre hosts public information seminars and generally tries to insure the ethics surrounding AI don't get lost in all the excitement. Taylor is also academic director of Next AI, a four-year-old founder development program that brings in experts from around the world to get entrepreneurs thinking about the ethical issues. \"In the first and second year of the program, we weren't getting a lot of questions about ethics and responsibilities from the teams, but in the past couple of years it has really spiked up,\" he says. \"It tends to one of the areas that the teams want to know the most about.\"</p><p>Though Taylor co-founded Kindred Inc., which is trying to make robot workers that better emulate what humans do, he discovered balancing academia and a full-time business was a bit overwhelming. \"Running a company is more than a 100% job,\" he says. \"University is more than a 100% job.\" That's not to suggest you won't find Taylor in the trenches. He did a sabbatical at Google Brain last year, remains an academic adviser to Kindred and collaborates with startups such as Toronto-based Swift Medical Inc., which has created a mobile app for wound care (bed sores, diabetic ulcers and the like) in nursing homes. \"I really enjoyed all these experiences, but when I do them, I really feel my heart is in academics. These experiences have been amazing, but the best place for me is in university.\" Joshua Wong, founder and CEO, Opus One Solutions Energy Corp.</p><p>If you're going to have a big hairy audacious goal, it may as well be the biggest, hairiest, most audacious goal, and Joshua Wong, CEO and founder of Toronto-based Opus One Solutions has one: to be the Amazon.com of energy. Opus One can already collect data from power grids to help customers digitize the information they collect, hopefully allowing them to make better operational decisions, thus reducing the amount of wasted power and decarbonize. But the ultimate goal is to decentralize the grid or empower individual homeowners and business owners to participate in both buying and selling electricity.</p><p>\"With Amazon, you can trade consumer goods, but they still need the highways, shipping and logistics to ship the goods. We still need the poles and the wires, but we can transact energy like e-commerce on top of that traditional infrastructure,\" Wong says. \"That's the final solution to all the debates, in Ontario especially, about fees and tariffs, and the U.S. and others that have net metering subsidies for clean energy. Energy should not be subsidized, it doesn't need to be subsidized, you just need to use the data analytics to drive the right pricing for energy.\"</p><p>Data is the key, Wong says, because the infrastructure is in some case 100-plus years old, and while the resulting grid may be the most complex invention of the 20th century, it needs help to achieve the next phase. And there's nothing cheaper on the grid than data, especially when compared to the cost of running equipment down and not adding new energy sources and users, or replacing it with current, but expensive newer equipment. \"Data allows you to not only be the most efficient as to how you manage the infrastructure, and hopefully reduce rates and improve reliability, but it also allows you to, in the most informed fashion, choose between traditional investments, which is more poles and copper wires and oil, or the new stuff, being solar, storage, electric-vehicle charging, automation of components. It's the analytics that inform how we should evolve the infrastructure.\"</p><p>For example, it's possible to create microgrids, self-sufficient silos or islands that can be as small as one house, but that isn't very efficient. Inter-connecting these microgrids into a bigger whole, however, can improve resiliency, a fancy way of saying avoid outages. Opus One recently set up such a grid that connected Tesla batteries to store wind power in Nova Scotia. It was able to support the area for 19 hours when Hurricane Dorian hit in 2019 and shut the power off everywhere else. \"That's the power of the sharing economy of power,\" Wong says.</p><p>Microgrids allow utilities to incorporate new forms of power such as solar and wind, as well as storage batteries. But data is still needed to figure out where best to put such equipment and how it should be controlled.</p><p>Opus One is also working with hydro utilities in Ontario, as well as some of the largest utilities in the United States and around the world, and breaking into the Asia Pacific market. \"The market is ready and ripe. The data sets do succeed,\" Wong says. \"The biggest thing is further education, some regulatory support is always needed, but it's also good that, fundamentally, the market is moving to a different stage: how best should I use these new tools?\" He has a few ideas. Michael Tamblyn, CEO and president, Rakuten Kobo Inc.</p><p>Canada's history of creating cutting-edge products is rich. Making them successful? Not so much. There's the light bulb, Avro Arrow and BlackBerry to name a few that were punished by market forces.</p><p>Then there's the e-reader. Toronto-based Kobo certainly didn't invent it - the idea has been around since a 1930 manifesto called The Readies written by American writer Robert Brown - but it has popularized the device even though it's up against direct competition from Amazon. com Inc.'s Kindle as well as indirectly from tablets and smartphones by the likes of Apple Inc. and Samsung. Kobo now operates in 24 countries, making it one of the largest e-book retailers and device manufacturers.</p><p>That Kobo is still kicking 11 years after it was founded counts as CEO Michael Tamblyn's big surprise. \"We started with the idea that there would probably be three or four companies that would dominate e-books and e-reading globally and it was certainly our ambition to be one of them,\" he says. \"Through some choices, good bets and good luck, we find ourselves in a place where it's those three big ecosystem players that are big everywhere - Amazon, Apple and Google - and then there's us as the one big pure-play player in e-books and e-reading.\"</p><p>Marketing is one of the keys to innovation that is often overlooked, and Kobo would not be a success without it. In particular, Tamblyn says Kobo works with existing retailers, rather than try to disrupt their models.</p><p>It's a tactic that makes sense when you recall Kobo (an anagram of book) is an offshoot of Indigo Books &amp;; Music Inc., though it is now a subsidiary of the Japanese e-commerce conglomerate Rakuten. In the 2000s, Indigo, like other book retailers, was grappling with how best to accommodate the growing desire for digital content, something the music and video industries struggled mightily with as well. But, after all, if you want to find someone who loves books, go to a bookstore.</p><p>\"It's been interesting to watch the book industry navigate this change in a very different way than in music or video, where it's been much more of an all-or-nothing transition,\" Tamblyn says. \"We see publishers stepping up and making certain kinds of books more beautiful so that they earn places in people's homes and, at the same time, embracing digital distribution because somebody who is an avid reader and churning through two science fiction books a week is someone you want to keep reading digitally as fast as possible.\"</p><p>Aside from Indigo, some of the other retail partnerships Kobo has include Waterstones, the largest book retailer in the United Kingdom, Libreria Porr\u00faa and Gandhi in Mexico, and Hugendubel, Thalia and Weltbild in Germany. They get access to a catalogue of more than five million e-books, newspapers and magazines. In Canada, about one in five books read for personal use is currently read in digital form, which Tamblyn says is a fairly significant penetration rate when you consider how durable print is as a format. Typical users are as likely to be 65 years old as they are 18, he says, and Kobo says it already has 12 million users in 190 countries. At some point, \"we probably won't be pressing ink into dead trees to do our reading,\" he says. \"Everything after that is a just question of timing.\" FPM</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>/ (See hardcopy for photo);

A lot happened this year so much so that remembering every product and every piece of news is almost impossible. When I look back at big themes that shaped tech, there were five that stood out to me: Streaming, China, Foldable, 5G, and Regulation.StreamingIt seems as though 2019 was the year when everybody decided that consumers did not have enough options when it came to video streaming. Despite already having a long list of streaming services from Netflix. </p><p>Hulu, Prime Video, HBO two new brands came barging into what they believe is still a big opportunity of not just connect to consumers but also getting a slice of the revenue pie. After a big launch event in March, Apple started airing its Apple TV + content at the beginning of November, followed shortly after by Disney+. One day after launch, Disney shared that Disney+ had reached 10 million signups. Of course, signups don't necessarily equal subscribers. Many people could opt-out after the first seven-day free trial. Some could be among the 20 million Verizon customers who received a free subscription for the first 12 months. Nevertheless, the numbers seem to bode well for revenue service. Judging the success of Apple TV + will be equally difficult, considering that we shouldn't be expecting much guidance from Apple's earnings calls. Plus, any consumers who bought a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or TV would have received a year's of free subscription. What is clear, however, is the fact that both services have yet to impact the fortunes of long-standing streaming service, Netflix, the brand, the most feared, would have been affected. It seems as though the hunger for content remains, and consumers seem happy to add to their budget for worthwhile content. Interestingly, though, both services ended up launching at a lower price than most people expected, maybe a sign of awareness of how crowded this market was already. 2020 seems to be as busy with new services expected from HBO, Quibi. Peacock and Discovery/BBC. I continue to believe that the biggest threat these new services represent is aimed at cable TV. These subscriptions are not just costly, but they also fail to show a clear benefit associated with the amount users pay every month. It's not so much about cord cutting is about making sure the money you pay sees a clear return. I think bundling will be the real battle going forward. We already started to see Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN coming together under one subscription, and I expect Apple will bundle some of its services in 2020. Whether it will be Apple TV + and Apple Music or Apple TV + and Apple News remains to be seen, but my bet is bundled services are on the map.ChinaWherever you are thinking about Huawei, or the U.S./China tariffs, or the race to 5G and AI, China was very much at the center of many technology conversations during 2019. The growth and importance that China has represented in technology over the past few years seem to have shifted in 2019, from a market opportunity growth to a supplier opportunity growth. China was not just the market that offered a lot of sales potential, but it became the market where a lot of technologies had their first moment in both development and commercialization. 5G and AI are probably the most prominent tech trends of the next decade, and China is certainly on a mission to dominate both. While a lot of the innovation in these two areas was born in the US, China has been faster to deploy them thanks to government and regulation's decision that support rather than hinder commercialization. The tension between the two countries escalated when the US moved to halt Huawei's ability to sell equipment in the US and, more importantly, to buy parts from US suppliers, by adding Huawei to a Commerce Department blacklist which included another eight Chinese companies. It soon became obvious that Huawei was used as a pawn by the Trump administration in its bargaining with China on favorable tariffs. In what seemed like a chess game, the administration granted temporary reprieves that allow US companies to continue to sell parts to Huawei. Microsoft Corp., for instance, said it got a license to sell 'mass-market software' to Huawei. Yet, the US Federal Communications Commission voted to prohibit the use of federal subsidies to buy telecommunications equipment made by Huawei and ZTE and said it would consider requiring carriers now using the products to remove them. The tariff battle between the US and China culminated this month in the Chinese government mandating all government offices and public institutions to remove foreign computer devices and software within three years, adding to the complications non-Chinese OEMs are already facing with tariffs. Ironically, given the complaints made against Huawei, this mandate is part of China's longer-term push for 'secure and controllable' technology in government and critical industries as part of its Cyber Security Law, which should boost domestic PC makers share. The ramifications of this power struggle between the two superpowers will continue into 2020 with both countries possibly opening up opportunities for other geographies like South East Asia for manufacturing.FoldableRight out of CES 2019, it was clear that this was the year of foldables, if not for sales, certainly for marketing buzz. After years of more or less attractive rectangular pieces of glass, people were excited about new phone form-factors and even about experimenting with PC designs. Yet, as it is often the case with cutting edge technology, getting off the ground, wasn't as smooth as many expected. Samsung's launch of the Galaxy Fold was negatively impacted by some design decisions around screen protectors and hinge. Spring almost turned into fall as Samsung delayed the official launch of a Galaxy Fold and made some changes to tighten the area around the hinge and tuck the screen protector under the bezel. The second highly anticipated foldable smartphone was the Huawei Mate X, which has so far been released only in China, and an international launch said to be dependent on carriers 5G rollout has, in reality, been put on hold by the lack of Google services. Towards the end of the year, we also saw a more mainstream design with the Motorola Razr. The Razr injects some positivity back into this segment after the issues Samsung and Huawei have had. The inward folding solution protects the screen, and the design does not require developers to rethink their apps for a larger screen nor users to rethink how they use their phones. In other words, you can enjoy the Razr familiarity and uniqueness all at the same time. Foldables also became a talking point in the PC market where Lenovo introduced the first foldable PC, the ThinkPad X1. As we know, however, people seem to be much more flexible and open to new form factors and experiences with smartphones rather than PCs. This, and price, is why dual-screen devices will play a bigger role in 2020, both driven by efforts by Intel and its Athena project as well as Microsoft and their Surface Neo running Windows 10X, a new incarnation of the Windows operating system, focused on delivering a more agile set of workflows.5GIt seems strange to talk about 2019 as the year of 5G because in fairness is more about the time that was spent talking about 5G, than the availability of 5G services. As we are closing the year, you will have quite a different opinion of 5G depending on which region you're sitting in, Korea, China, Europe or the US In the US industry watchers, as well as consumers, seem to continue to have more questions than answers. And this is not because anyone is questioning the impact that 5G will eventually have on the way that both people and things will all be connected and communicate. It is more because much of the marketing and messaging, especially from the carriers, continues to confuse rather than excite or reassure. We continue to see marketing messages focusing on coverage maps and ideal speeds, but not much time is spent to really show the value of betting on 5G. Today, as companies start to invest in private 5G networks, the value is becoming more transparent. Still, for consumers, the limited number of devices, the higher price points of these devices, and the extra cost associated with some 5G plans are leaving people skeptical. The elbow fight among carriers to push through as a leader is, unfortunately, ending up hurting 5G's overall value proposition. 2020 will see broader device selection, as well as a broader price points, bringing the 5G functionality down in the mid-tier portfolio. And, more importantly, a lot of the confusion around network frequencies will go away as chipsets will be able to support multiple frequencies.RegulationBig tech was undoubtedly on the agenda in Washington this year! There was plenty to choose from: the FTC and the internet, the FTC and Qualcomm; Google, Twitter, and Facebook all went to Washington, breaking up Big Tech as big part of the 2020 elections agenda with politicians often showing very little understanding of what these companies do and what alternatives to these companies could be. Privacy was on the agenda in the US and Europe as GDPR started rolling out earlier in the year. Apple was the only vendor who was able to pivot on the push for privacy and made it a big marketing message thought-out the year, talking about privacy as a fundamental civil right. Antitrust was also on the agenda as politicians called for breaking up Big Tech mostly because it seemed the only way many felt they could hinder Facebook, Amazon, and Google from becoming even more powerful. Other tech areas that are under scrutiny are bitcoin, encryption, and AI. Regulators tried to put a stop on Libra, Facebook's cryptocurrency, for fear of the impact that an unregulated cryptocurrency might have on traditional currencies. Luckily for them, initial vital partners such as Paypal, Visa, MasterCard, and eBay all backed away from the project. This month, US lawmakers threatened to pass legislation that would force tech companies to provide court-ordered access to encrypted devices and messages. Law enforcement officials argue that encryption keeps them from accessing criminals' devices, while tech companies continue to be concerned that creating a backdoor into any device or messaging service opens up the opportunity for bad actors to maliciously access them too. This is the same argument made by Apple against the FBI after the San Bernardino shooting. After leading the way on privacy, Europe seems to want to shift its attention to AI with Ms. Vestager, Europe's Commissioner for Competition pledging to create the world's first regulations around artificial intelligence as well as delivering rights to gig economy workers like Uber drivers. All these big topics will remain on the agenda for politicians in the US, Europe, and Australia. Still, I have to admit that I hope to see a much better understanding in the US not just on technology but also on business models and the role that technology will play in key areas such as education, transportation, and real estate.2019 was also the year of tech leadership shakeups, Tik-Tok, silicon, diversity and inclusion (albeit more as a talking point), cloud, and edge. As we look ahead to 2020, we can rest assured we will see many of these big themes to further develop with some materially impacting our lives daily but with all certainly absorbing more marketing budget. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TCHP128926157668004450425876100234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TCHP-128926</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSB-Y7S1-F03R-N4MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1958\"/><timeReceived>2:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Tech.pinions</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Who knew that we'd be celebrating this three-decade tech milestone with such a frenzy of anti-tech fervor?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not so long ago, the tech sector was the jewel in the crown of the U.S. economy, a vibrant industry that non-tech companies envied and other countries were desperate to replicate. Tech was where the United States' best and brightest went to dream big, to move fast and to break things - to \"disrupt\" the bloated and lazy analog-economy incumbents. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the grads (and dropouts) of elite universities, going to Wall Street meant selling out. Going to Silicon Valley meant  changing the world . For our common good, presumably. </p><p>This cultural adoration of all things \"tech\" - and \"tech\" grew to encompass almost any company supposedly in the business of \"disruption\" (including, somehow, selling fake mayonnaise) - was ubiquitous. The sycophancy of the tech press defied parody. Hollywood, too, lionized the founder-genius, the socially awkward kid who finally got his social due (and payday). And politicians went to Silicon Valley to kiss the rings of these flip-flop-and-free-T-shirt-wearing, newly zillionaired nerds, in hope of coaxing a few pennies from their Venmo accounts.</p><p>The political pilgrims came from both parties. Democrats praised the open-mindedness and social liberalism of Silicon Valleyites; Republicans championed their entrepreneurial mettle and contempt for regulations. At one point, erstwhile 2016 Republican presidential front-runner Jeb Bush basically said his economic plan for the country was inspired by Uber.</p><p>But sometime in the past couple of years, disillusionment set in. Quantifiably so: In Gallup's sector-by-sector polling, the \"Internet industry\" was viewed very or somewhat favorably by 60 percent of respondents at its peak in 2015. That plummeted to 45 percent by last summer.</p><p>What happened? In some ways, anything hyped as high as the Silicon Valley  fairy tale was bound to face a reputational fall eventually. But the blemishes driving that backlash were also plentiful, and varied. </p><p>There was bro culture, sexism and sexual harassment. Data breaches - lots of data breaches. Broken laws. Allegations of theft. Ripped-off employees and independent contractors. Privacy violations, disinformation, fake accounts and other user abuses, and changing stories about how much firms knew about them. Lobbying. Lying. Leaching.</p><p>There was too little gatekeeping in toxic social-media environments. Or too much of the sort of gatekeeping that threatens free speech, depending on your political persuasion. The amplification of outrage culture, but also of white nationalism, xenophobia and conspiracy theories. The radicalization of young men worldwide into terrorists, evidenced most recently - though hardly exclusively - in the horrific slaughters at two New Zealand mosques.</p><p>The list goes on, and the outcome is plain. A sector once seen as a bunch of plucky underdogs has become viewed by many as a greedy, parasitic monolith, indifferent to its effects on democracy, civility, human rights. Or, in any event, it was recognized for what it was: a sector at least as inclined to bad behavior as any that came before it, except it exists within an overmatched regulatory environment that has been ill-equipped to impose consequences.</p><p>Politicians smelled blood. And now, rather than competing over who could more closely align themselves with Silicon Valley, they vie for the role of toughest on tech.</p><p>President Trump, who wears his technological illiteracy on his sleeve, was ahead of the game here, having pledged way back in 2015 that he would enlist Bill Gates's help in \"closing that Internet up,\" whatever that meant.</p><p>When it comes to actual policy changes, though, both parties have fallen short. The most ambitious proposal of late comes from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who wants to break up the tech companies. But that just seems like a solution to the wrong problem. Large tech firms have certainly harmed consumers, but it's not clear how consumers would be served by, say, forcing Google to surrender Nest. If Facebook sold off WhatsApp, the colonies of Russian trolls wouldn't miss a beat.</p><p>European regulators have also aimed their firepower on antitrust issues, though it's not always obvious that these efforts are about improving experiences for consumers so much as extracting money from deep-pocketed U.S. companies. Europe's vaunted data-privacy rule - whose most visible change requires everyone to click yes to cookies when visiting a new website - doesn't seem to have moved the needle much either.</p><p>Certainly, consequences for data breaches or other privacy violations could and should be more severe. But fixing the tech sector's systemic problems remains a thornier problem. Perhaps the real lesson of 30 years of webbed connectedness is that a \"disrupted\" economic model is every bit as vulnerable to human failings as the one it supplants. Neither our tech overlords nor their supposed overseers are capable of saving us from ourselves. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:crampell@washpost.com\">crampell@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-e7433980-4694-11e9-aaf8-4512a6fe3439</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-K8K1-DXXY-33TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 16, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;

Who knew that we'd be celebrating this three-decade tech milestone with such a frenzy of anti-tech fervor?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not so long ago, the tech sector was the jewel in the crown of the U.S. economy, a vibrant industry that non-tech companies envied and other countries were desperate to replicate. Tech was where the United States' best and brightest went to dream big, to move fast and to break things - to \"disrupt\" the bloated and lazy analog-economy incumbents. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the grads (and dropouts) of elite universities, going to Wall Street meant selling out. Going to Silicon Valley meant <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">changing the world</emphasis>. For our common good, presumably. </p><p>This cultural adoration of all things \"tech\" - and \"tech\" grew to encompass almost any company supposedly in the business of \"disruption\" (including, somehow, selling fake mayonnaise) - was ubiquitous. The sycophancy of the tech press defied parody. Hollywood, too, lionized the founder-genius, the socially awkward kid who finally got his social due (and payday). And politicians went to Silicon Valley to kiss the rings of these flip-flop-and-free-T-shirt-wearing, newly zillionaired nerds, in hope of coaxing a few pennies from their Venmo accounts.</p><p>The political pilgrims came from both parties. Democrats praised the open-mindedness and social liberalism of Silicon Valleyites; Republicans championed their entrepreneurial mettle and contempt for regulations. At one point, erstwhile 2016 Republican presidential front-runner Jeb Bush basically said his economic plan for the country was inspired by Uber.</p><p>But sometime in the past couple of years, disillusionment set in. Quantifiably so: In Gallup's sector-by-sector polling, the \"Internet industry\" was viewed very or somewhat favorably by 60 percent of respondents at its peak in 2015. That plummeted to 45 percent by last summer.</p><p>What happened? In some ways, anything hyped as high as the Silicon Valley  fairy tale was bound to face a reputational fall eventually. But the blemishes driving that backlash were also plentiful, and varied. </p><p>There was bro culture, sexism and sexual harassment. Data breaches - lots of data breaches. Broken laws. Allegations of theft. Ripped-off employees and independent contractors. Privacy violations, disinformation, fake accounts and other user abuses, and changing stories about how much firms knew about them. Lobbying. Lying. Leaching.</p><p>There was too little gatekeeping in toxic social-media environments. Or too much of the sort of gatekeeping that threatens free speech, depending on your political persuasion. The amplification of outrage culture, but also of white nationalism, xenophobia and conspiracy theories. The radicalization of young men worldwide into terrorists, evidenced most recently - though hardly exclusively - in the horrific slaughters at two New Zealand mosques.</p><p>The list goes on, and the outcome is plain. A sector once seen as a bunch of plucky underdogs has become viewed by many as a greedy, parasitic monolith, indifferent to its effects on democracy, civility, human rights. Or, in any event, it was recognized for what it was: a sector at least as inclined to bad behavior as any that came before it, except it exists within an overmatched regulatory environment that has been ill-equipped to impose consequences.</p><p>Politicians smelled blood. And now, rather than competing over who could more closely align themselves with Silicon Valley, they vie for the role of toughest on tech.</p><p>President Trump, who wears his technological illiteracy on his sleeve, was ahead of the game here, having pledged way back in 2015 that he would enlist Bill Gates's help in \"closing that Internet up,\" whatever that meant.</p><p>When it comes to actual policy changes, though, both parties have fallen short. The most ambitious proposal of late comes from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who wants to break up the tech companies. But that just seems like a solution to the wrong problem. Large tech firms have certainly harmed consumers, but it's not clear how consumers would be served by, say, forcing Google to surrender Nest. If Facebook sold off WhatsApp, the colonies of Russian trolls wouldn't miss a beat.</p><p>European regulators have also aimed their firepower on antitrust issues, though it's not always obvious that these efforts are about improving experiences for consumers so much as extracting money from deep-pocketed U.S. companies. Europe's vaunted data-privacy rule - whose most visible change requires everyone to click yes to cookies when visiting a new website - doesn't seem to have moved the needle much either.</p><p>Certainly, consequences for data breaches or other privacy violations could and should be more severe. But fixing the tech sector's systemic problems remains a thornier problem. Perhaps the real lesson of 30 years of webbed connectedness is that a \"disrupted\" economic model is every bit as vulnerable to human failings as the one it supplants. Neither our tech overlords nor their supposed overseers are capable of saving us from ourselves. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:crampell@washpost.com\">crampell@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-e7433980469411e9aaf84512a6fe3439</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-F801-JCDY-T32F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><timeReceived>12:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 16, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;
