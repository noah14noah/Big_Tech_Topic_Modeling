Twitter says he was not involved in it.Asked if he wanted to get rid of Twitter he said: 'If it was legal, if it was able to be legally shut down, I would.' Trump signed the executive order on 'fairness' which could lead to Twitter, Facebook, Google and other social media and search platforms being stripped of a legal shield which makes them almost immune from being sued.Trump rolled out the tough language as Attorney General Bill Barr looked on and the president signed an order that could expose Twitter and other social media platforms to a barrage of lawsuits. </p><p>Barr said when firms 'curate' their collection and engage in 'censoring' content firms become 'publishers' and shouldn't be entitled to a legal 'shield.' 'We're here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly, and you know what's going on as well as anybody. It's not good,' Trump said before inking the order, which came just days after Twitter for the first time provided what Trump's staff calls a fact-check on his own tweets.Pressed on whether he would in fact seek to use the courts to shut down Twitter, Trump responded: 'I think this: if twitter were not honorable, if you're going to have a guy like this be your judge and jury I think you shut it down as far as I'm concerned,' in reference to Twitter's 'head of integrity,' who has been revealed to have posted tweets highly critical of Trump and top Republicans. [item name=video id=4376706 style=2 /]Trump, a billionaire who amassed a branding and real estate empire before running for president, added: 'A small handful of powerful social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communication in the United States and we know what they are, we don't have to name them, we're going to give you a complete listing.'He continued: 'They've had unchecked power to censure, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.'SECTION 230: THE LAW TRUMP IS TAKING AIM AT OVER CLAIMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA BIAS    Twenty-six words tucked into a 1996 law overhauling telecommunications have allowed companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google to grow into the giants they are today.Those are the words President Donald Trump challenged in an executive order Thursday, one that would strip those protections if online platforms engaged in 'editorial decisions' - including, in the president's view, adding a fact-check warning to one of Trump's tweets.Under the U.S. law, internet companies are generally exempt from liability for the material users post on their networks. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act - itself part of a broader telecom law - provides a legal 'safe harbor' for internet companies.But Trump and other politicians argue that Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity - or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government.Section 230 probably can't be easily dismantled. But if it was, the internet as we know it might cease to exist.Just what is Section 230?If a news site falsely calls you a swindler, you can sue the publisher for libel. But if someone posts that on Facebook, you can't sue the company - just the person who posted it.That's thanks to Section 230, which states that 'no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.'That legal phrase shields companies that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted - whether their complaint is legitimate or not.Section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services' own standards, so long as they are acting in 'good faith.'Where did Section 230 come from?The measure's history dates back to the 1950s, when bookstore owners were being held liable for selling books containing 'obscenity,' which is not protected by the First Amendment. One case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which held that it created a 'chilling effect' to hold someone liable for someone else\u00b4s content.That meant plaintiffs had to prove that bookstore owners knew they were selling obscene books, said Jeff Kosseff, the author of 'The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet,' a book about Section 230.Fast-forward a few decades to when the commercial internet was taking off with services like CompuServe and Prodigy. Both offered online forums, but CompuServe chose not to moderate its, while Prodigy, seeking a family-friendly image, did.CompuServe was sued over that, and the case was dismissed. Prodigy, however, got in trouble. The judge in their case ruled that 'they exercised editorial control - so you're more like a newspaper than a newsstand,' Kosseff said.That didn't sit well with politicians, who worried that outcome would discourage newly forming internet companies from moderating at all. And Section 230 was born.'Today it protects both from liability for user posts as well as liability for any clams for moderating content,' Kosseff said.What happens if Section 230 is limited or goes away?'I don\u00b4t think any of the social media companies would exist in their current forms without Section 230,' Kosseff said. 'They have based their business models on being large platforms for user content.'There are two possible outcomes. Platforms might get more cautious, as Craigslist did following the 2018 passage of a sex-trafficking law that carved out an exception to Section 230 for material that 'promotes or facilitates prostitution.' Craigslist quickly removed its 'personals' section altogether, which wasn't intended to facilitate sex work. But the company didn\u00b4t want to take any chances.This outcome could actually hurt none other than the president himself, who routinely attacks private figures, entertains conspiracy theories and accuses others of crimes.'If platforms were not immune under the law, then they would not risk the legal liability that could come with hosting Donald Trump\u00b4s lies, defamation, and threats,' said Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.Another possibility: Facebook, Twitter and other platforms could abandon moderation altogether and let the lower common denominator prevail.Such unmonitored services could easily end up dominated by trolls, like 8chan, which is infamous for graphic and extremist content, said Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman. Undoing Section 230 would be an 'an existential threat to the internet,' he said.But Goldman doesn't see the White House order as that kind of threat to the internet, saying it's 'political theater' that will appeal to Trump supporters. 'The president can't override Congress,' he said. ASSOCIATED PRESS Trump brought up the 2016 elections as he tore into Twitter - a fact lawyers might try to flag if companies try to claim in court the action is politically motivated.'We can't allow that to happen especially when they go about doing what they're doing,' Trump said. 'Because they're doing things incorrectly. They have points of view. And if we go by that it's actually amazing that there was a success in 2016, but we can't let this continue to happen. It's very, very unfair.''What they're doing is tantamount to monopoly you can say,' Trump claimed. It's tantamount to taking over the airwaves. Can't let it happen. Otherwise we're not going to have a democracy. We're not going to have anything to do with a republic.'Trump also tried to use the power of federal purse strings as pressure, saying we 'are not going in any social media company that repress[es] free speech.' He said the government spends 'billions of dollars on giving them money' and called the firms 'rich enough,' although independent accounts put the total government ad spending far lower.'We're going to be doing none of it or very little of it,' Trump said.Asked if he would consider simply deleting his Twitter account given his concerns, Trump said he would 'do that in a heartbeat' if we had a 'fair press' in the U.S. The language of the order Trump signed specifically singled out Twitter for its decision to flag two of the president's tweets. The platform provided additional information, although it did not take down the tweets. It appeared to have been added since a draft order which was circulated widely in the run-up to the signing. 'Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias,' said the order. 'As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician's tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called 'Site Integrity' has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets.'Schiff is the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a favorite Trump target. Another section singled out four tech platforms - compared to a draft order which did not name Instagram and YouTube. 'Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see,' it said. Still another describes a new government 'working group' that will, among other things, evaluate media organizations with evidence of 'bias' being used to review content. ''Complaints described in section 4(b) of this order will be shared with the working group, consistent with applicable law. The working group shall also collect publicly available information regarding the following: (iv) reliance on third-party entities, including contractors, organizations, and individuals, with indicia of bias to review content,' it says.At least one section that did not appear in a draft form publicly available put new authority under Barr.A section on government expenditures on online ads states: 'The Department of Justice shall review the viewpoint-based speech restrictions imposed by each online platform identified in the report described in subsection (b) of this section and assess whether any online platforms are problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception to consumers, or other bad practices.'  A section on the FCC considers a newly-added hedge. 'The FTC shall consider developing a report' on whether complaints alleging a violation of the law implicate its provisions. A draft said the agency would produce the report - effectively giving it an exit from actually producing one.One section has the AG's working group probe an area with a financial angle, whether the platforms' policies act in ways 'that limit the ability of users with particular viewpoints to earn money on the platform compared with other users similarly situated.'Shares in Twitter, the target of Trump's anger for the fact check, were down 3% by early afternoon, but those in Facebook rose slightly. Its founder Mark Zuckerberg told CNBC he did not want to be an 'arbiter of truth,' and criticized Twitter's Jack Dorsey for the factchecks. Google shares were also up. It has not passed comment on the row.Facebook rejected the order, saying it would lessen free speech not expand it by making platforms unwilling to publish anything controversial.The crucial legal section is Trump's order to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to clarify how to enforce regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.That is the federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for users' posts.But the order says that the protection should not apply if companies are 'engaged in editorial conduct' - meaning making a judgment for themselves about how people's points of view are presented.That is what Trump accuses Twitter of doing by fact-checking him, and what conservatives claim happens to their posts which are promoted less than those with more liberal viewpoints. Such a move could open up Twitter, Facebook and other platforms to an avalanche of lawsuits from people claiming their views have been unfairly censored. It also requires the agency to look at whether social media platforms are using 'deceptive' policies to moderate content by not openly declaring how they decide how viewpoints are dealt with.Trump also set up a mechanism allowing Americans to report alleged political censorship or bias by the social media giants which will be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission.The White House tech bias reporting tool will collect complaints of online censorship and submit them to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The White House launched a similar tool last year but it is now closed.The order was also rejected by civil liberties groups - and by the Chamber of Commerce, normally a reliable supporter of Republican policy. 'This executive order, likely unconstitutional, is also intended to distract the public's attention away from the fact that there are now over 100,000 Covid-related deaths across the country and an economy that is sinking to Great Depression levels,' said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in a statement. Anti-conservative bias claims on social media  Facebook internal report admitted bias Facebook last year opened itself to an independent investigation of anti-conservative bias after repeated criticism from Trump.The audit, carried out by former Republican Senator Jon Kyl and others, found that the tech giant was still some way off eliminating its bias.It concluded that Facebook's efforts to counter fake news had silenced conservative voices. One example, was that fact-checking sites used by the social media giant were inherently left-leaning.In addition, it found that Facebook's ads policy could have restricted anti-abortion advocacy. Kyl's report said: 'Facebook has recognized the importance of our assessment and has taken some steps to address the concerns we uncovered. But there is still significant work to be done to satisfy the concerns we heard from conservatives.'Don Jr. claimed to be hit by 'Shadow banning'A series of high-profile pro-Trump figures have claimed that Twitter and Instagram have made it harder to find their accounts or individual posts.Among those making the claim have been Donald Trump Jr., and Mark Meadows, at the time a congressman and now Trump's White House chief of staff, and Jim Jordan, a prominent Trump defender.Trump Jr. made the claim in his book, Triggered.Twitter has denied that it was involved in such a practice but did update its algorithm when the controversy erupted in July 2016. Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - has said it does not alter the prominence of posts for political reasons.James Woods is banned from Twitter The conservative actor and prominent tweeter was locked out of his account in May 2019 for tweeting: ''If you try to kill the King, you best not miss'#HangThemAll.'Candace Owens suspended by Twitter after criticizing lockdownConservative commentator Candace Owens tweeted earlier this month: 'Apparently @GovWhitmer believes she is a duly elected dictator of a socialist country. The people of Michigan need to stand up to her. Open your businesses. Go to work. The police think she's crazy too. They are not going to arrest 10,000,000 people for going to work.'A Twitter spokesman confirmed that Owens' tweet violated its Covid-19 fake news policy. Twitter said the tweet would be deleted and Owens would serve a 'timeout' before being allowed to log back on. Google accused of censorship of views on abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism on its YouTube platformIn February, Google persuaded a federal appeals court on Wednesday to reject claims that YouTube illegally censored Prager University, a conservative nonprofit run by radio talk show host Dennis Prager.PragerU claimed that YouTube's opposition to its political views led it to tag dozens of videos on such topics as abortion, gun rights, Islam and terrorism for its 'Restricted Mode' setting, and block third parties from advertising on the videos.Writing for the appeals court, however, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said YouTube was a private forum despite its 'ubiquity' and public accessibility, and hosting videos did not make it a 'state actor' for purposes of the First Amendment.Clinton scourge Tulsi Gabbard sues Google over violating free speech Last year she announced she was suing Google for $50million after it suspended her advertising account in the hours after a Democratic debate because it was trying to silence her.Although she's a Democrat, Gabbard's nationalist ideals have put her at odds with the Democratic party.Hillary Clinton suggested the Iraq War veteran was a Russian asset. Tulsi Now Inc. said in the lawsuit filed in July 2019 that Google violated her right to free speech and didn't provide 'a straight answer' for suspending her ads account.Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify ban Infowars' Alex JonesIn 2018, Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify banned pages and content from Infowars and the show's host Alex Jones. A Facebook spokesman referred to content which it said glorified violence and the use of dehumanizing language to describe Muslims and migrants. These violated their graphic violence and hate speech policies.The spokesman noted conspiracy theories espoused by Jones on events like the 9/11 attacks and Sandy Hook school shooting, were not the reason for his ban. YouTube followed suit a few hours later, as did Spotify, after Apple removed Jones from its podcast directory. Laura Loomer banned from Twitter after she claimed Ilhan Omar was 'anti Jewish' and supported Shariah law It comes as a federal appeals court this week upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit that accused Twitter, Facebook and other tech giants of conspiring to stifle the political views of far-right activist, Laura Loomer, and a conservative nonprofit, Freedom Watch. In November 2018, Loomer handcuffed herself to the front doors of Twitter headquarters in New York after the company banned her. The company permanently suspended Loomer's account, which had more than 260,000 followers, after she tweeted that Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, is 'anti Jewish' and supports Sharia law.Facebook also banned Loomer, who is running for a Florida congressional seat as a Republican.In March 2019, U.S District Judge Trevor McFadden said their suit raises 'non-trivial concerns' but didn't tie these concerns to viable legal claims. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also blasted the move.'We believe that free speech and the right to engage in commerce are foundational to the American free enterprise system,' a Chamber official said in a statement, the New York Times reported. 'Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States. An executive order cannot be properly used to change federal law.' Facebook issued a statement saying limiting the section of communications law would have the opposite effect of protecting free speech.'Facebook is a platform for diverse views. We believe in protecting freedom of expression on our services, while protecting our community from harmful content including content designed to stop voters from exercising their right to vote,' it said, NBC news reported on Twitter. 'Those rules apply to everybody. Repealing or limiting section 230 will have the opposite effect. It will restrict more speech online, not less. 'By exposing companies to potential liability for everything that billions of people around the world say, this would penalize companies that choose to allow controversial speech and encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyoneThe order says it received 16,000 responses of alleged bias and suggests that they will form part of the Federal Trade Commission's investigation. The order also requires the attorney general to establish a working group including state attorneys general that will examine the enforcement of state laws that prohibit online platforms from engaging in unfair and deceptive acts. And it says the AG's group should look into who carries out factchecks for social media platforms and whether they have 'indicia of bias.'And federal agencies are to be told to review their advertising on social media platforms, which was worth $1.5 billion in the last decade. Trump described it as 'billions and billions of dollars.'Section 230 of the 1996 law is a shield against social media networks being sued for what people post on their platforms.It says: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.' It also says that: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.' A publisher or speaker can normally be sued for defamation for the contents of their speech but by not being categorized as those, any attempt to sue social media giants for what is written on them falls at the first hurdle.The 1996 statute has allowed Silicon Valley to make billions of dollars from their users' posts, photos and videos, with minimal legal liability, while giving them freedom to remove anything they see as 'objectionable.' When it was written social media did not exist.Since its explosive growth, platforms including Twitter and Facebook have changed repeatedly.Their algorithms decide the order in which users see new posts, and can be used to make particular content more or less visible.That has led critics to say that they are behaving as publishers - deciding what people read or see - and not simply as forums.The rest of the act gives forums powers to set standards for content, which social media platforms have used as a basis for moderating content and to justify the existence of algorithms. Conservatives - and many others outside mainstream thought on matters like history, climate change and even the coronavirus - have criticized the use of Section 230 claiming big tech has censored content without being subject to scrutiny. Republican senators Marco Rubio (FL) and Josh Hawley (MO) were among those who slammed Twitter for putting its fact-checking flag on the president's tweets.Rubio said: 'The law still protects social media companies like @Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers. 'But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher then they should no longer be shielded from liability &amp; treated as publishers under the law.' Hawley, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it 'raises serious questions about whether Twitter targeted the President for political reasons.' There is however zero possibility of a Democratic House passing reforms to the law itself.That leaves Trump trying to use the powers of the executive branch.The order also puts a prohibition on federal tax dollars going to online platforms that 'violate free speech principles.' But a report last February showed the feds spent just $8 million on social media ads in 2018. The idea of broadening the platforms' legal exposure carried more weight. Under the order, the Commerce Secretary would file a petition for new FCC rule-making. It would make platforms liable when actions are 'deceptive, pretextrual, or inconsistent with a provider's terms of service,' or when taken with 'inadequate notice' or by an 'unreasoned explanation.' Trump himself has made ample use of lawsuits and legal threats over his career. USA found in 2016 Trump and his companies had been involved in 3,500 lawsuits over three decades.Trump's moves brought immediate pushback. 'This is simply setting the wheels of law enforcement and regulation in motion against a private company for questioning the president,' said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, according to the Washington Post. Added former FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, 'Social media can be frustrating. But an executive order that would turn the Federal Communications Commission into the president's speech police is not the answer.' Jesse Blumenthal, head of the Koch-backed Stand Together group, said it was 'just nonsense' to try to rewrite a clear statute through an executive order. The rule's first section contains language that is more political than technical, following reports the administration rushed to put it out.It calls free speech 'the bedrock of American democracy' and says having a limited number of platforms 'hand-pick' speech is 'fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.' Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tweeted: 'Here's the inevitable effect ... all comments sections will be taken down. No website has the resources to actively edit all comments in order to shield themselves from liability, and no website is willing to leave comments entirely standards-free.'Pachter said that fact-checking 'is a stupid idea on Twitter's part' and that instead they should just delete tweets which are reported, warn the offender or suspend them for breaking its rules. Trump had claimed Wednesday in a Twitter thread that conservatives are being silenced and disproportionately regulated on social media websites like Twitter and Facebook as Twitter issued 'misleading' warning labels on two of his tweets about mail-in voting on Tuesday.'Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,' the president posted to his Twitter Wednesday morning. 'We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that happen again.'The warning was issued after Trump reacted with fury to having two of his tweets labelled as misleading, with links to news articles suggesting they were false attached. Responding to the 'fact checking' Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale said: 'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters.'Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them.' In contrast, Twitter's Jack Dorsey refused to take down the president's tweets where he touted a debunked conspiracy theory that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of a staffer when he was a Republican U.S. congressman from Florida. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg meanwhile criticized his competitor and said it was not the place of private companies to interfere in what people say online. Speaking to Fox News, Zuckerberg said: 'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this ... I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.'Twitter users, including some Republicans, did not react kindly to the president suggesting increased regulations on social media websites.Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg goes after Twitter for its fact-checking of Trump  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg criticized competitor Twitter on Thursday after it 'fact-checked' tweets from Donald Trump.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey immediately fired back saying that the site would continue to call out 'incorrect or disputed information' about elections shared by users. In his interview with Fox, Facebook's Zuckerberg said that it was not the place of the company to act as an 'arbiter of truth'.'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' he said.'I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,' he added.'Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.'Dorsey tweeted: 'Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me. Please leave our employees out of this. We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make,' he wrote. 'Per our Civic Integrity policy, the tweets yesterday may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot (only registered voters receive ballots),' he added. 'We're updating the link on @RealDonaldTrump's tweet to make this more clear.'Michael Pachter, research analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told Fox Business: 'Twitter came up with a rule that applies to one person ...'They're not treating (Trump) the way they treat everybody else. They came up with a separate set of rules just for him, which is fact-checking, because they're too afraid of his bullying to delete the tweet or suspend him.' Prominent conservative Margot Cleveland, whose work has been featured in several right leaning news publications, weighed in claiming any private organization has the right to decide what speech can and cannot be featured on their platform.'Pro Tip: Saying Twitter is violating your constitutional right to free speech or your First Amendment rights is wacko b/c Twitter ain't the government,' Cleveland wrote Wednesday morning. 'Saying Twitter is 'stifling free speech' isn't. Powerful private organizations can &amp; do stifle speech.' Trump critic and Republican George Conway, who is married to White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway, reposted a message from the State Department spokeswoman that contradicted the president's tweet.'The State Department's spokesperson, a couple of hours after the President of the United States suggested that the government may 'strongly regulate' social media platforms or 'close them down,'' Conway wrote as a lead up.Morgan Ortagus tweeted from the official State Department spokesperson account: 'Governments that restrict internet access deprive their citizens of the information they need to stay safe. #FreedomOfExpression both online and offline is vital, especially during COVID-19. @StateDept is proud to be an active member of the @FO_Coalition.' Kellyanne Conway criticized Twitter for flagging the tweets, lashing out at Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site Integrity, during an interview with Fox &amp; Friends Wednesday.She even cited his Twitter handle on live television to make sure Republicans knew where to direct their complaints.'This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it. He's the head of integrity at Twitter,' Conway lamented.'It's horrible the way he looks at people who should otherwise have a free and clear platform on Twitter.' Trump also re-asserted his flagged tweets' theme in his Wednesday morning tweet: 'Just like we can't let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country.'Trump views that mail-in ballots will increase the chances of voter fraud - and benefit Democrats in 2020.'It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots,' Trump insisted. 'Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!' On Tuesday, the president tweeted that California's mail-in balloting initiative would lead to substantial voter fraud in the November general election.Biased head of Twitter's 'Site Integrity' has previously called the President 'a racist tangerine'   Yoel Roth, whose official title at Twitter is head of Site Integrity, faced backlash on Wednesday after his history of anti-Trump tweets emerged less than 24 hours after the social media giant put a fact-checking warning on two of the president's tweets. In a January 2017 tweet, Roth referred to the Trump administration as 'actual Nazis in the White House' and tweeted in November 2016 that fly over states were racist.He also compared Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway to Nazi Joseph Goebbels saying: ''Today on Meet The Press, we're speaking with Joseph Goebbels about the first 100 days...' - What I hear whenever Kellyanne is on a news show.'The majority of Roth's tweets criticizing Trump and his administration were posted around 2017.Roth started working at Twitter in 2015 as a product trust partner, according to his LinkedIn profile.He has been in his current role as head of site integrity for almost two years.Conway, who is a counselor to Trump, lashed out at Roth in an interview with Fox &amp; Friends on Wednesday and went as far as giving out his Twitter handle on live television.'This guy is constantly attacking Trump voters, Trump, Mitch McConnell, you name it. He's the head of integrity at Twitter,' Conway said.'It's horrible the way he looks at people who should otherwise have a free and clear platform on Twitter.' 'There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed,' Trump wrote Tuesday morning.He then insinuated that non-citizens would be able to obtain ballots.'The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one,' he continued in the Twitter rant. 'That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote.'Trump ended the two-tweet tirade by saying, 'This will be a Rigged Election.''No way!' said Trump, who votes in Florida absentee.The president used a mail-in ballot to vote in the Florida primary last month - a move his administration has defended since he cannot show up for in-person voting while living in Washington, D.C. By Tuesday afternoon, Twitter had flagged the tweets with a blue exclamation mark prompting users to 'get the facts about mail-in ballots.'Another page on the social media site called Trump's tweets 'unsubstantiated,' according to fact-checkers from CNN, Washington Post and other news outlets.'These tweets contain potentially misleading information about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots,' a statement from Twitter read. Following the move from Twitter, Trump used the social media site he is attacking to decry its decision to label his tweets 'misleading' and accused them of 'stifling free speech.' He threatened the tech giant, stating he wouldn't allow it to continue.'@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post,' Trump wrote Tuesday night.'Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!' he asserted.Trump's 2020 campaign was quick to slam the move.'We always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters. Partnering with the biased fake news media 'fact checkers' is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility. There are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them,' campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. For weeks Trump has said that states, not wanting to expose the voting public to COVID-19, shouldn't be implementing full-scale mail-in balloting plans. The president has drawn a distinction between absentee ballots, which he said can be used for special purposes, and governors sending every American voter a ballot to send back in. 'I have to do an absentee because I'm voting in Florida and I happen to be president and I live in that beautiful house over there that's painted white,' he said in the Rose Garden Tuesday. Trump's tweets came after the Republican National Committee and two other GOP groups filed a lawsuit Sunday against California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had signed an executive order to use mail-in ballots for the November election. 'In California the governor, I hear, is sending millions of ballots all over the state. Millions, to anybody. People that aren't citizens, illegals, anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot,' Trump said at the White House Tuesday.'We are not going to destroy this county by allowing things like that to happen. We're not destroying our country,' he added. Republicans long have been suspicious that making voting easier would elect more Democrats. Young people, for instance, tend to tilt more Democratic, but are also less likely to vote in-person. California was the first state in the country to commit to sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters for the November election, a move responding to the coronavirus pandemic.'Democrats continue to use this pandemic as a ploy to implement their partisan election agenda, and Governor Newsom's executive order is the latest direct assault on the integrity of our elections,' Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. 'No state that conducts all-mail elections automatically mails ballots to inactive voters because it invites fraud, coercion, theft, and otherwise illegitimate voting,' it added.The lawsuit asks for Newsom's order to be barred as unlawful and was filed by the RNC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the California Republican Party.Numerous studies have found little evidence of voter fraud connected to voting by mail. Democrats say it is necessary to counter health risks from the coronavirus by helping to prevent crowds at polling places.Last Wednesday, Trump denounced plans to expand voting by mail in Michigan and Nevada, two key swing states. He briefly threatened to withhold federal funding for the two states but dropped the warning after an avalanche of criticism from Democrats. Since winning the 2016 election via the Electoral College, but losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, the president has alleged that 'millions' of people voted illegally in California and that's how Clinton had such an edge. There was no evidence of wide-scale voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election. What is the truth about Trump's fact-checked Tweet? Twitter's fails to answer American politics' most bitterly disputed question: Could fraud swing a presidential election? Twitter ignited a war with Donald Trump by attaching a fact-check to his tweets about mail-in ballots Tuesday, labeling them misleading and calling some of his claims 'false.' Its move puts the social media platform immediately at odds with Trump and his Republican Party.Twitter has not said why it chose these tweets particularly, or how it assembled its own factcheck. Additionally, its head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, has been plunged into the center of the row with his history of anti-Trump tweets surfacing. Here we analyze the controversy over the dueling claims about fraud.What Donald Trump said  What Twitter said Breaking down each side's claims What Trump said: There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. This is the heart of Trump's - and Republicans' - anti-mail-in ballot push. But it is impossible to either entirely prove or disprove because it is a prediction.There is however substantial evidence that mail-in ballots are not 'substantially' fraudulent: they are used universally in five states - Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah. Oregon was the first to go all mail-in, in 2000.That means every voter is sent a ballot in advance, which they can either return completed during early voting by mail or in person at a polling place, or take uncompleted to a polling center on election day. None of these states has been hit by increased claims of electoral fraud which would render their elections 'substantially fraudulent.' In Oregon, for example, the Secretary of State's office referred 57 cases of possible fraud to prosecutors, resulting in 10 prosecutions after the 2016 presidential elections. Among them were a student who voted in Colorado as well as Oregon when her parents sent her a ballot from home, and a woman who voted for herself and her daughter.[item name=video id=4376408 style=2 /]As for how those 10 cases would have changed the election, four were Democrats, one Republican, one Libertarian and four unaffiliated; Oregon voted for Hillary Clinton by 1,002,106 to 782,403 for Donald Trump. The tiny scale of prosecuted cases is a pattern across the country: the White House highlighted a report from the conservative Heritage Foundation which runs a database of fraud cases, but it managed to come up with just over 1,000 cases of all types of fraud going back as far as 1994, covering elections at every level. Similarly, in 2012, a large-scale investigation commissioned by the Knight Foundation found 491 instances of absentee ballot fraud in the previous 12 years. It said that level appeared to be higher than in voting in person; in the same period it found only 10 cases of people impersonating other voters at a polling place.However in that same period, the total number of votes cast by Americans runs far into the billions and there have been no cases where an entire state's elections have been declared to be 'substantially fraudulent' or anything equivalent to that. In fact, levels of fraud uncovered by investigation after investigation are consistently extremely low. For example, the U.S. Attorney in North Carolina ordered an audit of the 2016 election, where more than 4.5 million ballots were cast in a state which voted for Trump but is seen now as a possible swing state.It uncovered the following - effectively about 500 votes which were ineligible:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>400 suspected felons and 41 non-citizens had voted illegally</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>34 citizens were wrongly refused the right to vote because they were mistakenly declared ineligible</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>two suspected cases of voter impersonation - it was not specified whether this was in person or by mail</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>24 people who voted twice, mostly in other states.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The exercise suggests that the numbers were far too small to move the results of the election. If translated to states with closer margins - such as Michigan - such a scale of fraud would still do nothing to change the outcome. </p><p>Analysis: It is impossible to disprove Trump's claim that voting will be 'substantially fraudulent,' but he has no evidence to back it up. Mail-in voting has happened for many years with a very low level of fraud but it appears to be at a higher level than fraud for voting in person. Trump's use of the word 'substantially' flies in the face of past experience</p><p>Trump: Mail boxes will be robbed</p><p>Mail theft is a constant problem for the Postal Service but there do not appear to be prosecuted cases where the intention was to steal ballots.</p><p>Ballots have however been stolen along with other items; in Anchorage, Alaska in 2018 KTUU reported that 46 ballots and other sodden mail were found in a snowbank after being reported missing from a set of mailboxes. </p><p>They were returned, voided and new ballots issued to the voters affected.

There do not appear to be cases of entirely forged ballot papers.</p><p>Analysis: Highly unlikely to happen </p><p>Trump: Ballots will be 'illegally printed out'</p><p>It is unclear exactly what Trump means with this, making it difficult to analyze. </p><p>He may mean that ballots are issued in excess numbers or to illegal immigrants. </p><p>The number of mail-in ballots applications or ballots issued has been a long-running point of contention between Republicans and Democrats.</p><p>Republican groups including Judicial Watch have sued a number of states - among them California - claiming they issue voting papers to defunct voters, who may have died or moved.</p><p>Republicans broadly have been active in 'purging' voter rolls and introducing use-it-or-lose-it voting laws, which the Supreme Court upheld as constitutional. </p><p>California settled a case with the group in 2017, agreeing to contact 1.5 million people who were possibly inactive voters and removing them from the voter roll if they did not respond.</p><p>However in Ohio, the Republican secretary of state released a list of 'inactive voters' to be purged, only for tens of thousands of names on the list to be discovered to be errors who were still active voters.</p><p>Analysis: Confused at best </p><p>Trump: Ballots will be fraudulently signed</p><p>Forging signatures to impersonate another voter appears to be the most common form of fraud - but is still vanishingly rare.</p><p>The most prominent case to help Trump's claim is, ironically, one involving Republicans in North Carolina.</p><p>There the 2018 election for the 9th District was voided because of suspicions that a Republican contractor for Mark Harris had 'harvested' ballots and then had them filled in by members of his staff.</p><p>Mail-in ballots went Republican by 60% but just 16% of those who used them were registered to the party; Harris 'won' by a wafer-thin margin of 905 votes.</p><p>The contractor, Leslie Dowless, got his staff to go door-to-door in Bladen County and offer 'assistance' to people to request then fill in ballots; his stepdaughter admitted she simply signed them herself. Most of the targets were African-American. </p><p>They had done the same for the primary and Harris had beaten the incumbent, with 437 mail-in ballots for Harris, the challenger, to just 17 for the incumbent.</p><p>The fraud was the largest in modern history, and there had been warnings about Dowless' suspicious conduct before, but he had not been investigated. </p><p>The true scale of Dowless' crimes - and the number of ballots 'fraudulently signed' remains unclear. A total of 437 were submitted int he primary, and he was charged with specimen cases in the general election prosecution.</p><p>The last time a congressional election was voided was in 1974, and the re-run was the first ever ordered because of fraud.</p><p>Dowless' motive was financial, having billed $5 Republicans per absentee vote he 'helped.' </p><p>However, the scale of fraud which would be needed to sway a presidential election is far greater than Dowless was operating on, and there is no evidence that anything on that scale has happened.</p><p>Apart from anything else, at $5 a vote, the cost would be huge. </p><p>Election officials say that they have two levels of checks in place for preventing fraudulent signatures - first, inspecting for envelope tampering, and secondly signature verification.</p><p>That is itself fraught with challenges, including that people's signatures may change over time, but has been held up by officials of both parties as a robust system that prevents fraud. </p><p>Analysis: Such fraud undoubtedly happens but the scale involved is tiny compared to the scale of voting. Ironically the best proof for Trump's case involves his own party</p><p>Trump: The governor of California is sending ballots to... anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one</p><p>Gavin Newsom's executive order states that the ballots will go to registered voters. </p><p>Trump suggests they will go to illegal immigrants, who cannot register to vote.</p><p>Put simply, as long as the register of voters is accurate, then there is no prospect that they will got to illegal immigrants. </p><p>There have been cases of non-citizens who have been mistakenly registered, including 1,500 who were mistakenly sent ballots in June 2018 after an error at the DMV in California. </p><p>However it is unknown how many of those were illegal immigrants rather than legal immigrants, or under-18s, and it is also unknown how many - if any - voted. If they had voted, they would have been criminally liable.</p><p>In contrast to a potential 1,500 illegal votes, more than 6.6 million ballots were cast in that primary in California. </p><p>Analysis: Trump is wrong - as long as California's list of electors is up to date </p><p>Trump: Professionals telling all of those people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote</p><p>Trump is referring to the practice known by Republicans as 'ballot harvesting,' where politically-aligned groups collect mail-in ballots and return them for counting.</p><p>Ballot harvesting is among the most complicated areas of election law, and whether and how it is allowed varies state by state. </p><p>Some states - including Texas - have explicitly outlawed anybody returning an absentee ballot, or allowing only a family member to do so.</p><p>But others have no such restrictions, and there is no federal law on it. In Arizona, an attempt to ban it was deemed to fall foul of the Voting Rights Act.</p><p>Broadly, 27 states allow third-parties to collect and return ballots, but with a patchwork of restrictions; for example in Colorado, one person can return no more than 10 ballots. </p><p>California changed the law so that in the 2018 cycle, third-party groups could encourage people to fill in mail-in ballots and collect them. The main restriction is that collectors cannot be paid per ballot. </p><p>Republicans say this contributed to a blue wave which overwhelmed their members of Congress in the state - although the blue wave was repeated across the country.</p><p>There is nothing wrong in any state with asking people who have not voted to consider voting - in fact it is the basis of much campaigning, such as volunteers of both parties driving the elderly to vote on election day - or for that matter lobbying them about who they should vote for. </p><p>What is definitely true is that where legal, ballot-harvesting can juice turn-out - and it's not just Democrats who think that.</p><p>Devin Nunes, one of Trump's most reliably loyal Congressional defenders and a California Republican told Fox News this month that a 'robust ballot-harvesting operation' was vital to the party in November.</p><p>'I hate saying that because it's illegal in 49 states,' he said, mis-stating the complexities of the law over it.</p><p>Fraud associated with ballot harvesting does not appear to have been formally reported in California but some Republicans have offered anecdotal suggestions that it took pace in 2018.</p><p>Where ballot harvest fraud definitely happened as in North Carolina's 9th district in 2018, when Republican operative Leslie Dowless illegally persuaded voters to either complete a mail-in application and ballot for his party, or had his staff fill them in himself. </p><p>The state bans any handling of a ballot by a third party, but Dowless did so on a scale which was enough to void a congressional election for the first time since 1974. </p><p>Analysis: What Trump says will happen is not necessarily illegal in any form, but can be depending on the state. It has been practiced illegally on a large scale in one well-known case - to benefit Republicans</p><p>Twitter: Trump falsely claimed that mail-in ballots would lead to 'a Rigged Election.' However, fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud.</p><p>There is evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to fraud - cases of it have been prosecuted after every election cycle. </p><p>The issue which is political divisive is the scale on which it happens.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly made claims it involves 'millions' of votes but there has never been any proof that he is correct.</p><p>His own commission on electoral fraud was disbanded without reporting, and no large-scale findings to back up his claims of vast fraud have been made.</p><p>But there have repeatedly been prosecutions of fraud linked to mail-in ballots - even if the numbers are vanishingly low in comparison </p><p>Analysis: Twitter are wrong to state categorically that there is no fraud.

Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, March 22nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  My exclusive interview with President Trump coming up.  The Commander-in-Chief speaking out on his surprise Golan Heights announcement yesterday.  Now Syria slamming the President this morning and vowing to recovery Golan Heights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have been thinking about doing it for a long time.  It's been a very hard decision for every President.  No President has done it.  Every President has said, do that.  I'm the one that gets it done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Part two of my exclusive interview with the President coming up right here.  Meanwhile this, the deadly 737 Max crash hitting Boeing's bottom line.  The jetmaker is  facing its first Max order cancellation.</p><p>Apple on top.  The technology giant set to unveil its streaming service on Monday.  And the stock is higher ahead of the announcement.  Take a look.  Plus, the 2019 IPO boom is heating up.  Uber and Pinterest reportedly making their choices on where they will list their stock.  What that means for timeline to go public this morning.</p><p>And we're looking at weakness at the open.  We are off of the lows of the morning but futures indicating a decline of 134 points.  This is taking a cue from Europe because we have the Purchasing Manager's Indexes  out in the Eurozone.  They were weaker than expected.  So the U.S. market is following Europe lower.  Futures indicating a decline 13 on the S&amp;P and 26 points lower on the NASDAQ.</p><p>After a rally yesterday meanwhile, technology stocks led the way yesterday.  Take a look at the Dow at the close up 216 points yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up 30 and the NASDAQ was up 110 points, 1-1/2 percent on the hills of strength intact.  In Europe this morning, those PMI's, Purchasing Managers' Index is really weighing on markets.  FT-100 down 1-1/4 percent.  The CAC quarante is down better than one percent and the DAX Index in Germany weaker by three-quarters of a percent, 82 points lower.</p><p>In Asia overnight, fractional movers across the board but they were higher  All those stories coming up this Friday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the American Conservative Union Chairman, Matt Schlapp, and the Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath.  Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Great to see you, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They do.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  There is this -- the economy going on in the markets right now about growth, the stock market is near these new highs but the bond market is signaling that the whole world economy is slowing down.  That's s why those PMI numbers that you mentioned, the lead up were really interesting.  The bond market seems to be right about what's going on with the growth but the stock market doesn't care.  They're buying in part because the Fed is keeping policies --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because where the Fed is but in Europe I feel like there's not a lot of wiggle room if things continue to worsen.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There's -- no, rates are already negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So that's why those PMI numbers you mentioned are really important because there's very little that they can do if they fall into recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll keep watching that.  Meanwhile, we begin with part two of my exclusive interview with President Trump right now.  The Commander-in-Chief laying out the reasons why he suddenly declared it is time for the United States to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.  We began though with the impending release of the Mueller report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now we're going to get the Mueller report.  What are you expecting?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, it's always interesting to me because a deputy that didn't get votes appoints a man that didn't get any votes.  He's going to write a report on me.  I had one of the greatest elects victories in history.  Would you say that's true?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Absolutely.</p><p>TRUMP:  They came from the valleys, they came from the rivers, they came from the cities, they came from all over, they voted in one of the greatest elections in the history of our country and now I have a man that because we have an attorney general who -- nobody can even believe that, he didn't tell me but he recused himself.  So I have a man who was a deputy, who I don't know - who I didn't know at all and he appoints a man who had just left my office.  I didn't give him job at the FBI.  Comey his best friend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we covered every --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP:  Wait a minute.  Listen.  And you know better than anybody, you've been very fair to me on that.  But think of it, I have a deputy appoints a man to write a report on me, to make a determination of my presidency?  People will not stand for it.  Now, with all of that being said for two years we've gone through this nonsense, with -- because there's no collusion with the Russia, you know that better than anybody.</p><p>And there's no obstruction to say, oh, wait, there was no collusion, that was a hoax but he obstruct it and fighting against the hoax, OK?  Think about that one for a second.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And at the same time, the same group is running the Hillary Clinton investigation and now we heard from the Lisa Page testimony which was released that the Obama Department of Justice suggested we're not going to bring charges, so get off of this.  So, during the campaign I remember you said, look, it's time to get away from Hillary Clinton, let's forget about this now.</p><p>Do you still feel that way or do you think you want to see a accountability here given the fact that now we know that the DOJ under Obama did say we're not going to bring charges to the FBI.</p><p>TRUMP:  That's great question.  So when I won, I made my opening speech everyone chanting lock her up, lock her up, lock her up.  I said, no, no, no, let's forget it.  Let's get on to the future but they have treated me so viciously, they have treated me so badly and we did nothing wrong.  You look at the other -- and all of these people you hear about, that had nothing to do with Russia, Russia collusion, nothing.</p><p>It's all a big hoax, it's a witch-hunt and it's a hoax.  So you asked me a question, it's very interesting question.  The way they've treated me and we have found many crimes on the other side.  These are stone-cold crimes what they've done between the deletion of 33,000 e-mails and many, many other things, Comey is lying, all of the Brenman lying, the lies to Congress and these are just absolute lies to Congress.</p><p>Clapper lied to Congress.  Nobody does anything.  If somebody -- they all say Flynn, I don't know anything about what he said but the FBI said he didn't lie.  Mueller said he did lie.  So what's that all about?  And then they destroy a man who is a general and a respected man for many years.  They've treated -- we have -- we have been treated very, very unfairly.  All because Jeff Sessions didn't have a clue, OK?  And he recused himself.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will William Barr follow this?  Will --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  I think -- look, I have a lot of respect for him, I've never known him, he is a very, very smart respected man.  Hopefully he will do what's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now --</p><p>DOBBS:  And all I can ask you is what's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mueller is going to drop the report, the southern districts is on you, there's -- these other investigations by the Democrats.</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, you know, they say there are lots of things but I don't know about these things, OK?  Just so you understand.  Everyone says this one, that one.  I don't even know about this.  I call, I said to my lawyers, are we being looked at here?  They don't even know what people are talking about.  There's so much fake news out there, it's a disgrace.  If you look over the past two years, how many breaking news stories was there about me that turned out to be nonexistent?  So many of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How you going to get anything done with all of this?</p><p>TRUMP:  This should never happen to another President.  What happened to me, they came up with an excuse for losing an election, this should never happen to another President because most Presidents wouldn't be able to take it.  I know the politicians, I know the President, I know -- I know what we're dealing with.  Most people wouldn't be able to take it.  Let me tell you something, Maria.</p><p>What happened to me should never happen to another President of the United States, because I depend on this right here, mine, not other people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP:  And what they've done is a fraud.  It's a fake.  It's a witch-hunt.  It should never happen to another President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there anything you see that you would like to work with the Democrats on in these next two years?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We could work on a lot.  We could work on a lot.  And I think the easiest thing frankly of all I could have started with number but one I want to get the tax cuts which we got.  The easiest thing is infrastructure, they want it, I want it, I spoke to Nancy Pelosi about it the other day.  We agree on it.  We even like the type -- I think we like the type of infrastructure we're talking about.</p><p>Maybe in a certain way more Democrats from our standpoint than the Republican concept.  Private, public.  I like frankly owning our own roads, owning our bridges.  I don't like selling them to other countries.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- they don't want you to have any victor.</p><p>TRUMP:  I think it's very feasible because I think they want to do it.  I mean, Nancy Pelosi told me very strongly they want to do infrastructure and we have other things we can do too.  I we should do something on immigration, immigration is a total disaster in this country.  We have laws that are so bad.  People pouring in.  I'll tell you what, border security, border patrol, what they've done is incredible.</p><p>The job they're doing, the job that ISIS is doing, what they're doing, without the protection and the ability to have a wall now -- and by the way, we're building a lot of wall right now, you know that.  We're building the wall and it's going up fast, big, strong, looks good, not the horrible thing that they were building before I got here.  We're building the wall now.  We're going to have a lot of wall built pretty soon.  But if you don't have that, you can't have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you want to go up against in 2020?</p><p>TRUMP:  So you have people saying a lot of weird things, you know, I hear not only the Green New Deal but so many others, so many things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Medicare of All, tax on wealth, 70 percent tax rates.</p><p>TRUMP:  You have -- you have Beto -- so you have Beto and Beto comes out and he says, let's take down the wall.  If you ever took down the wall, this country would be overrun, OK?  And we put up a lot of wall like in San Diego, so interesting, you have California.  So, in San Diego they're begging me to do the wall.  I end up doing the wall and then I see Governor of California criticizes me for the wall.</p><p>They're begging me do it.  Because if you don't have it and they know this better.  It's all a political deal, it's all politics.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to run against Beto?</p><p>TRUMP:  You know, my attitude is -- I wouldn't mind.  I mean, I'd love to have Biden, I'd love to have Bernie, I'd love to have Beto.  I mean, Beto seems to be the one the press has chosen.  The press seems to have chosen Beto.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this socialism versus capitalism?</p><p>TRUMP:  And when I watched Beto, I say, we could dream about that but whatever it is, no, I think it's competence, I think if somebody -- look, when I first ran, I was never a politicians.  I ran -- I ran in a certain platform.  I've done far more than I said I was going to do.  When you look at the tax cuts, when you look at the regulation cuts, more than any other President.  When you look at all -- it's the biggest tax cut.  You look at --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP:  You look at even a thing like right to try, what people can now use if they're terminally ill and they can use medicines that we've developed but that aren't out by signing a simple document.  They used to travel to Asia, to Europe, all over the world to try and get a cure.  You look at so many things that I've done for the veterans, choice, accountability, they never thought you'd have accountability.</p><p>You couldn't fire anybody if they treated our vets badly.  Now you have accountability.  Veterans choice where if they have to wait two weeks online or they have to two days, they can go out now, Maria, and see a private doctor and we pay for that doctor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. President, let me end on the Golan Heights because you tweeted about this day today in Israel, you said it is time for the U.S. to recognize Israel's s sovereignty and the Golan Heights.  Why now?  Why did you send that out?</p><p>TRUMP:  I've been thinking about doing it for a long time.  It's been a very hard decision for every President.  No President has done it.  They've all -- this is very much Jerusalem moving the embassy to Jerusalem.  I did that and I fully understand why every -- Clinton and Bush and Obama, everybody campaigned on Jerusalem and the embassy going to Jerusalem.  I even got the embassy built by the way very inexpensively.</p><p>But they campaigned on it, they never did it and I understand why, because when I got elected, I also campaigned on it.  When I got elected, I was inundated with calls from all over the world.  The leaders, mostly the leaders saying, please don't do it, don't do it.  I did it and it's been done and it's fine.  Golan Heights is the same thing for years of other Presidents have campaigned they said they'd do it.  This is sovereignty, this is security, this is about regional security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not about Netanyahu's reelection.</p><p>TRUMP:  No.  I don't -- I wouldn't even know about that.  I wouldn't even know about that.  I have no idea.  He is doing OK.  I don't know if he's doing great right but I hear he is doing OK.  But I would imagine the other side whoever is against him is also in  favor of what I just did.  Every President has said, do that.  I'm the one that gets it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. President, thanks so much.</p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile this morning, the Syrian government declared that it will recover the Golan Heights territory.  The government reportedly published a statement on the Syrian news agency Web site calling the President's statement \"irresponsible\" and that showed contempt for international law.  My thanks to President Trump.  Coming up.  The IPO boom.  Uber and Pinterest, two of the biggest names on the flat line to go public this year.</p><p>Both reportedly making a choice and where they will list their shares.  We've got the very latest there.  Then big moves for Apple.  The technology giant blowing past Microsoft becoming the world's most valuable public company.  It's preparing to unveil a new plan for its television service.  All the details after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tiffany out this morning with mixed earnings.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at markets.  Gerri, good morning to you.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey.  Good morning to you.  Yes.  Tiffany out with numbers.  We look at -- we're looking at a mixed result here.  Misses estimates, 1.32 billion on revenues against expectations of 1.33 billion.  You see stock down here.  EPS, a better story, $1.67 actual versus 1.61.  That is tiffany.  We also have Nike here, those results I'm waiting on right now.  In the premarket it's down almost five percent.</p><p>I don't have those numbers at this time.  I apologize.  I'm going to move on to the IPOs and we can get the Nike numbers up in a second.  Uber coming to the NYSE.  Big story here after Levi's highly successful IPO yesterday.  We have Uber coming to the NYSE.  That will be the biggest public offering of the year, possibly the top five in all time.  Officially filing in April.  That's the expectation and they would be valued $120 billion.</p><p>You know, rival Lyft is going to the NASDAQ.  And NYSE here been able to score a lot of big tech names, Alibaba, Twitter and now Uber.  Pinterest also coming to the NYSE in April.  That filing could be out today.  They have sped up their offering to take advantage of this Gogo IPO market.  They were last valued privately at $12 billion.  And Apple has plans for its T.V. service.  We're expecting details of that Monday.</p><p>Don't expect Netflix, that's not what's happening here.  They will sell other company's video subscription and take a cut of their transactions.  We're expecting them to bundle services like HBO, Showtime and Starz.  That's the expectations for Apple apologize about those Nike earnings.  Do we have them?  Apple is up premarket as we see a little bit.  That's going to be an exciting statement on Monday.  Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you so much.  Nike reported net income of $1.1 billion, that was 68 cents a share.  It was compared to a loss of 921 million a year earlier.  The issue here was North American sales growth which actually came in weaker than expected.  They said things are going well in China but there's also question in terms of China growth given the slowdown there.</p><p>So the stock is down 4-2/3 percent largely on the North American sales growth even though the earnings were actually better than expected at 68 cents a share, $1.1 billion.  Jon Hilsenrath, what are you watching today?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So -- I mean, there's two things from what you just talked about.  One was the consumer stocks look like they're a little on the soft side with these two reports, Tiffany and Nike.  So we have to look carefully at the consumer right now.  They took a hit to their wealth in the fourth quarter, the jobs numbers the last time we saw them for February were close to flat.  Now we have to see if consumer spending holds up.</p><p>The other thing I'd say though is these IPOs are potentially good news.  You know, the IPO market has been so soft for so long and, you know, that's kind of been a sign that the economy isn't really kind of generating a lot of new companies, a lot of innovation.  If we see the IPO market opening up and as an outlet for companies to go public, raise capital, it's a good sign for economic growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a good point but with all those new supply and stock you wonder how the market absorbs it.  So, I wonder, yes, it's a good news that we got such a boom in IPOs  but whether or not, investors are going to be able to absorb that and whether or not it means the broader market trades down is something to watch as well.  Matt, you wanted to make a comment?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.  Real quickly on your interview with President Trump which I thought was great.  The key thing that I don't think it's covered enough by reporters is that 24 hours before Mr. Mueller is picked to be the special counsel, the President tells him he will not pick him again to run the FBI.  So, the President essentially gilt Bob Mueller and then he has to read in the paper that Bob Mueller has this job of being the Special Counsel looking after the President.</p><p>The conflict there is just so odious that that in and of itself, you can see why the President sits in this craw that just could ever happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And not only that but the Special Counsel investigation was based on the FBI investigation into President Trump, then-candidate Trump which was based on real flimsy evidence.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You couldn't make this up if it was a story of fiction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an extraordinary story, it's like a movie what they did.  Coming up.  General Motors' mega investment.  The automaker ready to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a Midwest plant.  What it means for the company.  Back in a minute.  Then, forever friends, marking National Puppy Day.  We have the breed just named America's favorite.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More fallout from Boeing following the deadly crash of two of its 737 Max jets.  Cheryl Casone with details there.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Indonesia's flagship carrier Garuda Indonesia is seeking to cancel an order for 49 of Boeing 747 Max planes because customers don't think the aircraft is safe.  This is the first set request following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.  The jets were grounded worldwide this month after an Ethiopian Airline crashed that killed all 157 people onboard.  Taking a look at shares of Boeing, fractionally lower in the premarket right now.</p><p>Well drugmakers, Biogen and Eisai into their recent experimental Alzheimer's drug trial.  That (INAUDIBLE) yesterday.  The Biogen stock fell 29 percent.  Shares of Eisai dropped 35 percent.  Meanwhile, analyst are predicting that Biogen's next move might be an acquisition of a -- investment plan this morning and Michigan.  G.M. plans to invest $300 million in its Oriion Assembly plant to build a new electric vehicle for Chevy.</p><p>The plant is already producing an electric car.  The Chevy bolt and a self-driving vehicle for G.M. Cruise unit.  Now this becomes after G.M. said it's going to close its plant in Ohio, that, of course, angered President Trump.  We're going to learn more about the plan from G.M. CEO Mara Barra on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" 10 a.m. Eastern Time today.</p><p>OK.  There's this.  OK.  There is this.  Lots of Labrador love out there.  The breed once again has landed on top in America for the 28th year in a row.  The near three-decade run is kind of impressive and a German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, French bulldogs and then bulldogs round out the top five.  An in honor of National Puppy Day, Maria.  Congratulations on your new edition.  Baby Bella, I'm sure she can't wait to see it.  She probably really misses you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  I was so happy to have Bella Dusty at home.  I missed her.  I haven't been home in a week.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we'll celebrate National Puppy Day when I get home.  Dagen, are you going to be celebrating with Charlie this weekend?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  We celebrate every day and people even yesterday because I talked to him like he is a person out in public and people think that I've completely lost my mind.  But I would say this, rescue is our favorite breed, although I do love a lab.  There is a lab who is a working dog in the building.  Her name is Persia.  And Persia when I see her, she looks at me and flips over on her back and sticks all four legs in the air because she wants belly-rub.</p><p>She's supposed to be on the job and she's not but I will give her -- I always come up with some belly scratches for her.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nothing comes between belly rubs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  belly rubs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And puppies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Belly rubs.  You know what I'm talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Happy National Puppy Day, Dagen.  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back.  Defending the Green New Deal.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says her proposal is being misinterpreted.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SETH MEYERS, NBC HOST:  You would outlaw cows --</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  Oh, yes.</p><p>MEYERS:  Cows farting, that would be out.  Children, hamburgers, ice cream.</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ:  It's always good to see how these narratives are manipulated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will discuss it and then more of my exclusive interview with President Trump.  Don't miss it.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo live this morning in Washington.  It is Friday, March 22nd, your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast.  President Trump slamming the impending Mueller report in my exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  It's all a big hoax, it's a witch hunt and it's a hoax.  We have been treated very, very unfairly all because Jeff Sessions didn't have a clue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will get reaction from former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, coming up this morning.  We're taking a look at weakness at the opening of trading, Futures indicating a decline of almost 200 points.  This is taking a cue from Europe because we had Purchasing Managers' Index surveys out in France, in Germany.  A number of the European PMIs were weaker than expecting, showing that manufacturing within the Eurozone is weakening.  We know that it's expected to grow one percent, the Eurozone is in 2019.  So, that is weighing on European markets, and the U.S. is following suite.</p><p>European down across the board, FT-100 is down 100, 1-1/3 percent; CAC Quarante down 73, also 1-1/3 percent; and the DAX Index in Germany down 95 points.  Germany has had a tough -- rough go at it this week, after the Bayer sell-off as well.  It is down, again, almost one percent on the DAX Index.  In Asia overnight, markets were fractionally moving, but they were higher across the board.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the Green New Deal, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking out on the Green New Deal last night on \"Late Night.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ:  They're trying to say that the Green New Deal is about what we have to give up, what we have to cut back on, when in fact, the Green New Deal itself is a resolution to be more expansive.  It is to be able to generate more and to make sure that we're investing in working class -- in working-class Americans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I asked President Trump about the Green New Deal in my exclusive sit-down yesterday.  Here's what he had to say about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  The Democrats actually are becoming a far-left party.  You look at this Green New Deal, it's the most preposterous thing.  Now, I don't want to knock it too much right now, because I really hope they keep going forward with it, you know, frankly, because I think it's going to be very easy to beat.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Douglas Holtz-Eakin's group says it's going to cost $94 trillion.  Joining is right now is former Utah Congressman, former House Oversight Committee Chairman, and Fox News Contributor, Jason Chaffetz.  Jason, it's great to see you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  First, your thoughts on the Green New Deal, and whether or not this has legs.  Every time Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talks about it, she basically refers to it as broad strokes.  You know, don't worry about the fact that it doesn't make sense, don't worry about the fact that we're obviously not going to get rid of fossil fuels in the next 10 years.  That makes no sense.  It's just an idea.  What do you think?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, it's an actual piece of legislation that has been embraced by most of the Democratic 2020 candidates on the Democratic side of the party, so there's a lot to about worried about there.  The economics make no sense, the absurdity on its face is ridiculous.  But let's be careful as Republicans as from -- as a Republican point of view to summarily dismiss it when I think it'd be a mistake.  Because she is communicating with a younger generation who maybe hasn't looked at the economics of it, and they think, well, why can't we do these things?  If you believe that the world is going to end because of plastic straws in the next 10 years, you're looking at this and thinking this is a viable piece of legislation and you should do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But Republicans have also got to communicate why they believe -- or what they can do to help the planet, and they can't just say, oh, it's ridiculous or they're going to lose a huge section of the younger -- the younger population.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, is that why the Democrats want the voting age to start at 16 years old, Matt Schlapp?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes, I mean, there is this -- this is the work I do at CPAC.  You know, half of the people that come to our events are high school kids and college kids.  So, we haven't lost that generation, but Jason is right, we have to reach out and talk to them.  The Democrats think that they own certain groups of Americans, and I think we're still -- people have my point of view, we are still being listened to, but we've got to deconstruct why the Green New Deal will harm them.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  How do you talk to them about the environment if --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Easily.  Easily.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The Green New Deal is a no-go for me.  How do you --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  No, it's very easy.  Carbon is not pollution.  This is the problem.  We could spend money combating pollution, having cleaner air, or cleaner water, or we could take that same money where we -- instead of combating pollution, we can do this all hoax, this facade over CO2, which will do nothing but raise people's energy prices.  It's nothing but a war on fossil fuels.  It's a diversion from cleaning up our environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me move on to the Mueller report, Jason, because President Trump wade in during my interview, and former FBI Director Jim Comey wrote an op-ed in The New York Times titled this, \"What I Want From the Mueller Report.\"  In this op-ed, Comey writes in part, \"Even though I believe Mr. Trump is morally unfit to be President of the United States, I'm not rooting for Mr. Mueller to demonstrate that he is a criminal.  I'm also not rooting for Mr. Mueller to clear the President.  I'm not rooting for anything at all, except that the special counsel be permitted to finish his work.\"</p><p>Now, in my exclusive interview yesterday, I had the chance to ask the President about this ongoing probe into Russia collusion, and this narrative nonsense of the last two years.  Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now, we're going to get the Mueller report.  What are you expecting?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, it's always interesting to me because a deputy that didn't get any votes appoints a man that didn't get any votes.  He's going to write a report on me.  I had one of the greatest election victories in history.  Would you say that's true?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.</p><p>TRUMP:  They came from the valleys, they came from the rivers, they came from the cities, they came from all over, they voted in one of the greatest elections in the history of our country.  And now, I have a man that because we have an attorney general who -- nobody can even believe that he didn't tell me, but he recused himself.  So, I have a man who is a deputy who I don't know, who I didn't know at all, and he appoints a man who had just left my office.  I didn't give him the job at the FBI.  For two years, we've gone through this nonsense.  With no -- because there's no collusion with Russia.  You know that better than anybody.  And there's no obstruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason, I find it so ironic that here is Jim Comey writing this op-ed, meanwhile, he was the Director of the FBI at the time.  He knew he had flimsy evidence to actually wiretap an American citizen, just so that they could spy on a political enemy's campaign.  He knew that Hillary Clinton was actually a part of the dossier's history and paid for it, and then he writes this whole op-ed as if he's neutral.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, yes, you read the op-ed and it's rich with irony, because you're exactly right, the -- and the President is right about Director Comey here, too.  You know, Comey tries to go to great lengths to say that the President has been tearing apart the rule of law.  To the contrary, the President has let this process play out with arm's length.  He has professed his innocence as an innocent person would do time and time and time again.  He waived the executive privilege, he opened up to interviews, he provided all the documents.  What else do you want a President to do?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And so, I think the -- I think the President is on the right side of this.  What James Comey did to Hillary Clinton, I think the way he did it was absolutely wrong, he started exonerating her before they had even interviewed her.  I mean, the list is long, and if you look at the senior most leadership at the FBI, it is disastrous.  The top echelon there has done a great disservice to this country, and torn down the belief in the FBI that was there before.  My grandfather was a career FBI agent.  But I got to tell you, the more we learn about Comey, we -- the more we learn that the way he administered that department was fundamentally wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they had those two investigations going side-by-side, the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation and the Trump collusion investigation.  And now, we know from the Lisa Page testimony that the (INAUDIBLE) released, they were told at the FBI, lay off Hillary from the DOJ, Obama's DOJ.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And you combine that with Mr. Baker's testimony, the general counsel there, and then you start to see a pattern that what Comey testified in front of Congress, was not true.  That there was never a chance for lady justice to actually administer justice.  It was just absolutely wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good op-ed in the Journal about this today by Kim Strassel, Matt.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes, absolutely.  I think the key thing here is that for those of us who were saying that Hillary Clinton was guilty of breaking the law, and that Obama's Department of Justice is actually the guilty party in getting involved in the investigations in calling off the FBI, and the prosecutors at DOJ.  Who's going to apologize for all these two years of people saying that that was made up and that was, you know, that was wrong?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  We wasted two years of our political discourse talking about a fiction, and we allowed all the wrongdoing to occur, and it's travesty.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the question is, William Barr, Jason, is he going to seek the truth, the A.G.?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes, I think he has the degree of creditability on both sides of the aisle.  He is -- he's got a great background on this.  And ironically, if you look at what happened -- because James Comey basically set this up so the special prosecutor would be there, the irony of all of this is I don't think there will be any charges or any evidence of any collusion.  We'll see.  But that's what you would think at this point.  And without any of that, guess what, the President comes out of this stronger than ever, because he will have the support of that document behind him.  And all of these people who've been flailing about the President going down, the President will be stronger politically than ever.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we should get the Mueller report, if not this weekend, next week, it is coming.  We have a lot of evidence to believe that the report should be out within the next few days.  Jason -- yes, go ahead, real quick.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Is that a reason to make it public?  We were having this discussion earlier.  Should all of this stuff be out there?  So, Jason, you say that this is -- you know, this will exonerate the President.  Do you think the whole thing should be out there from the get-go?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Your gut says yes.  There are certain material under the law, a grand jury testimony among the things that cannot be released.  So, don't get caught up in that, oh, Democrats will flail about -- hey, we want all of it released.  But under the law, not all of it can be released.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, understood.  Jason, good to see you this morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason Chaffetz in Utah.  Coming up, more of my exclusive sit-down with the President.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that.  And then, our favorite moments from the week right here.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump and I covered a lot of ground yesterday during my one-on-one exclusive with him.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I don't want to weigh in.  I want to ask you a question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, OK.</p><p>VARNEY:  I wonder if that's legit or not, but I'm going to ask you anyway.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>VARNEY:  OK.  Of all the points that you made with the President, in that great interview, what's the single most important point that you should -- that you want to put before our viewers at 9:00?  What is it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think you want to look at economic growth and whether or not he can keep this going.  I mean, he said that the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates actually hampered growth.  Now, we did see a 3.1 percent economic growth year-over-year, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, '17 tor '18.  But he said that it could have been four percent, if the Fed did not raise rates.  Obviously, the news around Mueller was important, as the -- as the Mueller report is going to drop soon.</p><p>His reaction to -- his talking about John McCain and why he is so upset with the late senator, because McCain gave the dossier, which of course, was salacious and unverified to the FBI.  That, I thought, was also worth a mention in terms of what's behind this upset.  Obviously, you know, a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are upset with him, that he keeps talking about him.  And I think the news that he broke yesterday Golan Heights ahead of the election in Israel, also worthwhile.</p><p>But when it comes to the economic stuff, the China news is important, we've got a meeting next week.  Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin going to China.  He said a deal could get done.  He's expecting a deal to get done.  I wonder if, in fact, the Chinese are pushing back on I.P. theft and whether or not, they're ever really going to be able to change that behavior, because I think it's a culture.  But I also think the fact that the President said we can come up with some enforcement mechanisms to keep them in line is worthwhile as well.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's a lot of stuff.  Why don't you come over and start at 9:00 and tell everybody all over again, why don't you?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's just my two cents, Stu, but, you know?</p><p>VARNEY:  About two dollars' worth, actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Maria, that was great.  Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you have a big interview, coming up, Jeff Flock is going to interview Mary Barra.  And of course, the President has been pressuring G.M. to either sell that plant or reopen it in Ohio.  So, we'll see what Mary Barra has to say about that on your show.</p><p>VARNEY:  I -- wait, I want to see what she's going to say about this pressure from the President about Lordstown.  She'll have an answer, I'm sure.  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  Thanks so much.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join Stuart, coming up.  But first, our favorite moments from this past week on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We've been on the road.  Don't miss it.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's been a big week here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We've been on the road.  Take a look at some of the top moments from the program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Under your administration's policy, we've seen growth in the economy, in jobs, the stock market, but now, the rest of the world is slowing.  How are you going to keep this elevated growth going?</p><p>TRUMP:  And you look at what's going on with respect to China.  Our deal is coming along very well.  We'll see what happens.  But we're taking in billions and billions of dollars for the first time ever against China in the form of tariffs.  I'm very happy with that, but I think the deal will probably happen.  I think they need it very badly.  The world going in a little bit the wrong direction, not horribly.  I think a lot of people are waiting for the deal with China.  I think that's going to have a very big impact, maybe bigger than people know.  As to whether or not it makes it, I think it will.  I had Facebook, Google, Twitter, everybody against me.  I have the medias, almost totally against me, and yet I won.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the vitriol happening today in Washington?</p><p>JOHN BOEHNER, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  So, it was crazy enough when I was there.  It's just gotten exponentially more crazy since I left.  Both parties are being held hostage by the extreme wings in their party.  And any idea that there should be -- there will be any cooperation is -- it's just not going to happen.  And so, it's messy, but listen, it's democracy.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I'm not being asked to chose between my marriage and my job, Donald Trump has never made -- the President has never made me feel that way, Maria.  I know George was quoted recently as saying, I don't -- I wish she didn't work there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, does he want you to step down?  George -- does George say --</p><p>CONWAY:  Certainly.  Certainly.</p><p>KEVIN HASEETT, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS:  Capex number is really the source of all the good news, because we're getting a capital expenditure boom, up about nine percent since the tax cuts passed.  And that nine percent capital spending boom is creating jobs.  And this year, it's going to create output and also continue.  And we can see that in the orders data.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  It's absolutely staggering how prolific the Chinese are, who are the number one penetrators of our cyberspace.</p><p>SUSAN DEVORE, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, PREMIER:  Innovation needs to continue in the development of new drugs, but we have to get the control over the pricing of drugs.</p><p>KATIE COURIC, AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST:  We definitely need people to be more engaged, and to get involved in science, because that really is the solution, it's nonpartisan, it really -- it transcends politics, and it's the key to solving incurable diseases, climate change, and environment issues.</p><p>KEVIN JOHNSON, CEO, STARBUCKS:  I think the competition, globally, around the addressable market of coffee has been -- has been increasing over the last three to five years.  You know, some of it is start-up companies or third wave independents, but you've seen, you know, many large companies making acquisitions, and doing consolidation around the industry of coffee.  You know, for Starbucks, we've stayed focused on the formula who's worked for us for the last 48 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Survey shows that three in five millennials say that life is more stressful for them right now than ever before.</p><p>JOY VILLA, SINGER-SONGWRITER:  I mean, losing your phone charger, having a cracked phone screen, not getting enough likes on your social media, these are the things that millennials have problems with now.</p><p>CASONE:  Sesame Street releasing Muppet stamps to celebrate the show's 50th anniversary.  Meanwhile, Sesame Street has caused a heated debate on Twitter.  Here's what they tweeted, they asked, \"Which of the Muppets would you take on a deserted island with you?\"  Well, how about you?  What do you think?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm going to go with you, Cookie Monster.</p><p>CASONE:  Cookie -- OK, Cookie Monster.  There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, what about you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Since I am Oscar the Grouch, you do not want to be stuck on a deserted island with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, welcome back with our all-star panel.  Final thoughts, Matt Schlapp?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yet another Trump accomplishment, that executive order on free speech on college campuses.  Way to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  You're right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  You covered a lot of ground with the President on trade.  That's the big issue for the markets.  We're coming down to the wire.  We have to see if he gets something done with China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they going to be able to do an enforcement enough to actually keep China to its promises to not steal I.P.?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's one of many issues and that's why one of the things he said is important, that they want to keep some of these tariffs in place until they see some of this -- some of these agreements coming to fruition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He also said to you which made my ears burn, no to zero tariffs with Europe on automobiles.  And he actually praised the 25 percent import tariffs on light trucks, called the Chicken Tax, which your viewers know because we've talked about it literally for two years on this program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was important, you're right, the zero taxes.  He doesn't want to go there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That will do it for today.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel, great program.  Have a great weekend.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2196703147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-DDC1-DY0W-42PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, March 22nd. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. My exclusive interview with President Trump coming up. The Commander-in-Chief speaking out on his surprise Golan Heights announcement yesterday. Now Syria slamming the President this morning and vowing to recovery Golan Heights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have been thinking about doing it for a long time. It's been a very hard decision for every President. No President has done it. Every President has said, do that. I'm the one that gets it done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Part two of my exclusive interview with the President coming up right here. Meanwhile this, the deadly 737 Max crash hitting Boeing's bottom line. The jetmaker is facing its first Max order cancellation.</p><p>Apple on top. The technology giant set to unveil its streaming service on Monday. And the stock is higher ahead of the announcement. Take a look. Plus, the 2019 IPO boom is heating up. Uber and Pinterest reportedly making their choices on where they will list their stock. What that means for timeline to go public this morning.</p><p>And we're looking at weakness at the open. We are off of the lows of the morning but futures indicating a decline of 134 points. This is taking a cue from Europe because we have the Purchasing Manager's Indexes out in the Eurozone. They were weaker than expected. So the U.S. market is following Europe lower. Futures indicating a decline 13 on the S&amp;P and 26 points lower on the NASDAQ.</p><p>After a rally yesterday meanwhile, technology stocks led the way yesterday. Take a look at the Dow at the close up 216 points yesterday. The S&amp;P was up 30 and the NASDAQ was up 110 points, 1-1/2 percent on the hills of strength intact. In Europe this morning, those PMI's, Purchasing Managers' Index is really weighing on markets. FT-100 down 1-1/4 percent. The CAC quarante is down better than one percent and the DAX Index in Germany weaker by three-quarters of a percent, 82 points lower.</p><p>In Asia overnight, fractional movers across the board but they were higher All those stories coming up this Friday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the American Conservative Union Chairman, Matt Schlapp, and the Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Great to be here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to see you, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They do.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: There is this -- the economy going on in the markets right now about growth, the stock market is near these new highs but the bond market is signaling that the whole world economy is slowing down. That's s why those PMI numbers that you mentioned, the lead up were really interesting. The bond market seems to be right about what's going on with the growth but the stock market doesn't care. They're buying in part because the Fed is keeping policies --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because where the Fed is but in Europe I feel like there's not a lot of wiggle room if things continue to worsen.</p><p>HILSENRATH: There's -- no, rates are already negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So that's why those PMI numbers you mentioned are really important because there's very little that they can do if they fall into recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we'll keep watching that. Meanwhile, we begin with part two of my exclusive interview with President Trump right now. The Commander-in-Chief laying out the reasons why he suddenly declared it is time for the United States to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We began though with the impending release of the Mueller report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And now we're going to get the Mueller report. What are you expecting?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, it's always interesting to me because a deputy that didn't get votes appoints a man that didn't get any votes. He's going to write a report on me. I had one of the greatest elects victories in history. Would you say that's true?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Absolutely.</p><p>TRUMP: They came from the valleys, they came from the rivers, they came from the cities, they came from all over, they voted in one of the greatest elections in the history of our country and now I have a man that because we have an attorney general who -- nobody can even believe that, he didn't tell me but he recused himself. So I have a man who was a deputy, who I don't know - who I didn't know at all and he appoints a man who had just left my office. I didn't give him job at the FBI. Comey his best friend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we covered every --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: Wait a minute. Listen. And you know better than anybody, you've been very fair to me on that. But think of it, I have a deputy appoints a man to write a report on me, to make a determination of my presidency? People will not stand for it. Now, with all of that being said for two years we've gone through this nonsense, with -- because there's no collusion with the Russia, you know that better than anybody.</p><p>And there's no obstruction to say, oh, wait, there was no collusion, that was a hoax but he obstruct it and fighting against the hoax, OK? Think about that one for a second.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And at the same time, the same group is running the Hillary Clinton investigation and now we heard from the Lisa Page testimony which was released that the Obama Department of Justice suggested we're not going to bring charges, so get off of this. So, during the campaign I remember you said, look, it's time to get away from Hillary Clinton, let's forget about this now.</p><p>Do you still feel that way or do you think you want to see a accountability here given the fact that now we know that the DOJ under Obama did say we're not going to bring charges to the FBI.</p><p>TRUMP: That's great question. So when I won, I made my opening speech everyone chanting lock her up, lock her up, lock her up. I said, no, no, no, let's forget it. Let's get on to the future but they have treated me so viciously, they have treated me so badly and we did nothing wrong. You look at the other -- and all of these people you hear about, that had nothing to do with Russia, Russia collusion, nothing.</p><p>It's all a big hoax, it's a witch-hunt and it's a hoax. So you asked me a question, it's very interesting question. The way they've treated me and we have found many crimes on the other side. These are stone-cold crimes what they've done between the deletion of 33,000 e-mails and many, many other things, Comey is lying, all of the Brenman lying, the lies to Congress and these are just absolute lies to Congress.</p><p>Clapper lied to Congress. Nobody does anything. If somebody -- they all say Flynn, I don't know anything about what he said but the FBI said he didn't lie. Mueller said he did lie. So what's that all about? And then they destroy a man who is a general and a respected man for many years. They've treated -- we have -- we have been treated very, very unfairly. All because Jeff Sessions didn't have a clue, OK? And he recused himself.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Will William Barr follow this? Will --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: I think -- look, I have a lot of respect for him, I've never known him, he is a very, very smart respected man. Hopefully he will do what's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And now --</p><p>DOBBS: And all I can ask you is what's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mueller is going to drop the report, the southern districts is on you, there's -- these other investigations by the Democrats.</p><p>TRUMP: Well, you know, they say there are lots of things but I don't know about these things, OK? Just so you understand. Everyone says this one, that one. I don't even know about this. I call, I said to my lawyers, are we being looked at here? They don't even know what people are talking about. There's so much fake news out there, it's a disgrace. If you look over the past two years, how many breaking news stories was there about me that turned out to be nonexistent? So many of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How you going to get anything done with all of this?</p><p>TRUMP: This should never happen to another President. What happened to me, they came up with an excuse for losing an election, this should never happen to another President because most Presidents wouldn't be able to take it. I know the politicians, I know the President, I know -- I know what we're dealing with. Most people wouldn't be able to take it. Let me tell you something, Maria.</p><p>What happened to me should never happen to another President of the United States, because I depend on this right here, mine, not other people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: And what they've done is a fraud. It's a fake. It's a witch-hunt. It should never happen to another President.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is there anything you see that you would like to work with the Democrats on in these next two years?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We could work on a lot. We could work on a lot. And I think the easiest thing frankly of all I could have started with number but one I want to get the tax cuts which we got. The easiest thing is infrastructure, they want it, I want it, I spoke to Nancy Pelosi about it the other day. We agree on it. We even like the type -- I think we like the type of infrastructure we're talking about.</p><p>Maybe in a certain way more Democrats from our standpoint than the Republican concept. Private, public. I like frankly owning our own roads, owning our bridges. I don't like selling them to other countries.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- they don't want you to have any victor.</p><p>TRUMP: I think it's very feasible because I think they want to do it. I mean, Nancy Pelosi told me very strongly they want to do infrastructure and we have other things we can do too. I we should do something on immigration, immigration is a total disaster in this country. We have laws that are so bad. People pouring in. I'll tell you what, border security, border patrol, what they've done is incredible.</p><p>The job they're doing, the job that ISIS is doing, what they're doing, without the protection and the ability to have a wall now -- and by the way, we're building a lot of wall right now, you know that. We're building the wall and it's going up fast, big, strong, looks good, not the horrible thing that they were building before I got here. We're building the wall now. We're going to have a lot of wall built pretty soon. But if you don't have that, you can't have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you want to go up against in 2020?</p><p>TRUMP: So you have people saying a lot of weird things, you know, I hear not only the Green New Deal but so many others, so many things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Medicare of All, tax on wealth, 70 percent tax rates.</p><p>TRUMP: You have -- you have Beto -- so you have Beto and Beto comes out and he says, let's take down the wall. If you ever took down the wall, this country would be overrun, OK? And we put up a lot of wall like in San Diego, so interesting, you have California. So, in San Diego they're begging me to do the wall. I end up doing the wall and then I see Governor of California criticizes me for the wall.</p><p>They're begging me do it. Because if you don't have it and they know this better. It's all a political deal, it's all politics. But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You want to run against Beto?</p><p>TRUMP: You know, my attitude is -- I wouldn't mind. I mean, I'd love to have Biden, I'd love to have Bernie, I'd love to have Beto. I mean, Beto seems to be the one the press has chosen. The press seems to have chosen Beto.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is this socialism versus capitalism?</p><p>TRUMP: And when I watched Beto, I say, we could dream about that but whatever it is, no, I think it's competence, I think if somebody -- look, when I first ran, I was never a politicians. I ran -- I ran in a certain platform. I've done far more than I said I was going to do. When you look at the tax cuts, when you look at the regulation cuts, more than any other President. When you look at all -- it's the biggest tax cut. You look at --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: You look at even a thing like right to try, what people can now use if they're terminally ill and they can use medicines that we've developed but that aren't out by signing a simple document. They used to travel to Asia, to Europe, all over the world to try and get a cure. You look at so many things that I've done for the veterans, choice, accountability, they never thought you'd have accountability.</p><p>You couldn't fire anybody if they treated our vets badly. Now you have accountability. Veterans choice where if they have to wait two weeks online or they have to two days, they can go out now, Maria, and see a private doctor and we pay for that doctor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. President, let me end on the Golan Heights because you tweeted about this day today in Israel, you said it is time for the U.S. to recognize Israel's s sovereignty and the Golan Heights. Why now? Why did you send that out?</p><p>TRUMP: I've been thinking about doing it for a long time. It's been a very hard decision for every President. No President has done it. They've all -- this is very much Jerusalem moving the embassy to Jerusalem. I did that and I fully understand why every -- Clinton and Bush and Obama, everybody campaigned on Jerusalem and the embassy going to Jerusalem. I even got the embassy built by the way very inexpensively.</p><p>But they campaigned on it, they never did it and I understand why, because when I got elected, I also campaigned on it. When I got elected, I was inundated with calls from all over the world. The leaders, mostly the leaders saying, please don't do it, don't do it. I did it and it's been done and it's fine. Golan Heights is the same thing for years of other Presidents have campaigned they said they'd do it. This is sovereignty, this is security, this is about regional security.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's not about Netanyahu's reelection.</p><p>TRUMP: No. I don't -- I wouldn't even know about that. I wouldn't even know about that. I have no idea. He is doing OK. I don't know if he's doing great right but I hear he is doing OK. But I would imagine the other side whoever is against him is also in favor of what I just did. Every President has said, do that. I'm the one that gets it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. President, thanks so much.</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile this morning, the Syrian government declared that it will recover the Golan Heights territory. The government reportedly published a statement on the Syrian news agency Web site calling the President's statement \"irresponsible\" and that showed contempt for international law. My thanks to President Trump. Coming up. The IPO boom. Uber and Pinterest, two of the biggest names on the flat line to go public this year.</p><p>Both reportedly making a choice and where they will list their shares. We've got the very latest there. Then big moves for Apple. The technology giant blowing past Microsoft becoming the world's most valuable public company. It's preparing to unveil a new plan for its television service. All the details after this break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Tiffany out this morning with mixed earnings. Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at markets. Gerri, good morning to you.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey. Good morning to you. Yes. Tiffany out with numbers. We look at -- we're looking at a mixed result here. Misses estimates, 1.32 billion on revenues against expectations of 1.33 billion. You see stock down here. EPS, a better story, $1.67 actual versus 1.61. That is tiffany. We also have Nike here, those results I'm waiting on right now. In the premarket it's down almost five percent.</p><p>I don't have those numbers at this time. I apologize. I'm going to move on to the IPOs and we can get the Nike numbers up in a second. Uber coming to the NYSE. Big story here after Levi's highly successful IPO yesterday. We have Uber coming to the NYSE. That will be the biggest public offering of the year, possibly the top five in all time. Officially filing in April. That's the expectation and they would be valued $120 billion.</p><p>You know, rival Lyft is going to the NASDAQ. And NYSE here been able to score a lot of big tech names, Alibaba, Twitter and now Uber. Pinterest also coming to the NYSE in April. That filing could be out today. They have sped up their offering to take advantage of this Gogo IPO market. They were last valued privately at $12 billion. And Apple has plans for its T.V. service. We're expecting details of that Monday.</p><p>Don't expect Netflix, that's not what's happening here. They will sell other company's video subscription and take a cut of their transactions. We're expecting them to bundle services like HBO, Showtime and Starz. That's the expectations for Apple apologize about those Nike earnings. Do we have them? Apple is up premarket as we see a little bit. That's going to be an exciting statement on Monday. Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Gerri. Thank you so much. Nike reported net income of $1.1 billion, that was 68 cents a share. It was compared to a loss of 921 million a year earlier. The issue here was North American sales growth which actually came in weaker than expected. They said things are going well in China but there's also question in terms of China growth given the slowdown there.</p><p>So the stock is down 4-2/3 percent largely on the North American sales growth even though the earnings were actually better than expected at 68 cents a share, $1.1 billion. Jon Hilsenrath, what are you watching today?</p><p>HILSENRATH: So -- I mean, there's two things from what you just talked about. One was the consumer stocks look like they're a little on the soft side with these two reports, Tiffany and Nike. So we have to look carefully at the consumer right now. They took a hit to their wealth in the fourth quarter, the jobs numbers the last time we saw them for February were close to flat. Now we have to see if consumer spending holds up.</p><p>The other thing I'd say though is these IPOs are potentially good news. You know, the IPO market has been so soft for so long and, you know, that's kind of been a sign that the economy isn't really kind of generating a lot of new companies, a lot of innovation. If we see the IPO market opening up and as an outlet for companies to go public, raise capital, it's a good sign for economic growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's a good point but with all those new supply and stock you wonder how the market absorbs it. So, I wonder, yes, it's a good news that we got such a boom in IPOs but whether or not, investors are going to be able to absorb that and whether or not it means the broader market trades down is something to watch as well. Matt, you wanted to make a comment?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes. Real quickly on your interview with President Trump which I thought was great. The key thing that I don't think it's covered enough by reporters is that 24 hours before Mr. Mueller is picked to be the special counsel, the President tells him he will not pick him again to run the FBI. So, the President essentially gilt Bob Mueller and then he has to read in the paper that Bob Mueller has this job of being the Special Counsel looking after the President.</p><p>The conflict there is just so odious that that in and of itself, you can see why the President sits in this craw that just could ever happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And not only that but the Special Counsel investigation was based on the FBI investigation into President Trump, then-candidate Trump which was based on real flimsy evidence.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHLAPP: You couldn't make this up if it was a story of fiction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's an extraordinary story, it's like a movie what they did. Coming up. General Motors' mega investment. The automaker ready to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a Midwest plant. What it means for the company. Back in a minute. Then, forever friends, marking National Puppy Day. We have the breed just named America's favorite. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More fallout from Boeing following the deadly crash of two of its 737 Max jets. Cheryl Casone with details there. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. Indonesia's flagship carrier Garuda Indonesia is seeking to cancel an order for 49 of Boeing 747 Max planes because customers don't think the aircraft is safe. This is the first set request following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The jets were grounded worldwide this month after an Ethiopian Airline crashed that killed all 157 people onboard. Taking a look at shares of Boeing, fractionally lower in the premarket right now.</p><p>Well drugmakers, Biogen and Eisai into their recent experimental Alzheimer's drug trial. That (INAUDIBLE) yesterday. The Biogen stock fell 29 percent. Shares of Eisai dropped 35 percent. Meanwhile, analyst are predicting that Biogen's next move might be an acquisition of a -- investment plan this morning and Michigan. G.M. plans to invest $300 million in its Oriion Assembly plant to build a new electric vehicle for Chevy.</p><p>The plant is already producing an electric car. The Chevy bolt and a self- driving vehicle for G.M. Cruise unit. Now this becomes after G.M. said it's going to close its plant in Ohio, that, of course, angered President Trump. We're going to learn more about the plan from G.M. CEO Mara Barra on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" 10 a.m. Eastern Time today.</p><p>OK. There's this. OK. There is this. Lots of Labrador love out there. The breed once again has landed on top in America for the 28th year in a row. The near three-decade run is kind of impressive and a German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, French bulldogs and then bulldogs round out the top five. An in honor of National Puppy Day, Maria. Congratulations on your new edition. Baby Bella, I'm sure she can't wait to see it. She probably really misses you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. I was so happy to have Bella Dusty at home. I missed her. I haven't been home in a week.</p><p>CASONE: I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we'll celebrate National Puppy Day when I get home. Dagen, are you going to be celebrating with Charlie this weekend?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. We celebrate every day and people even yesterday because I talked to him like he is a person out in public and people think that I've completely lost my mind. But I would say this, rescue is our favorite breed, although I do love a lab. There is a lab who is a working dog in the building. Her name is Persia. And Persia when I see her, she looks at me and flips over on her back and sticks all four legs in the air because she wants belly-rub.</p><p>She's supposed to be on the job and she's not but I will give her -- I always come up with some belly scratches for her. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nothing comes between belly rubs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. belly rubs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And puppies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Belly rubs. You know what I'm talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Happy National Puppy Day, Dagen. All right. We'll take a break. When we come back. Defending the Green New Deal. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says her proposal is being misinterpreted.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SETH MEYERS, NBC HOST: You would outlaw cows --</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK: Oh, yes.</p><p>MEYERS: Cows farting, that would be out. Children, hamburgers, ice cream.</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ: It's always good to see how these narratives are manipulated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will discuss it and then more of my exclusive interview with President Trump. Don't miss it. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo live this morning in Washington. It is Friday, March 22nd, your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast. President Trump slamming the impending Mueller report in my exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: It's all a big hoax, it's a witch hunt and it's a hoax. We have been treated very, very unfairly all because Jeff Sessions didn't have a clue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will get reaction from former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, coming up this morning. We're taking a look at weakness at the opening of trading, Futures indicating a decline of almost 200 points. This is taking a cue from Europe because we had Purchasing Managers' Index surveys out in France, in Germany. A number of the European PMIs were weaker than expecting, showing that manufacturing within the Eurozone is weakening. We know that it's expected to grow one percent, the Eurozone is in 2019. So, that is weighing on European markets, and the U.S. is following suite.</p><p>European down across the board, FT-100 is down 100, 1-1/3 percent; CAC Quarante down 73, also 1-1/3 percent; and the DAX Index in Germany down 95 points. Germany has had a tough -- rough go at it this week, after the Bayer sell-off as well. It is down, again, almost one percent on the DAX Index. In Asia overnight, markets were fractionally moving, but they were higher across the board.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the Green New Deal, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking out on the Green New Deal last night on \"Late Night.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ: They're trying to say that the Green New Deal is about what we have to give up, what we have to cut back on, when in fact, the Green New Deal itself is a resolution to be more expansive. It is to be able to generate more and to make sure that we're investing in working class -- in working-class Americans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I asked President Trump about the Green New Deal in my exclusive sit-down yesterday. Here's what he had to say about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The Democrats actually are becoming a far-left party. You look at this Green New Deal, it's the most preposterous thing. Now, I don't want to knock it too much right now, because I really hope they keep going forward with it, you know, frankly, because I think it's going to be very easy to beat.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Douglas Holtz-Eakin's group says it's going to cost $94 trillion. Joining is right now is former Utah Congressman, former House Oversight Committee Chairman, and Fox News Contributor, Jason Chaffetz. Jason, it's great to see you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us this morning. First, your thoughts on the Green New Deal, and whether or not this has legs. Every time Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talks about it, she basically refers to it as broad strokes. You know, don't worry about the fact that it doesn't make sense, don't worry about the fact that we're obviously not going to get rid of fossil fuels in the next 10 years. That makes no sense. It's just an idea. What do you think?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, it's an actual piece of legislation that has been embraced by most of the Democratic 2020 candidates on the Democratic side of the party, so there's a lot to about worried about there. The economics make no sense, the absurdity on its face is ridiculous. But let's be careful as Republicans as from -- as a Republican point of view to summarily dismiss it when I think it'd be a mistake. Because she is communicating with a younger generation who maybe hasn't looked at the economics of it, and they think, well, why can't we do these things? If you believe that the world is going to end because of plastic straws in the next 10 years, you're looking at this and thinking this is a viable piece of legislation and you should do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: But Republicans have also got to communicate why they believe -- or what they can do to help the planet, and they can't just say, oh, it's ridiculous or they're going to lose a huge section of the younger -- the younger population.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, is that why the Democrats want the voting age to start at 16 years old, Matt Schlapp?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes, I mean, there is this -- this is the work I do at CPAC. You know, half of the people that come to our events are high school kids and college kids. So, we haven't lost that generation, but Jason is right, we have to reach out and talk to them. The Democrats think that they own certain groups of Americans, and I think we're still -- people have my point of view, we are still being listened to, but we've got to deconstruct why the Green New Deal will harm them.</p><p>HILSENRATH: How do you talk to them about the environment if --</p><p>SCHLAPP: Easily. Easily.</p><p>HILSENRATH: The Green New Deal is a no-go for me. How do you --</p><p>SCHLAPP: No, it's very easy. Carbon is not pollution. This is the problem. We could spend money combating pollution, having cleaner air, or cleaner water, or we could take that same money where we -- instead of combating pollution, we can do this all hoax, this facade over CO2, which will do nothing but raise people's energy prices. It's nothing but a war on fossil fuels. It's a diversion from cleaning up our environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me move on to the Mueller report, Jason, because President Trump wade in during my interview, and former FBI Director Jim Comey wrote an op-ed in The New York Times titled this, \"What I Want From the Mueller Report.\" In this op-ed, Comey writes in part, \"Even though I believe Mr. Trump is morally unfit to be President of the United States, I'm not rooting for Mr. Mueller to demonstrate that he is a criminal. I'm also not rooting for Mr. Mueller to clear the President. I'm not rooting for anything at all, except that the special counsel be permitted to finish his work.\"</p><p>Now, in my exclusive interview yesterday, I had the chance to ask the President about this ongoing probe into Russia collusion, and this narrative nonsense of the last two years. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And now, we're going to get the Mueller report. What are you expecting?</p><p>TRUMP: Well, it's always interesting to me because a deputy that didn't get any votes appoints a man that didn't get any votes. He's going to write a report on me. I had one of the greatest election victories in history. Would you say that's true?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>TRUMP: They came from the valleys, they came from the rivers, they came from the cities, they came from all over, they voted in one of the greatest elections in the history of our country. And now, I have a man that because we have an attorney general who -- nobody can even believe that he didn't tell me, but he recused himself. So, I have a man who is a deputy who I don't know, who I didn't know at all, and he appoints a man who had just left my office. I didn't give him the job at the FBI. For two years, we've gone through this nonsense. With no -- because there's no collusion with Russia. You know that better than anybody. And there's no obstruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jason, I find it so ironic that here is Jim Comey writing this op-ed, meanwhile, he was the Director of the FBI at the time. He knew he had flimsy evidence to actually wiretap an American citizen, just so that they could spy on a political enemy's campaign. He knew that Hillary Clinton was actually a part of the dossier's history and paid for it, and then he writes this whole op-ed as if he's neutral.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, yes, you read the op-ed and it's rich with irony, because you're exactly right, the -- and the President is right about Director Comey here, too. You know, Comey tries to go to great lengths to say that the President has been tearing apart the rule of law. To the contrary, the President has let this process play out with arm's length. He has professed his innocence as an innocent person would do time and time and time again. He waived the executive privilege, he opened up to interviews, he provided all the documents. What else do you want a President to do?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: And so, I think the -- I think the President is on the right side of this. What James Comey did to Hillary Clinton, I think the way he did it was absolutely wrong, he started exonerating her before they had even interviewed her. I mean, the list is long, and if you look at the senior most leadership at the FBI, it is disastrous. The top echelon there has done a great disservice to this country, and torn down the belief in the FBI that was there before. My grandfather was a career FBI agent. But I got to tell you, the more we learn about Comey, we -- the more we learn that the way he administered that department was fundamentally wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they had those two investigations going side-by-side, the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation and the Trump collusion investigation. And now, we know from the Lisa Page testimony that the (INAUDIBLE) released, they were told at the FBI, lay off Hillary from the DOJ, Obama's DOJ.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: And you combine that with Mr. Baker's testimony, the general counsel there, and then you start to see a pattern that what Comey testified in front of Congress, was not true. That there was never a chance for lady justice to actually administer justice. It was just absolutely wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good op-ed in the Journal about this today by Kim Strassel, Matt.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes, absolutely. I think the key thing here is that for those of us who were saying that Hillary Clinton was guilty of breaking the law, and that Obama's Department of Justice is actually the guilty party in getting involved in the investigations in calling off the FBI, and the prosecutors at DOJ. Who's going to apologize for all these two years of people saying that that was made up and that was, you know, that was wrong?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP: We wasted two years of our political discourse talking about a fiction, and we allowed all the wrongdoing to occur, and it's travesty.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, the question is, William Barr, Jason, is he going to seek the truth, the A.G.?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes, I think he has the degree of creditability on both sides of the aisle. He is -- he's got a great background on this. And ironically, if you look at what happened -- because James Comey basically set this up so the special prosecutor would be there, the irony of all of this is I don't think there will be any charges or any evidence of any collusion. We'll see. But that's what you would think at this point. And without any of that, guess what, the President comes out of this stronger than ever, because he will have the support of that document behind him. And all of these people who've been flailing about the President going down, the President will be stronger politically than ever.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we should get the Mueller report, if not this weekend, next week, it is coming. We have a lot of evidence to believe that the report should be out within the next few days. Jason -- yes, go ahead, real quick.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Is that a reason to make it public? We were having this discussion earlier. Should all of this stuff be out there? So, Jason, you say that this is -- you know, this will exonerate the President. Do you think the whole thing should be out there from the get-go?</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Your gut says yes. There are certain material under the law, a grand jury testimony among the things that cannot be released. So, don't get caught up in that, oh, Democrats will flail about -- hey, we want all of it released. But under the law, not all of it can be released.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, understood. Jason, good to see you this morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jason Chaffetz in Utah. Coming up, more of my exclusive sit- down with the President. Stuart Varney weighs in on that. And then, our favorite moments from the week right here. MORNINGS WITH MARIA, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump and I covered a lot of ground yesterday during my one-on-one exclusive with him. Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I don't want to weigh in. I want to ask you a question.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, OK.</p><p>VARNEY: I wonder if that's legit or not, but I'm going to ask you anyway.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>VARNEY: OK. Of all the points that you made with the President, in that great interview, what's the single most important point that you should -- that you want to put before our viewers at 9:00? What is it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I think you want to look at economic growth and whether or not he can keep this going. I mean, he said that the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates actually hampered growth. Now, we did see a 3.1 percent economic growth year-over-year, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, '17 tor '18. But he said that it could have been four percent, if the Fed did not raise rates. Obviously, the news around Mueller was important, as the -- as the Mueller report is going to drop soon.</p><p>His reaction to -- his talking about John McCain and why he is so upset with the late senator, because McCain gave the dossier, which of course, was salacious and unverified to the FBI. That, I thought, was also worth a mention in terms of what's behind this upset. Obviously, you know, a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are upset with him, that he keeps talking about him. And I think the news that he broke yesterday Golan Heights ahead of the election in Israel, also worthwhile.</p><p>But when it comes to the economic stuff, the China news is important, we've got a meeting next week. Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin going to China. He said a deal could get done. He's expecting a deal to get done. I wonder if, in fact, the Chinese are pushing back on I.P. theft and whether or not, they're ever really going to be able to change that behavior, because I think it's a culture. But I also think the fact that the President said we can come up with some enforcement mechanisms to keep them in line is worthwhile as well.</p><p>VARNEY: That's a lot of stuff. Why don't you come over and start at 9:00 and tell everybody all over again, why don't you?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's just my two cents, Stu, but, you know?</p><p>VARNEY: About two dollars' worth, actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: Maria, that was great. Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know you have a big interview, coming up, Jeff Flock is going to interview Mary Barra. And of course, the President has been pressuring G.M. to either sell that plant or reopen it in Ohio. So, we'll see what Mary Barra has to say about that on your show.</p><p>VARNEY: I -- wait, I want to see what she's going to say about this pressure from the President about Lordstown. She'll have an answer, I'm sure. OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes. Thanks so much.</p><p>VARNEY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Join Stuart, coming up. But first, our favorite moments from this past week on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. We've been on the road. Don't miss it. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It's been a big week here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. We've been on the road. Take a look at some of the top moments from the program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Under your administration's policy, we've seen growth in the economy, in jobs, the stock market, but now, the rest of the world is slowing. How are you going to keep this elevated growth going?</p><p>TRUMP: And you look at what's going on with respect to China. Our deal is coming along very well. We'll see what happens. But we're taking in billions and billions of dollars for the first time ever against China in the form of tariffs. I'm very happy with that, but I think the deal will probably happen. I think they need it very badly. The world going in a little bit the wrong direction, not horribly. I think a lot of people are waiting for the deal with China. I think that's going to have a very big impact, maybe bigger than people know. As to whether or not it makes it, I think it will. I had Facebook, Google, Twitter, everybody against me. I have the medias, almost totally against me, and yet I won.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your take on the vitriol happening today in Washington?</p><p>JOHN BOEHNER, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: So, it was crazy enough when I was there. It's just gotten exponentially more crazy since I left. Both parties are being held hostage by the extreme wings in their party. And any idea that there should be -- there will be any cooperation is -- it's just not going to happen. And so, it's messy, but listen, it's democracy.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'm not being asked to chose between my marriage and my job, Donald Trump has never made -- the President has never made me feel that way, Maria. I know George was quoted recently as saying, I don't -- I wish she didn't work there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, does he want you to step down? George -- does George say - -</p><p>CONWAY: Certainly. Certainly.</p><p>KEVIN HASEETT, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: Capex number is really the source of all the good news, because we're getting a capital expenditure boom, up about nine percent since the tax cuts passed. And that nine percent capital spending boom is creating jobs. And this year, it's going to create output and also continue. And we can see that in the orders data.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: It's absolutely staggering how prolific the Chinese are, who are the number one penetrators of our cyberspace.</p><p>SUSAN DEVORE, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, PREMIER: Innovation needs to continue in the development of new drugs, but we have to get the control over the pricing of drugs.</p><p>KATIE COURIC, AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST: We definitely need people to be more engaged, and to get involved in science, because that really is the solution, it's nonpartisan, it really -- it transcends politics, and it's the key to solving incurable diseases, climate change, and environment issues.</p><p>KEVIN JOHNSON, CEO, STARBUCKS: I think the competition, globally, around the addressable market of coffee has been -- has been increasing over the last three to five years. You know, some of it is start-up companies or third wave independents, but you've seen, you know, many large companies making acquisitions, and doing consolidation around the industry of coffee. You know, for Starbucks, we've stayed focused on the formula who's worked for us for the last 48 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Survey shows that three in five millennials say that life is more stressful for them right now than ever before.</p><p>JOY VILLA, SINGER-SONGWRITER: I mean, losing your phone charger, having a cracked phone screen, not getting enough likes on your social media, these are the things that millennials have problems with now.</p><p>CASONE: Sesame Street releasing Muppet stamps to celebrate the show's 50th anniversary. Meanwhile, Sesame Street has caused a heated debate on Twitter. Here's what they tweeted, they asked, \"Which of the Muppets would you take on a deserted island with you?\" Well, how about you? What do you think?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm going to go with you, Cookie Monster.</p><p>CASONE: Cookie -- OK, Cookie Monster. There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen, what about you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Since I am Oscar the Grouch, you do not want to be stuck on a deserted island with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, welcome back with our all-star panel. Final thoughts, Matt Schlapp?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yet another Trump accomplishment, that executive order on free speech on college campuses. Way to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. You're right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You covered a lot of ground with the President on trade. That's the big issue for the markets. We're coming down to the wire. We have to see if he gets something done with China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are they going to be able to do an enforcement enough to actually keep China to its promises to not steal I.P.?</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's one of many issues and that's why one of the things he said is important, that they want to keep some of these tariffs in place until they see some of this -- some of these agreements coming to fruition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: He also said to you which made my ears burn, no to zero tariffs with Europe on automobiles. And he actually praised the 25 percent import tariffs on light trucks, called the Chicken Tax, which your viewers know because we've talked about it literally for two years on this program.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That was important, you're right, the zero taxes. He doesn't want to go there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That will do it for today. Thanks, everybody. Great panel, great program. Have a great weekend. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now. Stuart, take it away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019032203cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPJ-TCV1-JB20-G032-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Friday, March 22nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  My exclusive interview with President Trump coming up.  The Commander-in-Chief speaking out on his surprise Golan Heights announcement yesterday.  Now Syria slamming the President this morning and vowing to recovery Golan Heights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have been thinking about doing it for a long time.  It's been a very hard decision for every President.  No President has done it.  Every President has said, do that.  I'm the one that gets it done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Part two of my exclusive interview with the President coming up right here.  Meanwhile this, the deadly 737 Max crash hitting Boeing's bottom line.  The jetmaker is  facing its first Max order cancellation.</p><p>Apple on top.  The technology giant set to unveil its streaming service on Monday.  And the stock is higher ahead of the announcement.  Take a look.  Plus, the 2019 IPO boom is heating up.  Uber and Pinterest reportedly making their choices on where they will list their stock.  What that means for timeline to go public this morning.</p><p>And we're looking at weakness at the open.  We are off of the lows of the morning but futures indicating a decline of 134 points.  This is taking a cue from Europe because we have the Purchasing Manager's Indexes  out in the Eurozone.  They were weaker than expected.  So the U.S. market is following Europe lower.  Futures indicating a decline 13 on the S&amp;P and 26 points lower on the NASDAQ.</p><p>After a rally yesterday meanwhile, technology stocks led the way yesterday.  Take a look at the Dow at the close up 216 points yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up 30 and the NASDAQ was up 110 points, 1-1/2 percent on the hills of strength intact.  In Europe this morning, those PMI's, Purchasing Managers' Index is really weighing on markets.  FT-100 down 1-1/4 percent.  The CAC quarante is down better than one percent and the DAX Index in Germany weaker by three-quarters of a percent, 82 points lower.</p><p>In Asia overnight, fractional movers across the board but they were higher  All those stories coming up this Friday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the American Conservative Union Chairman, Matt Schlapp, and the Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath.  Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Great to see you, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They do.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  There is this -- the economy going on in the markets right now about growth, the stock market is near these new highs but the bond market is signaling that the whole world economy is slowing down.  That's s why those PMI numbers that you mentioned, the lead up were really interesting.  The bond market seems to be right about what's going on with the growth but the stock market doesn't care.  They're buying in part because the Fed is keeping policies --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because where the Fed is but in Europe I feel like there's not a lot of wiggle room if things continue to worsen.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There's -- no, rates are already negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So that's why those PMI numbers you mentioned are really important because there's very little that they can do if they fall into recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we'll keep watching that.  Meanwhile, we begin with part two of my exclusive interview with President Trump right now.  The Commander-in-Chief laying out the reasons why he suddenly declared it is time for the United States to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.  We began though with the impending release of the Mueller report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now we're going to get the Mueller report.  What are you expecting?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, it's always interesting to me because a deputy that didn't get votes appoints a man that didn't get any votes.  He's going to write a report on me.  I had one of the greatest elects victories in history.  Would you say that's true?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Absolutely.</p><p>TRUMP:  They came from the valleys, they came from the rivers, they came from the cities, they came from all over, they voted in one of the greatest elections in the history of our country and now I have a man that because we have an attorney general who -- nobody can even believe that, he didn't tell me but he recused himself.  So I have a man who was a deputy, who I don't know - who I didn't know at all and he appoints a man who had just left my office.  I didn't give him job at the FBI.  Comey his best friend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we covered every --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP:  Wait a minute.  Listen.  And you know better than anybody, you've been very fair to me on that.  But think of it, I have a deputy appoints a man to write a report on me, to make a determination of my presidency?  People will not stand for it.  Now, with all of that being said for two years we've gone through this nonsense, with -- because there's no collusion with the Russia, you know that better than anybody.</p><p>And there's no obstruction to say, oh, wait, there was no collusion, that was a hoax but he obstruct it and fighting against the hoax, OK?  Think about that one for a second.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And at the same time, the same group is running the Hillary Clinton investigation and now we heard from the Lisa Page testimony which was released that the Obama Department of Justice suggested we're not going to bring charges, so get off of this.  So, during the campaign I remember you said, look, it's time to get away from Hillary Clinton, let's forget about this now.</p><p>Do you still feel that way or do you think you want to see a accountability here given the fact that now we know that the DOJ under Obama did say we're not going to bring charges to the FBI.</p><p>TRUMP:  That's great question.  So when I won, I made my opening speech everyone chanting lock her up, lock her up, lock her up.  I said, no, no, no, let's forget it.  Let's get on to the future but they have treated me so viciously, they have treated me so badly and we did nothing wrong.  You look at the other -- and all of these people you hear about, that had nothing to do with Russia, Russia collusion, nothing.</p><p>It's all a big hoax, it's a witch-hunt and it's a hoax.  So you asked me a question, it's very interesting question.  The way they've treated me and we have found many crimes on the other side.  These are stone-cold crimes what they've done between the deletion of 33,000 e-mails and many, many other things, Comey is lying, all of the Brenman lying, the lies to Congress and these are just absolute lies to Congress.</p><p>Clapper lied to Congress.  Nobody does anything.  If somebody -- they all say Flynn, I don't know anything about what he said but the FBI said he didn't lie.  Mueller said he did lie.  So what's that all about?  And then they destroy a man who is a general and a respected man for many years.  They've treated -- we have -- we have been treated very, very unfairly.  All because Jeff Sessions didn't have a clue, OK?  And he recused himself.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will William Barr follow this?  Will --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS:  I think -- look, I have a lot of respect for him, I've never known him, he is a very, very smart respected man.  Hopefully he will do what's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now --</p><p>DOBBS:  And all I can ask you is what's fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mueller is going to drop the report, the southern districts is on you, there's -- these other investigations by the Democrats.</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, you know, they say there are lots of things but I don't know about these things, OK?  Just so you understand.  Everyone says this one, that one.  I don't even know about this.  I call, I said to my lawyers, are we being looked at here?  They don't even know what people are talking about.  There's so much fake news out there, it's a disgrace.  If you look over the past two years, how many breaking news stories was there about me that turned out to be nonexistent?  So many of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How you going to get anything done with all of this?</p><p>TRUMP:  This should never happen to another President.  What happened to me, they came up with an excuse for losing an election, this should never happen to another President because most Presidents wouldn't be able to take it.  I know the politicians, I know the President, I know -- I know what we're dealing with.  Most people wouldn't be able to take it.  Let me tell you something, Maria.</p><p>What happened to me should never happen to another President of the United States, because I depend on this right here, mine, not other people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TRUMP:  And what they've done is a fraud.  It's a fake.  It's a witch-hunt.  It should never happen to another President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there anything you see that you would like to work with the Democrats on in these next two years?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We could work on a lot.  We could work on a lot.  And I think the easiest thing frankly of all I could have started with number but one I want to get the tax cuts which we got.  The easiest thing is infrastructure, they want it, I want it, I spoke to Nancy Pelosi about it the other day.  We agree on it.  We even like the type -- I think we like the type of infrastructure we're talking about.</p><p>Maybe in a certain way more Democrats from our standpoint than the Republican concept.  Private, public.  I like frankly owning our own roads, owning our bridges.  I don't like selling them to other countries.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- they don't want you to have any victor.</p><p>TRUMP:  I think it's very feasible because I think they want to do it.  I mean, Nancy Pelosi told me very strongly they want to do infrastructure and we have other things we can do too.  I we should do something on immigration, immigration is a total disaster in this country.  We have laws that are so bad.  People pouring in.  I'll tell you what, border security, border patrol, what they've done is incredible.</p><p>The job they're doing, the job that ISIS is doing, what they're doing, without the protection and the ability to have a wall now -- and by the way, we're building a lot of wall right now, you know that.  We're building the wall and it's going up fast, big, strong, looks good, not the horrible thing that they were building before I got here.  We're building the wall now.  We're going to have a lot of wall built pretty soon.  But if you don't have that, you can't have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you want to go up against in 2020?</p><p>TRUMP:  So you have people saying a lot of weird things, you know, I hear not only the Green New Deal but so many others, so many things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Medicare of All, tax on wealth, 70 percent tax rates.</p><p>TRUMP:  You have -- you have Beto -- so you have Beto and Beto comes out and he says, let's take down the wall.  If you ever took down the wall, this country would be overrun, OK?  And we put up a lot of wall like in San Diego, so interesting, you have California.  So, in San Diego they're begging me to do the wall.  I end up doing the wall and then I see Governor of California criticizes me for the wall.</p><p>They're begging me do it.  Because if you don't have it and they know this better.  It's all a political deal, it's all politics.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to run against Beto?</p><p>TRUMP:  You know, my attitude is -- I wouldn't mind.  I mean, I'd love to have Biden, I'd love to have Bernie, I'd love to have Beto.  I mean, Beto seems to be the one the press has chosen.  The press seems to have chosen Beto.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is this socialism versus capitalism?</p><p>TRUMP:  And when I watched Beto, I say, we could dream about that but whatever it is, no, I think it's competence, I think if somebody -- look, when I first ran, I was never a politicians.  I ran -- I ran in a certain platform.  I've done far more than I said I was going to do.  When you look at the tax cuts, when you look at the regulation cuts, more than any other President.  When you look at all -- it's the biggest tax cut.  You look at --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP:  You look at even a thing like right to try, what people can now use if they're terminally ill and they can use medicines that we've developed but that aren't out by signing a simple document.  They used to travel to Asia, to Europe, all over the world to try and get a cure.  You look at so many things that I've done for the veterans, choice, accountability, they never thought you'd have accountability.</p><p>You couldn't fire anybody if they treated our vets badly.  Now you have accountability.  Veterans choice where if they have to wait two weeks online or they have to two days, they can go out now, Maria, and see a private doctor and we pay for that doctor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. President, let me end on the Golan Heights because you tweeted about this day today in Israel, you said it is time for the U.S. to recognize Israel's s sovereignty and the Golan Heights.  Why now?  Why did you send that out?</p><p>TRUMP:  I've been thinking about doing it for a long time.  It's been a very hard decision for every President.  No President has done it.  They've all -- this is very much Jerusalem moving the embassy to Jerusalem.  I did that and I fully understand why every -- Clinton and Bush and Obama, everybody campaigned on Jerusalem and the embassy going to Jerusalem.  I even got the embassy built by the way very inexpensively.</p><p>But they campaigned on it, they never did it and I understand why, because when I got elected, I also campaigned on it.  When I got elected, I was inundated with calls from all over the world.  The leaders, mostly the leaders saying, please don't do it, don't do it.  I did it and it's been done and it's fine.  Golan Heights is the same thing for years of other Presidents have campaigned they said they'd do it.  This is sovereignty, this is security, this is about regional security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not about Netanyahu's reelection.</p><p>TRUMP:  No.  I don't -- I wouldn't even know about that.  I wouldn't even know about that.  I have no idea.  He is doing OK.  I don't know if he's doing great right but I hear he is doing OK.  But I would imagine the other side whoever is against him is also in  favor of what I just did.  Every President has said, do that.  I'm the one that gets it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. President, thanks so much.</p><p>TRUMP:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile this morning, the Syrian government declared that it will recover the Golan Heights territory.  The government reportedly published a statement on the Syrian news agency Web site calling the President's statement \"irresponsible\" and that showed contempt for international law.  My thanks to President Trump.  Coming up.  The IPO boom.  Uber and Pinterest, two of the biggest names on the flat line to go public this year.</p><p>Both reportedly making a choice and where they will list their shares.  We've got the very latest there.  Then big moves for Apple.  The technology giant blowing past Microsoft becoming the world's most valuable public company.  It's preparing to unveil a new plan for its television service.  All the details after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tiffany out this morning with mixed earnings.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at markets.  Gerri, good morning to you.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey.  Good morning to you.  Yes.  Tiffany out with numbers.  We look at -- we're looking at a mixed result here.  Misses estimates, 1.32 billion on revenues against expectations of 1.33 billion.  You see stock down here.  EPS, a better story, $1.67 actual versus 1.61.  That is tiffany.  We also have Nike here, those results I'm waiting on right now.  In the premarket it's down almost five percent.</p><p>I don't have those numbers at this time.  I apologize.  I'm going to move on to the IPOs and we can get the Nike numbers up in a second.  Uber coming to the NYSE.  Big story here after Levi's highly successful IPO yesterday.  We have Uber coming to the NYSE.  That will be the biggest public offering of the year, possibly the top five in all time.  Officially filing in April.  That's the expectation and they would be valued $120 billion.</p><p>You know, rival Lyft is going to the NASDAQ.  And NYSE here been able to score a lot of big tech names, Alibaba, Twitter and now Uber.  Pinterest also coming to the NYSE in April.  That filing could be out today.  They have sped up their offering to take advantage of this Gogo IPO market.  They were last valued privately at $12 billion.  And Apple has plans for its T.V. service.  We're expecting details of that Monday.</p><p>Don't expect Netflix, that's not what's happening here.  They will sell other company's video subscription and take a cut of their transactions.  We're expecting them to bundle services like HBO, Showtime and Starz.  That's the expectations for Apple apologize about those Nike earnings.  Do we have them?  Apple is up premarket as we see a little bit.  That's going to be an exciting statement on Monday.  Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you so much.  Nike reported net income of $1.1 billion, that was 68 cents a share.  It was compared to a loss of 921 million a year earlier.  The issue here was North American sales growth which actually came in weaker than expected.  They said things are going well in China but there's also question in terms of China growth given the slowdown there.</p><p>So the stock is down 4-2/3 percent largely on the North American sales growth even though the earnings were actually better than expected at 68 cents a share, $1.1 billion.  Jon Hilsenrath, what are you watching today?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So -- I mean, there's two things from what you just talked about.  One was the consumer stocks look like they're a little on the soft side with these two reports, Tiffany and Nike.  So we have to look carefully at the consumer right now.  They took a hit to their wealth in the fourth quarter, the jobs numbers the last time we saw them for February were close to flat.  Now we have to see if consumer spending holds up.</p><p>The other thing I'd say though is these IPOs are potentially good news.  You know, the IPO market has been so soft for so long and, you know, that's kind of been a sign that the economy isn't really kind of generating a lot of new companies, a lot of innovation.  If we see the IPO market opening up and as an outlet for companies to go public, raise capital, it's a good sign for economic growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a good point but with all those new supply and stock you wonder how the market absorbs it.  So, I wonder, yes, it's a good news that we got such a boom in IPOs  but whether or not, investors are going to be able to absorb that and whether or not it means the broader market trades down is something to watch as well.  Matt, you wanted to make a comment?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.  Real quickly on your interview with President Trump which I thought was great.  The key thing that I don't think it's covered enough by reporters is that 24 hours before Mr. Mueller is picked to be the special counsel, the President tells him he will not pick him again to run the FBI.  So, the President essentially gilt Bob Mueller and then he has to read in the paper that Bob Mueller has this job of being the Special Counsel looking after the President.</p><p>The conflict there is just so odious that that in and of itself, you can see why the President sits in this craw that just could ever happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And not only that but the Special Counsel investigation was based on the FBI investigation into President Trump, then-candidate Trump which was based on real flimsy evidence.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  You couldn't make this up if it was a story of fiction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's an extraordinary story, it's like a movie what they did.  Coming up.  General Motors' mega investment.  The automaker ready to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a Midwest plant.  What it means for the company.  Back in a minute.  Then, forever friends, marking National Puppy Day.  We have the breed just named America's favorite.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More fallout from Boeing following the deadly crash of two of its 737 Max jets.  Cheryl Casone with details there.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Indonesia's flagship carrier Garuda Indonesia is seeking to cancel an order for 49 of Boeing 747 Max planes because customers don't think the aircraft is safe.  This is the first set request following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.  The jets were grounded worldwide this month after an Ethiopian Airline crashed that killed all 157 people onboard.  Taking a look at shares of Boeing, fractionally lower in the premarket right now.</p><p>Well drugmakers, Biogen and Eisai into their recent experimental Alzheimer's drug trial.  That (INAUDIBLE) yesterday.  The Biogen stock fell 29 percent.  Shares of Eisai dropped 35 percent.  Meanwhile, analyst are predicting that Biogen's next move might be an acquisition of a -- investment plan this morning and Michigan.  G.M. plans to invest $300 million in its Oriion Assembly plant to build a new electric vehicle for Chevy.</p><p>The plant is already producing an electric car.  The Chevy bolt and a self-driving vehicle for G.M. Cruise unit.  Now this becomes after G.M. said it's going to close its plant in Ohio, that, of course, angered President Trump.  We're going to learn more about the plan from G.M. CEO Mara Barra on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" 10 a.m. Eastern Time today.</p><p>OK.  There's this.  OK.  There is this.  Lots of Labrador love out there.  The breed once again has landed on top in America for the 28th year in a row.  The near three-decade run is kind of impressive and a German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, French bulldogs and then bulldogs round out the top five.  An in honor of National Puppy Day, Maria.  Congratulations on your new edition.  Baby Bella, I'm sure she can't wait to see it.  She probably really misses you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  I was so happy to have Bella Dusty at home.  I missed her.  I haven't been home in a week.</p><p>CASONE:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we'll celebrate National Puppy Day when I get home.  Dagen, are you going to be celebrating with Charlie this weekend?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  We celebrate every day and people even yesterday because I talked to him like he is a person out in public and people think that I've completely lost my mind.  But I would say this, rescue is our favorite breed, although I do love a lab.  There is a lab who is a working dog in the building.  Her name is Persia.  And Persia when I see her, she looks at me and flips over on her back and sticks all four legs in the air because she wants belly-rub.</p><p>She's supposed to be on the job and she's not but I will give her -- I always come up with some belly scratches for her.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nothing comes between belly rubs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  belly rubs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And puppies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Belly rubs.  You know what I'm talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Happy National Puppy Day, Dagen.  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back.  Defending the Green New Deal.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says her proposal is being misinterpreted.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SETH MEYERS, NBC HOST:  You would outlaw cows --</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  Oh, yes.</p><p>MEYERS:  Cows farting, that would be out.  Children, hamburgers, ice cream.</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ:  It's always good to see how these narratives are manipulated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will discuss it and then more of my exclusive interview with President Trump.  Don't miss it.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo live this morning in Washington.  It is Friday, March 22nd, your top stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the east coast.  President Trump slamming the impending Mueller report in my exclusive interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  It's all a big hoax, it's a witch hunt and it's a hoax.  We have been treated very, very unfairly all because Jeff Sessions didn't have a clue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will get reaction from former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, coming up this morning.  We're taking a look at weakness at the opening of trading, Futures indicating a decline of almost 200 points.  This is taking a cue from Europe because we had Purchasing Managers' Index surveys out in France, in Germany.  A number of the European PMIs were weaker than expecting, showing that manufacturing within the Eurozone is weakening.  We know that it's expected to grow one percent, the Eurozone is in 2019.  So, that is weighing on European markets, and the U.S. is following suite.</p><p>European down across the board, FT-100 is down 100, 1-1/3 percent; CAC Quarante down 73, also 1-1/3 percent; and the DAX Index in Germany down 95 points.  Germany has had a tough -- rough go at it this week, after the Bayer sell-off as well.  It is down, again, almost one percent on the DAX Index.  In Asia overnight, markets were fractionally moving, but they were higher across the board.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the Green New Deal, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking out on the Green New Deal last night on \"Late Night.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ:  They're trying to say that the Green New Deal is about what we have to give up, what we have to cut back on, when in fact, the Green New Deal itself is a resolution to be more expansive.  It is to be able to generate more and to make sure that we're investing in working class -- in working-class Americans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I asked President Trump about the Green New Deal in my exclusive sit-down yesterday.  Here's what he had to say about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  The Democrats actually are becoming a far-left party.  You look at this Green New Deal, it's the most preposterous thing.  Now, I don't want to knock it too much right now, because I really hope they keep going forward with it, you know, frankly, because I think it's going to be very easy to beat.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Douglas Holtz-Eakin's group says it's going to cost $94 trillion.  Joining is right now is former Utah Congressman, former House Oversight Committee Chairman, and Fox News Contributor, Jason Chaffetz.  Jason, it's great to see you.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  First, your thoughts on the Green New Deal, and whether or not this has legs.  Every time Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talks about it, she basically refers to it as broad strokes.  You know, don't worry about the fact that it doesn't make sense, don't worry about the fact that we're obviously not going to get rid of fossil fuels in the next 10 years.  That makes no sense.  It's just an idea.  What do you think?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, it's an actual piece of legislation that has been embraced by most of the Democratic 2020 candidates on the Democratic side of the party, so there's a lot to about worried about there.  The economics make no sense, the absurdity on its face is ridiculous.  But let's be careful as Republicans as from -- as a Republican point of view to summarily dismiss it when I think it'd be a mistake.  Because she is communicating with a younger generation who maybe hasn't looked at the economics of it, and they think, well, why can't we do these things?  If you believe that the world is going to end because of plastic straws in the next 10 years, you're looking at this and thinking this is a viable piece of legislation and you should do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  But Republicans have also got to communicate why they believe -- or what they can do to help the planet, and they can't just say, oh, it's ridiculous or they're going to lose a huge section of the younger -- the younger population.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, is that why the Democrats want the voting age to start at 16 years old, Matt Schlapp?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes, I mean, there is this -- this is the work I do at CPAC.  You know, half of the people that come to our events are high school kids and college kids.  So, we haven't lost that generation, but Jason is right, we have to reach out and talk to them.  The Democrats think that they own certain groups of Americans, and I think we're still -- people have my point of view, we are still being listened to, but we've got to deconstruct why the Green New Deal will harm them.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  How do you talk to them about the environment if --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Easily.  Easily.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The Green New Deal is a no-go for me.  How do you --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  No, it's very easy.  Carbon is not pollution.  This is the problem.  We could spend money combating pollution, having cleaner air, or cleaner water, or we could take that same money where we -- instead of combating pollution, we can do this all hoax, this facade over CO2, which will do nothing but raise people's energy prices.  It's nothing but a war on fossil fuels.  It's a diversion from cleaning up our environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let me move on to the Mueller report, Jason, because President Trump wade in during my interview, and former FBI Director Jim Comey wrote an op-ed in The New York Times titled this, \"What I Want From the Mueller Report.\"  In this op-ed, Comey writes in part, \"Even though I believe Mr. Trump is morally unfit to be President of the United States, I'm not rooting for Mr. Mueller to demonstrate that he is a criminal.  I'm also not rooting for Mr. Mueller to clear the President.  I'm not rooting for anything at all, except that the special counsel be permitted to finish his work.\"</p><p>Now, in my exclusive interview yesterday, I had the chance to ask the President about this ongoing probe into Russia collusion, and this narrative nonsense of the last two years.  Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now, we're going to get the Mueller report.  What are you expecting?</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, it's always interesting to me because a deputy that didn't get any votes appoints a man that didn't get any votes.  He's going to write a report on me.  I had one of the greatest election victories in history.  Would you say that's true?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.</p><p>TRUMP:  They came from the valleys, they came from the rivers, they came from the cities, they came from all over, they voted in one of the greatest elections in the history of our country.  And now, I have a man that because we have an attorney general who -- nobody can even believe that he didn't tell me, but he recused himself.  So, I have a man who is a deputy who I don't know, who I didn't know at all, and he appoints a man who had just left my office.  I didn't give him the job at the FBI.  For two years, we've gone through this nonsense.  With no -- because there's no collusion with Russia.  You know that better than anybody.  And there's no obstruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason, I find it so ironic that here is Jim Comey writing this op-ed, meanwhile, he was the Director of the FBI at the time.  He knew he had flimsy evidence to actually wiretap an American citizen, just so that they could spy on a political enemy's campaign.  He knew that Hillary Clinton was actually a part of the dossier's history and paid for it, and then he writes this whole op-ed as if he's neutral.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Well, yes, you read the op-ed and it's rich with irony, because you're exactly right, the -- and the President is right about Director Comey here, too.  You know, Comey tries to go to great lengths to say that the President has been tearing apart the rule of law.  To the contrary, the President has let this process play out with arm's length.  He has professed his innocence as an innocent person would do time and time and time again.  He waived the executive privilege, he opened up to interviews, he provided all the documents.  What else do you want a President to do?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And so, I think the -- I think the President is on the right side of this.  What James Comey did to Hillary Clinton, I think the way he did it was absolutely wrong, he started exonerating her before they had even interviewed her.  I mean, the list is long, and if you look at the senior most leadership at the FBI, it is disastrous.  The top echelon there has done a great disservice to this country, and torn down the belief in the FBI that was there before.  My grandfather was a career FBI agent.  But I got to tell you, the more we learn about Comey, we -- the more we learn that the way he administered that department was fundamentally wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they had those two investigations going side-by-side, the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation and the Trump collusion investigation.  And now, we know from the Lisa Page testimony that the (INAUDIBLE) released, they were told at the FBI, lay off Hillary from the DOJ, Obama's DOJ.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  And you combine that with Mr. Baker's testimony, the general counsel there, and then you start to see a pattern that what Comey testified in front of Congress, was not true.  That there was never a chance for lady justice to actually administer justice.  It was just absolutely wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good op-ed in the Journal about this today by Kim Strassel, Matt.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes, absolutely.  I think the key thing here is that for those of us who were saying that Hillary Clinton was guilty of breaking the law, and that Obama's Department of Justice is actually the guilty party in getting involved in the investigations in calling off the FBI, and the prosecutors at DOJ.  Who's going to apologize for all these two years of people saying that that was made up and that was, you know, that was wrong?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  We wasted two years of our political discourse talking about a fiction, and we allowed all the wrongdoing to occur, and it's travesty.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the question is, William Barr, Jason, is he going to seek the truth, the A.G.?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Yes, I think he has the degree of creditability on both sides of the aisle.  He is -- he's got a great background on this.  And ironically, if you look at what happened -- because James Comey basically set this up so the special prosecutor would be there, the irony of all of this is I don't think there will be any charges or any evidence of any collusion.  We'll see.  But that's what you would think at this point.  And without any of that, guess what, the President comes out of this stronger than ever, because he will have the support of that document behind him.  And all of these people who've been flailing about the President going down, the President will be stronger politically than ever.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we should get the Mueller report, if not this weekend, next week, it is coming.  We have a lot of evidence to believe that the report should be out within the next few days.  Jason -- yes, go ahead, real quick.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Is that a reason to make it public?  We were having this discussion earlier.  Should all of this stuff be out there?  So, Jason, you say that this is -- you know, this will exonerate the President.  Do you think the whole thing should be out there from the get-go?</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Your gut says yes.  There are certain material under the law, a grand jury testimony among the things that cannot be released.  So, don't get caught up in that, oh, Democrats will flail about -- hey, we want all of it released.  But under the law, not all of it can be released.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, understood.  Jason, good to see you this morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jason Chaffetz in Utah.  Coming up, more of my exclusive sit-down with the President.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that.  And then, our favorite moments from the week right here.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump and I covered a lot of ground yesterday during my one-on-one exclusive with him.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I don't want to weigh in.  I want to ask you a question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, OK.</p><p>VARNEY:  I wonder if that's legit or not, but I'm going to ask you anyway.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>VARNEY:  OK.  Of all the points that you made with the President, in that great interview, what's the single most important point that you should -- that you want to put before our viewers at 9:00?  What is it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think you want to look at economic growth and whether or not he can keep this going.  I mean, he said that the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates actually hampered growth.  Now, we did see a 3.1 percent economic growth year-over-year, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, '17 tor '18.  But he said that it could have been four percent, if the Fed did not raise rates.  Obviously, the news around Mueller was important, as the -- as the Mueller report is going to drop soon.</p><p>His reaction to -- his talking about John McCain and why he is so upset with the late senator, because McCain gave the dossier, which of course, was salacious and unverified to the FBI.  That, I thought, was also worth a mention in terms of what's behind this upset.  Obviously, you know, a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are upset with him, that he keeps talking about him.  And I think the news that he broke yesterday Golan Heights ahead of the election in Israel, also worthwhile.</p><p>But when it comes to the economic stuff, the China news is important, we've got a meeting next week.  Lighthizer and Steven Mnuchin going to China.  He said a deal could get done.  He's expecting a deal to get done.  I wonder if, in fact, the Chinese are pushing back on I.P. theft and whether or not, they're ever really going to be able to change that behavior, because I think it's a culture.  But I also think the fact that the President said we can come up with some enforcement mechanisms to keep them in line is worthwhile as well.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's a lot of stuff.  Why don't you come over and start at 9:00 and tell everybody all over again, why don't you?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's just my two cents, Stu, but, you know?</p><p>VARNEY:  About two dollars' worth, actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Maria, that was great.  Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you have a big interview, coming up, Jeff Flock is going to interview Mary Barra.  And of course, the President has been pressuring G.M. to either sell that plant or reopen it in Ohio.  So, we'll see what Mary Barra has to say about that on your show.</p><p>VARNEY:  I -- wait, I want to see what she's going to say about this pressure from the President about Lordstown.  She'll have an answer, I'm sure.  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.  Thanks so much.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join Stuart, coming up.  But first, our favorite moments from this past week on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We've been on the road.  Don't miss it.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It's been a big week here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  We've been on the road.  Take a look at some of the top moments from the program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Under your administration's policy, we've seen growth in the economy, in jobs, the stock market, but now, the rest of the world is slowing.  How are you going to keep this elevated growth going?</p><p>TRUMP:  And you look at what's going on with respect to China.  Our deal is coming along very well.  We'll see what happens.  But we're taking in billions and billions of dollars for the first time ever against China in the form of tariffs.  I'm very happy with that, but I think the deal will probably happen.  I think they need it very badly.  The world going in a little bit the wrong direction, not horribly.  I think a lot of people are waiting for the deal with China.  I think that's going to have a very big impact, maybe bigger than people know.  As to whether or not it makes it, I think it will.  I had Facebook, Google, Twitter, everybody against me.  I have the medias, almost totally against me, and yet I won.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the vitriol happening today in Washington?</p><p>JOHN BOEHNER, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  So, it was crazy enough when I was there.  It's just gotten exponentially more crazy since I left.  Both parties are being held hostage by the extreme wings in their party.  And any idea that there should be -- there will be any cooperation is -- it's just not going to happen.  And so, it's messy, but listen, it's democracy.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I'm not being asked to chose between my marriage and my job, Donald Trump has never made -- the President has never made me feel that way, Maria.  I know George was quoted recently as saying, I don't -- I wish she didn't work there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, does he want you to step down?  George -- does George say --</p><p>CONWAY:  Certainly.  Certainly.</p><p>KEVIN HASEETT, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS:  Capex number is really the source of all the good news, because we're getting a capital expenditure boom, up about nine percent since the tax cuts passed.  And that nine percent capital spending boom is creating jobs.  And this year, it's going to create output and also continue.  And we can see that in the orders data.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  It's absolutely staggering how prolific the Chinese are, who are the number one penetrators of our cyberspace.</p><p>SUSAN DEVORE, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, PREMIER:  Innovation needs to continue in the development of new drugs, but we have to get the control over the pricing of drugs.</p><p>KATIE COURIC, AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST:  We definitely need people to be more engaged, and to get involved in science, because that really is the solution, it's nonpartisan, it really -- it transcends politics, and it's the key to solving incurable diseases, climate change, and environment issues.</p><p>KEVIN JOHNSON, CEO, STARBUCKS:  I think the competition, globally, around the addressable market of coffee has been -- has been increasing over the last three to five years.  You know, some of it is start-up companies or third wave independents, but you've seen, you know, many large companies making acquisitions, and doing consolidation around the industry of coffee.  You know, for Starbucks, we've stayed focused on the formula who's worked for us for the last 48 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Survey shows that three in five millennials say that life is more stressful for them right now than ever before.</p><p>JOY VILLA, SINGER-SONGWRITER:  I mean, losing your phone charger, having a cracked phone screen, not getting enough likes on your social media, these are the things that millennials have problems with now.</p><p>CASONE:  Sesame Street releasing Muppet stamps to celebrate the show's 50th anniversary.  Meanwhile, Sesame Street has caused a heated debate on Twitter.  Here's what they tweeted, they asked, \"Which of the Muppets would you take on a deserted island with you?\"  Well, how about you?  What do you think?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm going to go with you, Cookie Monster.</p><p>CASONE:  Cookie -- OK, Cookie Monster.  There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, what about you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Since I am Oscar the Grouch, you do not want to be stuck on a deserted island with me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, welcome back with our all-star panel.  Final thoughts, Matt Schlapp?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yet another Trump accomplishment, that executive order on free speech on college campuses.  Way to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  You're right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  You covered a lot of ground with the President on trade.  That's the big issue for the markets.  We're coming down to the wire.  We have to see if he gets something done with China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they going to be able to do an enforcement enough to actually keep China to its promises to not steal I.P.?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's one of many issues and that's why one of the things he said is important, that they want to keep some of these tariffs in place until they see some of this -- some of these agreements coming to fruition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He also said to you which made my ears burn, no to zero tariffs with Europe on automobiles.  And he actually praised the 25 percent import tariffs on light trucks, called the Chicken Tax, which your viewers know because we've talked about it literally for two years on this program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was important, you're right, the zero taxes.  He doesn't want to go there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That will do it for today.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel, great program.  Have a great weekend.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTWIR-2196703147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INTWIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRK-5H11-DY0W-40G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319388</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

We did get better than expected best quarter GDP, but Intel and Exxon Mobil earnings weighing on the market.  We are an hour away from the end of trading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As things stand now, the NASDAQ is at a record high and this is what is moving the markets on Friday, April 26th.  Donald Trump said the U.S. has the world's best economy after some bumper GDP numbers and Uber makes its latest pitch for the year's biggest IPO and Ford take things up a gear.  The shares are actually up 10 percent after some turbocharged earnings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, everyone.  I am Zain Asher, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>All right, welcome, everybody.  A big surprise when the world's biggest economy.  Talk of the U.S. economic slowdown was certainly premature in the first quarter.  The preliminary reading of GDP growth came in at 3.2% annual rate that was actually a lot better than what folks had been anticipating.  The economy managed to struggle risks, like trade disputes, severe weather and the government shutdown.  The report put President Trump in a buoyant mood.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They were far higher than even the high expectations.  GDP is an incredible number. But remember this, not only that, we have a great growth, which is growth.  We have great growth, and also very, very low inflation.  Our economy is doing great -- number one in the world.  We are the number one economy right now in the world.  And it's not even close.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER:  So you had the President there saying that the U.S. is number one in the world.  We're still actually waiting for growth numbers from other countries of the first quarter.  And that U.S. expansion could still cool off, but the United States looks like it is outpacing actually every other -- almost every other -- I should say advanced economy.</p><p>In the latest IMF predictions for the world's eight biggest advanced economies, the Fund says the U.S. is actually out in front and Spain is the only other one of the eight that is expected to grow more than 2 percent this year, Germany might not even quite make 1 percent.</p><p>Lindsey Piegza is chief economist at Independent Financial Services and joins us live now from Minnesota.  Lindsey, thank you so much for being with us.  So pretty good GDP numbers for the United States, 3.2 percent.  Just walk us through what's behind the numbers.</p><p>LINDSEY PIEGZA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STIFEL:  Oh, I think it was better than just good.  I think that was a pretty solid number, well above expectations as you mentioned, and beating the street consensus, which was at just 2.3 percent.  So this really alleviates a lot of the concern that the U.S. economy was falling off a cliff at least near term.</p><p>But what's interesting is when we look at some of the underlying details, there still is a lot of reason to be concerned about the health of the U.S. economy as we move further into 2019 and beyond.  And I say that because when we look at the details, most every key component of the report did contribute to the GDP rise, which in part is why we saw such an elevated level.</p><p>But rising doesn't necessarily mean that it beat or continued to see this positive trend relative to what we saw last quarter.  And in fact, the only areas where we did see a beat relative to fourth quarter was in inventories, trade and government.  And if we strip out those three components and look at something called final domestic sales, U.S. GDP actually only rose 1.3 percent, the weakest pace of expansion that we've seen in years.</p><p>When we look at consumption, consumption was still positive.  So U.S. consumers are still out in the marketplace spending, but they did so at a noticeably slower pace relative to what we saw in 2018.  The same story carries forward for business investment, housing, and of course, we continue to see this disinflationary trend in terms of inflation back in in the domestic U.S. marketplace.  So really a mixed bag, when you start to look a little further beyond that headline of 3.2 percent increase.</p><p>ASHER:  I see what you're saying.  So the headline number 3.2 percent, even though it sounds stellar, it is a little bit misleading.  Obviously, the Fed has talked about being cautious, they've decided they're not going to raise interest rates for the rest of 2019.  Based on what you're saying it doesn't sound like these numbers are unlikely to change that -- are likely to change that.</p><p>PIEGZA:  No, I don't think they are.  One number in and of itself, certainly won't change Fed policy.  But again, as we look at some of those underlying components, particularly in the weakness in consumption and investment, again, still positive, but it's that second derivative decline or that loss of momentum relative to what we saw in previous quarters, and that's really going to set the stage for concern for the Fed.</p><p>[15:05:06] PIEGZA:  If we continue to see this waning activity in those two key areas, it's very likely that we do see some disappointing GDP numbers in the near term.  And that's going to really add to this uncertainty for the Federal Reserve, keeping them on the sideline and maybe even expanding the conversation to potentially a rate cut.  If we do, in fact, see more disappointing growth reports after this more impressive start to the year.</p><p>ASHER:  Okay, so speaking of disappointment, and just cautiousness in general, just a couple of months ago, everybody was talking about fears of recession, the inverted yield curve, that sort of thing.  I mean, all those fears still overblown, do you think?</p><p>PIEGZA:  Well, I think there is absolutely a very real reason for concern when we talk about the risk of losing further momentum, sliding into maybe the first negative print.  Now, whether or not we're talking about a near term recession, a technical back-to-back quarters of negative growth remains to be seen.</p><p>But I think it is very clear that there are some red flags in the domestic economy at this point in the domestic data that is showing a loss of momentum, particularly on the consumer side, and in terms of business investment.  And again, if we continue to see these two key areas lose this level of activity, this positive level of activity, I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that we do see negative growth or a possible recession when we look out to 2020 and beyond.</p><p>Now, typically, in terms of the yield curve, as you mentioned, this is a good predictor of recession 12 to 18 months out and an inversion in the yield curve.  But typically, we look at twos to tens inversion.  This time around, we saw some other types of inversion, which could be some sort of a predictor but again, historically, we haven't seen yet that inversion twos to tens giving us that indication.</p><p>ASHER:  So then, just based on Uber roll this idea of what you're saying that, you know, the recession fears are not necessarily that overblown.  There is some fear that is certainly a little bit justified.  When you hear President Trump taking a victory lap, and saying that, you know, the U.S. has the best economy in the world, what goes through your mind?</p><p>PIEGZA:  Well, I think that's typical of politicians, right?  Politicians want to make sure that they are pandering to their base to either sell the current policies in place, or arguing against them.  So I'm sure we'll hear from the other side of the aisle arguing about some of the temporary supports that went into first quarter growth.</p><p>So I think that's a little more from a political or politically-fueled response, as opposed to some of the more fundamentals that we're looking at in the individual details of the report.  But certainly, to the President's credit, I think there was a lot of legislation that helped expand or prolong the expansion in the domestic economy.  And that's something that he's going to take credit for and certainly want to highlight as the 2020 elections are already on the forefront of most Americans minds.</p><p>ASHER:  Yes, it is that game, the 2020 election, that's what the focus is squarely on.  Lindsey Piegza live for us.  Thank you so much.  Appreciate that.</p><p>PIEGZA:  Absolutely.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, so even with strong headline U.S. economic numbers, Wall Street remains mixed in the final hour of trading as things down the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P have been trading at record highs.  Right now, the Dow is actually the only index that is not yet at an all-time high.</p><p>The hotter than expected first quarter growth combined with surprisingly weak inflation, this should make for a fascinating debate at the Fed about the direction of rates policymakers meet next week.  And Intel shares are having a bit of a rough day on Wall Street because of disappointing earnings results.</p><p>Tim Anderson of TJM Investors talked to my colleague, Julia Chatterley about the big picture for stocks.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM ANDERSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TJM INVESTMENTS:  We've certainly had a whirlwind week of earnings topped off by some more earnings today.  And of course, the GDP number.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR:  What do you make?  What's the most important here for investors?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, I think what's very important is that though there's been numerous earnings disappointments, some very high profile stock declines of 10 percent or more Intel today, 3M yesterday, its largest decline since the crash in '87.  And the market just has this way of working through all of it and rotating into other names.</p><p>Those two names -- Intel and 3M --major components of the Dow, the Dow is down only 100 points right now in the last two days.  It's just remarkable the resilience behind the market, and how investors are -- there's no doubt that they're selling bad earnings.  There's no doubt that they're also taking some profits and some stocks that are reporting really good earnings.  And that's very healthy.  But now this GDP report is almost like another variable that a lot of economists are going to have to go back and take a closer look at their model and take a closer look at what maybe this means for the rest of the year for the whole economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER:  Actually part of that market resilience that Tim was talking about just there has actually come from tech stocks.  As we approach the earnings endgame, we've been collecting big tech earnings like Thanos collects Infinity stones.  Facebook has actually risen at more than 7 percent this week after shrugging off various scandals to deal with.  Privacy and that sort of thing.</p><p>[15:10:14] ASHER:  Microsoft actually joined the trillion dollar club in terms of valuation.  The very first time after impressing the market with its own numbers, and Amazon has kept it going, announcing record profits after the bell last night.  Their shares are actually at more than 1 percent today.  We still have numbers from Apple.  That's going to be next week.</p><p>With that kind of firepower, the NASDAQ has been flooding with all-time highs throughout the week, may still hit a record high with the NASDAQ before the hour is done.  Alison Kosik is joining us live now.  So Alison, let's talk about Amazon to begin with.  Because a lot of us were talking about that they came in with stellar earnings.  However, there were a few blips, one of them being the fact that their profit guidance wasn't that great, partly because they intend to really invest in the future.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Right, and some of that investment are those fulfillment centers, in healthcare, premium video content.  There are a lot of questions as to how Amazon can continue pulling in this kind of profit, when it continues to invest in these kinds of expansions, these kinds of businesses.</p><p>But going back to that headline number, Amazon pulling in $3.6 billion in profit, that's more than double for the same time last year.  So gone are the days of Amazon, you know, bleeding money when it was acquiring and gathering its sort of businesses around it.  Amazon has kind of joined the club of learning what it's like to kind of make those consistent profits, but also deal with sluggish sales growth.</p><p>It is remarkable that once again, as we see Amazon continue to make these expansions, let's say into fulfillment centers that it is pulling in this profit.  Case in point, you think about Amazon increasing the amount of membership for its Prime members, and still in the quarter, increasing the number of people coming in to be those Prime members, how many businesses do you know raising prices, and still able to pull in customers?  Well, Amazon is able to do that.</p><p>The other part of the profit picture for Amazon, Cloud computing and advertising business for Amazon Cloud computing, 41 percent sales increased their advertising business looking healthy as well.  And one thing that stuck out with me, Amazon upping the ante for its competitors, offering that free-two day shipping benefit that it often gives to its Prime subscribers evolving that into one day, that one day shipping perk in an effort to kind of increase those shopping numbers.</p><p>So Amazon is really putting the pressure on its consumers -- on its competitors rather by saying, look, \"We can deliver in one day, what can you do?\"</p><p>ASHER:  What can you do?  And when you think about just what a week, this has been for tech stocks.  I mean, you and I were talking about this yesterday, I think, you have Microsoft reaching that $1 trillion valuation partly because they've done so well with Xbox, Surface, that sort of thing.  And then you also have Facebook.  I mean, they completely shrugged off all of their scandals when it came to privacy and security concerns.  What do you make of this week with tech stocks?</p><p>KOSIK:  Well, forget about this week.  Look at what the prognosticators were saying about first quarter earnings, everybody was saying we're going to have an earnings recession.  I don't see it.  A little over a third of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported it looks like we're not going to see first quarter earnings go negative.  We will see it flat or even positive.</p><p>So I think that all those negative naysayers who were saying we're going to see an earnings recession, I think that they were jumping the gun.</p><p>ASHER:  Although Tesla didn't exactly have a good --</p><p>KOSIK:  Good point.</p><p>ASHER:  Unfortunately, all right, Alison Kosik, live for us.  Thank you so much.  Have a great weekend.</p><p>Okay, so looking at Europe those better than expected U.S. growth numbers helped lift stocks over there, too.  Let's take a look here, the German DAX and the CAC 40 Paris, you could see they closed higher.  The DAX up about a third of one percent.  The CAC 40 of about a fifth of one percent.  In London, the FTSE 100 was a touch lower dragged down by Royal Bank of Scotland saying that Brexit uncertainty is putting a cloud over future growth.</p><p>All right, coming up here, tech unicorns unveil their IPO strategies.  Uber keeps expectations low with a very cautious valuation and Slack cut out the middleman in the direct listing, and after mass executions in Saudi Arabia, CNN has actually exclusive reporting that some men say they were tortured into signing confessions, the man who inspired the Magnitsky Act, Bill Browder will join us.  He is calling for sanction.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:17:10] ASHER:  There are calls for new sanctions on Saudi Arabia tonight.  The United Nations and Amnesty International are outraged over the latest mass executions there. Now Saudi Arabia announced this week that the 37 men had been executed mostly for offenses of planning, terrorism or spying, but trial documents reviewed exclusively by CNN reveal that contrary to Saudi claims, all defendants admitted their guilt.</p><p>Some of the 37 said they were innocent.  Court filing show they pleaded for their lives and told judges they had been tortured into making false confessions.  Senior international correspondent Arwa Damon has this story from Istanbul.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Among these hundreds and hundreds of pages are \"please\" statements from those who have now been executed to the judge in court saying that they are innocent.  Some of them say that their confessions were forced, that they had been tortured, that they didn't know what they were signing.</p><p>One man, Wani Al-Adam (ph), 27 years old, slightly blind and deaf says quote, \"Those aren't my words.  I did not write a letter.  This is defamation written by the interrogator with his own hand.\"  One of the other young men who was just 17 years old at the time that his so-called crime was committed, his father pleading to the court on his son's behalf saying that his son was subjected to psychological and physical abuse, that the interrogator dictated the confession and forced him forced his son to sign it just so that the torture would stop.</p><p>These documents that were exclusively obtained by CNN's Tamara Qiblawi center around the cases of 25 of the men out of the 37 that Saudi Arabia executed on Tuesday.  We reached out to Saudi authorities asking about the contents of these documents and whether or not the allegations of torture had been investigated.  We have yet to receive a response.</p><p>But the Saudi government did say on Tuesday that those executed had been found guilty and that they had had their day in court and that the Kingdom had a zero tolerance policy.  But it would appear from the content of these court documents themselves that there were numerous occasions -- numerous instances where those who were put on trial were saying that their confessions were extracted under torture.</p><p>But despite all of the human rights allegations surrounding the Kingdom's activities, there seems to not have been much of an effect on a conference that took place just the next day that saw major banks and financial institutions in attendance and human rights seemingly not on the table.  Arwa Damon, CNN, Istanbul.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:20:10]ASHER:  The public outcry over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi prompted some overseas investors in Saudi Arabia to freeze their plans.  Six months later, that's begun to thaw.</p><p>Top executives from Blackrock, HSBC, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley all appeared it an event in Riyadh on Wednesday just hours after the news broke of recent executions.  CNN has reached out to each of the banks and either got no response or was told no comment.</p><p>Several companies have already decided to go ahead with their investments.  SoftBank is keeping the $45 billion it got from Saudi Arabia for its vision fund.  Earlier this month, AMC said it would go ahead with a plan to open dozens of movie theaters in the country.  And Aramco, the state-owned oil company had a mammoth $12 billion bond sale that was a smash hit with international investors Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, HSBC, and Morgan Stanley all accepted money to help Aramco sell the bonds.</p><p>Crown Prince Mohamed Bil Salman claims to be reforming and opening up Saudi Arabia, but with ever more claims of human rights abuses, overseas observers are questioning what his reform really means.</p><p>In January at the World Economic Forum, Richard pressed the Saudi Finance Minister about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed al-Jadaan promised his government was working hard to change.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOHAMMED AL-JADAAN, SAUDI FINANCE MINISTER:  We are committed to reform.  We are reforming and we will continue whether it is institutional reform within the government, Intelligence system as announced by the government, but also in the economy.  So there is a lot happening and we are committed to continuing that journey.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER:  Bill Browder helped put the Magnitsky Act into law in the United States, it empowers the U.S. to place economic sanctions on human rights abuses.  He tweeted a link to CNN story and wrote, \"In Saudi Arabia, they tortured 37 men, forced them to sign false confessions and then executed them, including three below the age of 18.  Very Stalin-esque time for more Magnitsky sanctions on Saudi officials.\"  Bill Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital, joins us live now from London.</p><p>So Bill, here's my question to you.  If Western powers decided to stop doing business with Saudi Arabia, because of these human rights abuses, how much of an impact do you think that would actually have on the Saudi government on the Saudi royal family in terms of these executions?</p><p>BILL BROWDER, CEO, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Well, first of all, the Saudi Royal Family is one of the richest and most internationally invested families around and so if they found themselves not welcome in western capitals, if they found their money not welcome, that would be a very, very severe punishment for them and they wouldn't change their ways.</p><p>Right now, what they do is that they were involved in this horrific killing of Jamal Khashoggi, they've now executed a whole bunch of people in a mass trial, where three minors were executed and they don't seem to feel any consequence from this.</p><p>And so until there's a consequence, they're going to carry on doing all the terrible stuff they're doing and these two examples are just the tip of the iceberg of the human rights abuses and oppressions that are going on in that country.</p><p>ASHER:  So Adam Aron, the CEO of AMC theater chain, they're actually expanding massively in Saudi Arabia has come out and said, you know, they're doing this for the Saudi people.  That it's important for AMC to do business in Saudi Arabia in order to help the Saudi people not necessarily the government, do you buy that?</p><p>BROWDER:  Well, anytime a big company goes into a country that has a spotty record like Saudi Arabia, it legitimizes the government.  And so I believe that that he is talking his own book, his comments are self-serving for his own business and economics.  But the one thing I would say is that people like him and others may find themselves in a very uncomfortable position at some point in the future, when the West finally says enough is enough.</p><p>Because when you're in business in a country where serious sanctions are applied, you get stuck in the crossfire between the countries that are sanctioning and the country that's being sanctioned.  And we've seen this with many businesses that were doing business with Putin's cronies that were put on the sanctions list last year, it's not a pleasant situation to be caught in that crossfire and at that point, they may then see it not being such a great place to invest.</p><p>ASHER:  Do you really think, though, I mean, just based on what you just said, do you really think that Western powers at least anytime soon, in the short term will say enough is enough when you have President Trump, for example, indicating that he really does have no appetite to be tough on Saudi?  I mean, Saudi Arabia was the very first country that President Trump visited as soon as he became President.</p><p>BROWDER:  Well, that is true.  But at the same time, 17 Saudis were sanctioned for the grisly murder of Jamal Khashoggi by the United States and by various other countries.  And what I can say is that Trump may have his views but Congress and including many Republicans in Congress, are outraged by the behavior of Saudi Arabia and are doing many things different things to try to tighten the noose on that country so they don't get away with this stuff.</p><p>And so, you know, the world is a very fluid place.  Donald Trump maybe a President for two years, maybe even President for six years, but it's not going to be like that forever.</p><p>[15:25:10] ASHER:  So what is at stake financially for Western powers just in terms of oil prices, and just financially in general, if they cut their ties with Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BROWDER:  Well, there's, there's plenty of countries that you can get oil from.  We don't have to buy oil from Saudi Arabia.  We don't have to invest in Saudi Arabia.  We don't have to buy Saudi Arabian bonds if they're behaving like barbarians, which is what they're where they're doing right now.  You know, it's totally optional.  There's many countries in the world that produce oil.</p><p>The United States is actually an exporter of oil at this point, it doesn't have to -- the United States really doesn't need to buy oil from Saudi Arabia.</p><p>ASHER:  Is there any sort of western country in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder, was there any western country be it Canada or any other country that you felt really took the moral high ground in how they handled Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BROWDER:  Well, it is interesting because even before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Canada, started speaking out on behalf of imprisoned human rights activists and in response, Saudi Arabia cut all ties with Canada.  But Canada, stood there with their head held high, and they said, we're not going to budge.  We're not going to be bullied into changing our views or changing our behavior towards Saudi Arabia.  And that was a good public posture to take.</p><p>The idea that we are beholden to Saudi Arabia is just nonsense.  Saudi Arabia is not that important a country in the overall scheme of things.</p><p>ASHER:  Right.  Bill Browder, thank you so much for sharing your views.  Appreciate that.</p><p>BROWDER:  Thank you.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, up next, no surge pricing for Uber, the ride hailing company plays it safe when it comes to the IPO valuation.  Has it learned from Lyft's mistakes?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>ASHER:  Hi everyone, I'm Zain Asher.  Coming up on the next half hour of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, there is no slacking for the IPO market as a new tech unicorn joins the party.  And the curious case of Pepsi and the potatoes.  Indian farmers are outraged after being hit with legal threats.</p><p>So first, though, these are the news headlines on CNN at this hour.  CNN has obtained documents that raise questions about Saudi Arabia's mass execution of 37 alleged terrorists.  Many of the defendants claim they were coerced into confessing or torture.  The U.S. State Department official says Washington is urging the Saudis to ensure basic rights in the kingdom.</p><p>A massive search is underway in Sri Lanka as security forces try to prevent more potential terror attacks.  In one home, they found explosives, ISIS flags and uniforms.  The country's president says every household in the country will be checked in the wake of the devastating attacks on Easter Sunday.</p><p>And Russian national Maria Butina will spend another nine months in a U.S. prison and then be deported.  She had pled guilty to try and to infiltrate conservative political circles and promote Russian interest before and after the 2016 election.  Russia says the sentence is politically motivated.</p><p>And U.S. President Donald Trump says he is putting United Nations on notice.  That his administration will not ratify an International Arms Treaty.  He made the announcement at the annual meeting of America's most powerful gun lobby.  The treaty is meant to keep weapons away from human rights abusers.</p><p>And the judge presiding over the sexual assault case against Harvey Weinstein has banned the media from parts of Friday's pre-trial hearings.  It includes arguments about whether other allegations against Mr. Weinstein can be heard.  Weinstein faces five felony charges, he has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>We've got details on the biggest IPO of the year earlier today.  Uber unveiled the price range for its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.  The ride-sharing app is heading for evaluation of up to $84 billion U.S., that by the way is more than Delta, United Airlines and American Airlines combined.</p><p>Matt Egan is live for us in the newsroom.  So Matt, when you think about Uber's pricing, they priced it very sort of conservatively.  How has what happened to Lyft had an impact on Uber's strategy, do you think?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER:  So Zain, I think that Uber has learned some valuable lessons from its arch rival Lyft.  One, don't get too greedy on evaluation, and two, shore up support before the IPO.  Uber filed paperwork with the SEC this morning, saying that it intends to sell shares to the public at a range of $44 to $50 a piece.</p><p>Now, at the high end of that evaluation, it would be about $84 billion based on outstanding shares.  And while that is a ton of money, and as you pointed out, it's bigger than a lot of other major publicly-traded companies right now, it's actually a downshift from what Uber had previously been indicating.</p><p>Previously, it was about 90 billion to 100 billion, last year, there was even talk of 120 billion.  Uber also landed a pretty big endorsement from a major established company, and that's PayPal.  PayPal agreed to invest $500 million in Uber's common stock through a private placement at the IPO price.  And that's the kind of endorsement that I think could really sort of shore up some sentiment around this IPO.</p><p>Now, all of this is a big contrast to what happened with Lyft, which actually scaled up its ambitions right before going public, it raised the price target.  And what ended up happening is the company is actually still trading below its IPO price.  I think it's you know, a reflection of the fact that some investors are understandably nervous about betting on money-losing companies in a brand new industry, particularly at this point of the cycle where people are talking about economic slowdown and then eventually potentially a recession.</p><p>And you know, Uber is losing money.  The SEC filings that Uber filed this morning show that the company while it has about 90 million customers a month, it also lost about a billion dollars just in the last quarter.  And so I think that's another reason why it makes sense that Uber is tapping the brakes here on the evaluation.</p><p>ASHER:  Right, and investors obviously one of the things they're going to be really looking for is a path to profitability for Uber.  So, let's talk about slack because slack is obviously going public as well.  But this is not your sort of traditional everyday IPO, it's sort of directly listing prices.</p><p>[15:35:00]  EGAN:  That's right, Zain, so slack is taking a page out of the Spotify playbook, it's doing what they call a direct listing.  And so what that means is they're not going to be hiring investment banks and underwriters to test the market and value the stock, they're just going to list it directly.</p><p>And that's a way to save money on some investment bank and IPO-related fees.  The critics would say that, you know, it's a risky strategy because you could have some short-term, near-term volatility in the stocks since everyone is trying to figure out and assess how much it's worth.</p><p>But you know what? Spotify pulled it off, and so they proved that it's possible.  The other thing, you know, about a direct listing is that you know, they're not actually raising money.  While Uber is going to be raising billions of dollars, slack is not.  What this really is, is about insiders, the early investors, venture capitalists and the employees having a way to sell out their shares.</p><p>It gives them liquidity.  But you know, when you think about slack, this is another example of a company that is growing very quickly, it's got 10 million customers, users every day.  It's in 150 countries.  But it's another company that is losing money.  It posted a loss of $139 million in the most recent fiscal year.</p><p>So it's another important test to see whether or not investors want to bet on a company that is not profitable right now.</p><p>ASHER:  Right, Matt Egan, live for us there, thank you so much.  OK, so I want to turn now to Ford.  One of the standout performers on Wall Street today, shares are actually up more than 10 percent after first quarter earnings fell by less than expected.</p><p>Strong sales -- truck sales in the U.S. were the big factor there, partially offsetting weaker numbers in China and other international markets.  Joining me now, Rebecca Lindland; the founder of rebeccadrives.com.  Rebecca, thank you so much for being with us, so Ford there beating expectations, despite the fact that the car industry as a whole is struggling right now.  How have they done that?</p><p>REBECCA LINDLAND, FOUNDER, REBECCADRIVES.COM:  Well, you know, they really had to rely upon their F series Pickup truck, which is you know, really the bestselling vehicle in the states for the last few decades.  And it's an incredibly profitable vehicle for them.</p><p>The average transaction price of the F series is $47,000, which compared to the average transaction price of all vehicles is $35,000.  So they really make an incredible amount of profit off of their F series Pickup truck.</p><p>ASHER:  Just shifting gears in terms of talking about a possible merger, Renault wants to merge with Nissan, but Nissan executives are not a fan of the idea.  Just walk us through why not and what's happening on that front?</p><p>LINDLAND:  Yes, so Renault is actually much smaller than Nissan, but it has more of a stake in Nissan than Nissan does in Renault.  So it's not an equal partnership right now.  And Renault has gone to Nissan to say we want to see about making this an equal partnership.</p><p>This is something that Mr. Ghosn, who is now under indictment in Japan, always protected Nissan against, but then he started to get this idea that this might be a good idea.  And this was one of the things that people say led to his indictment with Nissan basically saying we want to protect our company, we don't want Paris to run us.</p><p>But at the same time, Renault says, well, they don't want to be run by Nissan.  So, it's this back and forth and just incredible tensions, a lot of complications, and it's just kind of a big fat mess right now.  I mean, it does --</p><p>ASHER:  It's like a technical -- yes, it does sort of feel as though since Carlos Ghosn isn't there anymore, the alliance between Renault and Nissan, it does sort of feel like that it's in jeopardy.</p><p>LINDLAND:  Well, you know, it's not in jeopardy on a day-to-day basis, in that there's hundreds of people that are working every day on making products that benefit both of these brands as well as Mitsubishi.  And Mitsubishi standing in this proposed alliance is not established yet.</p><p>So on a day-to-day basis, the alliance continues.  What is -- what is in turmoil is the structure and the ongoing structure.  What does this look like in a post-Ghosn world.  And that's what Nissan is trying to figure out, and Renault is offering this as a possible solution.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, Rebecca Lindland live for us, thank you so much, have a great weekend.</p><p>LINDLAND:  Thank you.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a legal fight that's not small potatoes.  The owner of Frito-lay says some farmers are treading on its territory.  We'll explain after the break.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER:  It's not exactly a traditional recipe, Pepsi and potatoes.  But put these ingredients together and you get a huge uproar.  PepsiCo is actually suing four Indian farmers, accusing them of growing a certain type of potato that it says is  exclusively for Lay's chips.</p><p>Is reportedly demanding damages amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Farmers Association in India say the law is on the side of the small farmers.  Now, Pepsi says it will drop the lawsuit if the farmers that it's suing join its authorized cultivation programs.</p><p>It's just one example of friction between small Indian operators and international mega corporations.  We've also seen local retailers accuse giants like Wal-Mart and Amazon of running -- or ruining rather their business.  Hannah Lownsbrough is the executive director of SumOfUs; an organization using people power to hold companies to account.</p><p>She joins us live now from London.  It -- you know, Hannah, it does actually seem rather aggressive to have this multi-national -- multi-billion dollar company suing four small farmers.  I mean, these farmers can't really be that much of a threat, can they?</p><p>HANNAH LOWNSBROUGH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SUMOFUS:  We don't think so.  I think some of us members feel that, you know, this is a really good example of a very large corporation taking on very small -- a very small pro -- you know, in many cases family-run businesses and going after them for amounts of money that are kind of spare change to a company like PepsiCo, but can be absolutely ruin for you know, for a small farmer.</p><p>ASHER:  How are the farmers actually supposed to know that a company like Pepsi has exclusive rights to a certain type of potato?</p><p>LOWNSBROUGH:  Well, I mean, I think this is exactly the question that some of us members, you know, would ask really.  And it sort of highlights the way in which it makes -- it's a bit of a nonsense really when these huge corporations seem to own things like seeds or water supply.  These sorts of things which, you know, to most people's way of thinking really belong to all of us.</p><p>So, you know, we're not surprised that the farmers, you know, didn't really believe themselves to be doing anything wrong, and that this lawsuit has come as a huge shock and is completely overwhelming.</p><p>ASHER:  The lawsuit for -- was for over a $100,000 for each of the farmers.  I mean, when you have a massive -- I mean, I can't even imagine what it's like to be a small time farmer in a place like India and having Pepsi suing you.  I mean, how do farmers protect themselves?</p><p>LOWNSBROUGH:  Well, I think it's difficult.  I think we're seeing civil society in India has really come forward to stand with these farmers and challenge the behavior of PepsiCo in this case.  But also you know, similar corporations.  You mentioned Amazon in the introduction, you know, who have also been accused of doing things which are really damaging many Indian domestic operations.</p><p>[15:45:00]  And I think there's some evidence that the Indian government is taking steps to regulate, but these are -- these are tough questions to answer because it is critically important that, you know, we don't end up in a situation where a handful of companies are you know, owning the seeds that we rely on to produce our food supply or, you know, are responsible for almost all the business that gets done online.</p><p>ASHER:  So Pepsi's argument is that they filed this lawsuit to protect the interest of thousands of farmers who are part of its potato farming program.  Is that a fair argument do you think?</p><p>LOWNSBROUGH:  I don't think so really.  I mean, I think you know, you asked a good question at the beginning which is, you know, how are they supposed to know really that these seeds are sort of, you know, they belong to somebody else.  But I also think that, you know, arguably, PepsiCo is really setting up a relationship of dependency between some of these farmers with whom it has its cultivation -- farmers with whom it has its cultivation program.</p><p>We're seeing examples in some cases for instance of seeds being developed that can -- will only grow and will only thrive if they're also raised using fertilizers or what have you, that are also produced by some of these parent companies.  So you are seeing sort of small farmers really ending up sort of in-hawked to some of these very big businesses.</p><p>And it's hard to see that as kind of, you know, creating the conditions in which everybody can make a success of -- make a success of a small business.</p><p>ASHER:  All right, Hannah, thank you so much for being with us, appreciate that.</p><p>LOWNSBROUGH:  Thank you.</p><p>ASHER:  OK, so from the farms of India, we are taking you to the lush landscape, that is Hawaii.  If you're going to do the hula dance, you better get your hips in gear.  Richard Quest is going to be showing us all how it's done, we'll be talking tourism in two shakes, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:50:00]  ASHER:  That music should be a clue to where we're heading next.  I'm filling in for Richard Quest this Friday night, but he actually doesn't have a day off, he's got an extremely difficult awful assignment filming one of the most beautiful remote islands in the entire world.  Richard Quest joins us live now from Waikiki Beach in Hawaii.</p><p>Richard, I was there six months ago actually in Kuhio, and it's beautiful, looks as though, Richard -- it looks as though sadly, Richard can't hear me.  It looks as though we'll have to come back to him.  All right, now, you don't need Hawaii's natural beauty to enjoy a holiday.</p><p>For the CEOs of Radisson hotels, beautiful design might be the key to beating the opposition in a crowded hotel market.  Richard went to meet Federico Gonzalez for a tour of the world's first ever design hotel.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN (voice-over):  The Royal Radisson hotel in Copenhagen.  The world's first design hotel, it dominated the skyline for more than five decades.  And it's here that I meet Radisson's chief executive, Federico Gonzales.</p><p>FEDERICO GONZALEZ, PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RADISSON HOSPITALITY:  Well, I think it helps, but at the same time it's really exciting with their latest and you really can't sign --</p><p>QUEST:  Federico manages Radisson's seven brands, and more than 1,400 hotels worldwide.</p><p>(on camera):  Is it intimidating competing for example against Marriott with its million rooms over more than 30 brands?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  No, not at all, it's exciting.  When I look to Radisson Hotel Group, and what we are doing in our building is much stronger and it will last much longer.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over):  For Radisson, it's been a bumpy ride.  Three years and three different owners.</p><p>(on camera):  I'm often left wondering what is Radisson?</p><p>GONZALEZ:  It's towards those consumers who do not want or cannot pay the price of the high, but they want a more memorable experience and they want something more exceptional.  So we call it affordable luxury.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over):  And so to this design elite hotel, the Royal Copenhagen, the vision of the architect Arnie Jacobson.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Welcome in.</p><p>QUEST:  Nice --</p><p>GONZALEZ:  This was the inner room where he stays because he wanted to really know and understand what was lightening, what was the views, how the views would change.</p><p>QUEST:  This hotel is where savings meets functionality, according to Gonzales.</p><p>(on camera):  These lights.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Yes, if we would build this today, it's much more cost effective than putting 20 different lights across.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over):  But I'm going to interview a hotel CEO, and of course, we have to test the most important part of the place.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  You are now behind a bit, right?</p><p>QUEST (on camera):  Right --</p><p>GONZALEZ:  And then you can feel not only the bed, the mattress, also the tissue.  Now, what is more important is, what are the figures you have? And if in your highest lead, you can choose where to sleep, different textures, different size, and then now you can look to your temptations.  This is really temptations.</p><p>QUEST:  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  Oh, you should have another one.</p><p>QUES:  And as for customer service, no skimping there.</p><p>GONZALEZ:  It is a culture.  This is a company where every employee or associate is absolutely obsessed with servicing them, and they are worth every moment matters.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over):  An inspiring strategy that will ensure this proud hotel group will remain my host.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER:  All right, let's try this again, Richard Quest is joining us live now from Waikiki Beach, I believe he can hear me.  So Richard, as beautiful, as stunning as it looks there behind you, I was surprised to hear that tourists spending on Hawaii is actually falling.  Why is that?</p><p>QUEST:  And it's interesting, that's one of the conundrums, Zain, that they don't quite understand.  In that report you heard how hoteliers are having to find new ways, different things that tourists want.  And that's certainly the same case.  Let's take Waikiki Beach in Hawaii where I am for World of Wonder.</p><p>Look, it's packed.  There's no shortage of people who are coming here, actually visitor numbers are up by some 2 percent to 4 percent.  But the spending, and that's the important part in many ways, the spend is down.  And this is something that many resorts are finding happening.</p><p>And Zain, what's really worrying about this is spend is the holy grail, with a resort like Hawaii and Honolulu, you want more tourists, but you want the right sort of tourists, you want them to stay longer and you want them to spend more.  So Zain, that's one of the interesting things.  It is paradise, but it's paradise with clouds on the horizon.</p><p>[15:55:00]  ASHER:  And just talk to us a bit more about hula dancing.  I understand that you got to try some yourself, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes, because we're here for World of Wonder.  And one of the important things about is, is what's the DNA of this place? The 50th state of the union, we're familiar with Hawaii 5-0.  I was determined to get that in.  We're familiar with all of that.</p><p>But what about hula? So I got a chance to try it out and realize it's not the tacky coconut bras and grass skirts that you often see.  My hula wasn't very good, but it gives me an understanding of the spiritual DNA of Hawaii.  And this afternoon, I get to try surfing, because again, as the Duke showed some years ago, surfing is part of the spiritual heritage of these islands.</p><p>ASHER:  Richard, you've got skills, I just watched that video, you are great at hula dancing, I'm inspired.  Richard Quest live for us there, thank you so much.  All right, so just a few minutes to go for the end of trading week on Wall Street.  After the break, we've got the final numbers and the closing bell.  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER:  All right, so let's take a look at the numbers in the last few minutes of trade on Wall Street.  As you can see behind me, the Dow is actually basically flat, up about 57 points or so.  And we've hovered up and down throughout the session, despite some pretty good, I should say stellar numbers in terms of first quarter GDP.</p><p>The Dow has been dragged down by Intel earnings that aren't necessarily that great, and also ExxonMobil earnings as well.  And my producer, Tom, simply cannot contain his excitement because we're told that the Wu-Tang Clan is going to be ringing the closing bell today at some part to celebrate a documentary on \"Showtime\" that is about them of \"Mics and Men\".</p><p>And as I mentioned, it was all about stronger-than-expected first quarter growth in terms of GDP in the United States, combined though with surprisingly weak inflation.  All of that should make for a fascinating debate when it comes to the Fed decision about the direction of rates.</p><p>They're not going to raise interest rates this year, but who knows? Policy makers do end up meeting next week.  And that is the closing bell on Wall Street.  As I mentioned, the Wu-Tang Clan as you can see up there is actually ringing the closing bell this Friday, and that is it my friends for QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I am Zain Asher, thank you so much for joining us, the news continues right here on CNN.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2216420899</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC2-9MR1-DY0W-423M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7836\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

We did get better than expected best quarter GDP, but Intel and Exxon Mobil earnings weighing on the market. We are an hour away from the end of trading.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As things stand now, the NASDAQ is at a record high and this is what is moving the markets on Friday, April 26th. Donald Trump said the U.S. has the world's best economy after some bumper GDP numbers and Uber makes its latest pitch for the year's biggest IPO and Ford take things up a gear. The shares are actually up 10 percent after some turbocharged earnings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello, everyone. I am Zain Asher, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>All right, welcome, everybody. A big surprise when the world's biggest economy. Talk of the U.S. economic slowdown was certainly premature in the first quarter. The preliminary reading of GDP growth came in at 3.2% annual rate that was actually a lot better than what folks had been anticipating. The economy managed to struggle risks, like trade disputes, severe weather and the government shutdown. The report put President Trump in a buoyant mood.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They were far higher than even the high expectations. GDP is an incredible number. But remember this, not only that, we have a great growth, which is growth. We have great growth, and also very, very low inflation. Our economy is doing great -- number one in the world. We are the number one economy right now in the world. And it's not even close.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: So you had the President there saying that the U.S. is number one in the world. We're still actually waiting for growth numbers from other countries of the first quarter. And that U.S. expansion could still cool off, but the United States looks like it is outpacing actually every other -- almost every other -- I should say advanced economy.</p><p>In the latest IMF predictions for the world's eight biggest advanced economies, the Fund says the U.S. is actually out in front and Spain is the only other one of the eight that is expected to grow more than 2 percent this year, Germany might not even quite make 1 percent.</p><p>Lindsey Piegza is chief economist at Independent Financial Services and joins us live now from Minnesota. Lindsey, thank you so much for being with us. So pretty good GDP numbers for the United States, 3.2 percent. Just walk us through what's behind the numbers.</p><p>LINDSEY PIEGZA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STIFEL: Oh, I think it was better than just good. I think that was a pretty solid number, well above expectations as you mentioned, and beating the street consensus, which was at just 2.3 percent. So this really alleviates a lot of the concern that the U.S. economy was falling off a cliff at least near term.</p><p>But what's interesting is when we look at some of the underlying details, there still is a lot of reason to be concerned about the health of the U.S. economy as we move further into 2019 and beyond. And I say that because when we look at the details, most every key component of the report did contribute to the GDP rise, which in part is why we saw such an elevated level.</p><p>But rising doesn't necessarily mean that it beat or continued to see this positive trend relative to what we saw last quarter. And in fact, the only areas where we did see a beat relative to fourth quarter was in inventories, trade and government. And if we strip out those three components and look at something called final domestic sales, U.S. GDP actually only rose 1.3 percent, the weakest pace of expansion that we've seen in years.</p><p>When we look at consumption, consumption was still positive. So U.S. consumers are still out in the marketplace spending, but they did so at a noticeably slower pace relative to what we saw in 2018. The same story carries forward for business investment, housing, and of course, we continue to see this disinflationary trend in terms of inflation back in in the domestic U.S. marketplace. So really a mixed bag, when you start to look a little further beyond that headline of 3.2 percent increase.</p><p>ASHER: I see what you're saying. So the headline number 3.2 percent, even though it sounds stellar, it is a little bit misleading. Obviously, the Fed has talked about being cautious, they've decided they're not going to raise interest rates for the rest of 2019. Based on what you're saying it doesn't sound like these numbers are unlikely to change that -- are likely to change that.</p><p>PIEGZA: No, I don't think they are. One number in and of itself, certainly won't change Fed policy. But again, as we look at some of those underlying components, particularly in the weakness in consumption and investment, again, still positive, but it's that second derivative decline or that loss of momentum relative to what we saw in previous quarters, and that's really going to set the stage for concern for the Fed.</p><p>[15:05:06] PIEGZA: If we continue to see this waning activity in those two key areas, it's very likely that we do see some disappointing GDP numbers in the near term. And that's going to really add to this uncertainty for the Federal Reserve, keeping them on the sideline and maybe even expanding the conversation to potentially a rate cut. If we do, in fact, see more disappointing growth reports after this more impressive start to the year.</p><p>ASHER: Okay, so speaking of disappointment, and just cautiousness in general, just a couple of months ago, everybody was talking about fears of recession, the inverted yield curve, that sort of thing. I mean, all those fears still overblown, do you think?</p><p>PIEGZA: Well, I think there is absolutely a very real reason for concern when we talk about the risk of losing further momentum, sliding into maybe the first negative print. Now, whether or not we're talking about a near term recession, a technical back-to-back quarters of negative growth remains to be seen.</p><p>But I think it is very clear that there are some red flags in the domestic economy at this point in the domestic data that is showing a loss of momentum, particularly on the consumer side, and in terms of business investment. And again, if we continue to see these two key areas lose this level of activity, this positive level of activity, I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that we do see negative growth or a possible recession when we look out to 2020 and beyond.</p><p>Now, typically, in terms of the yield curve, as you mentioned, this is a good predictor of recession 12 to 18 months out and an inversion in the yield curve. But typically, we look at twos to tens inversion. This time around, we saw some other types of inversion, which could be some sort of a predictor but again, historically, we haven't seen yet that inversion twos to tens giving us that indication.</p><p>ASHER: So then, just based on Uber roll this idea of what you're saying that, you know, the recession fears are not necessarily that overblown. There is some fear that is certainly a little bit justified. When you hear President Trump taking a victory lap, and saying that, you know, the U.S. has the best economy in the world, what goes through your mind?</p><p>PIEGZA: Well, I think that's typical of politicians, right? Politicians want to make sure that they are pandering to their base to either sell the current policies in place, or arguing against them. So I'm sure we'll hear from the other side of the aisle arguing about some of the temporary supports that went into first quarter growth.</p><p>So I think that's a little more from a political or politically-fueled response, as opposed to some of the more fundamentals that we're looking at in the individual details of the report. But certainly, to the President's credit, I think there was a lot of legislation that helped expand or prolong the expansion in the domestic economy. And that's something that he's going to take credit for and certainly want to highlight as the 2020 elections are already on the forefront of most Americans minds.</p><p>ASHER: Yes, it is that game, the 2020 election, that's what the focus is squarely on. Lindsey Piegza live for us. Thank you so much. Appreciate that.</p><p>PIEGZA: Absolutely.</p><p>ASHER: All right, so even with strong headline U.S. economic numbers, Wall Street remains mixed in the final hour of trading as things down the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P have been trading at record highs. Right now, the Dow is actually the only index that is not yet at an all-time high.</p><p>The hotter than expected first quarter growth combined with surprisingly weak inflation, this should make for a fascinating debate at the Fed about the direction of rates policymakers meet next week. And Intel shares are having a bit of a rough day on Wall Street because of disappointing earnings results.</p><p>Tim Anderson of TJM Investors talked to my colleague, Julia Chatterley about the big picture for stocks. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TIM ANDERSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TJM INVESTMENTS: We've certainly had a whirlwind week of earnings topped off by some more earnings today. And of course, the GDP number.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: What do you make? What's the most important here for investors?</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, I think what's very important is that though there's been numerous earnings disappointments, some very high profile stock declines of 10 percent or more Intel today, 3M yesterday, its largest decline since the crash in '87. And the market just has this way of working through all of it and rotating into other names.</p><p>Those two names -- Intel and 3M --major components of the Dow, the Dow is down only 100 points right now in the last two days. It's just remarkable the resilience behind the market, and how investors are -- there's no doubt that they're selling bad earnings. There's no doubt that they're also taking some profits and some stocks that are reporting really good earnings. And that's very healthy. But now this GDP report is almost like another variable that a lot of economists are going to have to go back and take a closer look at their model and take a closer look at what maybe this means for the rest of the year for the whole economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Actually part of that market resilience that Tim was talking about just there has actually come from tech stocks. As we approach the earnings endgame, we've been collecting big tech earnings like Thanos collects Infinity stones. Facebook has actually risen at more than 7 percent this week after shrugging off various scandals to deal with. Privacy and that sort of thing.</p><p>[15:10:14] ASHER: Microsoft actually joined the trillion dollar club in terms of valuation. The very first time after impressing the market with its own numbers, and Amazon has kept it going, announcing record profits after the bell last night. Their shares are actually at more than 1 percent today. We still have numbers from Apple. That's going to be next week.</p><p>With that kind of firepower, the NASDAQ has been flooding with all-time highs throughout the week, may still hit a record high with the NASDAQ before the hour is done. Alison Kosik is joining us live now. So Alison, let's talk about Amazon to begin with. Because a lot of us were talking about that they came in with stellar earnings. However, there were a few blips, one of them being the fact that their profit guidance wasn't that great, partly because they intend to really invest in the future.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Right, and some of that investment are those fulfillment centers, in healthcare, premium video content. There are a lot of questions as to how Amazon can continue pulling in this kind of profit, when it continues to invest in these kinds of expansions, these kinds of businesses.</p><p>But going back to that headline number, Amazon pulling in $3.6 billion in profit, that's more than double for the same time last year. So gone are the days of Amazon, you know, bleeding money when it was acquiring and gathering its sort of businesses around it. Amazon has kind of joined the club of learning what it's like to kind of make those consistent profits, but also deal with sluggish sales growth.</p><p>It is remarkable that once again, as we see Amazon continue to make these expansions, let's say into fulfillment centers that it is pulling in this profit. Case in point, you think about Amazon increasing the amount of membership for its Prime members, and still in the quarter, increasing the number of people coming in to be those Prime members, how many businesses do you know raising prices, and still able to pull in customers? Well, Amazon is able to do that.</p><p>The other part of the profit picture for Amazon, Cloud computing and advertising business for Amazon Cloud computing, 41 percent sales increased their advertising business looking healthy as well. And one thing that stuck out with me, Amazon upping the ante for its competitors, offering that free-two day shipping benefit that it often gives to its Prime subscribers evolving that into one day, that one day shipping perk in an effort to kind of increase those shopping numbers.</p><p>So Amazon is really putting the pressure on its consumers -- on its competitors rather by saying, look, \"We can deliver in one day, what can you do?\"</p><p>ASHER: What can you do? And when you think about just what a week, this has been for tech stocks. I mean, you and I were talking about this yesterday, I think, you have Microsoft reaching that $1 trillion valuation partly because they've done so well with Xbox, Surface, that sort of thing. And then you also have Facebook. I mean, they completely shrugged off all of their scandals when it came to privacy and security concerns. What do you make of this week with tech stocks?</p><p>KOSIK: Well, forget about this week. Look at what the prognosticators were saying about first quarter earnings, everybody was saying we're going to have an earnings recession. I don't see it. A little over a third of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported it looks like we're not going to see first quarter earnings go negative. We will see it flat or even positive.</p><p>So I think that all those negative naysayers who were saying we're going to see an earnings recession, I think that they were jumping the gun.</p><p>ASHER: Although Tesla didn't exactly have a good --</p><p>KOSIK: Good point.</p><p>ASHER: Unfortunately, all right, Alison Kosik, live for us. Thank you so much. Have a great weekend.</p><p>Okay, so looking at Europe those better than expected U.S. growth numbers helped lift stocks over there, too. Let's take a look here, the German DAX and the CAC 40 Paris, you could see they closed higher. The DAX up about a third of one percent. The CAC 40 of about a fifth of one percent. In London, the FTSE 100 was a touch lower dragged down by Royal Bank of Scotland saying that Brexit uncertainty is putting a cloud over future growth.</p><p>All right, coming up here, tech unicorns unveil their IPO strategies. Uber keeps expectations low with a very cautious valuation and Slack cut out the middleman in the direct listing, and after mass executions in Saudi Arabia, CNN has actually exclusive reporting that some men say they were tortured into signing confessions, the man who inspired the Magnitsky Act, Bill Browder will join us. He is calling for sanction. That's next.</p><p>[15:17:10] ASHER: There are calls for new sanctions on Saudi Arabia tonight. The United Nations and Amnesty International are outraged over the latest mass executions there. Now Saudi Arabia announced this week that the 37 men had been executed mostly for offenses of planning, terrorism or spying, but trial documents reviewed exclusively by CNN reveal that contrary to Saudi claims, all defendants admitted their guilt.</p><p>Some of the 37 said they were innocent. Court filing show they pleaded for their lives and told judges they had been tortured into making false confessions. Senior international correspondent Arwa Damon has this story from Istanbul.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Among these hundreds and hundreds of pages are \"please\" statements from those who have now been executed to the judge in court saying that they are innocent. Some of them say that their confessions were forced, that they had been tortured, that they didn't know what they were signing.</p><p>One man, Wani Al-Adam (ph), 27 years old, slightly blind and deaf says quote, \"Those aren't my words. I did not write a letter. This is defamation written by the interrogator with his own hand.\" One of the other young men who was just 17 years old at the time that his so-called crime was committed, his father pleading to the court on his son's behalf saying that his son was subjected to psychological and physical abuse, that the interrogator dictated the confession and forced him forced his son to sign it just so that the torture would stop.</p><p>These documents that were exclusively obtained by CNN's Tamara Qiblawi center around the cases of 25 of the men out of the 37 that Saudi Arabia executed on Tuesday. We reached out to Saudi authorities asking about the contents of these documents and whether or not the allegations of torture had been investigated. We have yet to receive a response.</p><p>But the Saudi government did say on Tuesday that those executed had been found guilty and that they had had their day in court and that the Kingdom had a zero tolerance policy. But it would appear from the content of these court documents themselves that there were numerous occasions -- numerous instances where those who were put on trial were saying that their confessions were extracted under torture.</p><p>But despite all of the human rights allegations surrounding the Kingdom's activities, there seems to not have been much of an effect on a conference that took place just the next day that saw major banks and financial institutions in attendance and human rights seemingly not on the table. Arwa Damon, CNN, Istanbul.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:20:10]ASHER: The public outcry over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi prompted some overseas investors in Saudi Arabia to freeze their plans. Six months later, that's begun to thaw.</p><p>Top executives from Blackrock, HSBC, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley all appeared it an event in Riyadh on Wednesday just hours after the news broke of recent executions. CNN has reached out to each of the banks and either got no response or was told no comment.</p><p>Several companies have already decided to go ahead with their investments. SoftBank is keeping the $45 billion it got from Saudi Arabia for its vision fund. Earlier this month, AMC said it would go ahead with a plan to open dozens of movie theaters in the country. And Aramco, the state-owned oil company had a mammoth $12 billion bond sale that was a smash hit with international investors Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, HSBC, and Morgan Stanley all accepted money to help Aramco sell the bonds.</p><p>Crown Prince Mohamed Bil Salman claims to be reforming and opening up Saudi Arabia, but with ever more claims of human rights abuses, overseas observers are questioning what his reform really means.</p><p>In January at the World Economic Forum, Richard pressed the Saudi Finance Minister about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed al-Jadaan promised his government was working hard to change.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOHAMMED AL-JADAAN, SAUDI FINANCE MINISTER: We are committed to reform. We are reforming and we will continue whether it is institutional reform within the government, Intelligence system as announced by the government, but also in the economy. So there is a lot happening and we are committed to continuing that journey.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Bill Browder helped put the Magnitsky Act into law in the United States, it empowers the U.S. to place economic sanctions on human rights abuses. He tweeted a link to CNN story and wrote, \"In Saudi Arabia, they tortured 37 men, forced them to sign false confessions and then executed them, including three below the age of 18. Very Stalin-esque time for more Magnitsky sanctions on Saudi officials.\" Bill Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital, joins us live now from London.</p><p>So Bill, here's my question to you. If Western powers decided to stop doing business with Saudi Arabia, because of these human rights abuses, how much of an impact do you think that would actually have on the Saudi government on the Saudi royal family in terms of these executions?</p><p>BILL BROWDER, CEO, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Well, first of all, the Saudi Royal Family is one of the richest and most internationally invested families around and so if they found themselves not welcome in western capitals, if they found their money not welcome, that would be a very, very severe punishment for them and they wouldn't change their ways.</p><p>Right now, what they do is that they were involved in this horrific killing of Jamal Khashoggi, they've now executed a whole bunch of people in a mass trial, where three minors were executed and they don't seem to feel any consequence from this.</p><p>And so until there's a consequence, they're going to carry on doing all the terrible stuff they're doing and these two examples are just the tip of the iceberg of the human rights abuses and oppressions that are going on in that country.</p><p>ASHER: So Adam Aron, the CEO of AMC theater chain, they're actually expanding massively in Saudi Arabia has come out and said, you know, they're doing this for the Saudi people. That it's important for AMC to do business in Saudi Arabia in order to help the Saudi people not necessarily the government, do you buy that?</p><p>BROWDER: Well, anytime a big company goes into a country that has a spotty record like Saudi Arabia, it legitimizes the government. And so I believe that that he is talking his own book, his comments are self-serving for his own business and economics. But the one thing I would say is that people like him and others may find themselves in a very uncomfortable position at some point in the future, when the West finally says enough is enough.</p><p>Because when you're in business in a country where serious sanctions are applied, you get stuck in the crossfire between the countries that are sanctioning and the country that's being sanctioned. And we've seen this with many businesses that were doing business with Putin's cronies that were put on the sanctions list last year, it's not a pleasant situation to be caught in that crossfire and at that point, they may then see it not being such a great place to invest.</p><p>ASHER: Do you really think, though, I mean, just based on what you just said, do you really think that Western powers at least anytime soon, in the short term will say enough is enough when you have President Trump, for example, indicating that he really does have no appetite to be tough on Saudi? I mean, Saudi Arabia was the very first country that President Trump visited as soon as he became President.</p><p>BROWDER: Well, that is true. But at the same time, 17 Saudis were sanctioned for the grisly murder of Jamal Khashoggi by the United States and by various other countries. And what I can say is that Trump may have his views but Congress and including many Republicans in Congress, are outraged by the behavior of Saudi Arabia and are doing many things different things to try to tighten the noose on that country so they don't get away with this stuff.</p><p>And so, you know, the world is a very fluid place. Donald Trump maybe a President for two years, maybe even President for six years, but it's not going to be like that forever.</p><p>[15:25:10] ASHER: So what is at stake financially for Western powers just in terms of oil prices, and just financially in general, if they cut their ties with Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BROWDER: Well, there's, there's plenty of countries that you can get oil from. We don't have to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. We don't have to invest in Saudi Arabia. We don't have to buy Saudi Arabian bonds if they're behaving like barbarians, which is what they're where they're doing right now. You know, it's totally optional. There's many countries in the world that produce oil.</p><p>The United States is actually an exporter of oil at this point, it doesn't have to -- the United States really doesn't need to buy oil from Saudi Arabia.</p><p>ASHER: Is there any sort of western country in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder, was there any western country be it Canada or any other country that you felt really took the moral high ground in how they handled Saudi Arabia?</p><p>BROWDER: Well, it is interesting because even before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Canada, started speaking out on behalf of imprisoned human rights activists and in response, Saudi Arabia cut all ties with Canada. But Canada, stood there with their head held high, and they said, we're not going to budge. We're not going to be bullied into changing our views or changing our behavior towards Saudi Arabia. And that was a good public posture to take.</p><p>The idea that we are beholden to Saudi Arabia is just nonsense. Saudi Arabia is not that important a country in the overall scheme of things.</p><p>ASHER: Right. Bill Browder, thank you so much for sharing your views. Appreciate that.</p><p>BROWDER: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: All right, up next, no surge pricing for Uber, the ride hailing company plays it safe when it comes to the IPO valuation. Has it learned from Lyft's mistakes? That's next.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>ASHER: Hi everyone, I'm Zain Asher. Coming up on the next half hour of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, there is no slacking for the IPO market as a new tech unicorn joins the party. And the curious case of Pepsi and the potatoes. Indian farmers are outraged after being hit with legal threats.</p><p>So first, though, these are the news headlines on CNN at this hour. CNN has obtained documents that raise questions about Saudi Arabia's mass execution of 37 alleged terrorists. Many of the defendants claim they were coerced into confessing or torture. The U.S. State Department official says Washington is urging the Saudis to ensure basic rights in the kingdom.</p><p>A massive search is underway in Sri Lanka as security forces try to prevent more potential terror attacks. In one home, they found explosives, ISIS flags and uniforms. The country's president says every household in the country will be checked in the wake of the devastating attacks on Easter Sunday.</p><p>And Russian national Maria Butina will spend another nine months in a U.S. prison and then be deported. She had pled guilty to try and to infiltrate conservative political circles and promote Russian interest before and after the 2016 election. Russia says the sentence is politically motivated.</p><p>And U.S. President Donald Trump says he is putting United Nations on notice. That his administration will not ratify an International Arms Treaty. He made the announcement at the annual meeting of America's most powerful gun lobby. The treaty is meant to keep weapons away from human rights abusers.</p><p>And the judge presiding over the sexual assault case against Harvey Weinstein has banned the media from parts of Friday's pre-trial hearings. It includes arguments about whether other allegations against Mr. Weinstein can be heard. Weinstein faces five felony charges, he has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>We've got details on the biggest IPO of the year earlier today. Uber unveiled the price range for its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The ride-sharing app is heading for evaluation of up to $84 billion U.S., that by the way is more than Delta, United Airlines and American Airlines combined.</p><p>Matt Egan is live for us in the newsroom. So Matt, when you think about Uber's pricing, they priced it very sort of conservatively. How has what happened to Lyft had an impact on Uber's strategy, do you think?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER: So Zain, I think that Uber has learned some valuable lessons from its arch rival Lyft. One, don't get too greedy on evaluation, and two, shore up support before the IPO. Uber filed paperwork with the SEC this morning, saying that it intends to sell shares to the public at a range of $44 to $50 a piece.</p><p>Now, at the high end of that evaluation, it would be about $84 billion based on outstanding shares. And while that is a ton of money, and as you pointed out, it's bigger than a lot of other major publicly-traded companies right now, it's actually a downshift from what Uber had previously been indicating.</p><p>Previously, it was about 90 billion to 100 billion, last year, there was even talk of 120 billion. Uber also landed a pretty big endorsement from a major established company, and that's PayPal. PayPal agreed to invest $500 million in Uber's common stock through a private placement at the IPO price. And that's the kind of endorsement that I think could really sort of shore up some sentiment around this IPO.</p><p>Now, all of this is a big contrast to what happened with Lyft, which actually scaled up its ambitions right before going public, it raised the price target. And what ended up happening is the company is actually still trading below its IPO price. I think it's you know, a reflection of the fact that some investors are understandably nervous about betting on money- losing companies in a brand new industry, particularly at this point of the cycle where people are talking about economic slowdown and then eventually potentially a recession.</p><p>And you know, Uber is losing money. The SEC filings that Uber filed this morning show that the company while it has about 90 million customers a month, it also lost about a billion dollars just in the last quarter. And so I think that's another reason why it makes sense that Uber is tapping the brakes here on the evaluation.</p><p>ASHER: Right, and investors obviously one of the things they're going to be really looking for is a path to profitability for Uber. So, let's talk about slack because slack is obviously going public as well. But this is not your sort of traditional everyday IPO, it's sort of directly listing prices.</p><p>[15:35:00] EGAN: That's right, Zain, so slack is taking a page out of the Spotify playbook, it's doing what they call a direct listing. And so what that means is they're not going to be hiring investment banks and underwriters to test the market and value the stock, they're just going to list it directly.</p><p>And that's a way to save money on some investment bank and IPO-related fees. The critics would say that, you know, it's a risky strategy because you could have some short-term, near-term volatility in the stocks since everyone is trying to figure out and assess how much it's worth.</p><p>But you know what? Spotify pulled it off, and so they proved that it's possible. The other thing, you know, about a direct listing is that you know, they're not actually raising money. While Uber is going to be raising billions of dollars, slack is not. What this really is, is about insiders, the early investors, venture capitalists and the employees having a way to sell out their shares.</p><p>It gives them liquidity. But you know, when you think about slack, this is another example of a company that is growing very quickly, it's got 10 million customers, users every day. It's in 150 countries. But it's another company that is losing money. It posted a loss of $139 million in the most recent fiscal year.</p><p>So it's another important test to see whether or not investors want to bet on a company that is not profitable right now.</p><p>ASHER: Right, Matt Egan, live for us there, thank you so much. OK, so I want to turn now to Ford. One of the standout performers on Wall Street today, shares are actually up more than 10 percent after first quarter earnings fell by less than expected.</p><p>Strong sales -- truck sales in the U.S. were the big factor there, partially offsetting weaker numbers in China and other international markets. Joining me now, Rebecca Lindland; the founder of rebeccadrives.com. Rebecca, thank you so much for being with us, so Ford there beating expectations, despite the fact that the car industry as a whole is struggling right now. How have they done that?</p><p>REBECCA LINDLAND, FOUNDER, REBECCADRIVES.COM: Well, you know, they really had to rely upon their F series Pickup truck, which is you know, really the bestselling vehicle in the states for the last few decades. And it's an incredibly profitable vehicle for them.</p><p>The average transaction price of the F series is $47,000, which compared to the average transaction price of all vehicles is $35,000. So they really make an incredible amount of profit off of their F series Pickup truck.</p><p>ASHER: Just shifting gears in terms of talking about a possible merger, Renault wants to merge with Nissan, but Nissan executives are not a fan of the idea. Just walk us through why not and what's happening on that front?</p><p>LINDLAND: Yes, so Renault is actually much smaller than Nissan, but it has more of a stake in Nissan than Nissan does in Renault. So it's not an equal partnership right now. And Renault has gone to Nissan to say we want to see about making this an equal partnership.</p><p>This is something that Mr. Ghosn, who is now under indictment in Japan, always protected Nissan against, but then he started to get this idea that this might be a good idea. And this was one of the things that people say led to his indictment with Nissan basically saying we want to protect our company, we don't want Paris to run us.</p><p>But at the same time, Renault says, well, they don't want to be run by Nissan. So, it's this back and forth and just incredible tensions, a lot of complications, and it's just kind of a big fat mess right now. I mean, it does --</p><p>ASHER: It's like a technical -- yes, it does sort of feel as though since Carlos Ghosn isn't there anymore, the alliance between Renault and Nissan, it does sort of feel like that it's in jeopardy.</p><p>LINDLAND: Well, you know, it's not in jeopardy on a day-to-day basis, in that there's hundreds of people that are working every day on making products that benefit both of these brands as well as Mitsubishi. And Mitsubishi standing in this proposed alliance is not established yet.</p><p>So on a day-to-day basis, the alliance continues. What is -- what is in turmoil is the structure and the ongoing structure. What does this look like in a post-Ghosn world. And that's what Nissan is trying to figure out, and Renault is offering this as a possible solution.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Rebecca Lindland live for us, thank you so much, have a great weekend.</p><p>LINDLAND: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: All right, still to come here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a legal fight that's not small potatoes. The owner of Frito-lay says some farmers are treading on its territory. We'll explain after the break.</p><p>[15:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER: It's not exactly a traditional recipe, Pepsi and potatoes. But put these ingredients together and you get a huge uproar. PepsiCo is actually suing four Indian farmers, accusing them of growing a certain type of potato that it says is exclusively for Lay's chips.</p><p>Is reportedly demanding damages amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Farmers Association in India say the law is on the side of the small farmers. Now, Pepsi says it will drop the lawsuit if the farmers that it's suing join its authorized cultivation programs.</p><p>It's just one example of friction between small Indian operators and international mega corporations. We've also seen local retailers accuse giants like Wal-Mart and Amazon of running -- or ruining rather their business. Hannah Lownsbrough is the executive director of SumOfUs; an organization using people power to hold companies to account.</p><p>She joins us live now from London. It -- you know, Hannah, it does actually seem rather aggressive to have this multi-national -- multi- billion dollar company suing four small farmers. I mean, these farmers can't really be that much of a threat, can they?</p><p>HANNAH LOWNSBROUGH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SUMOFUS: We don't think so. I think some of us members feel that, you know, this is a really good example of a very large corporation taking on very small -- a very small pro -- you know, in many cases family-run businesses and going after them for amounts of money that are kind of spare change to a company like PepsiCo, but can be absolutely ruin for you know, for a small farmer.</p><p>ASHER: How are the farmers actually supposed to know that a company like Pepsi has exclusive rights to a certain type of potato?</p><p>LOWNSBROUGH: Well, I mean, I think this is exactly the question that some of us members, you know, would ask really. And it sort of highlights the way in which it makes -- it's a bit of a nonsense really when these huge corporations seem to own things like seeds or water supply. These sorts of things which, you know, to most people's way of thinking really belong to all of us.</p><p>So, you know, we're not surprised that the farmers, you know, didn't really believe themselves to be doing anything wrong, and that this lawsuit has come as a huge shock and is completely overwhelming.</p><p>ASHER: The lawsuit for -- was for over a $100,000 for each of the farmers. I mean, when you have a massive -- I mean, I can't even imagine what it's like to be a small time farmer in a place like India and having Pepsi suing you. I mean, how do farmers protect themselves?</p><p>LOWNSBROUGH: Well, I think it's difficult. I think we're seeing civil society in India has really come forward to stand with these farmers and challenge the behavior of PepsiCo in this case. But also you know, similar corporations. You mentioned Amazon in the introduction, you know, who have also been accused of doing things which are really damaging many Indian domestic operations.</p><p>[15:45:00] And I think there's some evidence that the Indian government is taking steps to regulate, but these are -- these are tough questions to answer because it is critically important that, you know, we don't end up in a situation where a handful of companies are you know, owning the seeds that we rely on to produce our food supply or, you know, are responsible for almost all the business that gets done online.</p><p>ASHER: So Pepsi's argument is that they filed this lawsuit to protect the interest of thousands of farmers who are part of its potato farming program. Is that a fair argument do you think?</p><p>LOWNSBROUGH: I don't think so really. I mean, I think you know, you asked a good question at the beginning which is, you know, how are they supposed to know really that these seeds are sort of, you know, they belong to somebody else. But I also think that, you know, arguably, PepsiCo is really setting up a relationship of dependency between some of these farmers with whom it has its cultivation -- farmers with whom it has its cultivation program.</p><p>We're seeing examples in some cases for instance of seeds being developed that can -- will only grow and will only thrive if they're also raised using fertilizers or what have you, that are also produced by some of these parent companies. So you are seeing sort of small farmers really ending up sort of in-hawked to some of these very big businesses.</p><p>And it's hard to see that as kind of, you know, creating the conditions in which everybody can make a success of -- make a success of a small business.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Hannah, thank you so much for being with us, appreciate that.</p><p>LOWNSBROUGH: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: OK, so from the farms of India, we are taking you to the lush landscape, that is Hawaii. If you're going to do the hula dance, you better get your hips in gear. Richard Quest is going to be showing us all how it's done, we'll be talking tourism in two shakes, that's next.</p><p>[15:50:00] ASHER: That music should be a clue to where we're heading next. I'm filling in for Richard Quest this Friday night, but he actually doesn't have a day off, he's got an extremely difficult awful assignment filming one of the most beautiful remote islands in the entire world. Richard Quest joins us live now from Waikiki Beach in Hawaii.</p><p>Richard, I was there six months ago actually in Kuhio, and it's beautiful, looks as though, Richard -- it looks as though sadly, Richard can't hear me. It looks as though we'll have to come back to him. All right, now, you don't need Hawaii's natural beauty to enjoy a holiday.</p><p>For the CEOs of Radisson hotels, beautiful design might be the key to beating the opposition in a crowded hotel market. Richard went to meet Federico Gonzalez for a tour of the world's first ever design hotel. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN (voice-over): The Royal Radisson hotel in Copenhagen. The world's first design hotel, it dominated the skyline for more than five decades. And it's here that I meet Radisson's chief executive, Federico Gonzales.</p><p>FEDERICO GONZALEZ, PRESIDENT &amp; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RADISSON HOSPITALITY: Well, I think it helps, but at the same time it's really exciting with their latest and you really can't sign --</p><p>QUEST: Federico manages Radisson's seven brands, and more than 1,400 hotels worldwide.</p><p>(on camera): Is it intimidating competing for example against Marriott with its million rooms over more than 30 brands?</p><p>GONZALEZ: No, not at all, it's exciting. When I look to Radisson Hotel Group, and what we are doing in our building is much stronger and it will last much longer.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): For Radisson, it's been a bumpy ride. Three years and three different owners.</p><p>(on camera): I'm often left wondering what is Radisson?</p><p>GONZALEZ: It's towards those consumers who do not want or cannot pay the price of the high, but they want a more memorable experience and they want something more exceptional. So we call it affordable luxury.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): And so to this design elite hotel, the Royal Copenhagen, the vision of the architect Arnie Jacobson.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Welcome in.</p><p>QUEST: Nice --</p><p>GONZALEZ: This was the inner room where he stays because he wanted to really know and understand what was lightening, what was the views, how the views would change.</p><p>QUEST: This hotel is where savings meets functionality, according to Gonzales.</p><p>(on camera): These lights.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Yes, if we would build this today, it's much more cost effective than putting 20 different lights across.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): But I'm going to interview a hotel CEO, and of course, we have to test the most important part of the place.</p><p>GONZALEZ: You are now behind a bit, right?</p><p>QUEST (on camera): Right --</p><p>GONZALEZ: And then you can feel not only the bed, the mattress, also the tissue. Now, what is more important is, what are the figures you have? And if in your highest lead, you can choose where to sleep, different textures, different size, and then now you can look to your temptations. This is really temptations.</p><p>QUEST: You ought to be ashamed of yourself.</p><p>GONZALEZ: Oh, you should have another one.</p><p>QUES: And as for customer service, no skimping there.</p><p>GONZALEZ: It is a culture. This is a company where every employee or associate is absolutely obsessed with servicing them, and they are worth every moment matters.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): An inspiring strategy that will ensure this proud hotel group will remain my host.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: All right, let's try this again, Richard Quest is joining us live now from Waikiki Beach, I believe he can hear me. So Richard, as beautiful, as stunning as it looks there behind you, I was surprised to hear that tourists spending on Hawaii is actually falling. Why is that?</p><p>QUEST: And it's interesting, that's one of the conundrums, Zain, that they don't quite understand. In that report you heard how hoteliers are having to find new ways, different things that tourists want. And that's certainly the same case. Let's take Waikiki Beach in Hawaii where I am for World of Wonder.</p><p>Look, it's packed. There's no shortage of people who are coming here, actually visitor numbers are up by some 2 percent to 4 percent. But the spending, and that's the important part in many ways, the spend is down. And this is something that many resorts are finding happening.</p><p>And Zain, what's really worrying about this is spend is the holy grail, with a resort like Hawaii and Honolulu, you want more tourists, but you want the right sort of tourists, you want them to stay longer and you want them to spend more. So Zain, that's one of the interesting things. It is paradise, but it's paradise with clouds on the horizon.</p><p>[15:55:00] ASHER: And just talk to us a bit more about hula dancing. I understand that you got to try some yourself, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, because we're here for World of Wonder. And one of the important things about is, is what's the DNA of this place? The 50th state of the union, we're familiar with Hawaii 5-0. I was determined to get that in. We're familiar with all of that.</p><p>But what about hula? So I got a chance to try it out and realize it's not the tacky coconut bras and grass skirts that you often see. My hula wasn't very good, but it gives me an understanding of the spiritual DNA of Hawaii. And this afternoon, I get to try surfing, because again, as the Duke showed some years ago, surfing is part of the spiritual heritage of these islands.</p><p>ASHER: Richard, you've got skills, I just watched that video, you are great at hula dancing, I'm inspired. Richard Quest live for us there, thank you so much. All right, so just a few minutes to go for the end of trading week on Wall Street. After the break, we've got the final numbers and the closing bell. That's next.</p><p>ASHER: All right, so let's take a look at the numbers in the last few minutes of trade on Wall Street. As you can see behind me, the Dow is actually basically flat, up about 57 points or so. And we've hovered up and down throughout the session, despite some pretty good, I should say stellar numbers in terms of first quarter GDP.</p><p>The Dow has been dragged down by Intel earnings that aren't necessarily that great, and also ExxonMobil earnings as well. And my producer, Tom, simply cannot contain his excitement because we're told that the Wu-Tang Clan is going to be ringing the closing bell today at some part to celebrate a documentary on \"Showtime\" that is about them of \"Mics and Men\".</p><p>And as I mentioned, it was all about stronger-than-expected first quarter growth in terms of GDP in the United States, combined though with surprisingly weak inflation. All of that should make for a fascinating debate when it comes to the Fed decision about the direction of rates.</p><p>They're not going to raise interest rates this year, but who knows? Policy makers do end up meeting next week. And that is the closing bell on Wall Street. As I mentioned, the Wu-Tang Clan as you can see up there is actually ringing the closing bell this Friday, and that is it my friends for QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I am Zain Asher, thank you so much for joining us, the news continues right here on CNN.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019042601cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W06-SF01-DXH2-643S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002DBA</classCode><className>PEPSICO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002C1P</classCode><className>EXXON MOBIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS312111 SOFT DRINK MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS311919 OTHER SNACK FOOD MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS311513 CHEESE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS311511 FLUID MILK MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS311411 FROZEN FRUIT, JUICE &amp;

When customers shop on Amazon, they are helping to create jobs in their local communities,' he says.</p><p>He adds that Amazon hired an additional 175,000 employees during the coronavirus pandemic, including many who were laid off from other jobs. </p><p>Bezos includes personal information about his life before becoming a billionaire and how he was raised by a teen mother and Cuban immigrant adoptive father. </p><p>'It's not a coincidence that Amazon was born in this country,' he says. </p><p>'We nurture entrepreneurs and start-ups with stable rule of law, the finest university system in the world, the freedom of democracy, and a deeply accepted culture of risk-taking.'</p><p>Zuckerberg also touched on the theme of the American success story, arguing that Facebook grew into a billion-dollar business 'the American way, by starting out with nothing and providing products that people find valuable. </p><p>'Although people around the world use our products, Facebook is a proudly American company. We believe in values - democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression - that the American economy was built on,' he says. </p><p>He also argues Facebook faces intense competition from large rivals adding: 'We compete against the companies appearing at this hearing, plus many others that sell advertising and connect people. We also compete globally, including against companies that have access to markets that we aren't in.'</p><p>Zuckerberg will also defend Facebook's acquisitions by saying the social-media platform helped companies like WhatsApp and Instagram grow. Both are owned by Facebook.</p><p>He plans to remind lawmakers of the competitive threat U.S. tech companies face from China, saying the Asian country is building its 'own version of the internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries.'</p><p>The billionaire tech exec also renewed Facebook's call for government regulation in areas such as harmful content in social media, election integrity, and privacy - areas where the company has been criticized. </p><p>In his prepared remarks released ahead of the hearing, Pichai argued that search - which Google dominates by most metrics - was broader than just typing a query into Google, and said he remained concerned about being relevant as people turn to Twitter, Pinterest or other websites for information.</p><p>'We know Google's continued success is not guaranteed. Google operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,' Pichai said.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook will tell the committee the company 'does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business. That is not just true for iPhone, it is true for any product category.'</p><p>He will argue the company's 'commissions are comparable to or lower than commissions charged by the majority of our competitors. And they are vastly lower than the 50 to 70 percent that software developers paid to distribute their work before we launched the App Store.' </p><p>The high-profile hearing was originally set for Monday but was postponed because Representative John Lewis will be lying in state until Wednesday.</p><p>The panel will question the companies as part of its sweeping probe into whether they actively work to harm and eliminate smaller rivals, while not always making the best choices for their customers. </p><p>It will be a key moment in the growing backlash against Big Tech in the United States and is likely to set up a face-off between the executives and skeptical lawmakers from both parties. </p><p>Many tech lobbying groups and industry critics say the hearing is unlikely to address core antitrust issues or bring new information to the table, however.</p><p>'There's not much tech CEOs can do to appease anti-tech critics... this hearing is not about finding truth but creating news stories,' said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel at industry lobby group NetChoice. </p><p>The antitrust subcommittee is expected to release a report within weeks on their investigation into the companies.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department is also probing the big four tech platforms. Facebook and Amazon are also facing inquiries by the Federal Trade Commission, while U.S. states attorneys general are looking at Google and Facebook.</p><p>READ THE TECH CEOS' OPENING STATEMENTS </p><p>AMAZON'S BEZOS: I'M LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM AND WE'RE MAKING IT COME TRUE FOR MILLIONS OF OTHERS                   </p><p> Thank you, Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and members of the Subcommittee. </p><p>I'm Jeff Bezos. I founded Amazon 26 years ago with the long-term mission of making it Earth's most customer-centric company. </p><p>My mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><p> Being pregnant in high school was not popular in Albuquerque in 1964. It was difficult for her. When they tried to kick her out of school, my grandfather went to bat for her. </p><p>After some negotiation, the principal said, 'OK, she can stay and finish high school, but she can't do any extracurricular activities, and she can't have a locker.' </p><p>My grandfather took the deal, and my mother finished high school, though she wasn't allowed to walk across the stage with her classmates to get her diploma.</p><p>Determined to keep up with her education, she enrolled in night school, picking classes led by professors who would let her bring an infant to class. She would show up with two duffel bags-one full of textbooks, and one packed with diapers, bottles, and anything that would keep me interested and quiet for a few minutes.</p><p>My dad's name is Miguel. He adopted me when I was four years old. He was 16 when he came to the United States from Cuba as part of Operation Pedro Pan, shortly after Castro took over. </p><p>My dad arrived in America alone. His parents felt he'd be safer here. His mom imagined America would be cold, so she made him a jacket sewn entirely out of cleaning cloths, the only material they had on hand. </p><p>We still have that jacket; it hangs in my parents' dining room. My dad spent two weeks at Camp Matecumbe, a refugee center in Florida, before being moved to a Catholic mission in Wilmington, Delaware. </p><p>He was lucky to get to the mission, but even so, he didn't speak English and didn't have an easy path. </p><p>What he did have was a lot of grit and determination. He received a scholarship to college in Albuquerque, which is where he met my mom. </p><p>You get different gifts in life, and one of my great gifts is my mom and dad. They have been incredible role models for me and my siblings our entire lives. </p><p>You learn different things from your grandparents than you do from your parents, and I had the opportunity to spend my summers from ages four to 16 on my grandparents' ranch in Texas. </p><p>My grandfather was a civil servant and a rancher-he worked on space technology and missile defense systems in the 1950s and '60s for the Atomic Energy Commission - and he was self-reliant and resourceful. </p><p>When you're in the middle of nowhere, you don't pick up a phone and call somebody when something breaks. You fix it yourself.</p><p>As a kid, I got to see him solve many seemingly unsolvable problems himself, whether he was restoring a broken-down Caterpillar bulldozer or doing his own veterinary work. </p><p>He taught me that you can take on hard problems. When you have a setback, you get back up and try again. You can invent your way to a better place. </p><p>I took these lessons to heart as a teenager, and became a garage inventor. I invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker out of an umbrella and tinfoil, and alarms made from baking pans to entrap my siblings.</p><p> The concept for Amazon came to me in 1994.</p><p>The idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles - something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world - was exciting to me.</p><p>At the time, I was working at an investment firm in New York City. When I told my boss I was leaving, he took me on a long walk in Central Park. </p><p>After a lot of listening, he finally said, 'You know what, Jeff, I think this is a good idea, but it would be a better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good job.' </p><p>He convinced me to think about it for two days before making a final decision. </p><p>It was a decision I made with my heart and not my head. When I'm 80 and reflecting back, I want to have minimized the number of regrets that I have in my life. </p><p>And most of our regrets are acts of omission - the things we didn't try, the paths untraveled. Those are the things that haunt us. </p><p>And I decided that if I didn't at least give it my best shot, I was going to regret not trying to participate in this thing called the internet that I thought was going to be a big deal. </p><p>The initial start-up capital for Amazon.com came primarily from my parents, who invested a large fraction of their life savings in something they didn't understand. </p><p>They weren't making a bet on Amazon or the concept of a bookstore on the internet. They were making a bet on their son.</p><p>I told them that I thought there was a 70% chance they would lose their investment, and they did it anyway. </p><p>It took more than 50 meetings for me to raise $1 million from investors, and over the course of all those meetings, the most common question was, 'What's the internet?' </p><p>Unlike many other countries around the world, this great nation we live in supports and does not stigmatize entrepreneurial risk-taking.</p><p>I walked away from a steady job into a Seattle garage to found my startup, fully understanding that it might not work.</p><p> It feels like just yesterday I was driving the packages to the post office myself, dreaming that one day we might be able to afford a forklift. </p><p>Amazon's success was anything but preordained. Investing in Amazon early on was a very risky proposition. From our founding through the end of 2001, our business had cumulative losses of nearly $3 billion, and we did not have a profitable quarter until the fourth quarter of that year.</p><p>Smart analysts predicted Barnes &amp; Noble would steamroll us, and branded us 'Amazon.toast.'</p><p>In 1999, after we'd been in business for nearly five years, Barron's headlined a story about our impending demise 'Amazon.bomb.' </p><p>My annual shareholder letter for 2000 started with a one word sentence: 'Ouch.' </p><p>At the pinnacle of the internet bubble our stock price peaked at $116, and then after the bubble burst our stock went down to $6. Experts and pundits thought we were going out of business.</p><p> It took a lot of smart people with a willingness to take a risk with me, and a willingness to stick to our convictions, for Amazon to survive and ultimately to succeed. And it wasn't just those early years.</p><p>In addition to good luck and great people, we have been able to succeed as a company only because we have continued to take big risks. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment. </p><p>Outsized returns come from betting against conventional wisdom, but conventional wisdom is usually right. </p><p>A lot of observers characterized Amazon Web Services as a risky distraction when we started. 'What does selling compute and storage have to do with selling books?' they wondered. </p><p>No one asked for AWS. It turned out the world was ready and hungry for cloud computing but didn't know it yet. </p><p>We were right about AWS, but the truth is we've also taken plenty of risks that didn't pan out. </p><p>In fact, Amazon has made billions of dollars of failures. Failure inevitably comes along with invention and risk-taking, which is why we try to make Amazon the best place in the world to fail.</p><p>Since our founding, we have strived to maintain a 'Day One' mentality at the company. By that I mean approaching everything we do with the energy and entrepreneurial spirit of Day One.</p><p>Even though Amazon is a large company, I have always believed that if we commit ourselves to maintaining a Day One mentality as a critical part of our DNA, we can have both the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one. </p><p>In my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the best way to achieve and maintain Day One vitality. </p><p>Why? Because customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great.</p><p>Even when they don't yet know it, customers want something better, and a constant desire to delight customers drives us to constantly invent on their behalf. </p><p>As a result, by focusing obsessively on customers, we are internally driven to improve our services, add benefits and features, invent new products, lower prices, and speed up shipping times - before we have to. </p><p>No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it.</p><p>And I could give you many such examples. Not every business takes this customer-first approach, but we do, and it's our greatest strength. </p><p>Customer trust is hard to win and easy to lose. When you let customers make your business what it is, then they will be loyal to you-right up to the second that someone else offers them better service. </p><p>We know that customers are perceptive and smart. We take as an article of faith that customers will notice when we work hard to do the right thing, and that by doing so again and again, we will earn trust. </p><p>You earn trust slowly, over time, by doing hard things well- delivering on time; offering everyday low prices; making promises and keeping them; making principled decisions, even when they're unpopular; and giving customers more time to spend with their families by inventing more convenient ways of shopping, reading, and automating their homes. </p><p>As I have said since my first shareholder letter in 1997, we make decisions based on the long-term value we create as we invent to meet customer needs.</p><p>When we're criticized for those choices, we listen and look at ourselves in the mirror. </p><p>When we think our critics are right, we change. When we make mistakes, we apologize. </p><p>But when you look in the mirror, assess the criticism, and still believe you're doing the right thing, no force in the world should be able to move you.</p><p>Fortunately, our approach is working. Eighty percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon overall, according to leading independent polls. </p><p>Who do Americans trust more than Amazon 'to do the right thing?' </p><p>Only their primary physicians and the military, according to a January 2020 Morning Consult survey. </p><p>Researchers at Georgetown and New York University found in 2018 that Amazon trailed only the military among all respondents to a survey on institutional and brand trust. </p><p>Among Republicans, we trailed only the military and local police; among Democrats, we were at the top, leading every branch of government, universities, and the press. </p><p>In Fortune's 2020 rankings of the World's Most Admired Companies, we came in second place (Apple was #1). We are grateful that customers notice the hard work we do on their behalf, and that they reward us with their trust. </p><p>Working to earn and keep that trust is the single biggest driver of Amazon's Day One culture. </p><p>The company most of you know as Amazon is the one that sends you your online orders in the brown boxes with the smile on the side. </p><p>That's where we started, and retail remains our largest business by far, accounting for over 80% of our total revenue. The very nature of that business is getting products to customers. </p><p>Those operations need to be close to customers, and we can't outsource these jobs to China or anywhere else. </p><p>To fulfill our promises to customers in this country, we need American workers to get products to American customers. </p><p>When customers shop on Amazon, they are helping to create jobs in their local communities. </p><p>As a result, Amazon directly employs a million people, many of them entry-level and paid by the hour. </p><p>We don't just employ highly educated computer scientists and MBAs in Seattle and Silicon Valley. </p><p>We hire and train hundreds of thousands of people in states across the country such as West Virginia, Tennessee, Kansas, and Idaho.</p><p>These employees are package stowers, mechanics, and plant managers. For many, it's their first job. </p><p>For some, these jobs are a stepping stone to other careers, and we are proud to help them with that. We are spending more than $700 million to give more than 100,000 Amazon employees access to training programs in fields such as healthcare, transportation, machine learning, and cloud computing. </p><p>That program is called Career Choice, and we pay 95% of tuition and fees toward a certificate or diploma for in-demand, high-paying fields, regardless of whether it's relevant to a career at Amazon. </p><p>Patricia Soto, one of our associates, is a Career Choice success story. Patricia always wanted to pursue a career in the medical field to help care for others, but with only a high school diploma and facing the costs of post-secondary education, she wasn't sure she'd be able to accomplish that goal. </p><p>After earning her medical certification through Career Choice, Patricia left Amazon to start her new career as a medical assistant at Sutter Gould Medical Foundation, supporting a pulmonary medicine doctor. </p><p>Career Choice has given Patricia and so many others a shot at a second career that once seemed out of reach. </p><p>Amazon has invested more than $270 billion in the U.S. over the last decade. </p><p>Beyond our own workforce, Amazon's investments have created nearly 700,000 indirect jobs in fields like construction, building services, and hospitality. </p><p>Our hiring and investments have brought muchneeded jobs and added hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity to areas like Fall River, Massachusetts, California's Inland Empire, and Rust Belt states like Ohio. </p><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, we hired an additional 175,000 employees, including many laid off from other jobs during the economic shutdown. </p><p>We spent more than $4 billion in the second quarter alone to get essential products to customers and keep our employees safe during the COVID-19 crisis. </p><p>And a dedicated team of Amazon employees from across the company has created a program to regularly test our workers for COVID-19. We look forward to sharing our learnings with other interested companies and government partners.</p><p>The global retail market we compete in is strikingly large and extraordinarily competitive. </p><p>Amazon accounts for less than 1% of the $25 trillion global retail market and less than 4% of retail in the U.S. </p><p>Unlike industries that are winner-take-all, there's room in retail for many winners. </p><p>For example, more than 80 retailers in the U.S. alone earn over $1 billion in annual revenue. </p><p>Like any retailer, we know that the success of our store depends entirely on customers' satisfaction with their experience in our store. </p><p>Every day, Amazon competes against large, established players like Target, Costco, Kroger, and, of course, Walmart -a company more than twice Amazon's size. </p><p>And while we have always focused on producing a great customer experience for retail sales done primarily online, sales initiated online are now an even larger growth area for other stores. Walmart's online sales grew 74% in the first quarter. </p><p>And customers are increasingly flocking to services invented by other stores that Amazon still can't match at the scale of other large companies, like curbside pickup and in-store returns.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on these trends, which have been growing for years.</p><p>In recent months, curbside pickup of online orders has increased over 200%, in part due to COVID19 concerns. </p><p>We also face new competition from the likes of Shopify and Instacart-companies that enable traditionally physical stores to put up a full online store almost instantaneously and to deliver products directly to customers in new and innovative ways-and a growing list of omnichannel business models.</p><p>Like almost every other segment of our economy, technology is used everywhere in retail and has only made retail more competitive, whether online, in physical stores, or in the various combinations of the two that make up most stores today. </p><p>And we and all other stores are acutely aware that, regardless of how the best features of 'online' and 'physical' stores are combined, we are all competing for and serving the same customers. </p><p>The range of retail competitors and related services is constantly changing, and the only real constant in retail is customers' desire for lower prices, better selection, and convenience. </p><p>It's also important to understand that Amazon's success depends overwhelmingly on the success of the thousands of small and medium-sized businesses that also sell their products in Amazon's stores. </p><p>Back in 1999, we took what at the time was the unprecedented step of welcoming third-party sellers into our stores and enabling them to offer their products right alongside our own. </p><p>Internally, this was extremely controversial, with many disagreeing and some predicting this would be the beginning of a long, losing battle. </p><p>We didn't have to invite third-party sellers into the store. We could have kept this valuable real estate for ourselves. </p><p>But we committed to the idea that over the long term it would increase selection for customers, and that more satisfied customers would be great for both third-party sellers and for Amazon. </p><p>And that's what happened. Within a year of adding those sellers, third-party sales accounted for 5% of unit sales, and it quickly became clear that customers loved the convenience of being able to shop for the best products and to see prices from different sellers all in the same store. </p><p>These small and medium-sized third-party businesses now add significantly more product selection to Amazon's stores than Amazon's own retail operation. </p><p>Third-party sales now account for approximately 60% of physical product sales on Amazon, and those sales are growing faster than Amazon's own retail sales.</p><p>We guessed that it wasn't a zero sum game. And we were right - the whole pie did grow, third-party sellers did very well and are growing fast, and that has been great for customers and for Amazon. </p><p>There are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses around the world selling in Amazon's stores. More than 200,000 entrepreneurs worldwide surpassed $100,000 in sales in our stores in 2019. </p><p>On top of that, we estimate that third-party businesses selling in Amazon's stores have created over 2.2 million new jobs around the world. One of those sellers is Sherri Yukel, who wanted to change careers to be home more for her children. </p><p>She started handcrafting gifts and party supplies for friends as a hobby, and eventually began selling her products on Amazon. Today, Sherri's company employs nearly 80 people and has a global customer base. </p><p>Another is Christine Krogue, a stay-at-home mother of five in Salt Lake City. Christine started a business selling baby clothes through her own website before taking a chance on Amazon.</p><p>She has since seen her sales more than double, and she's been able to expand her product line and hire a team of part-time employees. Selling on Amazon has allowed Sherri and Christine to grow their own businesses and satisfy customers on their own terms. </p><p>And it is striking to remember how recent all of this is. We did not start out as the largest marketplace -eBay was many times our size. </p><p>It was only by focusing on supporting sellers and giving them the best tools we could invent that we were able to succeed and eventually surpass eBay. </p><p>One such tool is Fulfillment by Amazon, which enables our third-party sellers to stow their inventory in our fulfillment centers, and we take on all logistics, customer service, and product returns. </p><p>By dramatically simplifying all of those challenging aspects of the selling experience in a cost-effective way, we have helped many thousands of sellers grow their businesses on Amazon. </p><p>Our success may help explain the wide proliferation of marketplaces of all types and sizes around the world.</p><p>This includes U.S. companies like Walmart, eBay, Etsy, and Target, as well as retailers based overseas but selling globally, such as Alibaba and Rakuten. </p><p>These marketplaces further intensify competition within retail. The trust customers put in us every day has allowed Amazon to create more jobs in the United States over the past decade than any other company - hundreds of thousands of jobs across 42 states. </p><p>Amazon employees make a minimum of $15 an hour, more than double the federal minimum wage (which we have urged Congress to increase). We've challenged other large retailers to match our $15 minimum wage. </p><p>Target did so recently, and just last week so did Best Buy. We welcome them, and they remain the only ones to have done so. </p><p>We do not skimp on benefits, either. Our full-time hourly employees receive the same benefits as our salaried headquarters employees, including comprehensive health insurance starting on the first day of employment, a 401(k) retirement plan, and parental leave, including 20 weeks of paid maternity leave. </p><p>I encourage you to benchmark our pay and benefits against any of our retail competitors.</p><p>More than 80% of Amazon shares are owned by outsiders, and over the last 26 years - starting from zero - we've created more than $1 trillion of wealth for those outside shareholders. </p><p>Who are those shareowners? They are pension funds: fire, police, and school teacher pension funds. </p><p>Others are 401(k)s-mutual funds that own pieces of Amazon. University endowments, too, and the list goes on.</p><p>Many people will retire better because of the wealth we've created for so many, and we're enormously proud of this. </p><p>At Amazon, customer obsession has made us what we are, and allowed us to do ever greater things.</p><p>I know what Amazon could do when we were 10 people. I know what we could do when we were 1,000 people, and when we were 10,000 people. And I know what we can do today when we're nearly a million. </p><p>I love garage entrepreneurs-I was one.</p><p>But, just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones. There are things small companies simply can't do.</p><p>I don't care how good an entrepreneur you are, you're not going to build an all-fiber Boeing 787 in your garage. </p><p>Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact on important societal issues. </p><p>The Climate Pledge is a commitment made by Amazon and joined by other companies to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net zero carbon by 2040. </p><p>We plan to meet the pledge, in part, by purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian - a Michigan-based producer of electric vehicles. </p><p>Amazon aims to have 10,000 of Rivian's new electric vans on the road as early as 2022, and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. </p><p>Globally, Amazon operates 91 solar and wind projects that have the capacity to generate over 2,900 MW and deliver more than 7.6 million MWh of energy annually - enough to power more than 680,000 U.S. homes. </p><p>Amazon is also investing $100 million in global reforestation projects through the Right Now Climate Fund, including $10 million Amazon committed in April to conserve, restore, and support sustainable forestry, wildlife and nature-based solutions across the Appalachian Mountains-funding two innovative projects in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy. </p><p>Four global companies-Verizon, Reckitt Benckiser, Infosys, and Oak View Group-recently signed The Climate Pledge, and we continue to encourage others to join us in this fight.</p><p>Together, we will use our size and scale to address the climate crisis right away.</p><p>And last month, Amazon introduced The Climate Pledge Fund, started with $2 billion in funding from Amazon. </p><p>The Fund will support the development of sustainable technologies and services that in turn will enable Amazon and other companies to meet The Climate Pledge. </p><p>The Fund will invest in visionary entrepreneurs and innovators who are building products and services to help companies reduce their carbon impact and operate more sustainably. </p><p>We recently opened the largest homeless shelter in Washington state-and it's located inside one of our newest headquarters buildings in downtown Seattle. </p><p>The shelter is for Mary's Place, an incredible Seattle-based nonprofit. </p><p>The shelter, part of Amazon's $100 million investment in Mary's Place, spans eight floors and can accommodate up to 200 family members each night. It has its own health clinic and provides critical tools and services to help families fighting homelessness get back on their feet. </p><p>And there is dedicated space for Amazon to provide weekly pro-bono legal clinics offering counsel on credit and debt issues, personal injury, housing and tenant rights. </p><p>Since 2018, Amazon's legal team has supported hundreds of Mary's Place guests and volunteered more than 1,000 pro-bono hours. </p><p>Amazon Future Engineer is a global childhood-to-career program designed to inspire, educate, and prepare thousands of children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue a computer science career. </p><p>The program funds computer science coursework and professional teacher development for hundreds of elementary schools, introductory and AP Computer Science classes for more than 2,000 schools in underserved communities across the country, and 100 four-year, $40,000 college scholarships to computer science students from low-income backgrounds. </p><p>Those scholarship recipients also receive guaranteed internships at Amazon. </p><p>There is a diversity pipeline problem in tech, and this has an outsized impact on the Black community. </p><p>We want to invest in building out the next generation of technical talent for the industry and expanding the opportunities for underrepresented minorities. </p><p>We also want to accelerate this change right now. To find the best talent for technical and non-technical roles, we actively partner with historically Black colleges and universities on our recruiting, internship, and upskilling initiatives. </p><p>Let me close by saying that I believe Amazon should be scrutinized. </p><p>We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they're companies, government agencies, or non-profits. Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colors. </p><p>It's not a coincidence that Amazon was born in this country. More than any other place on Earth, new companies can start, grow, and thrive here in the U.S. </p><p>Our country embraces resourcefulness and self-reliance, and it embraces builders who start from scratch. </p><p>We nurture entrepreneurs and start-ups with stable rule of law, the finest university system in the world, the freedom of democracy, and a deeply accepted culture of risk-taking. </p><p>Of course, this great nation of ours is far from perfect. Even as we remember Congressman John Lewis and honor his legacy, we're in the middle of a much-needed race reckoning. </p><p>We also face the challenges of climate change and income inequality, and we're stumbling through the crisis of a global pandemic. </p><p>Still, the rest of the world would love even the tiniest sip of the elixir we have here in the U.S. </p><p>Immigrants like my dad see what a treasure this country is-they have perspective and can often see it even more clearly than those of us who were lucky enough to be born here. </p><p>It's still Day One for this country, and even in the face of today's humbling challenges, I have never been more optimistic about our future. </p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today and am happy to take your questions. </p><p>                     ZUCKERBERG: OUR SIZE IS WHY WE SUCCEED - SO DON'T BREAK US UP                   </p><p> Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to be here today.</p><p>I'd also like to thank your staff for their professionalism and courtesy in working with our team over the course of your investigation. </p><p>Facebook is part of an industry that has changed the world. We face intense competition globally and we only succeed when we build things people find valuable. </p><p>I'm proud that we stand for American values like giving every person a voice and expanding access to opportunity.</p><p>As a platform for ideas we'll always be at the center of important debates about society and technology, which is why I've called for new rules for the internet.</p><p>Facebook's value and the role of competition</p><p>Every day, millions of Americans use our services to stay in touch with friends and family and talk about issues that matter to them. </p><p>People use our apps to share videos, photos, livestreams, posts and private messages; to join communities, set up fundraisers for good causes, and even register to give blood. </p><p>These services create a lot of value in people's lives, and our business model means we can offer them for free. </p><p>We also help millions of businesses connect with customers. Facebook gives small businesses and individual entrepreneurs access to sophisticated tools that previously only the largest players had. </p><p>Now any business can use our services to establish an online presence, reach potential customers and grow. </p><p>We're constantly building new ways to empower people to connect and share. Since Covid-19 emerged, we've seen how important this can be. </p><p>People use our services to stay in touch with friends and family they can't be with in person; they use our tools to keep their businesses running since the internet stays open even when physical stores cannot.</p><p>Facebook supports its mission of connecting people around the world by selling ads, and we face significant competition. </p><p>We compete against the companies appearing at this hearing, plus many others that sell advertising and connect people. We also compete globally, including against companies that have access to markets that we aren't in. </p><p>Our story would not have been possible without U.S. laws that encourage competition and innovation. I believe that strong and consistent competition policy is vital because it ensures that the playing field is level for all. </p><p>At Facebook, we compete hard, because we're up against other smart and innovative companies that are determined to win. </p><p>We know that our future success is not guaranteed, especially in a global tech industry defined by rapid innovation.</p><p>The history of technology is often the history of failure, and even industry-leading tech companies fail if they don't stay competitive. </p><p>This is why we're focused on delivering better services for people and businesses, and competing as vigorously as we can within the rules. 2 </p><p>Although people around the world use our products, Facebook is a proudly American company.</p><p>We believe in values -- democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression -- that the American economy was built on. </p><p>Many other tech companies share these values, but there's no guarantee our values will win out. </p><p>For example, China is building its own version of the internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries. </p><p>As Congress and other stakeholders consider how antitrust laws support competition in the U.S., I believe it's important to maintain the core values of openness and fairness that have made America's digital economy a force for empowerment and opportunity here and around the world.</p><p>Facebook's History of Innovation</p><p> In a competitive economy, innovation leads to improvements that benefit consumers. </p><p>I understand this is one of the key goals of antitrust law, and it is what Facebook has been focused on since day one. </p><p>We've consistently added new products for people that enhance their ability to connect and share what matters most to them. </p><p>Our service began as a text-based website. Today on Facebook you can share almost any type of digital content; read news; broadcast or watch live video; play games; connect with businesses; buy or sell products; send and receive payments; organize groups and events; and raise money for important causes. </p><p>WhatsApp provides secure and reliable communication, including voice and video calls.</p><p>Instagram offers photo sharing with tools to connect and create. And the Facebook family goes beyond software, with hardware products like Oculus and Portal. </p><p>We built these new products and services because the intense competitive pressures we face push us to experiment with new ideas. </p><p>We are always working to develop technologies that will change how people connect and communicate in the future, and we invest around $10 billion per year in research and development. </p><p>We know that if we don't constantly keep improving, we will fall behind. Many of our products were new concepts when we introduced them, and they have served as models for other companies and apps that have used and iterated on our ideas - including features like News Feed ranking and the Like button that have become foundational to many competitive services. </p><p>We have also helped advance nascent technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). We actively contribute to the open-source community. </p><p>For example, we developed the PyTorch opensource project, which has become one of the most successful AI development tools and is now used worldwide to create new AI technology and applications. </p><p>We also released Detectron2, our computer vision technology which we use for integrity work; FAISS, a state-of-the-art search tool for finding similar multimedia documents; and DensePose, for 3D interpretation of 2D images. We offer hundreds of projects like these on Facebook Open Source and GitHub, where our projects have hundreds of thousands of followers. </p><p>We also share the results of our hardware research: for example, we developed the world's most efficient servers and published the plans so everyone could use them as part of our Open Compute Project.</p><p> I believe sharing our intellectual property this way helps the entire ecosystem move forward and develop new products. </p><p>We create technology to enable social good. For example, our Crisis Response tools allow people to let family and friends know they are safe, share information during a crisis, and help communities recover. </p><p>Our Safety Check tool has been activated in more than 1,400 crises. In 2018 alone, our community used Crisis Response tools for over 300 crises in more than 80 countries. </p><p>We've also developed charitable giving tools that make it easy for our community to raise money for causes they care about on Facebook. </p><p>People, nonprofits and verified Pages can collect donations from their friends and supporters on Facebook, and so far our community has raised more than $3 billion. </p><p>To take just one example, the nonprofit No Kid Hungry has raised over $5 million from more than 200,000 donors to help feed children across the United States. </p><p>We also invest in our communities, and have committed to making over $1 billion in investments in Black and diverse suppliers and communities in the US.</p><p>Like many companies, we've both built our own products from the ground up, and we've moved others forward through mergers and acquisitions. </p><p>Our acquisitions have helped drive innovation for people who use our own products and services and for the broader startup community. </p><p>Acquisitions bring together different companies' complementary strengths. When you acquire a company, you can benefit from their technology and talent, and when you are acquired you get access to resources and people you otherwise might never have been able to tap into. </p><p>Facebook has made Instagram and WhatsApp successful as part of our family of apps.</p><p>Instagram and WhatsApp have been able to grow and operate their services using Facebook's bespoke, lower-cost infrastructure and tackle spam and harmful content with Facebook's integrity teams and technology. </p><p>Following its acquisition, Instagram was able to get help stabilizing infrastructure and controlling runaway spam. </p><p>It also benefited from the ability to plug into Facebook's self-serve ads system, sales team and existing advertiser relationships to drive monetization, and was able to build products including IG Direct and IG Video that used Facebook's technology and infrastructure. </p><p>Before it was acquired, WhatsApp was a paid app with a reputation for secure communications; together we built on that by introducing end-to-end encryption and making it free to use. </p><p>Since its acquisition, WhatsApp has also been able to develop products such as voice and video calling that were built on Facebook's technology stack. </p><p>These benefits came about as a result of our acquisition of those companies, and would not have happened had we not made those acquisitions. </p><p>We have developed new products for Instagram and WhatsApp, and we have learned from those companies to bring new ideas to Facebook. </p><p>The end result is better services that provide more value to people and advertisers, which is a core goal of Facebook's acquisition strategy.</p><p>Facebook Platform </p><p>In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform, a set of tools for developers and businesses to build complementary services on Facebook. </p><p>Our vision for Platform has always been to foster an ecosystem of apps that build on top of Facebook and create a richer and more interesting experience for people. </p><p>At the same time, we have developed rules to make Platform work better for everyone and to protect the significant investments we made in capital and talent to develop it. </p><p>We've made changes to those policies over time to deal with issues as they arose, and to protect user privacy and give people more control over their data. We stand by those changes and will continue to evaluate our policies to address any new issues that arise. </p><p>The Benefits of Scale </p><p>I understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have.</p><p>Ultimately, I believe companies shouldn't be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy, and election integrity on their own.</p><p>That's why I've called for a more active role for governments and regulators and updated rules for the internet.</p><p>If we do this right, we can preserve what's best about this technology - the freedom for people to connect and express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things - while also protecting society from broader harms.</p><p>In the meantime, Facebook is working to address problems at scale.</p><p>From election security to building more privacy-protective products, we are bringing significant technical and financial resources to bear on the challenges we face. </p><p>For example, we now have more than 35,000 people working on safety and security - three times as many as we had just three years ago. We've built sophisticated systems to find and remove harmful content. </p><p>We're funding new technologies to tackle emerging threats like deepfakes. </p><p>And we're building products to connect people to authoritative information, like our recently introduced Covid-19 and voter information centers. </p><p>We have a responsibility to work constantly to keep people safe on our platform, and to make sure we're investing to fix our issues and get ahead of new risks. Facebook's size is an asset in those efforts. </p><p>Supporting Our Community Through the COVID-19 Pandemic </p><p>Our services have supported people and businesses throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>People turn to Facebook to stay connected with their families and friends and get authoritative and up-to-date health information. </p><p>For many, our services are critical communications tools: group calls in Italy during the early stages of the pandemic jumped by more than 1,000 percent, and in April 700 million people were making video calls every day on Messenger and WhatsApp. </p><p>Businesses also use our tools to stay connected to customers, shift sales online, and run fundraisers. </p><p>For many small businesses, being able to operate online is vital and I'm proud that our tools enable this. </p><p>We built new products to respond to the crisis. We launched Community Help, which lets people find and offer help in their local area -- everything from volunteering to pick up groceries and assisting with errands to sharing goods and checking in on one another.</p><p>This is the kind of social infrastructure that companies like Facebook are well positioned to provide. </p><p>We connect people to authoritative health information and we're taking aggressive steps to stop Covid19-related misinformation and harmful content from spreading. </p><p>In January, we started displaying educational pop-ups in Facebook and Instagram connecting people to authoritative Covid-19-related information from organizations including the CDC, regional health authorities, and the WHO. </p><p>We also launched the Covid-19 information center, which is now featured at the top of News Feed on Facebook and includes real-time updates from national health authorities and global organizations. </p><p>Through these efforts across Facebook and Instagram, we've directed more than 2 billion people to resources from health authorities, and we're giving millions in ad credits to health authorities so they can reach people. </p><p>We're also using data in new ways to inform the public health response. We partnered with Carnegie Mellon University to launch a Covid-19 Symptom Survey that can help researchers predict the spread of the disease. </p><p>With millions of responses, researchers are able to get a much more detailed picture of the pandemic.</p><p>We also contributed aggregated anonymized location data to the Covid-19 Mobility Data Network, a group of 40 health researchers whose work helps governments determine if and where it's appropriate to roll back social distancing orders.</p><p>I'm proud that we've been able to support people, businesses and the public health effort during this crisis. </p><p>Our Responsibility to Our Community </p><p>This is an incredibly challenging time, and that's why it's more important than ever that people can have conversations on our platforms about the issues that matter to them - whether that's Covid-19, racial and 5 social injustice, family and economic concerns, or the upcoming elections. </p><p>We recognize that we have a responsibility to stop bad actors from interfering with or undermining these conversations through misinformation, attempted voter suppression, or speech that is hateful or incites violence. </p><p>I understand the concerns people have in these areas, and we are working to address them. While we are making progress - for example, we have dramatically improved our ability to proactively find and remove harmful content and prevent election interference - I recognize that we have more to do. </p><p>I know our primary goal at this hearing is to talk about antitrust and competition issues, but with four major tech CEOs appearing before Congress, we also have an opportunity to talk about how technology can better serve society. </p><p>Each of our companies is doing important work to meet our current responsibilities to our communities, while also planning and investing for a time where we are likely to see significant economic and social disruption. </p><p>I hope at least some of today's hearing will touch on the future, and how our collective scale and resources could be harnessed to help people and businesses. </p><p>For instance, many families are worried about schooling and how to balance home and work obligations going forward. </p><p>How can we leverage our products to lessen this burden for people? What else can we do to support communities if social distancing orders remain in place? How can we better equip our small businesses to compete, including on the world stage? How else can technology companies assist the public health effort? </p><p>We don't have all the answers yet, but I hope that our industry continues to look for innovative ways to support our communities through this difficult time.</p><p>Conclusion </p><p>Our success rests on our ability to build products that bring value to people's lives -- whether it's finding a supportive Facebook group, starting a business on Instagram, video calling loved ones on Messenger or staying in touch with a friend on WhatsApp. </p><p>Facebook is a successful company now, but we got there the American way: we started with nothing and provided better products that people find valuable. </p><p>As I understand our laws, companies aren't bad just because they are big. </p><p>Many large companies that fail to compete cease to exist. This is why we're focused on building and updating our products to give people the best possible experiences. </p><p>Provided we continue investing in new ideas and living up to our broader social responsibilities, I'm hopeful that we'll keep making progress and deliver better products and services -- for the people and businesses that use our products, for the wider tech ecosystem, and for the world.</p><p>Several years ago, Facebook moved our headquarters to the campus where Sun Microsystems used to be. </p><p>We kept their sign out front, on the back of ours, to remind us that things change fast in tech. </p><p>I've long believed that the nature of our industry is that someday a product will replace Facebook.</p><p>I want us to be the ones that that build it, because if we don't, someone else will. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</p><p>GOOGLE'S PICHAI:                    </p><p> Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to appear before you today. </p><p>At its heart, a discussion about competition is a discussion about opportunity. </p><p>This has never been more important, as the global pandemic poses dual challenges to our health and our economy. </p><p>Expanding access to opportunity through technology is deeply personal to me. I didn't have much access to a computer growing up in India. </p><p>So you can imagine my amazement when I arrived in the U.S. for graduate school and saw an entire lab of computers I could use whenever I wanted. </p><p>Accessing the internet for the first time in that computer lab set me on a path to bring technology to as many people as possible. It's what inspired me to join Google 16 years ago. </p><p>And it's what led me to help create Google's first browser, Chrome... not because I thought the world needed another browser, but because a better browser could open up the web to more people.</p><p>I couldn't have imagined then that, eleven years later, so many people would experience the web through Chrome, for free.</p><p>At Google, we take pride in the number of people who choose our products and services; we're even prouder of what they do with them - whether it's the 140 million students and educators using G Suite for Education to stay connected during the pandemic . . . the 5 million Americans gaining digital skills through Grow with Google, part of our $1 billion initiative to expand economic opportunity . . . or the millions of small business owners connecting with customers through Google products such as Maps and Search. </p><p>Our work would not be possible without the long tradition of American innovation, and we're proud to contribute to its future. </p><p>Founded in Silicon Valley, we now employ more than 120,000 Googlers around the world - more than 75,000 here in the U.S., acrossoffices and data centers in 26 states. </p><p>PPI estimated that in 2018 alone we invested more than $20 billion across the U.S., citing us as the largest capital investor in America that year. </p><p>It's also ranked us in the top five U.S. investors for the last three years. </p><p>An implant way we contribute is by building products that are helpful to American users in moments big and small, whether they are looking for a faster route home, learning how to cook a new dish on YouTube, or growing a small business. </p><p>Survey research found that free services like Search, Gmail, Maps, and Photos provide thousands of dollars a year in value to the average American. </p><p>Many are small business owners who have used our digital tools to grow. For example, Fat Witch Bakery is a New York City-based bakery that for decades has been known for its delicious brownies. </p><p>For over 17 years, Fat Witch and its founder Patricia Helding have been Google Ads customers. The Fat Witch team uses free tools like Google My Business to interact with their customers and to keep them informed, with over 200 reviews on their prole and counting.</p><p>They also use free tools like Google Analytics to track the effectiveness of their marketing spend. </p><p>Online has been a lifeline for so many businesses, especially during the global pandemic. </p><p>For example, by the time COVID-19 forced Texas to shelter in place, Kelebell Kings, an Austin-based fitness company, had already been investing in Google Ads and Analytics for nearly a decade. </p><p>When the lockdown orders led to a surge in sales for home fitness equipment, Kelebell was prepared to adjust its digital offerings to capture the market, and its YouTube Channel grew 20%, helping them to grow their digital revenue and sales, which are up 3000% since COVID hit. </p><p>Nearly one-third of small business owners say that without digital tools they would have had to close all or part of their business during COVID. </p><p>I am deeply proud that because of our tools, businesses on Main Street can compete in a way that wasn't possible 20 years ago, including globally. </p><p>For example, Berry Digital Solutions is a digital marketing firm in Urbana, Ohio, that supports local small businesses. </p><p>They use Google tools to work remotely during the pandemic, coordinating meetings through Google Calendar and collaborating on content in Google Docs. </p><p>They help their clients use Google Ads, and they appreciate that you only pay when someone clicks on your ad. The Berry Digital team also uses Google 2 Analytics to learn more about the customers of their clients and how they can beer serve them. </p><p>Another way we contribute is by making deep technology investments in America's future. </p><p>Every year, we are among the world's biggest investors in research and development. </p><p>At the end of 2019, our R&amp;D spend had increased almost 10 times over 10 years, from $2.8 billion to $26 billion. </p><p>We've invested over $90 billion over the last 5 years. Through these investments, our teams of engineers are helping America solidify its position as the global leader in emerging technologies like facial intelligence, self-driving cars, and quantum computing. </p><p>For example, last fall, our team of researchers based here in the U.S. was the first to reach a quantum computing milestone, a discovery that could eventually lead to new breakthroughs in medicine and more efficient batteries. </p><p>Just as American leadership in these areas is not inevitable, we know Google's continued success is not guaranteed. </p><p>Google operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving. </p><p>Today's competitive landscape looks nothing like it did 5 years ago, let alone 21 years ago, when Google launched its first product, Google Search. </p><p>For example, people have more ways to search for information than ever before - and increasingly this is happening outside the context of only a search engine.</p><p>Often the answer is just a click or an app away: You can ask Alexa a question from your kitchen; read your news on Twitter; ask friends for information via WhatsApp; and get recommendations on Snapchat or Pinterest. </p><p>When searching for products online, you may be visiting Amazon, eBay, Walmart, or any one of a number of e-commerce providers, where most online shopping queries happen.</p><p>Similarly, in areas like travel and real estate, Google faces strong competition for search queries from many businesses that are experts in these areas. A competitive digital ad marketplace gives publishers and advertisers, and therefore consumers, an enormous amount of choice. </p><p>For example, competition in ads - from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Comcast and others - has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these savings passed down to consumers through lower prices. </p><p>We also deliberately build platforms that support the innovation of others. </p><p>Using Android - a product I worked on for many years - thousands of device makers and 3 mobile operators build and sell devices without any licensing fees to us or any requirement to integrate our products. </p><p>This greatly reduces device prices, and today billions of consumers around the globe are now able to afford cuing-edge smartphones, some for less than $50. And in doing so they are able to access new opportunities - whether it's sharing a video with friends and family around the world, gaining an education for themselves or their children, or starting a business. </p><p>Competition also sets higher standards for privacy and security. </p><p>I've always believed that privacy is a universal right and should be available to everyone, and Google is committed to keeping your information safe, treating it responsibly, and putting you in control of what you choose to share. We also never sell user information to third parties.</p><p>But more must be done to protect users across industries, which is why we've long supported the creation of comprehensive federal privacy laws. </p><p>To this day, I haven't forgotten how access to innovation and technology altered the course of my life. </p><p>Google aims to build products that increase access to opportunity for everyone - no matter where you live, what you believe, or how much money you earn. </p><p>We are committed to partnering with lawmakers, including the members of this Committee, to protect consumers, maintain America's competitive technological edge in the world, and ensure that every American has access to the incredible opportunities that technology creates. Thank you. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-64810866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-KCR1-JCJY-G00G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"10090\"/><timeReceived>3:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

I knew I had to run away from it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is NEW DAY weekend with Victor Blackwell and Christi Paul.</p><p>CHRISTI PAUL, CNN HOST: President Trump is on vacation. Twitter however is not. Specifically his Twitter feed. He's been launching attacks on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the whistleblower.</p><p>VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN HOST: The President is clearly frustrated with the uncertainty surrounding his Senate trial. CNN White House Reporter Sarah Westwood joins us now from South Florida. Sarah, we hear that the President has been at Mar-a-Lago there asking advice about who should be on his defense team.</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE REPORTER: That's right, Victor and Christie. President Trump clearly growing agitated with this extended state of limbo surrounding his Senate trial and while he's been spending time down here at his property of Mar-a-Lago he's been quizzing aides, quizzing allies with him at his club about who should be presenting the defense and what the White House's strategy should be when this trial finally gets under way.</p><p>Now the only certain thing at this point looks to be White House Counsel Pat Cipollone is expected to present the bulk of the President's case before the Senate but beyond that a lot of the details remain unclear. President Trump is considering adding some conservative House allies such as Congressman Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows to the team.</p><p>They would present something of a minority response to whatever the Democratic House Managers present in terms of the case for the articles of impeachment. But Democrats are showing no signs of letting up. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of course continues to withhold the articles of impeachment from the Senate.</p><p>Take a listen to what one top Democratic member of the House told CNN yesterday about just how long this standoff could last?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAN KIDLEE, (D-MI): I think we have to wait until we have some assurance that the trial is not going to be some sort of sham or a joke.</p><p>KATE BOLDUAN, CNN HOST: I'm talking extremes here, like into February?</p><p>KIDLEE: Well, I mean that's certainly possible but I'm not going to get ahead of the Speaker.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WESTWOOD: Now, we know that President Trump is eager to have his symbolic day of court but, of course, there are just so many unanswered questions, a lot of uncertainty about when that trial will start Victor and Christi.</p><p>PAUL: Well, we know Sarah that President Trump and Speaker Pelosi have really been very publicly on Twitter, talking about this. Is there a sense that they are trying to convince either the American people or swing members of the opposite party to get on their side?</p><p>WESTWOOD: Ultimately Christi this decision will be up to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He is the one who needs just 51 votes technically to set the parameters of the trial. McConnell said this week that he's not anxious to get to trial but President Trump is clearly very impatient. He settled into something of a routine firing off these missives at Speaker Pelosi in between his rounds of golf mingling with guests at the club. Here's just one of those barbs. He wrote on Twitter so interesting to see Nancy Pelosi demanding fairness from Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when she presided over the most unfair hearing in the history of the United States Congress.</p><p>Now Pelosi of course has shown no signs of budging and in fact Democrats have been mounting fresher on Senate Republicans to include some of the things that they want to see like live witnesses, more document collection. Speaker Pelosi firing back wrote on Twitter the facts are clear and every witness told the same story despite the President's attempts to cover it up.</p><p>President Trump abused his power for his own personal gain, #defendourdemocracy. The President does have one more week here at Mar-a-Lago and will be surrounded by a row cast of staff and some of those questions about White House strategy could be addressed during the remaining time down here Victor and Christi.</p><p>PAUL: All right. It's Sarah Westwood, appreciate it. Thank you. Kevin Robillard with us now Senior Political Reporter at \"The Huffington Post,\" Kevin as we continue to listen to this very public fight back and forth, the longer this goes on which party is most at risk here?</p><p>KEVIN ROBILLARD, SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER, THE HUFFINGTON POST: I think really it's tough to say. Neither party's standing has really been hurt all that much by this showdown so far. Impeachment really hasn't moved Trump's approval ratings; it really hasn't moved the approval ratings of Democrats in Congress.</p><p>[08:05:00]</p><p>ROBILLARD: To a certain extent it might be Republicans just because that right now sort of the onus is on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to keep the Republican Senators together and keep them from sort of bowing to any of these Democratic demands. There's going to be increasing pressure on some of those moderate Republicans, people like Maine Senator Susan Collins, Colorado Senator Corey Gardner both of whom are up for re-election this year.</p><p>So there might be a little bit more pressure on Republicans but so far this hasn't really drastically - there hasn't been any drastic change that is going to put a lot of pressure on either party.</p><p>PAUL: Sure. Ron Brownstein last night brought something at that was really interesting about how there's no expectation that any of these Senators are going to, you know, check their partisan identity at the door, so to speak. He went on to note every Democratic Senator in '98 voted not to remove President Clinton.</p><p>Every Democrat in 1868 voted not to remove Andrew Johnson. But he made the point that to move forward without hearing from some of the key players here with Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton, Mike Pompeo that this could set a dangerous precedent. Let's listen to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: The idea that Republicans in the Senate just from an institutional precedent that they are setting would be okay with the White House base is saying we're not going to let anybody testify. We're not going to release any documents. It's just remarkable to me.</p><p>There's going to be another Democratic President some day. There is going to be a Republican Congress that wants to hold oversight over them and they are going to be looking back at the precedent there establishing here and realizing that they have let themselves in a much weakened position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL: We know Senator Murkowski is at odds with Leader McConnell when it comes what to do here. Do you think that there are other Republicans who have the same concerns that Ron talked about?</p><p>ROBILLARD: Yes, I think they're definitely could be. We haven't heard them speak up so far. Although we should note that where Lisa Murkowski goes Susan Collins often goes with her. That is not 100 percent correlation but it is something that they do tend to vote as a bloc at times.</p><p>I do think there are going to be other Republican Senators, particularly maybe some of those old time institutionists like Lamar Alexander who is retiring who might want to take a look at this and say wait are we giving up too much article II powers here. Congress has a right to oversee the Executive Branch.</p><p>Are we giving up too many of those powers if we sort of just lock arms with Donald Trump on this question? Right now whether or not that desire to protect Congress' historical powers is greater than the desire to protect the Republican President we haven't yet seen much evidence that it is going to get that far.</p><p>PAUL: Now Kevin before I let you go I want to ask about the Former Vice President Joe Biden. He gave an interview with \"The Des Moines Register\" and said that he will not and was very definitive, he will not testify in an impeachment trial because it would take the focus off of President Trump. This is a man who is vying for the executive office of our country for the presidency. Is it okay for him to dismiss protocol if he's subpoenaed?</p><p>ROBILLARD: Yes. I was a little surprised by that comment for the most fact that Biden entertained the hypothetical. At this point it is a hypothetical. And really Biden also noted in that interview it doesn't look like we're going to get there. I would be really, really surprised at this point if Joe Biden is subpoenaed. It really seems like most Republican Senators want a pretty quick trial when that happens.</p><p>That said it is sort of remarkable that Joe Biden who is really running a campaign on the idea that, you know, Donald Trump thinks he's above the law, we have to - you know he's an abnormal President, the fact he keeps his abusing his powers is unacceptable that's why I'm running that's the reason we have to defeat him.</p><p>At the same time going to say, you know if I get the subpoena I won't comply with it. It's interesting he could have said if I was subpoenaed I would fight it in court. That's not what he said. He said I straight up I wouldn't comply with it. I was really surprised by that comment.</p><p>PAUL: All right. Kevin Robillard, always great to have you with us. Thank you, sir.</p><p>ROBILLARD: Good to be on.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Right now to Hawaii. The remains of six people have been recovered. After a tour helicopter crashed on the Island of Kauai and that was Thursday. One person is still unaccounted for. Police say the Debris was found in a remote area of a state park north of the city of Hanapepe. The FAA and NTSP are investigating and we'll have a full report of the latest developments. It's coming up next hour.</p><p>PAU: The following new developments in the controversy over Former Navy SEAL Platoon Leader Eddie Gallagher. Videos obtained by \"The New York Times\" shed light on his fellow SEAL's accusations against him. We have the latest for you next.</p><p>[08:10:00]</p><p>PAUL: Twelve minutes past the hour glad to have you back with us. We're following some new developments in the controversy over a Former Navy SEAL Platoon Leader Eddie Gallagher. His case drew attention of the President as he was tried and acquitted of murdering an ISIS fighter.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Videos obtained by \"The New York Times\" shed light on his fellow SEAL's accusations against him. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr reports and we need to warn you her report contains some pretty disturbing images.</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Members of SEAL Team 7 Alpha Platoon broke their own code of silence in 2018 with their opinions about retired Special Operations Chief Eddie Gallagher and some making accusations that the elite SEAL committed murder and potential war crimes.</p><p>These are portions of recorded Navy SEAL interviews published by \"The New York Times,\" where team members tell investigators their views on the Platoon Leader. Gallagher was acquitted of premeditated murder when a key prosecution witness changed his story and testified under immunity that he caused the prisoner's death not Gallagher.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you suffocate him?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I put my thumbs over his ET tube until he stopped breathing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STARR: Scott described the killing as an act of mercy because he was concerned the boy, a prisoner of Iraqi forces would be tortured by them. Gallagher was convicted on the charge of taking a photo with a dead ISIS fighter and was then demoted in rank. A decision President Trump reversed allowing the SEAL to retire with honor, even after Pentagon Leaders urged the President not to interfere.</p><p>Speaking through his Attorney Gallagher told CNN my first reaction to seeing the videos was surprise and disgust that they would make up blatant lies about me. But I quickly realized that they were scared that the truth would come out of how cowardly they acted on deployment? His defense attorney said the tapes were \"A road map to acquittal because they show there were conflicting stories about allegations of Gallagher killing civilians and other misconduct\".</p><p>[08:15:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Really, you're seeing one very small slice of the story in a way that's not reflecting what the ultimate result was.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STARR: President Trump's determination to reverse the military's punishment of Gallagher against the advice of top Pentagon officials were so controversial Navy Secretary Richard Spencer was ousted. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff insists that discipline and adherence to the laws of war will not suffer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do maintain and we will maintain good order and discipline. We will not turn into a gang of raping, burning and pillaging.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STARR: But some say it's all led to festering bad feelings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEN. MARK MILLEY, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN: So it's this kind of divisiveness that the President's actions have been introducing to the SEAL community, I think that are the most damaging and will have long term effect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) STARR: Gallagher met with Trump over the holidays at Mar-a-Lago and it's possible he will campaign for Trump if asked those who know him say. Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon.</p><p>PAUL: We're going to get some insight from CNN Military and Diplomatic Analyst Retired Rear Admiral John Kirby. Admiral thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>REAR ADMIRAL JOHN KIRBY (RET), FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN: You bet.</p><p>PAUL: So when you look at all of this, what concerns, what challenges do these videos raise for the military community?</p><p>KIRBY: The biggest concern I have Christi, is the fact that the SEAL community under their new commander Rear McConnell Green has been trying to get their arms around standards of conduct, ethics and proper behavior on the battlefield for quite some time. They've had some fairly news worthy incidents lately where SEAL's in operations have not been meeting the proper standards of conduct for military members involved in operations overseas.</p><p>So they are trying to get their arms around that. This is not going make it any easier forced an Admiral Green to do. Bringing these videos out and \"The New York Times\" story just going to make it that much harder for him because there's a possibility that some members of the military might look at what happened to Gallagher and what he was able to do as surrogates at Fox News and with the President's help.</p><p>And they say hey I don't have to pay attention to the Military Judicial System I can be acquitted or I can be exonerated by the President himself through pressure by Fox News hosts. There's a real concern here for good order and discipline going forward.</p><p>PAUL: These are Navy SEALs though they are elite members, we know. They usually are out of our sight essentially. Talk to me about how uncommon this is?</p><p>KIRBY: Well, we have to keep it in perspective. Remember they weren't going out there publicly trying to talk about what Gallagher did? They were talking to investigators in a pre-trial environment. They were called in to talk to investigators. This isn't necessarily breaking public silence.</p><p>But look when we talk about the code of silence for the SEALs and they are a quiet, insular bunch. There is no question about that and rightfully so. There's also a code of honor. Just like every other member of the military they have an obligation when they he see something awry to report it, to try to stop it and report it.</p><p>That's what they did. They came forward and said what they believed were Gallagher's misdeeds on the battle field and of course they had some pretty strong comments about him and his character as well. It probably wasn't easy for them to do this. If you look at the text messages that \"The New York Times\" showed it's clear that they simply want to tell the truth. There was no a lot of coordination of their stories or anything like that in terms of nailing down details. They just all collectively said let's tell truth. I think that's noteworthy.</p><p>PAUL: How do they recover from this then Admiral?</p><p>KIRBY: They will recover. I think it's important Christi that to say right off the top of the bat that 99.9 percent of all military members and certainly that includes the SEAL community are people of character honor and integrity and serve very honorably this country. There are a few that have caused problems.</p><p>And so the SEALs will work through this as the United States military. The standards of conduct won't change. It's a matter of driving the leadership forward and making sure that everybody understands what the expectations are. And I also think the American people don't need the to worry about the SEALs on the battlefield.</p><p>Yes there have been some incidents but they are out there every night defending our values, defending our interests, defending this country and doing necessary things to bad people every single night. Lastly Christi, I would say I hope that if nothing else this maybe can start a national conversation to the degree we relied on special operators in the last 19 years.</p><p>They are the troops out there every night doing incredible thing. Their deployments are combat deployments. There's not a single day when they are not engaged with the enemy. That takes a toll on your as a person, it takes a toll on your family and certainly it takes a toll on your community. They are very resilient and they will get the through this but we need to think about how much we relied on them? And whether or not we have the right balance in terms of the forces in the field?</p><p>[08:20:00]</p><p>PAUL: Admiral John Kirby we should appreciate always and grateful for your candidness and for your insight.</p><p>KIRBY: Thanks Christi.</p><p>PAUL: Thank you.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Well, he acknowledges that he's a late entry into the 2020 Democratic Presidential Race but is it too late? Former Governor Deval Patrick's campaign just stumbled a bit. We'll speak with the Governor about it next.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Election officials in Michigan say Deval Patrick will not appear on the state's 2020 primary ballot. The Former Massachusetts Governor launched his campaign last month less than three months before the Iowa Caucuses and New Hampshire primary. Yesterday Michigan's Bureau of Elections ruled that Patrick campaign was nearly 3,000 votes short of the 11,000 required to qualify roughly a 11,000 for the state's March 10th primary. And Former Governor Deval Patrick joins us now. Guys this should be on a two shot because this is with Christi and I. Governor, welcome. Thank you for being with us.</p><p>DEVAL PATRICK (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good morning. Thanks form having me.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Let's put this on a two shot. All right first up here, thank you very much, first up, let's talk about Michigan here and then we'll get to the broader campaign. I want to put up on the screen what we heard from the Michigan board of canvassers. They decided on Friday that your name will not be on the ballot. Here's part of what they said.</p><p>They wrote off your petition that it includes 474 signatures of dubious authenticity where the signature appeared to be written in handwriting that was substantially the same as handwriting from multiple petition entries appearing on the same petition sheet. So, let's start here. Did someone from your campaign forge signatures falsify anything on that petition and what's the effort to try to figure that out?</p><p>PATRICK: Well, first of all, of course there are no forged or made up signatures. We have to sort out what our options are. It's a kind of a peculiar outcome, I must say because there were two candidates who had not announced at the point when the state party chair submitted names of candidates for the ballot.</p><p>One was included, Mayor Bloomberg and one was not, my own. There's something that smells funny there but we submitted more than enough signatures by the deadline. We're going to have to sort out what our options are going forward this is clearly a setback.</p><p>[08:25:00]</p><p>PATRICK: But it's not going to stop us. People of Michigan want me on the ballot. People of the other states where we are competing have been very, very warm in their welcome and we're building our team and building our campaign to be competitive.</p><p>PAUL: You said something smells odd there. Are you suggesting that there is something foul going on in Michigan?</p><p>PATRICK: Well I want to understand that. I think it is strange that the way the process works there, the state party chair writes to the Secretary of State, as I understand it correctly, saying who should be on the ballot, who are the Democratic candidates for the ballot?</p><p>Two candidates had not announced at that point, myself and Mayor Bloomberg. They included Mayor Bloomberg who announced after I did, but not me. So that is something we're trying to sort out. There hasn't really been a good enough explanation. We were the only ones as a result who had to go get signatures. We got more than enough signatures and now we have this decision, preliminary or otherwise out of Secretary of State. We have to sort that out. The campaign isn't about the puts and takes of the technicalities of getting on ballots. That's an important part of it. It's about defending and renewing the American dream, which I myself have lived. And which is becoming more and more out of reach for more and more people in more and more parts of the country, and I got a record of delivering the kinds of result that make it possible for people to experience the American dream and I think that's something worth fighting for.</p><p>BLACKWELL: You know Governor Patrick, I've been in preparation for this discussion, reading and watching. I was just watching your conversation earlier this week with voters in New Hampshire. What I'm trying to get to in your announcement you said this is not a commentary on the other Democrats in the race. You're not getting in or getting to the nomination by climbing on anyone else.</p><p>But what I have not heard or read is - what you don't see in the field that you think you bring. If you respect your other counterparts in the race and you respect their rich experience as you said, what don't they have as you think this race needs that you bring?</p><p>PATRICK: First of all, no other candidate has the range of life and leadership experience that I do. Having grown-up on public assistance on the south side of Chicago, having worked and solved problems in the private-sector, in the public sector, in civil rights, domestically and overseas, no one else has that range of experience.</p><p>So where the other candidates talk about their ideas, I have results. You know we delivered health insurance to 99 percent of the residents in Massachusetts. There's not another state in America that can touch that.</p><p>We delivered a national model for responding to climate change with a cap and trade, regional cap and trade system where we use those proceeds to invest in energy efficiency, becoming number one in the nation in energy efficiency and where we also use that crisis to create a new economy in the creation of clean tech jobs.</p><p>There is whole range of examples of that kind. I also believe that if you want change that lasts not change that's rhetorical but change that actually lasts that makes a generation difference, my experience tells me you got to bring other people in. And not push them aside and say that because, you know, you are presumed to be in opposition to this particular idea there's not room for you in the solution. I have a record of that.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Governor, let me ask you quickly on health care. You suggested that there should be a robust public option added to the Affordable Care Act. What is the difference between what you're proposing and what we've heard from Joe Biden with the Biden initiative, adding a public option or Medicare for all who wanted from Pete Buttigieg or others who think that you start with ACA and then add the public option. What's the difference between your plan and what we've seen from others?</p><p>PATRICK: Well a couple of things I would say. First of all, in our experience it was a broad coalition of policymakers and providers and insurers and patient advocates and labor who came together to invent health care reform in Massachusetts and then stuck together to learn from it and refine it as we went along.</p><p>So I think I signed three or four major health care reform bills after the one that Governor Romney signed that took effect the day I took office. That's why I land on the idea of having a public option which was part of ACA's intent going in. That public option might be Medicare. And I think you get the value of the creative tension of the private insurance industry having to innovate to compete for those customers or clients or patients who move to a new or lower cost alternative.</p><p>[08:30:00]</p><p>BLACKWELL: Governor I apologize for jumping in. We're low on time. The question was what's the difference between what you're suggesting and what we heard from Vice President Biden and Mayor Buttigieg because that idea has already been proposed in the race. You're adding something else. Is there a difference?</p><p>PATRICK: The difference is experience. That's important. It's about what it actually takes to make big system changes and how you have to bring in all voices in order to get those changes to stick, to really last.</p><p>PAUL: All right, Presidential Candidate and Former Governor Deval Patrick. Thank you for taking time with us today.</p><p>PATRICK: Thank you. Thank you so much for having me this morning.</p><p>PAUL: We have some new details we want to clue you in on regarding that deadly plane crash in Kazakhstan. We have a live report for you on what investigators are focusing on now?</p><p>PAUL: 33 minutes past the hour right now. We know investigators have found the black boxes belonging to that airplane that crashed in Kazakhstan. The passenger plane crashed just 19 seconds after takeoff yesterday. It killed at least 12 people, injured dozens more. The black boxes are going to be sent now to Moscow for investigation.</p><p>BLACKWELL: The plane with 93 passengers and five crew members lost altitude and broke through a concrete fence according to airport authorities. CNN's Moscow Bureau Chief Nathan Hodge is live in Moscow. Now with latest details on the crash survivor say and hello to you Nathan so it sounded like something out of a movie I can imagine.</p><p>NATHAN HODGE, CNN MOSCOW BUREAU CHIEF: Victor, yes. We saw the dramatic images yesterday of the plane, the fuselage actually broken up on the ground. It's astonishing to everyone that there were so many people who were dragged from the wreckage. Yes 12 people died. Dozens survived that crash.</p><p>Today marks a day of national mourning in Kazakhstan. As we mentioned here, investigators have recovered the black boxes, the flight data recorders are being sent back to Moscow for analysis and we're going to try to learn in the next couple of days what is the probable cause of this dramatic accident?</p><p>Now yesterday Kazakhstan's Deputy Prime Minister told reporter that they were looking at two likely or preliminary causes for this. One would be pilot error and the other would be some kind of technical malfunction. That sounds rather broad.</p><p>[08:35:00]</p><p>HODGE: He also said that the plane had hit the runway twice on takeoff. So we'll learn more in the coming days. Christi?</p><p>PAUL: All right, Nathan Hodge, thank you so much. Glad to have you here.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Well, with the New Year comes new resolutions financial experts' shares advice on how you can get a fatter wallet? And the rest of you can get thinner.

Financial expert Ted Jenkin is out with a new book \"The 21 Day Budget Cleanse.\" It's going to help you with a leaner budget and fatter wallet he says. Let's look live from New York Ted, good morning to you.</p><p>TED JENKIN, FINANCIAL EXPERT: Hey, good morning Christi.</p><p>PAUL: Good morning. So you say number one first and foremost what we need to do in our New Year's resolution in terms of money is paying off our debts. How do we determine where we start, which debt we focus on first?</p><p>JENKIN: Well, this is a big New Year's resolution Christi. Look the average consumer out there right now has $7,000 of revolving credit card debt. So I say pay off the smallest balance first. Get a win, put a win in the wincom Christi and then do something Ted likes call plastic surgery. Cut up all the credit cards except that two that you really need. Don't cancel them cut them up. This way you won't spend more money in 2020.</p><p>PAUL: Good idea. I know that you mention 21 day budget cleanse. I was sitting here thinking what can you accomplish in three weeks? Help us out here.</p><p>JENKIN: Well, you can accomplish a lot Christi. This is all about the principles of diet and exercise. And this is how you can get sort of a leaner budget, fatter wallet and bigger net worth in 2020. First and foremost take your yearend credit card statements and what you should do is go through them. Cancel your recurrent credit card charges, subscriptions things that you didn't use in 2019 and may not use in 2020.</p><p>And Christi a big one, grocery shopping the average American goes to grocery stores 14 times a month right now so simply put try to go to the grocery store just one time per week and make a list. Otherwise the grocery stores are like Las Vegas Christi. They just separate you from your wallet. That's what they do.</p><p>PAUL: I'll remind my refrigerator that I'm not even using. It happens all the time good point. Stocks, we know they are tearing it up right now. Prognosticate for us what 2020 is going to look like? What should we be doing here?</p><p>JENKIN: Actually the stock market is doing very well in election years Christi. Obviously there was an abysmal year in 2008 and wasn't so great in 2000. But this is a time after a banner year in 2019 to do a reset on your asset allocation. Easy rule of thumb is rule of 100. Take your age, you subtract it from 100 and that's how much money you should have equities and stocks and the remainder should be in fixed income or bonds.</p><p>And if you have college accounts and you're going to pay tuition in the fall and you have 529 plans that have gone up in value have no business being in the stock market. Get that cash to the sidelines.</p><p>PAUL: Good point. Ted Jenkin, the book is \"21 Day Budget Cleanse.\" We appreciate it so much thank you sir.</p><p>JENKIN: Thanks Christi.</p><p>PAUL: Sure.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Is Antonio Brown back on track to play on the NFL? Vince Cellini, you got a call for a work out with one team?</p><p>VINCE CELLINI, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Brown has been out of the league since September in limbo over a sexual assault lawsuit. Now that team's coach is pumping the brakes on the possibility of an immediate return - coming up.</p><p>[08:50:00]</p><p>BLACKWELL: Controversial NFL player Antonio Brown. They've gotten his first shot to get back into the league.</p><p>PAUL: Got a workout with the New Orleans Saints.

With the Super Bowl as the end goal that Payton said Antonio Brown did in fact work out for the team yesterday. This as the NFL confirmed it is still investigating Brown following allegations of sexual assault which Brown denies. But Payton was also quick to point out that workouts are common and Brown was not the only person participating.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP0)</p><p>SEAN PAYTON, SAINTS HEAD COACH: We are looking closely all the time at who are the players available and how they can help us especially as we get ready for the post season.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CELLINI: Brown hasn't played since week two in September he was promptly released by the Patriots. He spent 11 days there. The NFL has not announced any kind of discipline if you were to sign with the team. And turning the couch football the playoff is finally here. Three juggernauts in LSU, Ohio State and Clemson and fourth seed in Oklahoma that can put up points in bunches the - is about as good as he gets. Clemson has won 28 straight games with so many players back from their national championship last year including quarterback Trevor Lawrence.</p><p>[08:55:00]</p><p>CELLINI: But the Buckeyes have Justine Field who threw 40 touchdowns against only one interception this season and they also have the defensive lineman Chase Young who just might be the number one pick in next year's NFL draft.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>J. K. DOBBINS, OHIO STATE RUNNING BACK: It's going to be a big challenge. They have some great players on that team, great coaches. This is a hard fought game. We'll do everything we can to beat them. CHASE YOUNG, OHIO DEFENSIVE END: Really good quarterback can definitely sling it. Probably could have went to the draft last year. He was that good definitely going to be a challenge to get to him.</p><p>JUSTINE FIELDS, OHIO STATE QUARTERBACK: They have great players all around great coaches. It's really just going to come down to who executes more and who prepares more.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CELLINI: And it starts with the peach bowl where all eyes will be on the two quarterbacks. Joe Burrow for what a great story going from backup at Ohio State to the Heisman Trophy winner with the Tigers. And Oklahoma has its own transfer hero in Jail Hard. He was part of three Alabama teams that made the playoffs before losing a job last year. He stayed, graduated only to come to Oklahoma, finished second in the Heisman and lead Sooners back to the promise land.</p><p>The holidays are about bringing families back together. That's what the NBA did repeat forward Chris Sylva. The league surprising the 23- year-old by flying his mom in all the way from Gabon in Africa to Miami they hadn't seen each other in three years only once since he moved to the U.S. as a teenager in 2012. I love this story. I watched this video several times. Every time it gets to me. What a beautiful story.</p><p>PAUL: Oh my, gosh.</p><p>BLACKWELL: There is a second there were maybe it looks like he just doesn't believe it's happening. He says that's my mom.</p><p>PAUL: Vince, thank you for sharing. That was good.</p><p>CELLINI: Thank you.</p><p>PAUL: Thank you. Hey listen there is some amazing video we want to show you here. This winter storm that we have been seeing across the country it has really been a travel nightmare for people but this is amazing anybody survived this.</p><p>BLACKWELL: So the fog here is the big problem. Look at this.</p><p>PAUL: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>BLACKWELL: It led to the unforgettable scene on the highway there in Texas. The photographer a CNN affiliate KCBD was there caught it on camera.

The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>The high-profile White House event raised the prospect of Trump using the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against big tech companies in the areas of competition and privacy.</p><p>The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump's volley of Twitter messages Thursday had familiar targets - \"certain companies,\" the media and his Democratic rivals - that have resonance with his political base. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the media and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020. He hailed himself as \"so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!\"</p><p>A \"big subject\" of the summit would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,\" Trump said in his tweets.</p><p>\"We will not let them get away with it much longer,\" he said.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations expected to participate in the White House meeting are Turning Point USA, a nonprofit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think-tank.</p><p>Accusations commonly levelled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. By policy, Twitter prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. weighed in on the subject Wednesday, tweeting: \"Twitter: We won't allow pro-life groups like @LiveAction to run ads on our 'platform' &amp; if you're a conservative we might ban you for 1st Amendment protected speech that we arbitrarily deem 'offensive.'\"</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" Internet Association president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday. \"Internet companies depend upon their users' trust from across the political spectrum to grow and succeed.\"</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.</p><p>\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who has been sharply critical of the big companies for reasons of their market dominance and effect on competition. He leads a House Judiciary subcommittee that has opened a bipartisan probe into Big Tech's market conduct.</p><p>\"If someone wants to show me some empirical data, instead of some alt-right member's paranoid claims, I'd appreciate it,\" Cicilline said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said private companies should be allowed to remove \"vicious, racist, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic hate speech.\"</p><p>\"But this president, amazingly, seems to believe that when offensive language is coming from a right-wing source, and it's taken off the social media site, that's censorship,\" he said.</p><p>Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter and uses the platform almost daily to speak directly to his followers. He has a knack for tweeting outrageous, divisive or tongue-in-cheek missives that spur frenzied reactions from the mainstream media.</p><p>At the same time, Trump has accused Twitter, without evidence, of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\"</p><p>Trump was dealt a setback Tuesday in his ongoing legal battle against Twitter. A federal appeals court in New York City ruled that the president can't ban critics from his Twitter account, saying the First Amendment calls for more speech, rather than less, on matters of public concern.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2019071155032115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJB-FSW1-JDH1-C42P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

I'm Mike Emanual in for Bret Baier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking tonight, we are following several big stories and apparent resolution in the standoff over federal forces intervening in protest violence in Portland, but President Trump is still threatening to send in the National Guard.</p><p>The President's making news on a number of other topics tonight. The president says he has not asked Vladimir Putin about reports Russia offered bounties to the Taliban to kill American troops in Afghanistan.</p><p>He's offering support for a controversial doctor who has some out of the mainstream views about the coronavirus.</p><p>And one of the lawmakers most opposed to mandatory mask rules misses a ride with the president to his home state after testing positive for COVID-19.</p><p>Chief White House correspondent John Roberts has all of it tonight. Good evening, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Mike, good evening to you. A lot of news here at the White House but around here, we just call it Wednesday. And late this afternoon, President Trump giving officials in Oregon a short time to stop the violence in Portland threatening that he will send in the National Guard if they can't get it done.</p><p>And with the presidential poll numbers tightening in Texas, President Trump today traveled to the Lone Star State, promising that he will never let Texas or its oil industry down.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: In Midland, Texas today, President Trump offering new help to the battered oil and gas industry near decimated by the coronavirus crisis. The president issuing permits for new cross border pipe and rail lines with Mexico.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This will include two permits allowing the export of Texas crude to Mexico, a giant victory for the workers of the state that you've been after for many years, right?</p><p>ROBERTS: Not with the president today, Texas Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert. He was scheduled to fly on Air Force One, but tested positive for coronavirus in a pre-trip screening.</p><p>Gohmert who was known for not wearing the face covering in Congress said, it may have contracted the virus from the inside of his mask.</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R-TX): It is interesting and I don't know about everybody, but when I have a mask on, I'm moving it to make it comfortable. And I can't help but wonder if that -- you know, puts some germs in the mask if -- keep the hands off your mask,</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump today doubled down yet again on his belief that the drug cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin could be an effective treatment for coronavirus.</p><p>TRUMP: I happen to be a believer in hydroxychloroquine, I used it. I had no problem. I happen to be a believer. Many, many people agree with me.</p><p>ROBERTS: And he had praise for Houston Dr. Stella Immanuel, whose video touting hydroxychloroquine as a cure for COVID was taken down by Facebook and Twitter. Dr. Immanuel has also claimed alien DNA is used to make some drugs.</p><p>TRUMP: I was very impressed with her and other doctors that stood with her. I think she made sense, but I know nothing about her. I just saw her on -- you know, making a statement with very respected doctors. She was not alone.</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump also revealed today that in his phone call last Thursday with Vladimir Putin, he did not bring up reports that Russia had offered bounties to the Taliban for killing American service members.</p><p>TRUMP: We discussed numerous things. We did not discuss that now.</p><p>ROBERTS: On his way to Texas this morning, the president said, intelligence about bounties is unconfirmed. Pointing out even Colin Powell said the reporting about it was way overblown.</p><p>TRUMP: If it were true, I'd be very angry about it. I would respond appropriately.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROBERTS: And on the subject of where the President might give his convention acceptance speech, he said this morning that he is still considering locations and that he might even, Mike, have it here at the White House.</p><p>EMANUEL: There you go. John Roberts leading us off on the North Lawn. John, many thanks.</p><p>Also breaking tonight, Oregon's governor says federal agents will begin a phased withdrawal from Portland. It is the result of negotiations with the Trump administration over its response to nightly protest violence.</p><p>National correspondent William La Jeunesse has the details tonight from Portland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Sweeping up, spraying down, painting over while crews cleaned up after another night of protests, the feds and state of Oregon say, they have an agreement to end the violence.</p><p>CHAD WOLF, ACTING SECRETARY, HOMELAND SECURITY: We need state or local law enforcement to step up and help us police the streets and the other areas around that courthouse and to hold individuals accountable.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Under the deal, Oregon State Police will help defend the courthouse, allowing some federal agents to withdraw.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As long as there's no trouble on the streets, then, everybody should go home and take a breath.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Both sides have a chance to prove themselves. The feds are expected to remove this fence surrounding the courthouse and stop sending agents into the streets.</p><p>State police will likely have to clear a nearby park where protesters and rioters have staged.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're not the ones doing the destruction over here, that's outsiders that don't even live here that are paid. They're highly financed. They're set up in motels and they're here to do one thing, be a disruptive force.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Secretary Wolf says federal agents will remain nearby in case they're needed. Privately, the two sides made a deal. Publicly they're still on the attack, name calling, finger pointing and blaming each other.</p><p>TRUMP:In Portland, they either clean out their city and do the job and get rid of the anarchists and agitators, which is what they are, they're not protesters.</p><p>TED WHEELER (D), MAYOR OF PORTLAND: This is not how things are done in America. This is more like the police state in terms of the tactics. They weren't wanted here. We didn't invite them here.</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Well, Governor Kate Brown trumpeted the deal, she tweeted, they have acted as an occupying force in broad violence. State police will protect Oregonians right to free speech and keep the peace.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: So, the one party that didn't sign on to this deal, the protesters including those who have violently challenged the federal presence here. To the hardcore a cop is a cop regardless of badge. So, the unknown is how they'll react when state police begin policing tomorrow or patrolling tomorrow, and vice versa, Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Great point. William La Jeunesse live in Portland. William, thanks a lot.</p><p>The Justice Department is sending more federal law enforcement to major cities to assist local police in combating violent crime. Operation Legend is expanding to Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee. The initiative first launched in Kansas City, Missouri July 8th and expanded to Chicago and Albuquerque one week ago.</p><p>Several local lawmakers are demanding answers from the NYPD after video shows officers arresting a transgender woman and placing her in an unmarked police van. It happened during a protest Tuesday about the closure of the encampment at City Hall Park. 18-year old Nicholas Stone is accused of damaging police cameras at the park. Online outrageous comparing it to covert tactics used recently by federal agents in Portland.</p><p>The leaders of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple defend their companies against lawmakers from both sides of the aisle during a big hearing today on Capitol Hill.</p><p>But first, everyone had to defend against an ironic series of technical glitches. Once the testimony started, it was deadly serious. Correspondent Gillian Turner shows us what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Congressman Jim Jordan got right to the heart of what Republican lawmakers have been wanting to grill, these big tech execs about for two years.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Big tech's out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion, that's not a hunch, that's a fact.</p><p>TURNER: Jordan put Google's Sundar Pichai directly on the firing line.</p><p>JORDAN: Is Google going to tailor its features to help Joe Biden?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CEO, ALPHABET: You have my commitment. It's always been true and we'll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way.</p><p>TURNER: Other lawmakers quickly lasered in on Zuckerberg.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: Thank you for the opportunity to testify.</p><p>TURNER: Who push back hard on accusations that Facebook has censored Republicans.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas.</p><p>TURNER: But asked about Twitter censorship of Donald Trump Jr. this week for posting a video advocating hydroxychloroquine to cure COVID-19, Zuckerberg hedged.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: We do not want to become the arbiters of truth. I think that that would be a bad position for us to be in and not what we should be doing.</p><p>TURNER: Democrats had a different axe to grind, anti-competitiveness. Chairman David Cicilline, accusing all four companies becoming so big, they're killing the tech industry.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Open markets are predicated on the idea that if a company harms people, consumers, workers and business partners, will choose another option. We're here today because that choice is no longer possible.</p><p>TURNER: Apple's Tim Cook made the case his company doesn't dominate the market.</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE: We have fierce competition at the developer side and the customer side which is a -- which is essentially it's so competitive, I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business.</p><p>TURNER: Wildcard Jeff Bezos, who'd never faced off against lawmakers during his 25-year reign at Amazon until today, tried to stay out of the fray but got in hot water anyway.</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Does Amazon ever access and use third party seller data when making business decisions?</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON: We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private labeled business. But I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER: Murphy's law was in full effect at this hearing today. It had tech problems from beginning to end, lawmakers started an hour early and then to break so that those problems could get fixed.</p><p>And Mike, once source here on Capitol Hill tells Fox News, that's about par for the course around here these days, Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Challenging times. Gillian Turner live on the Hill. Gillian, thanks.</p><p>TURNER: You bet.</p><p>EMANUEL: A grim milestone tonight as the U.S. passes the 150,000 mark in coronavirus deaths. That's the highest official count in the world. The tally has risen by 10,000 in the last 11 days, the fastest increase since early June.</p><p>The Miami Marlins have had another player test positive that makes 16. This as the NBA says it had no positive tests from its latest sampling.</p><p>The NHL returns to the ice officially Saturday, but some practice games are being played today. Both hockey and basketball are staging their contests in centralized bubble locations to avoid travel and outside contact.</p><p>The Federal Reserve says it plans to keep its benchmark short term interest rate near zero because of concerns the pandemic will act as a drag on the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIR, FEDERAL RESERVE: The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: That's at the Dow to a 160-point gain, the S&amp;P 500 was up 40, NASDAQ jumped 141.</p><p>In tonight's Democracy 2020 report, intense speculation over Joe Biden's pick for the number two spot on the Democratic ticket. We might have a better indication tonight about who will be. Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has our story from New York.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Former Vice President Joe Biden doesn't hold grudges against Senator Kamala Harris.

One witness described it as a scene from hell and the images are even more remarkable when you consider no one was hurt, not even the conductor or crew.</p><p>Dozens of firefighters are still on scene on the heavy railroad bridge over the Tempe Town Lake close to Arizona State University. The fire is mostly out now but they're trying to extinguish hotspots and contain possible hazmat leaks.</p><p>They've been on scene since just after 6:00 a.m. local time, when numerous freight cars ran off the track, several tumbled to an empty park below, and as many as 10 caught fire.</p><p>You can see the thick black smoke and the heavy flames were visible for miles in part because some of the cars were carrying lumber, which burned all day.

National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon tells us why this is happening now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MASRK ESPER, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Nearly 5,600 service members we -- will be repositioned within NATO countries. And approximately 6,400 will return to the United States.</p><p>JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Defense Secretary Mark Esper announcing today 12,000 U.S. troops will be leaving Germany. The move comes after the President indicated his displeasure with how much Germany spends on defense.</p><p>TRUMP: We're reducing the forts because they're not paying their bills. It's very simple. They're delinquent. Germany owes billions and billions of dollars to NATO. And why would we keep all of our troops there, and now Germany is saying it's bad for their economy. Well, it's good for our economy.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Republicans Senator Mitt Romney called the move a, quote, \"grave error\" and \"a gift to Russia.\" Former State Department officials expressed dismay. \"This comes on the same day Trump excuses Russia's arming the Taliban to fight American troops because, \"We supplied weapons while they were fighting Russia.\" So excuse Russia for imperiling U.S. troops, and then spite one of our closest allies. Unreal.\"</p><p>During the Cold War, more than 200,000 U.S. troops were deployed to Germany. After the latest shift 24,000 will remain.

It is believed the mailings are from China, and one expert says to treat the contents inside like they are kryptonite. Correspondent Garrett Tenney tells us why tonight from Chicago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We opened the package and it was seeds. It was like, we didn't order any seeds.</p><p>GARRETT TENNEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Thousands of packages from China are showing up in the mailboxes of Americans who never ordered them. Many of them are labeled as jewelry or toys, but inside are bags of seeds and no explanations.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I still opened it. When I opened it, there wasn't anything inside with like an invoice or anything with a description of what it was.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It had all Chinese writing on it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Number one, what are they? Even the instructions on them, they don't read very clearly.</p><p>TENNEY: The USDA is now leading an investigation, working with the Department of Homeland Security to find out what the seeds are and who sent them. At this point the agency tells FOX News it believes the packages are part of what's known as a brushing scam, where online sellers send folks items they never ordered and then post fake reviews to boost their product ratings and appearance of legitimacy. But State Ag officials across country are issuing warnings about the seeds over concerns they could be some kind of invasive species, or even worse, part of a coordinated effort to devastate America's food supply.</p><p>MAX MONCASTER, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE DEPARTMENTS OF AGRICULTURE: Certainly in the wake of 9/11, the fear of agricultural terrorism or bioterrorism has been very, very real and on people's minds. It can really harm the amount of food that we are able to produce in this country, and that could have downstream impacts on how much food is available for Americans to eat.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TENNEY: The USDA is now trying to round up as many of these mystery packages as it can to test the seeds and find out what they are. Mike?</p><p>EMANUEL: Garrett Tenney in Chicago. Garrett, thanks very much.</p><p>President Trump goes off while Joe Biden keeps it close, but not close enough. The panel reacts when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We want to take care of the people.

Here's a sample.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As long as you're your president, we will never let anyone put American energy out of business. We will never again be reliant on hostile foreign suppliers.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TRUMP: We will bring America energy independence.</p><p>My administration is announcing today that export authorizations for American liquefied natural gas can now be extended through the year 2050.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: A warm reception there in the Permian Basin. Let's bring in our panel, former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., who is currently chairman of RX Saver, Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Greg Gutfeld, cohost for \"The Five\" and author of the new book \"The Plus, Self-Help for People who Hate Self-Help.\" Great to have you all. So Greg, your thoughts on the president's message today on a whole range of topics?</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, COHOST, \"THE FIVE\": First off, I want you to know, Mike, that I wore this jacket for you. I wouldn't have worn it for Bret. I think you are special.</p><p>EMANUEL: Thank you.</p><p>GUTFELD: OK, what is amazing about Trump is in that clip he talked about Russia, TikTok, COVID, Germany, the FBI building, the GOP convention, hydroxy. He is essentially America's cabdriver. If you ask him, he's going to tell you everything that's on his mind, 17 topics nonstop, and he is certain about every one of them.</p><p>And I think that's part of the reason why the media kind of likes Joe Biden, because they don't have to work as hard. Biden is more of a figurehead. He doesn't really have any opinions. He doesn't get his hands dirty. But Trump just jumps right in. And I think everybody in the media really just wants to work less, because Trump is a lot of work.</p><p>EMANUEL: Susan, any surprise about the location today for the president talk about energy. Obviously a huge energy area of our country, but the message there, your thoughts?</p><p>SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": It's an important message for Trump, because in order for him to win, he needs to really sell his stewardship of the economy, because right now Americans don't view his stewardship of this pandemic very favorably. But they do look favorably on how he has steered the economy. This is a big deal. Extending liquefied natural gas exports to 2050 is going to bring billions and billions of dollars into the U.S. via the natural energy sector. And it's a really important part of that. He can differentiate himself from Democrats and from Joe Biden who has talked about eliminating fossil fuels. And that of course would destroy jobs and really hurt the economy.</p><p>So it's a great selling point for him, and it makes sense for him to go to Texas to talk about it.</p><p>EMANUEL: I worked in Midland-Odessa and across Texas in the 90s when it was ruby red. We know Democrats are anxious to make it purple. Harold, your thoughts?</p><p>HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE: I think one of the reasons -- first of all, thanks for having me on. Greg, congrats on your book. I think one of the reasons the president found himself in Texas is because of what you just shared, Mike, which is the polling data there shows that race tightening, even in places like Texas.</p><p>Two, we heard today from Chairman Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board who made clear that there are not enough jobs for a number of Americans who are trying to get back into the workforce. I hear people on this network, other financial networks making the case that somehow other people are taking advantage of these checks, these stimulus checks. The Fed Reserve Board chairman made it clear today that is not the case.</p><p>There's no doubt for the president to beat Joe Biden, he's going to have to get on the right side of this economy. But as Susan said so well, he's got to convince the American people first, though, that he has a handle on COVID. And as of right now, according to the polling, that is not the case. And Joe Biden has a simple message, build back better. You may make fun of him, you make poke fun at how he presents himself, maybe how he looks when he's speaking, but the country likes the stability I think he offers right now. Long way to go, but you've got to like where he is if you're on his team, and I am.</p><p>EMANUEL: One person who did not get to make the trip to the great state of Texas, Congressman Louie Gohmert. Take a listen to him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT, (R-TX) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: I have worn a mask more the last week or two more than I have in the whole last four months, and I was wearing my mask at the Judiciary hearing. When I have a mask on, I'm moving it to make it comfortable, and I can't help but wonder if that puts some germs in the mask.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: So Gohmert tested positive, did not get on Air Force One today. Now tonight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying masks will be mandatory on the House floor. Susan, your thoughts?</p><p>I'm not surprised. They were clearly getting toward that direction because the pandemic is surging in some parts of the country, and those members are coming back to Congress to work. And masks were not mandatory in the House. They were mandatory in committee hearing rooms. Members would not be called up unless they were wearing masks.</p><p>But those of us who work in the Capitol know, and I'm sure, Mike, you can attest to this, it's kind of enforced very loosely. Sometimes people don't have their masks while they are walking down the hall alone. Sometimes they pull them down to talk. Speaker Pelosi pulls her mask down to talk to us, although she's distanced from us. But it's hard to enforce this.</p><p>But Democrats are trying to do something. Today the Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told us that they are now talking about the possibility of mandatory coronavirus testing for House lawmakers because of concerns raised by lawmakers and staff and the media that they feel at risk by members who don't wear masks. Louie Gohmert has been wearing a mask now for a couple of weeks, a lot of the members do. There's a few here and there who are not wearing them. And of course, the whole theory behind masks is debatable. But I think this is just an effort by Democrats to say, look, we are trying to get a handle on this, we're trying to do something to calm everyone down here because we all need to work in the Capitol.</p><p>EMANUEL: And Greg, your thoughts about all this buzz about hydroxychloroquine once again?</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, I think that it's kind of unfair to that drug, because the only reason why people in the media and the Democrats don't like it is because Trump touted it. But the fact is, it has been around for a long time. It's a trusted drug, and I talked to infectious disease specialists who were talking and saying, basically, in the medical community, they were using it to basically prevent themselves getting sick.</p><p>But we've learned if Trump endorses something, the media is going to hate it. It's basically, his endorsement as a reverse good housekeeping seal of approval. You don't want to get his endorsement because half the country is going to hate it.</p><p>EMANUEL: Time flies when we're having fun. Next up, the titans of tech appear before Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID CICILLINE, (D-RI) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Open markets are predicated on an idea that if a company harms people, consumers, workers, and business partners will choose another option. We are here today because that choice is no longer possible. Simply put, they have too much power.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: Our services are about connection, and our business model is advertising. And we face intense competition in both. In many areas we are behind our competitors.</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: We don't have a dominant share in any market or in any product category where we do business.</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, AMAZON CEO: we nurture entrepreneurs and start-ups and stable rule of law and deeply accepted culture of risk-taking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Some of the huge tech giants appearing virtually on Capitol Hill. And we are back with our panel, Harold, Susan, and Greg. Harold, as our former Congressman, your assessment of the tech giants appearing before lawmakers today?</p><p>FORD: You know, when I was in Congress, the banks and China generated bipartisan revulsion. You saw a lot of that today, the Republicans motivated more by what they believe is some kind of political angle that the big tech is trying to advance, the Democrats concerned about these other issues.</p><p>My takeaway, Mike, it reminded me of the advantages of being big and rich, particularly as we go through COVID. If you're a small business living paycheck to paycheck, mortgage to mortgage, it's a lot harder. I'll let the Congress investigate whether or not these companies are hurting competition, innovation. Some interesting and compelling arguments were made today.</p><p>But the real takeaway I think for a small business guy or small business woman in this country is, what are you going to do for us to help us not only grow, help us not only survive but grow after we get through this awful moment the country is fighting through right now.</p><p>EMANUEL: A big concern for the Republicans in the room, of course, is conservative censorship. Take a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN, (R-OH) HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Big tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: We do not want to become the arbiters of truth. I think that that would be a bad position for us to be in and not what we should be doing.</p><p>JORDAN: Can you today assure Americans you will not tailor your features in any to help, specifically help one candidate over another. What I'm concerned about is you helping Joe Biden over President Trump.</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, GOOGLE CEO: We I don't want any work to politically tilt our core values.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Greg, your assessment.</p><p>GUTFELD: I think we are all in the same -- we are all against fake or wrong information. But for some reason it seems like, when the information is coming from the left, it kind of gets a pass. But if it's coming from the right, you have all these watchdogs. You have Snopes and you the Pinocchios and all this stuff. And usually you can't get away with anything, and I know that. But the left, is seems like -- think about all the wrong info that we were fed on social media regarding collusion and Russia and all the gossip and rumor about what was going on in the White House. That seems to just go right through, no speed bumps.</p><p>But I just hate everybody in that room, Mike. I hate the tech giants because they are young and rich, and I hate the politicians because they are obnoxious and stupid. And these hearings are exhausting. They never ask a question that merits an answer. Instead it's a dramatic statement dressed up as a question in order to end up in Twitter or on TV. I'm convinced when you watch these hearings, you shave 50 IQ points right off the top. I'm now down to like 185.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>EMANUEL: I've watched a lot of those hearings, so I've got to be worried.</p><p>Susan, your thoughts on today's hearing? Obviously the tech giants are very worried about both the right and the left coming after them trying to crack down.</p><p>FERRECHIO: That is exactly right, Mike. That's what I was going to say, the interesting quality here to this hearing was that no one was there to defend big tech. On one hand you have the chairman of the panel saying to big tech, you have too much power. And then on the right you have the ranking member Jim Jordan saying you are out to get conservatives. Nobody loves big tech.</p><p>And that leads me to ask, what's next? So far they haven't been regulated, so you have to look at what may come down the road, and of course the election of course plays a big part of this. Joe Biden has said we at least need to examine the possibility of breaking up big tech, he's certainly not committed to it. Elizabeth Warren has committed to it, and she, I think, is still on the V.P. list. So you have a platform by Democrats that may include a desire to do something to break up or somehow really regulate big tech, which is basically unregulated right now.</p><p>And then you have Congress. Congress is clearly angling to do something because nobody is satisfied here. There may be regulations, there may be some attempt to put them under a new kind of organization that is a watchdog over them. There's all kinds of possibilities here, but my sense from watching this hearing today is this is sort of day one of Congress, and really whoever becomes the next president, examining what they want to do to maybe regulate or change the way that we look at big tech right now.</p><p>EMANUEL: Harold, is regulation coming?</p><p>FORD: Something is likely to come. I think Susan nailed it. They're not going to let a hearing like this, a moment like this pass by without taking some steps. It could be that they reexamine the Sherman antitrust law and determine it doesn't fit here, and maybe they have to broaden or redefine it or reexplain it. But I think Susan is right, something is going to happen.</p><p>EMANUEL: Panel, thanks. Greg, best of luck with the book.</p><p>When we come back, more technical difficulties.</p><p>EMANUEL: Finally tonight, a little fun. Technical difficulties from Capitol Hill to Windsor, England. Princess Anne assisted her 94-year-old mother the Queen during a video call, but the pair encountered some issues along the way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good morning, Windsor. Good morning. I'm really glad to be able to join you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you see everybody? You should have six people on your screen.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I can see four, anyway.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Actually, you don't me. You know what I look like.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: It happens these days, a lot of new technology as we are dealing with this pandemic.

It was unclear how Trump could follow through on the threat of shutting down privately owned companies including Twitter Inc.Reuters The officials gave no further details. It was unclear how Trump could follow through on the threat of shutting down privately-owned companies including Twitter Inc.</p><p>The dispute erupted after Twitter on Tuesday for the first time-tagged Trump's tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact check the posts. Separately, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington on Wednesday upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit by a conservative group and right-wing YouTube personality against Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple accusing them of conspiring to suppress conservative political views. In an interview with Fox News Channel on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a platform would not be the \"right reflex\" for a government worried about censorship. Fox played a clip of the interview and said it would be aired in full on Thursday. Facebook left Trump's post on mail-in ballots on Tuesday untouched. The American Civil Liberties Union said the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution limits any action Trump could take. Facebook and Alphabet's Google declined comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. \"Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,\" Trump said in a pair of additional posts on Twitter on Wednesday. The president, a heavy user of Twitter with more than 80 million followers, added: \"Clean up your act, NOW!!!!\" Republican Trump has an eye on the November election. \"Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election,\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday. \"If that happens, we no longer have our freedom.\" STRONGEST THREAT YET Trump's threat is his strongest yet within a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech. Shares of both Twitter and Facebook fell on Wednesday. Last year the White House circulated drafts of a proposed executive order about anti-conservative bias which never gained traction. The Internet Association, which includes Twitter and Facebook among its members, said online platforms do not have a political bias and they offer \"more people a chance to be heard than at any point in history.\" Late on Wednesday, Twitter [1]CEO Jack Dorsey said Trump's tweets about California's vote-by-mail plans \"may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot.\" Separately, Twitter said Trump's tweets were labeled as part of efforts to enforce the company's \"civic integrity policy.\" The policy document on Twitter's website says people may not use its services for manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. In recent years Twitter has tightened its policies amid criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive. Tech companies have been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating user privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon.com face antitrust probes by federal and state authorities and a U.S. congressional panel. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, along with the U.S. Justice Department, have been considering changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for the material their users post. Such changes could expose tech companies to more lawsuits. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a frequent critic of Big Tech companies, sent a letter to Dorsey asking why Twitter should continue to receive legal immunity after \"choosing to editorialize on President Trump's tweets.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.co.in/topics/twitter\">https://www.ibtimes.co.in/topics/twitter</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132859159064964336975776100035</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132859</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600V-NNF1-F03R-N3RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><timeReceived>7:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times India</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!' Trump wrote. The tweet included a typo when it referenced Trump's name. </p><p>Cernekee, a former Google engineer, told Dobbs on Monday: 'When President Trump won in 2016, Google executives went up on stage right away and cried, literally tears streaming down their faces over the fact that President Trump won. </p><p>'They vowed that it would never happen again, and they want to use all of the power and all the resources that they have to control the flow of information to the public and make sure that Trump loses in 2020.'</p><p>Cernekee was fired from Google in 2018. He claims he was subjected to 'bullying' due to his conservative political posture. Google denies his claim.</p><p>Hours earlier, Trump had tweeted out a clip of Schweizer telling Dobbs about Google: 'They suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and they boosted negative stories about Donald Trump.' </p><p>Schweizer also said that in 2016 Google didn't feel like it had to 'tip the scale all that much' and predicted the firm would go 'all-in' in 2020.</p><p>Last year, Trump issued a similar threat, and claimed the firm's search results were 'RIGGED.' </p><p>Google issued a statement denying the charge in 2018, which online search experts also have said is untrue. </p><p>'Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology,' it said.</p><p>'Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. </p><p>'We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.' </p><p>The election result did cause upset inside Google. During a company meeting immediately after the election, several execs said they had backed Hillary Clinton but sought to reassure employees. </p><p>Said co-founder Sergey Brin at the meeting: 'Myself as an immigrant and a refugee, I certainly find the selection deeply offensive and I know many of you do too ...

And if we let them do what they've been doing, it's going to affect the outcome of the 2020 election as well,\" said Harmeet Dhillon, a First Amendment lawyer.</p><p> Mr. Trump suggested that Google, Facebook and Twitter should be siding with Republicans instead of with the Democratic Party, which he said is edging toward communism.</p><p> \"And the funny thing is that, in theory, they shouldn't be liking the other side,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They should be really liking our side because we're the ones that want freedom. What [Democrats] are looking at is pure socialism or worse than socialism. You know there's a word called communism, too. There's a word called communism, and they're trying to get socialism over the line.

Specifically, the hearing was in response to the Copyright Office's bizarre, ahistorical take on Section 512 of the DMCA[2] that ignores the public as a stakeholder. It seemed particularly bizarre to have as the first speaker on the panel, Don Henley, who is one of the most successful recording artists of all time -- his albums are literally the 1st and 3rd best selling albums of all time -- with a history of being wrong about the internet[3]. Henley seemed to recognize that it was a bad look for a super successful, aging rocker to be the voice of musicians on the panel (good for him) and insisted that he was really there to speak up for less well known musicians[4] who didn't have his reach.I am present, today, not to be contrary, not to advance a personal agenda (at age 73, and indefinitely homebound by the Covid\u201019 pandemic, I am in the final chapter of my career), but I come here out of a sense of duty and obligation to those artists, those creators who paved the road for me and my contemporaries, and for those who will travel this road after us. </p><p>It is truly unfortunate - and patently unfair - that the music industry is perceived only in terms of its most successful and wealthy celebrities, when in fact there are millions of people working in the industry, struggling in relative obscurity; people whose voices would never be heard were it not for hearings such as this one being held, today. So, I am compelled to seize this rare opportunity to discuss aspects of the fundamental issues that are foremost in the national conversation, at this anxious moment - fairness, rights, mutual respect and in this case, economic justice and equal opportunity.Of course, in the paragraph immediately after calling for a \"national conversation\" and \"mutual respect\" he trashed the entire tech sector and anyone who criticized him as a shill:But, the smear campaign has already begun. I have been targeted by the digital gatekeepers and their many shills and surrogates. It began last Friday in the newspaper that belongs to Mr. Bezos, and it continues, today. Big Tech was probably hoping that this hearing would be canceled, or that I would be intimidated to the extent that I would not testify. But, I will not be silent on this issue. I want to do everything in my power to strengthen the property rights of music creators of all ages, races and creeds; all styles, from hip\u2010hop to honky\u2010tonk, from rock, to rap, to rhythm &amp;#38; blues. From jazz to folk, to heavy metal. To change or improve outdated laws and regulations that have been abused for over 20 years by Big Tech the enormous digital platforms that facilitate millions of copyright infringements, monthly.From there he gave a bunch of strained and mostly debunked talking points about the notice-and-takedown provisions of the DMCA which he finds (of course) to be inadequate. Having discussed all of those in the past, I don't really want to revisit those silly talking points all over again. But I did want to point out, yet again, how Henley's \"those darn kids these days\" attitudes, undermines his claims of wishing to support up and coming artists. In particular, he attacks TikTok:In a world where more than 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, more than 1 billion videos are viewed on TikTok per day, and there are over 500 million daily active users on Instagram, it is clear that the massive online services are flourishing while artists have no ability to combat the rampant infringement that occurs on these platformsThat's an odd choice to pick on. While the labels and publishers have been fighting[5] over licensing on TikTok, this line of argument -- that TikTok is just some den of piracy -- seems completely at odds with its cultural impact. Indeed, TikTok has become the new music discovery platform[6] of the younger generation, and some argue it has taken over the music industry[7] because of that. It's also created a bunch of new music superstars[8], most notably in the persona of Lil Nas X, the hugely successful young, black, LGBTQ[9] role model. So, it becomes difficult to square the idea -- put forth by an aging white rocker claiming to represent those \"struggling in relative obscurity\" -- that TikTok is some damaging tool to up-and-coming musicians, when we see how it has enabled a young, black, LGBTQ star to rise from that obscurity. And, yes, of course there are some legitimate points buried within Henley's talking points. It's difficult to make a living as a musician. But that's not piracy's fault. It's always been difficult to make a living as an artist. But the internet and the freedom that it's created has enabled many, many, many more artists to have a chance -- including some who would never have had a chance under the old system. As we've discussed for many years[10], under the old label system, through which Henley grew up, you had record labels acting as gatekeepers. They, and they alone, chose who would be successful and who would not. The internet has obliterated that system. There's still a place for labels, but they don't control the gates anymore. There are now new avenues for artists to go direct to their fans -- to build followings and fans and supporters, with TikTok just being the latest in a long line of platforms that have brought us new artists, doing an endrun around the old system. Of course, whenever that happens, the old guard complains. Not because it's actually harming music. But because it's a lessening of their exclusive power. This is the same thing we've always seen from the antiquated wing of the legacy copyright industries. Every \"new\" thing is painted as a den of piracy. Back in the early 20th century, songwriters flipped out at player pianos and the \"piracy\" they created. The 1909 Copyright Act was literally a response to player pianos. Indeed, in the hearings over that Act, composer John Philip Sousa -- the Don Henley of his time -- testified before Congress whining that:'When I was a boy\u2014I was born in this town\u2014in front of every house in the summer evenings you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or the old songs. To-day you hear these infernal machines going night and day. ... Last summer and the summer before I was in one of the biggest yacht harbors in the world, and I did not hear a voice the whole summer. Every yacht had a gramophone, a phonograph, an aeolian, or something of the kind.\"The horrors of hearing a gramophone from your giant yacht. I'm sure Don Henley can sympathize. Of course, in retrospect this all looks silly. Here was Sousa complaining about the record player -- the very thing that eventually built the entire recording industry. But, really, what he's hooked into is the nostalgia of how things \"used to be.\" The nostalgia of \"young people together singing the songs of the day or the old songs.\" And of course that trend continued. When radio came on the scene, the makers of records screamed about how it was \"piracy.\" And when recordable cassettes came on the market, we were told that \"home taping is killing music.\" Napster was supposed to be the death of industry, as was any number of other services. Meanwhile, if one spends any time with TikTok, I'd argue that unlike Henley's view of it, it seems like the perfect example of technology and innovation -- including the innovation-promoting setup of the DMCA's provisions -- and brings us right back around to a situation in which \"young people today\" are \"singing the songs of the day or the old songs.\" Indeed, some of the most popular parts of TikTok, and those that have helped people like Lil Nas X become superstars, is the fact that TikTok encourages people to copy and sing and dance along with the \"songs of the day or the old songs.\" And it, and other similar platforms, are helping new artists break through every day -- without those artists needing to get the approval of an old has been exec at a record label. History tells us which path makes sense. Henley is choosing the Sousa path -- the successful old musician, complaining about what he's hearing from the biggest yacht not being to his liking.

So if the Trump campaign sends an email and the Bernie Sanders campaign sends an email, our email ends up in junk mail. Bernie Sanders is right there at the front of your screen,\" he said.</p><p>Google spokesperson Riva Sciuto, reached Monday, did not directly deny the Trump allegation, issuing a general statement about how it treats large-scale email senders. Sciuto put the burden on the Trump campaign to make sure the president's potential donors and other supporters see its emails.</p><p>\"Irrespective of party affiliation, when large-volume email senders follow our sender guidelines they can better ensure that their emails are received by the intended recipients,\" Sciuto said. \"Senders can monitor the health of their email sending practices via Postmaster Tools.\"</p><p>The Trump 2020 campaign hasn't released any evidence to support the claim that Google is branding its emails to supporters as spam. The campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In November 2015, a Sanders campaign email triggered Gmail's \"phishing scam\" alert. Google put a red warning box at the beginning of a campaign message claiming promises of free college tuition and lower prescription drug prices appeared fraudulent.</p><p>\"Be careful with this message. It contains content that's typically used to steal personal information,\" the warning box said, linking to a page that said: \"This message could be a scam.\"</p><p>Trump Jr. spoke exclusively to Zenger on video at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland. He hinted at changes to the Communications Decency Act, the law that shields social media platforms from responsibility when their users publish material that could invite lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.</p><p>The law's carve-outs for companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google have the practical effect of giving them safe harbor when their users make statements that would invite legal action if they appeared in a newspaper or a broadcast.</p><p>President Trump took precisely that approach with his executive order at the end of last month. While Congress alone can change the law, Attorney General William Barr said at the White House that the Justice Department will seek to sue social media giants in federal court.</p><p>His son told Zenger in February that social media platforms should be required to remain politically neutral. Some conservative activists have complained of being \"de-platformed\" or \"shadow banned\"\u2014shorthand for overt and covert ways of limiting their ability to communicate freely.</p><p>\"It's not free-market when these tech companies have many protections from liability from the U.S. government,\" Trump Jr. said. \"Once they accept those protections and they cede that liability, which could be plenty, and they're getting that benefit from the United States government, they lose the ability to say, 'We can do whatever we want.'\"</p><p>\"You can't then decide, 'Well, I only want to protect this class of people,'\" he said. \"If you tried doing that in any other business you'd be destroyed.\"</p><p>Trump Jr. said a ban on online political discrimination would be \"very comparable\" to prohibiting a university from conducting a race-based admissions process if it has access to funds from Pell Grants and other financial aid programs.</p><p>He said \"people in the Second Amendment movement, people who are pro-religious-liberty, people who are pro-life ... [are] the only people that are actually getting censored.\"</p><p>The president said May 27 in a tweet that Republicans believe social media platforms \"totally silence conservatives voices.\"</p><p>\"We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,\" he said.</p><p>Twitter's decision to fact-check the president's tweets\u2014and to append a warning label to one\u2014escalated the Trumps' feud with Silicon Valley.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1595761/donald-trump-jr-cpac-conservatives-president-son.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Donald Trump Jr CPAC conservatives president son</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Samuel Corum/Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Donald Trump Jr., son of President Donald Trump, speaks on stage during the Conservative Political Action Conference 2020 (CPAC) hosted by the American Conservative Union on February 28, 2020 in National Harbor, MD.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-1507957</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601X-G6F1-JBR6-9183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2020 Newsweek Inc.

The former DNC chairwoman unleashed a fiery rebuttal aimed not only at Watters but the rest of The Fivepanel over Trump's lies about mail-in and absentee voting as well as his ugly conspiracy theory posts about MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. As the panel brought up Twitter's unprecedented move on Tuesday to flag two of Trump's tweets[1] for false claims about California mail-in ballots, Watters ripped into the decision. </p><p>'What about pencil-neck?' Watters complained, lapsing into Fox News-speak about House Intelligence Chair Rep. Adam Schiff. 'He's been lying about closure for three years. I would put a fact-check behind any of those tweets. I know why they chose this. It is the only way they are going to beat Trump, ballot harvesting.' Watters' ominous use of the term 'ballot harvesting' belies the the infinitesimal low rate of mail voting fraud, which one study found occurred at a rate of one per 15 million eligible voters[2]. Five states currently vote entirely by mail, and 30 more offer no-excuse absentee voting by mail. Whats' more, a recent Reuters poll[3] found that more than seven in 10 Americans \u2014 including 79% of Democrats and 65% of Republicans \u2014 want the option for voting by mail in November amidst the coronavirus pandemic. 'It's not even a fact-check,' Watters claimed, before suggesting Twitter was part of vast left-wing plot to hurt Trump's reelection chances. 'It is spin. I have sheets of paper here of reports that I found on Twitter that say that there's a lot of abuse with mail ballots. It's from the New York Times, AP, CBS.These aren't fact-checkers. It's like the Democrat State of the Union rebuttal and they don't understand how weak it makes the left look. Because Biden can't take them out. The media can't take them out. Now they are asking Big Tech for help? You guys can't do this on your own? Why can't Biden retweet Trump and say this or that? That's his job. Then you find out that the guy in charge of enforcing the rules on Twitter is some left-wing hack that called the Trump folks Nazis. The whole thing is so cooked up. It's almost helping the president because it makes him, again, look like he's not everybody against him. Twitter, the FBI, the mainstream media. He's going to shove it right back in their face in November.' Co-host Katie Pavlich then threw to Brazile for comment and she let loose on Watters. 'I'm so sick and tired of hearing all the whining, all the whining, all this whining,' Brazile said, mocking Watters. 'Jesus Christ,Jesse, I wish I could send you some tissues but I'd have to be six feet from you and therefore I'd have to throw it at you.' 'I'm not whining!' Watters quickly insisted, before deploying the I'm-rubber-you're-glue argument. 'You're the one who's whining! You guys are the ones that complain to the refs.' The segment then descended into several seconds of barely intelligible arguing as Watters continued to try to interrupt and talk over Brazile during her time \u2014 and she refused to yield. 'You're talking over me because you're talking nonsense,' Brazile shot back, finally quieting down her co-host. 'These conspiracy theories. The information, the president's tweets should have been deleted. I would have deleted the president's tweets. You know why? It's a bald-faced lie. It's Republicans who use absentee ballots to get out their vote. That's traditionally been the way that Republicans have always motivated their voters: 'Go ahead and vote early.'' 'I think the social media platform company should regulate themselves and they should make sure that these conspiracy theories, the one the president put out about Joe Scarborough, it should be deleted,' Brazile added. 'The lies need to stop. There is no First Amendment right to lie. Period.' Co-hosts Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld did not try to defend Trump's ugly conspiracy theory attacks on Scarborough[4], but did break in to note that it is not illegal to lie. Brazile then made the point that just because something is not against the law does not mean it is an affirmatively-protected constitutional right. 'There's no First Amendment right to lie. There is no First Amendment right to lie,' she repeated. 'You just go ahead and lie, but if they want to delete or put a fact-check on' but before she could finish she was swallowed up in more interruptions. 'If you couldn't lie, you'd have no politics!' then snarked Gutfeld, as the segment wrapped up. Watch the video above, via Fox News. Have a tip we should know?

In response to these and other problems, some are wondering aloud whether it isn't time to bring Big Tech to heel by using antitrust law to break them up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (APPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have all come under intense public scrutiny not just because of their recent highly publicized errors, but because of their sheer size and presumed monopolistic market clout. The American Enterprise Institute's when she asked, \"Are tech companies this Halloween's boogeymen?\"</p><p>Indeed, it's worse than that actually, because at least Halloween is over in a day. Big Tech is now coming under the federal government's microscope, and it's not likely to end soon.</p><p>As we noted, this week's\u00a0hearings in Congress looked at how the\u00a0 during 2016's election.</p><p>\"You have a huge problem on your hands,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, told Facebook, Google and Twitter officials. \"You have created these platforms and now they are being misused. And you have to be the ones to do something about it, or we will.\"</p><p>Ominous words. But average consumers are also angry at the tech behemoths. After all, both Yahoo and Equifax suffered cybersecurity breaches that led to identity and data theft of millions of customers. Meanwhile, Google, Twitter and Facebook have all been heavily criticized for censoring online speech, in particular of conservatives.</p><p>Many users of online services have begun to feel as if they've lost control of their online identities, as the giant Internet companies manipulate, manage and make money off their customers' own data, with consumers having little say.</p><p>Meanwhile, conservatives are livid over the left-wing bias shown by the largest tech companies, which donate lavishly to leftist causes and the Democratic Party, pushing an aggressively progressive agenda while routinely censoring conservative political speech on their services through biased \"fact-checking\" and by blocking entirely reasonable political or cultural content. Conservative radio host Dennis Prager, tired of having his well-reasoned and informative \"Prager University\" videos blocked, has sued Google to force it to end its political censorship.</p><p>These are all certainly major problems, and should be addressed. But how?\u00a0Some want Washington to bring out its big gun \u2014 antitrust \u2014 to put these big tech companies in their place.</p><p>As the anger grows, it's tempting.</p><p>After all, as a , Amazon will next year have roughly half of all online retail revenue, while Facebook and Google already control more than 70% of all online advertising.\u00a0Isn't that, along with their recent arrogant behavior toward their users, evidence that today's tech and internet giants are monopolies and due for a good old-fashioned antitrust shellacking?</p><p>The answer is no.</p><p>First off\u00a0\u2014 in antitrust, size matters, but it's not everything. Yes, these companies have a market value of nearly $3 trillion and control much of the online world's commerce. But in order to apply antitrust remedies, the government has to prove that the big companies are acting either singly or together as monopolies to keep competition out of the market and raise prices to the detriment of consumers.</p><p>It isn't happening. Indeed, the economic benefits to most consumers of these services\u00a0\u2014 whatever the big companies' other shortcomings, including their political biases \u2014 are immense. Does anyone believe that Amazon, for instance, doesn't deliver enormous value to its customers, even as it faces growing competition both online and from established retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT) and others?</p><p>Breaking up Amazon and the others won't solve anything. Nor will regulating them to death. It will merely disrupt the market, raise prices, discourage innovation and leave users and investors alike frustrated with the results. Antitrust is always a blunt instrument and should be used only sparingly, if at all.</p><p>Rather than antitrust action, specific, targeted legislation would be far better and more efficient. As , you could start with the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which gave the then-nascent service providers broad protection from being sued for what their users say or do online. At the same time, they were also given enormous power to remove whatever they deemed to be \"objectionable\" content.</p><p>At a minimum, rewriting this law to force the big tech companies to take greater responsibility for the content that appears on their services \u2014 while at the same time removing their power to censor those whose political beliefs they disagree with \u2014 would seem to be a good start. Making Big Tech more accountable to its users and to society as a whole is a good idea\u00a0\u2014 but antitrust law is the wrong tool for the job.</p><p>RELATED:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-2480925</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PVT-36T1-DYTD-9175-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

Further, 'third parties' (such as ad tech companies) would be banned from collecting data from consumers who have activated do not track, with a limited exception for data analytics. Companies would also be prohibited from collecting data 'beyond what is indispensable to the companies' online services' as well as from discriminating against those users who have activated the do-not-track feature.Currently, consumers can ask not to be tracked via their browsers, but the request is rarely granted, as it lacks the force of law, Sen. </p><p>Hawley said.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would implement and regulate the do-not-track system, designate a do-not-track signal, and create a 'simple program' available on its public website that can be downloaded to any common connected device and sent to every site or service to indicate a consumer's desire not to be tracked. Fines of $1,000 per person per day for willful or reckless violations, with a minimum of $100,000, would be established by the bill.'Big tech companies collect incredible amounts of deeply personal, private data from people without giving them the option to meaningfully consent,' Sen. Hawley said in a statement about the proposed legislation. 'They have gotten incredibly rich by employing creepy surveillance tactics on their users, but too often the extent of this data extraction is only known after a tech company irresponsibly handles the data and leaks it all over the internet. The American people didn't sign up for this, so I'm introducing this legislation to finally give them control over their personal information online.'The do-not-track movement originally gained traction in 2010, when the FTC backed the idea in a staff report on consumer privacy[1]. Not long afterward, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) introduced the Do Not Track Me Online Act[2], and some browsers began offering a do-not-track option.But without repercussions for failing to honor consumer requests not to be tracked, and because there is disagreement about exactly how the feature should function (the World Wide Web Consortium Working Group on Tracking Preference Expression spent years working on a do-not-track program without success[3]), support waned and the movement petered out.To read the Do Not Track Act, click here[4].Why it matters: Could the Do Not Track Act find success in the current Congress? Privacy has been a popular topic for federal lawmakers in recent months, from facial recognition technology [5]to an expansion of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act[6], and even the ad industry has joined the push for a federal privacy bill[7]. Whether Sen. Hawley's bill can overcome party divisions to achieve passage remains to be seen, however.

Now it's plentiful, to put it mildly. What's scarce now? Attention, specifically your attention. And lots of people want to seize it, monetize it and commodify it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That was the topic of a program at Princeton University where I spoke last week, presented by Princeton's James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions. Princeton assigns its incoming freshman a book to read over the summer, and this year it was former Google executive James Williams' book, \"Stand out of our Light: Freedom and Resistance in the Attention Economy.\"</p><p>Williams, who has had second thoughts about his work at Google, thinks that many tech companies see their users as a form of prey - or maybe herd animals would be a better metaphor. Our attention is lured in via clickbait and algorithmic jiggery-pokery that's designed to keep us emotionally stirred and engaged (which mostly means angry) and then monetized to make tech companies rich.</p><p>This, Williams argues, has negative effects. Quoting poet Theodore Roethke he says, \"A mind too active is no mind at all.\" Yet social media and other tech platforms are designed - deliberately - to keep us in such a state, too busy reacting to the latest fad or outrage (it's usually outrage) to actually think.</p><p>Williams writes, \"The most visible and consequential form of compromised 'daylight' we see in the digital attention economy is the prevalence and centrality of moral outrage. Moral outrage consists of more than just anger: It also includes the impulse to judge, punish and shame someone you think has crossed a moral line. ... Moral outrage played a useful role earlier in human evolution when people lived in small nomadic groups: It enabled greater accountability, cooperation and in-group trust. However, the amplification of moral outrage on a societal, or even global, scale carries dire implications for the pursuit of politics worth having. In the past, when we lived in environments of information scarcity, all the world's moral transgressions weren't competing for our attention.\"</p><p>Williams adds, \"When children behave like this toward one another, we use words like 'cyberbullying' or 'harassment.' Yet when it's adults doing the shaming and threatening, we're inclined to shrug our shoulders, or even cheer it as 'karma,' 'sweet, sweet revenge,' or 'justice in the court of public opinion.' But it isn't any of those things. It's nothing more - and nothing less - than mob rule, a digital Salem.\"</p><p>He's right, of course. One needn't look far to see that today's social media seems to keep people angrier, more reactive and less thoughtful than we used to be. (And it's not as if people were paragons of reflective virtue beforehand.)</p><p>Indeed, the consensus at my program seemed to be that things are actually even worse than Williams says they are. And as Julie M. Albright argues in her new (and excellent) book, \"Left To Their Own Devices: How Digital Natives are Reshaping the American Dream,\" people are becoming increasingly tethered to their smartphones and increasingly untethered from each other and from the real world.</p><p>I suggest a number of societal and regulatory responses, including antitrust regulation of the Big Tech platforms and a new policy on the part of employers, etc., not to overreact to social media mobs, most of which disperse as fast as they formed. But what should we do as individuals?</p><p>I quit Twitter. For me at least, it was the most addictive yet also most unsatisfying social medium. If lushly illustrated sites like Instagram are the equivalent of a fancy Las Vegas casino with chandeliers, free champagne and elegant carpeting, Twitter is the social media equivalent of a row of gas station slot machines being repetitively worked by emaciated, chain-smoking senior citizens.</p><p>For other people, the most stress-inducing platform might be Instagram - everyone looks so beautiful and fit, even it if is partly due to Photoshop - or maybe Facebook - why are their kids doing so much better than mine? Or maybe it's Tinder, for reasons that should be obvious. These don't particularly bother me, because I don't compare myself with other people much, but others' experiences are different.</p><p>And that's my first piece of advice: Pick the social media platform that you find most stressful, and quit it. Don't quit social media or your phone cold turkey. Just quit one platform. If you're like me with Twitter, you'll be surprised how your stress level drops.</p><p>Next, start limiting your exposure to the others. Don't quit, just establish \"phone free\" time. (I put my phone on the charger at night and sit down with a book and a drink for some quiet time each night before bed.) Again, you'll probably be surprised how much you enjoy the quiet.</p><p>Limit your kids' exposure, too, if you have kids. One panelist noted that she doesn't let her 15-year-old daughter have a smartphone. Rather than resenting it, the daughter seems happy to miss out on all the social media drama among her schoolmates. Remember, what social media companies are selling is your attention. Why give them more of it than they deserve?</p><p>None of these steps will change the world. But they may change your life for the better. Sometimes, that's enough.</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.</p><p>\"The most visible and consequential form of compromised 'daylight' we see in the digital attention economy is the prevalence and centrality of moral outrage.\"</p><p>James Williams</p><p>Former Google executive</p><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds</p><p>Columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Glenn Harlan Reynolds</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Columnist</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PNWSJL-pen-1888730663</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PNWSJL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6R-RHD1-DYJJ-P0HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"958\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Pensacola News Journal All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pensacola News Journal (Florida)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 6, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>PRINCETON UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Or, if you are Singapore, you could just ban it.</p><p>On 8 May, the country's parliament passed the \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Bills-Supp/10-2019/Published/20190401?DocDate=20190401\">Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill</url>\". The law requires individuals and social media platforms to take down, or issue corrections alongside, content deemed false, and forces companies to remove bots and fake accounts. Those who fail to comply face hefty fines and up to 10 years in prison.</p><p>This might seem like a good thing. Research shows <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2163226-fake-news-travels-six-times-faster-than-the-truth-on-twitter/\">falsehoods travel faster online than the truth</url>, be they from anti-vaxxers, flat-Earthers or climate denialists. With bitter irony, social media platforms that once promised to help spread free speech are now a tool by which democracy is undermined.</p><p>Singapore isn't the first government to take action. Last year, France allowed judges to order the removal of fake content during election campaigns. The Canadian and UK governments have introduced policies to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2198947-uk-wants-to-curb-fake-news-and-cyberbullying-with-new-internet-laws/\">make social media companies more accountable</url> for misinformation.</p><p>But just what constitutes \"fake news\" is open to interpretation. Just take Donald Trump. For some, he was elected on the back of fake news, but he has since appropriated the term as a blanket criticism of news reporting he deems unflattering.</p><p>Singapore's record on free speech is poor. Reporters Without Borders <url normalizedValue=\"https://rsf.org/en/singapore\">ranks the country 151 out of 180</url> on press freedom, and the city state's Media Development Authority has previously clamped down on journalistic content. In 2014, film-maker Tan Pin Pin's documentary about political exiles, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">To Singapore, With Love</emphasis>, was banned for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2014/film/asia/to-singapore-with-love-banned-in-its-home-country-1201303250/\">what were deemed to be \"untruthful accounts\"</url> from interviewees.</p><p>The Singaporean government says the fake news ban won't be used to censor opinion or criticism, and will primarily be used against corporations, not individuals. But Rachael Jolley of the London-based Index on Censorship says the law could put individuals under pressure to back away from public interest research or investigative journalism. Researchers have raised <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WE5OttU3rdbEMOzKp7u7vHdI7qvuRG3qow1SbwWiznE/edit\">concerns that it could stifle academic discourse</url>, given that scientific progress hinges on challenging accepted truths.</p><p>In response, the country's education minister has said empirical research would be exempt so long as it isn't based on falsified data. It remains to be seen how the legislation will be enforced. Google, Facebook and Twitter all oppose it.</p><p>Preventing the spread of fake news means holding online platforms and publishers to account, just as print and broadcast media are for spreading falsehoods. Open democracies will continue to grapple with how to do that without compromising civil liberties. A blanket ban on information that a state deems to be false \u2013 and threatening punitive consequences including significant prison time for private individuals who contravene it \u2013 is the wrong way to go about it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSCI-mg24232321300</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSCI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W77-D461-JBPJ-70GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158275</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Scientist Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Scientist</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17543\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0262 4079</issn><volume>Vol. 242</volume><issueNumber>No. 3232</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 29, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

After all, what could be problematic about a short-form video app featuring a bunch of teenagers and 20-somethings doing choreographed dances, roller skating, hanging out in influencer mansions and cutting into photorealistic cakes?   The answer turns out to be: plenty.   In the past year, as it has become one of the most popular apps in the world, TikTok has accumulated many of the same problems that other large-scale social networks have. In addition to all the harmless Gen Z fun, there are TikTok conspiracy theories, TikTok misinformation and TikTok extremism. There are even activists using TikTok to influence our elections, including a network of teenagers and K-pop fans who claimed they used the app to sabotage President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last month by registering for tickets under false identities.   All of this might have been overlooked or forgiven, except for one fact: TikTok is owned by ByteDance, one of the largest tech companies in China.   TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership has become a subject of intense scrutiny by lawmakers, regulators and privacy activists in recent weeks. Trump is considering taking steps to ban the app in the United States. Companies including Wells Fargo and government agencies including the Transportation Security Administration have instructed their employees to delete TikTok from their work phones because of concerns that it could be used for surveillance or espionage.   In response to the mounting pressures, TikTok is wrapping itself in the American flag. The company has hired a small army of lobbyists in Washington, has brought in an American chief executive (former Disney executive Kevin Mayer) and is reportedly exploring selling a majority stake in the company to U.S. investors.   Jamie Favazza, a TikTok spokeswoman, said in a statement that in addition to the chief executive, the social network had an American as its chief information security officer and another as its head of safety.   \u201cWe\u2019ve tripled the number of employees in the U.S. since the start of 2020,\u201d she said, \u201cwith plans to hire 10,000 more people over the next three years in places like Texas, New York and Florida.\u201d   There are legitimate concerns about a Chinese-owned company capturing the attention and data of millions of Americans \u2014 especially one like ByteDance, which has a history of bending the knee to the country\u2019s ruling regime. Like all Chinese tech companies, ByteDance is required to abide by Chinese censorship laws, and it could be forced to give user data to the Chinese government under the country\u2019s national security law. Lawmakers have also raised concerns that TikTok could be used to promote pro-China propaganda to young Americans or censor politically sensitive content.   Favazza said TikTok stored U.S. user data in Virginia and Singapore. She added that the company\u2019s content moderation efforts were led by U.S.-based teams and not influenced by any foreign government, and that TikTok had not and would not give data to the Chinese government.   There are also reasons to be skeptical of the motives of TikTok\u2019s biggest critics. Many conservative politicians, including Trump, appear to care more about appearing tough on China than preventing potential harm to TikTok users. And Silicon Valley tech companies like Facebook, whose executives have warned of the dangers of a Chinese tech takeover, would surely like to see regulators kneecap one of their major competitors.   I\u2019ll be honest: I don\u2019t buy the argument that TikTok is an urgent threat to America\u2019s national security. Or, to put it more precisely, I am not convinced that TikTok is inherently more threatening to Americans than any other Chinese-owned app that collects data from Americans. If TikTok is a threat, so are WeChat, Alibaba and League of Legends, the popular video game, whose maker, Riot Games, is owned by China\u2019s Tencent.   And since banning every Chinese-owned tech company from operating in America wouldn\u2019t be possible without erecting our own version of China\u2019s Great Wall \u2014 a drastic step that would raise concerns about censorship and authoritarian control \u2014 we need to figure out a way for Chinese apps and U.S. democracy to coexist.   Here\u2019s an idea: Instead of banning TikTok or forcing ByteDance to sell it to Americans, why not make an example of it by turning it into the most transparent, privacy-protecting, ethically governed tech platform in existence?   As a foreign-owned app, TikTok is, in some ways, easier to regulate than a U.S. tech platform would be. (One way of regulating it, a national security review by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment of ByteDance\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly, TikTok\u2019s predecessor app, is already reportedly underway.) And there is plenty more the U.S. government could do to ensure that TikTok plays a responsible role in our information ecosystem without getting rid of it altogether. It could require the company to open-source key parts of its software, including the machine-learning algorithms that determine which posts users are shown. It could pressure TikTok to submit to regular audits of its data-collection practices and open up its internal content moderation guidelines for public comment.   As Kevin Xu, the author of Interconnected, a blog about U.S.-China relations, points out, ByteDance could impose strict internal controls to prevent its Chinese employees from accessing any of TikTok\u2019s systems and open-source those controls so that outsiders could verify the separation.   Samm Sacks, a cyberpolicy fellow at the centrist think tank New America, told me that some of the solutions being proposed for TikTok \u2014 such as selling itself to American investors \u2014 wouldn\u2019t address the core problems. A U.S.-owned TikTok could still legally sell data to third-party data brokers, for example, which could then feed it back to Chinese authorities.   Instead, Sacks said, the U.S. government should enact a strong federal privacy law that could protect TikTok users\u2019 data without banning the app altogether.   \u201cLet\u2019s solve for the problems at hand,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the concern is data security, the best way to secure the data is to put TikTok under the microscope and put in place really robust and enforceable rules about how they\u2019re using and retaining data.\u201d   Forcing TikTok to operate in a radically transparent way would go a long way toward assuaging Americans\u2019 fears. And it could become a test case for a new model of tech regulation that could improve the accountability and responsibility of not just Chinese-owned tech companies but American ones, too.   At its core, a lot of the TikTok fear factor comes down to a lack of information. In March, TikTok announced that it would open \u201ctransparency centers\u201d where independent auditors could examine its content moderation practices. The company has also begun releasing \u201ctransparency reports,\u201d similar to those issued by Facebook and Twitter, outlining the various takedown requests it gets from governments around the world.   But we still don\u2019t know how TikTok\u2019s algorithms are programmed or why they\u2019re showing which videos to which users. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s using the data it\u2019s collecting or how it makes and enforces its rules. We should know these things \u2014 not just about TikTok but about U.S. social media apps, too.   After all, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat are playing a huge role in the lives of millions of Americans, and for years, they have operated with a degree of secrecy that few other companies of their importance have been allowed. What little we understand about these platforms\u2019 inner workings is often learned years after the fact, gleaned from insider leaks or repentant former employees.   Some experts see TikTok\u2019s current predicament as a chance to change that.   \u201cI think TikTok is a bit of a red herring,\u201d Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s former chief security officer and a professor at Stanford University, told me in an interview.   Ultimately, Stamos said, the question of what to do about TikTok is secondary to the question of how multinational tech giants in general should be treated.   \u201cThis is a chance to come up with a thoughtful model of how to regulate companies that operate in both the U.S. and China, no matter their ownership,\u201d he said.   The debate over TikTok\u2019s fate, in other words, should really be a debate about how all of the big tech companies that entertain, inform and influence billions of people should operate and what should be required of them, whether they\u2019re based in China or Copenhagen, Denmark, or California.   If we can figure out how to handle TikTok \u2014 an app with a genuinely creative culture, and millions of American young people who love it \u2014 we\u2019ll have done a lot more than preserving a world-class time-waster. We\u2019ll have figured out a model for getting big tech platforms under control, after years of letting them run amok.  c.2020 The New York Times Company</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42720005005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-FV01-F07F-84HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1585\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Moneycontrol.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

After all, what could be problematic about a short-form video app featuring a bunch of teenagers and 20-somethings doing choreographed dances, roller skating, hanging out in influencer mansions and cutting into photorealistic cakes?  The answer turns out to be: plenty.  In the past year, as it has become one of the most popular apps in the world, TikTok has accumulated many of the same problems that other large-scale social networks have. In addition to all the harmless Gen Z fun, there are TikTok conspiracy theories, TikTok misinformation and TikTok extremism. There are even activists using TikTok to influence our elections, including a network of teenagers and K-pop fans who claimed they used the app to sabotage President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last month by registering for tickets under false identities.Read: All of this might have been overlooked or forgiven, except for one fact: TikTok is owned by ByteDance, one of the largest tech companies in China.  TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership has become a subject of intense scrutiny by lawmakers, regulators and privacy activists in recent weeks. Trump is considering taking steps to ban the app in the United States. Companies including Wells Fargo and government agencies including the Transportation Security Administration have instructed their employees to delete TikTok from their work phones because of concerns that it could be used for surveillance or espionage.  In response to the mounting pressures, TikTok is wrapping itself in the American flag. The company has hired a small army of lobbyists in Washington, has brought in an American chief executive (former Disney executive Kevin Mayer) and is reportedly exploring selling a majority stake in the company to US investors.Also Read: Jamie Favazza, a TikTok spokeswoman, said in a statement that in addition to the chief executive, the social network had an American as its chief information security officer and another as its head of safety.  \"We\u2019ve tripled the number of employees in the US since the start of 2020,\" she said, \"with plans to hire 10,000 more people over the next three years in places like Texas, New York and Florida.\"  There are legitimate concerns about a Chinese-owned company capturing the attention and data of millions of Americans \u2014 especially one like ByteDance, which has a history of bending the knee to the country\u2019s ruling regime. Like all Chinese tech companies, ByteDance is required to abide by Chinese censorship laws, and it could be forced to give user data to the Chinese government under the country\u2019s national security law. Lawmakers have also raised concerns that TikTok could be used to promote pro-China propaganda to young Americans or censor politically sensitive content.Also Read: Favazza said TikTok stored US user data in Virginia and Singapore. She added that the company\u2019s content moderation efforts were led by US-based teams and not influenced by any foreign government, and that TikTok had not and would not give data to the Chinese government.  There are also reasons to be skeptical of the motives of TikTok\u2019s biggest critics. Many conservative politicians, including Trump, appear to care more about appearing tough on China than preventing potential harm to TikTok users. And Silicon Valley tech companies like Facebook, whose executives have warned of the dangers of a Chinese tech takeover, would surely like to see regulators kneecap one of their major competitors.  I\u2019ll be honest: I don\u2019t buy the argument that TikTok is an urgent threat to America\u2019s national security. Or, to put it more precisely, I am not convinced that TikTok is inherently more threatening to Americans than any other Chinese-owned app that collects data from Americans. If TikTok is a threat, so are WeChat, Alibaba and League of Legends, the popular video game, whose maker, Riot Games, is owned by China\u2019s Tencent.  And since banning every Chinese-owned tech company from operating in America wouldn\u2019t be possible without erecting our own version of China\u2019s Great Wall \u2014 a drastic step that would raise concerns about censorship and authoritarian control \u2014 we need to figure out a way for Chinese apps and US democracy to coexist.Also Read: Here\u2019s an idea: Instead of banning TikTok or forcing ByteDance to sell it to Americans, why not make an example of it by turning it into the most transparent, privacy-protecting, ethically governed tech platform in existence?  As a foreign-owned app, TikTok is, in some ways, easier to regulate than a U.S. tech platform would be. (One way of regulating it, a national security review by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment of ByteDance\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly, TikTok\u2019s predecessor app, is already reportedly underway.) And there is plenty more the U.S. government could do to ensure that TikTok plays a responsible role in our information ecosystem without getting rid of it altogether. It could require the company to open-source key parts of its software, including the machine-learning algorithms that determine which posts users are shown. It could pressure TikTok to submit to regular audits of its data-collection practices and open up its internal content moderation guidelines for public comment.  As Kevin Xu, the author of Interconnected, a blog about U.S.-China relations, points out, ByteDance could impose strict internal controls to prevent its Chinese employees from accessing any of TikTok\u2019s systems and open-source those controls so that outsiders could verify the separation.Also Read: Samm Sacks, a cyberpolicy fellow at the centrist think tank New America, told me that some of the solutions being proposed for TikTok \u2014 such as selling itself to American investors \u2014 wouldn\u2019t address the core problems. A U.S.-owned TikTok could still legally sell data to third-party data brokers, for example, which could then feed it back to Chinese authorities.  Instead, Sacks said, the US government should enact a strong federal privacy law that could protect TikTok users\u2019 data without banning the app altogether.  \"Let\u2019s solve for the problems at hand,\" she said. \"If the concern is data security, the best way to secure the data is to put TikTok under the microscope and put in place really robust and enforceable rules about how they\u2019re using and retaining data.\"  Forcing TikTok to operate in a radically transparent way would go a long way toward assuaging Americans\u2019 fears. And it could become a test case for a new model of tech regulation that could improve the accountability and responsibility of not just Chinese-owned tech companies but American ones, too.Also Read: At its core, a lot of the TikTok fear factor comes down to a lack of information. In March, TikTok announced that it would open \"transparency centers\" where independent auditors could examine its content moderation practices. The company has also begun releasing \"transparency reports,\" similar to those issued by Facebook and Twitter, outlining the various takedown requests it gets from governments around the world.  But we still don\u2019t know how TikTok\u2019s algorithms are programmed or why they\u2019re showing which videos to which users. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s using the data it\u2019s collecting or how it makes and enforces its rules. We should know these things \u2014 not just about TikTok but about U.S. social media apps, too.  After all, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat are playing a huge role in the lives of millions of Americans, and for years, they have operated with a degree of secrecy that few other companies of their importance have been allowed. What little we understand about these platforms\u2019 inner workings is often learned years after the fact, gleaned from insider leaks or repentant former employees.Also Read: Some experts see TikTok\u2019s current predicament as a chance to change that.  \"I think TikTok is a bit of a red herring,\" Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s former chief security officer and a professor at Stanford University, told me in an interview.  Ultimately, Stamos said, the question of what to do about TikTok is secondary to the question of how multinational tech giants in general should be treated.  \"This is a chance to come up with a thoughtful model of how to regulate companies that operate in both the U.S. and China, no matter their ownership,\" he said.  The debate over TikTok\u2019s fate, in other words, should really be a debate about how all of the big tech companies that entertain, inform and influence billions of people should operate and what should be required of them, whether they\u2019re based in China or Copenhagen, Denmark, or California.  If we can figure out how to handle TikTok \u2014 an app with a genuinely creative culture, and millions of American young people who love it \u2014 we\u2019ll have done a lot more than preserving a world-class time-waster. We\u2019ll have figured out a model for getting big tech platforms under control, after years of letting them run amok.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42690717048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FK-2CR1-F07F-81G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Deccan Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

After all, what could be problematic about a short-form video app featuring a bunch of teenagers and 20-somethings doing choreographed dances, roller skating, hanging out in influencer mansions and cutting into photorealistic cakes?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The answer turns out to be: Plenty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the past year, as it has become one of the most popular apps in the world, TikTok has accumulated many of the same problems that other large-scale social networks have. In addition to all the harmless Gen Z fun, there are TikTok conspiracy theories, TikTok misinformation and TikTok extremism. There are even activists using TikTok to influence our elections, including a network of teenagers and K-pop fans who claimed they used the app to sabotage President Trump's rally in Tulsa, Okla., last month by registering for tickets under false identities.</p><p>All of this might have been overlooked or forgiven, except for one fact. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, one of the largest tech companies in China.</p><p>TikTok's Chinese ownership has become a subject of intense scrutiny by lawmakers, regulators and privacy activists in recent weeks. Mr. Trump is considering taking steps to ban the app in the United States. Companies including Wells Fargo, and government agencies including the Transportation Security Administration, have instructed their employees to delete TikTok from their work phones because of concerns that it could be used for surveillance or espionage.</p><p>In response to the mounting pressures, TikTok is wrapping itself in the American flag. The company has hired a small army of lobbyists in Washington, has brought in an American chief executive (the former Disney executive Kevin Mayer) and is reportedly exploring selling a majority stake in the company to American investors.</p><p>Jamie Favazza, a TikTok spokeswoman, said in a statement that in addition to the chief executive, the social network had an American as its chief information security officer and another as its head of safety.</p><p>\"We've tripled the number of employees in the U.S. since the start of 2020,\" she said, \"with plans to hire 10,000 more people over the next three years in places like Texas, New York and Florida.\"</p><p>There are legitimate concerns about a Chinese-owned company capturing the attention and data of millions of Americans - especially one like ByteDance, which has a history of bending the knee to the country's ruling regime. Like all Chinese tech companies, ByteDance is required to abide by Chinese censorship laws, and it could be forced to give user data to the Chinese government under the country's national security law. Lawmakers have also raised concerns that TikTok could be used to promote pro-China propaganda to young Americans, or censor politically sensitive content.</p><p>Ms. Favazza said TikTok stored American user data in Virginia and Singapore. She added that the company's content moderation efforts were led by U.S.-based teams and not influenced by any foreign government, and that TikTok had not and would not give data to the Chinese government.</p><p>There are also reasons to be skeptical of the motives of TikTok's biggest critics. Many conservative politicians, including Mr. Trump, appear to care more about appearing tough on China than preventing potential harm to TikTok users. And Silicon Valley tech companies like Facebook, whose executives have warned of the dangers of a Chinese tech takeover, would surely like to see regulators kneecap one of their major competitors.</p><p>I'll be honest: I don't buy the argument that TikTok is an urgent threat to America's national security. Or, to put it more precisely, I am not convinced that TikTok is inherently more threatening to Americans than any other Chinese-owned app that collects data from Americans. If TikTok is a threat, so are WeChat, Alibaba and League of Legends, the popular video game, whose maker, Riot Games, is owned by China's Tencent.</p><p>And since banning every Chinese-owned tech company from operating in America wouldn't be possible without erecting our own version of China's Great Firewall - a drastic step that would raise concerns about censorship and authoritarian control - we need to figure out a way for Chinese apps and American democracy to coexist.</p><p>Here's an idea: Instead of banning TikTok, or forcing ByteDance to sell it to Americans, why not make an example of it by turning it into the most transparent, privacy-protecting, ethically governed tech platform in existence?</p><p>As a foreign-owned app, TikTok is, in some ways, easier to regulate than an American tech platform would be. (One way of regulating it, a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of ByteDance's 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly, TikTok's predecessor app, is already reportedly underway.) And there is plenty more the U.S. government could do to ensure that TikTok plays a responsible role in our information ecosystem without getting rid of it altogether. It could require the company to open-source key parts of its software, including the machine-learning algorithms that determine which posts users are shown. It could pressure TikTok to submit to regular audits of its data-collection practices, and open up its internal content moderation guidelines for public comment. As Kevin Xu, the author of Interconnected, a blog about United States-China relations, points out, ByteDance could impose strict internal controls to prevent its Chinese employees from accessing any of TikTok's systems, and open-source those controls so that outsiders could verify the separation.</p><p>Samm Sacks, a cyberpolicy fellow at the centrist think tank New America, told me that some of the solutions being proposed for TikTok - such as selling itself to American investors - wouldn't address the core problems. An American-owned TikTok could still legally sell data to third-party data brokers, for example, which could then feed it back to the Chinese authorities.</p><p>Instead, Ms. Sacks said, the American government should enact a strong federal privacy law that could protect TikTok users' data without banning the app altogether.</p><p>\"Let's solve for the problems at hand,\" she said. \"If the concern is data security, the best way to secure the data is to put TikTok under the microscope, and put in place really robust and enforceable rules about how they're using and retaining data.\"</p><p>Forcing TikTok to operate in a radically transparent way would go a long way toward assuaging Americans' fears. And it could become a test case for a new model of tech regulation that could improve the accountability and responsibility of not just Chinese-owned tech companies but American ones, too.</p><p>At its core, a lot of the TikTok fear factor comes down to a lack of information. In March, TikTok announced that it would open \"transparency centers\" where independent auditors could examine its content moderation practices. The company has also begun releasing \"transparency reports,\" similar to those issued by Facebook and Twitter, outlining the various takedown requests it gets from governments around the world.</p><p>But we still don't know how TikTok's algorithms are programmed, or why they're showing which videos to which users. We don't know how it's using the data it's collecting, or how it makes and enforces its rules. We should know these things - not just about TikTok, but about American social media apps, too.</p><p>After all, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat are playing a huge role in the lives of millions of Americans, and for years, they have operated with a degree of secrecy that few other companies of their importance have been allowed. What little we understand about these platforms' inner workings is often learned years after the fact, gleaned from insider leaks or repentant former employees.</p><p>Some experts see TikTok's current predicament as a chance to change that.</p><p>\"I think TikTok is a bit of a red herring,\" Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer and a professor at Stanford University, told me in an interview. Ultimately, Mr. Stamos said, the question of what to do about TikTok is secondary to the question of how multinational tech giants in general should be treated.</p><p>\"This is a chance to come up with a thoughtful model of how to regulate companies that operate in both the U.S. and China, no matter their ownership,\" he said.</p><p>The debate over TikTok's fate, in other words, should really be a debate about how all of the big tech companies that entertain, inform and influence billions of people should operate, and what should be required of them, whether they're based in China or Copenhagen or California.</p><p>If we can figure out how to handle TikTok - an app with a genuinely creative culture, and millions of American young people who love it - we'll have done a lot more than preserving a world-class time-waster. We'll have figured out a model for getting big tech platforms under control, after years of letting them run amok.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007255464</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FX-7RS1-DYR7-C1XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

After all, what could be problematic about a short-form video app featuring a bunch of teenagers and 20-somethings doing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">choreographed dances</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">roller skating</url>, hanging out in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">influencer mansions</url> and cutting into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">photorealistic cakes</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The answer turns out to be: Plenty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the past year, as it has become one of the most popular apps in the world, TikTok has accumulated many of the same problems that other large-scale social networks have. In addition to all the harmless Gen Z fun, there are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">TikTok conspiracy theories</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">TikTok misinformation</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">TikTok extremism</url>. There are even activists using TikTok to influence our elections, including a network of teenagers and K-pop fans who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">claimed they used the app</url> to sabotage President Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa, Okla., last month by registering for tickets under false identities.</p><p>All of this might have been overlooked or forgiven, except for one fact. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">TikTok is owned by ByteDance</url>, one of the largest tech companies in China.</p><p>TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership has become a subject of intense scrutiny by lawmakers, regulators and privacy activists in recent weeks. Mr. Trump is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">considering</url> taking steps to ban the app in the United States. Companies including Wells Fargo, and government agencies including the Transportation Security Administration, have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">instructed their employees</url> to delete TikTok from their work phones because of concerns that it could be used for surveillance or espionage.</p><p>In response to the mounting pressures, TikTok is wrapping itself in the American flag. The company has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">hired a small army</url> of lobbyists in Washington, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">brought in</url> an American chief executive (the former Disney executive Kevin Mayer) and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">is reportedly exploring</url> selling a majority stake in the company to American investors.</p><p>Jamie Favazza, a TikTok spokeswoman, said in a statement that in addition to the chief executive, the social network had an American as its chief information security officer and another as its head of safety.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tripled the number of employees in the U.S. since the start of 2020,\u201d she said, \u201cwith plans to hire 10,000 more people over the next three years in places like Texas, New York and Florida.\u201d</p><p>There are legitimate concerns about a Chinese-owned company capturing the attention and data of millions of Americans \u2014 especially one like ByteDance, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">has a history</url> of bending the knee to the country\u2019s ruling regime. Like all Chinese tech companies, ByteDance is required to abide by Chinese censorship laws, and it could be forced to give user data to the Chinese government under the country\u2019s national security law. Lawmakers have also raised concerns that TikTok could be used to promote pro-China propaganda to young Americans, or censor politically sensitive content.</p><p>Ms. Favazza said TikTok stored American user data in Virginia and Singapore. She added that the company\u2019s content moderation efforts were led by U.S.-based teams and not influenced by any foreign government, and that TikTok had not and would not give data to the Chinese government.</p><p>There are also reasons to be skeptical of the motives of TikTok\u2019s biggest critics. Many conservative politicians, including Mr. Trump, appear to care more about appearing tough on China than preventing potential harm to TikTok users. And Silicon Valley tech companies like Facebook, whose executives <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">have warned</url> of the dangers of a Chinese tech takeover, would surely like to see regulators kneecap one of their major competitors.</p><p>I\u2019ll be honest: I don\u2019t buy the argument that TikTok is an urgent threat to America\u2019s national security. Or, to put it more precisely, I am not convinced that TikTok is inherently more threatening to Americans than any other Chinese-owned app that collects data from Americans. If TikTok is a threat, so are WeChat, Alibaba and League of Legends, the popular video game, whose maker, Riot Games, is owned by China\u2019s Tencent.</p><p>And since banning every Chinese-owned tech company from operating in America wouldn\u2019t be possible without erecting our own version of China\u2019s Great Firewall \u2014 a drastic step that would raise concerns about censorship and authoritarian control \u2014 we need to figure out a way for Chinese apps and American democracy to coexist.</p><p>Here\u2019s an idea: Instead of banning TikTok, or forcing ByteDance to sell it to Americans, why not make an example of it by turning it into the most transparent, privacy-protecting, ethically governed tech platform in existence?</p><p>As a foreign-owned app, TikTok is, in some ways, easier to regulate than an American tech platform would be. (One way of regulating it, a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States of ByteDance\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly, TikTok\u2019s predecessor app, is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">already reportedly underway</url>.)

An American-owned TikTok could still legally sell data to third-party data brokers, for example, which could then feed it back to the Chinese authorities.</p><p>Instead, Ms. Sacks said, the American government should enact a strong federal privacy law that could protect TikTok users\u2019 data without banning the app altogether.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s solve for the problems at hand,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the concern is data security, the best way to secure the data is to put TikTok under the microscope, and put in place really robust and enforceable rules about how they\u2019re using and retaining data.\u201d</p><p>Forcing TikTok to operate in a radically transparent way would go a long way toward assuaging Americans\u2019 fears. And it could become a test case for a new model of tech regulation that could improve the accountability and responsibility of not just Chinese-owned tech companies but American ones, too.</p><p>At its core, a lot of the TikTok fear factor comes down to a lack of information. In March, TikTok <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">announced</url> that it would open \u201ctransparency centers\u201d where independent auditors could examine its content moderation practices. The company has also begun <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">releasing</url> \u201ctransparency reports,\u201d similar to those issued by Facebook and Twitter, outlining the various takedown requests it gets from governments around the world.</p><p>But we still don\u2019t know how TikTok\u2019s algorithms are programmed, or why they\u2019re showing which videos to which users. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s using the data it\u2019s collecting, or how it makes and enforces its rules. We should know these things \u2014 not just about TikTok, but about American social media apps, too.</p><p>After all, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat are playing a huge role in the lives of millions of Americans, and for years, they have operated with a degree of secrecy that few other companies of their importance have been allowed. What little we understand about these platforms\u2019 inner workings is often learned years after the fact, gleaned from insider leaks or repentant former employees.</p><p>Some experts see TikTok\u2019s current predicament as a chance to change that.</p><p>\u201cI think TikTok is a bit of a red herring,\u201d Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s former chief security officer and a professor at Stanford University, told me in an interview. Ultimately, Mr. Stamos said, the question of what to do about TikTok is secondary to the question of how multinational tech giants in general should be treated.</p><p>\u201cThis is a chance to come up with a thoughtful model of how to regulate companies that operate in both the U.S. and China, no matter their ownership,\u201d he said.</p><p>The debate over TikTok\u2019s fate, in other words, should really be a debate about how all of the big tech companies that entertain, inform and influence billions of people should operate, and what should be required of them, whether they\u2019re based in China or Copenhagen or California.</p><p>If we can figure out how to handle TikTok \u2014 an app with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/technology/tiktok-underage-users-ftc.html\">genuinely creative culture</url>, and millions of American young people who love it \u2014 we\u2019ll have done a lot more than preserving a world-class time-waster. We\u2019ll have figured out a model for getting big tech platforms under control, after years of letting them run amok.</p><p>PHOTOS: TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership has become a subject of intense scrutiny.

That this quote, from Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerburg, focused on the supposed magnanimity of his for-profit company\u2014one of the richest and most powerful the world has ever known\u2014is only the first obvious problem with the quote. A more egregious one is the idea that Facebook has actually made the world more transparent, which is complete and utter nonsense. There is no more clear or cogent case against that kind of nonsense than Rana Foroohar's new book, Don't Be Evil. </p><p>The book takes its title from Google and its old, unofficial motto: When Google advised its employees not to be evil, it did so because it knew full well that evil was more than a powerful temptation. Evil was baked into the business plan.That statement is unequivocally at odds with the image Big Tech likes to portray. The industry has always painted its intentions in a utopian hue: to connect humanity, democratize access to information, to disrupt an old order of entrenched power and usher in a new, more equitable and innovative age. It is important to note that evil is not necessarily baked into the technology itself, but as Foroohar notes, into the predominant business plan of Big Tech\u2014in this case, Google. To understand why she would make such a contention, she brings us all the way back to the company's origin story. Larry Page and Sergei Brin developed Google in academia. It is a setting in which publishing one's findings is the norm and the expectation, but to the consternation of many at Stanford, they adhered to an entrepreneurial mindset and kept their research mostly private and proprietary for later profitization, even while relying on Stanford's massive computing power\u2014eventually commandeering the entire university's bandwidth after they burned through their own department's\u2014they needed to crawl the internet and build the PageRank algorithm that became the backbone of their search engine. Rather than an open source offering of search based on the internet's version of academic citations\u2014hyperlinks\u2014that you might expect of an institution of higher learning, Page and Brin took their idea to market and sold advertising around it. It is telling, however, that in one of the few papers they did publish in their time at Stanford, Page and Brin claimed that selling advertising would inherently corrupt the search engine. As they saw it:'We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased toward the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers. Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly insidious.'That is, of course, the business model they built their company's great wealth and power upon, and today, 'Ninety percent of the searches conducted everywhere on the planet are conducted on Google.' It is a business model that runs on what Foroohar calls the new 'oil' of the economy\u2014information, networks, and user data. And this is, increasingly, not just the business model of new technologies, but one that has bled into the rest of the new economy that tech companies sit on top of as the key power brokers and beneficiaries of the digital age. Foroohar explains how, since the rise of Big TechData is the fuel for growth in multiple industries, from manufacturing to retail to financial services. But unlike other assets, it doesn't necessarily fuel job growth, but rather, profit growth. And those profits tend to be diverted directly into executives' and shareholders' wallets. A 2018 J.P. Morgan study found that most of the money brought back to the United States from overseas bank accounts following the Trump tax cuts went directly into stock buybacks that enrich the wealthiest people and companies.  As others latch on to their surveillance capitalist business model through the 'internet of things,' Big Tech is entering traditional industries\u2014from finance and healthcare to entertainment and automobiles\u2014at break-neck pace:Big Tech, in other words, doesn't just want to become a leader in one sector. It wants to become the platform for everything, the operating system for your life.It is a business model that is predicated on protecting what they consider their own proprietary information, which\u2014in addition to algorithms, which we'll get to later\u2014is in fact the data generated by all of us and hoovered up by these companies. Rather than innovating themselves, they commodify and monetize the innovations of others, from the start-ups they swallow up to the artists (authors, musicians, filmmakers, etc.) whose copyright they infringe upon. They bully publishers to make their content available for free, while they reap the benefit in advertising dollars that come in from that content being accessible on their platforms. Traditional new outlets are left to scramble for the scraps as local newspapers are shuffled into the holdings of ever larger conglomerates or shutter their operations. One of the less investigated aspects of what Silicon Valley giants have been up to is the financial risk they are exposing themselves\u2014and all of us\u2014to in their quest for even higher profits, 'issuing their own cheap debt and using it to buy up higher-yielding debt of other firms.' It is akin to the financial engineering that big banks were engaged in in the lead up to the Great Recession. As she dug deeper into the issue, she found that Big Tech now simply has 'too much money chasing too little value.'In the search for both higher returns and for something to do with all their money, they were, in a way, acting like banks, taking large anchor positions in new corporate debt offerings and essentially underwriting them in the way that J.P. Morgan or Goldman Sachs might. But\u2014it's worth noting\u2014since such companies are not regulated like banks, it is difficult to track exactly what they are buying, how much they are buying, and what the market implications might be. [] In addition to being the most profitable and least regulated industry on the planet, the Silicon Valley giants had also become systemically crucial within the marketplace, holding assets that\u2014if sold or downgraded\u2014could topple the markets themselves. Hiding in plain sight was an amazing discovery: Big Tech, not big banks, was the new too-big-to-fail industry.'By giving people the power to share,' Zuckerberg says, 'we're making the world more transparent.' As Foroohar notes, this systemic risk generates enormous profits for those who own a share of these companies, but not much benefit for ordinary people who own a stake in the overall economy working for them, or looking to actually actually find work in an increasingly automated, intangible economy. What is often billed as the creation of a more dynamic economy is extremely dangerous territory for most workers.As Big Tech has risen, early stage venture capital and the number of start-ups they fund have plummeted\u2014taking the job creation that our economy depends on right along with them.As they stifle job creation, they also keep the wages of their own workers down by operating like cartels and agreeing to no-poaching agreements that keep employees in place. In a very real and crucial way, Big Tech keep us all in place\u2014in front of our screens\u2014by employing slot-machine-like mechanisms that keep us hooked on their platforms. Rather than 'giving people the power to share,' or empowering individuals to connect, they are fostering addiction and compelling users to give them not only their attention, but to hand over\u2014usually unwittingly\u2014their personal data. And if data is the new oil of the economy, as Foroohar makes the case it is, that is the most lucrative commodity of all.The race to capture consumer attention is the focal point of capitalism today. Of all the states of mind that companies and brands seek to induce, addiction is by far the most desirable.  We essentially carry history's most sophisticated sales device, armed with the most psychologically persuasive tools and algorithms, around in our pockets every day. Foroohar's last book, about the financial sector's activities leading up to the Great Recession, was called Makers and Takers, but the titles of her two books, in my mind, are interchangable. In many ways, as she explains throughout the book, the big questions about and existential threats posed by Big Tech is identical to that posed by the big banks of that era.Big Tech and big banks are also similar in the opacity and complexity of their operations. The algorithmic use of data is like the complex securitization done by the world's too-big-to-fail banks in the subprime era. Both are understood by industry experts who can use information asymmetry to hide risks and and the nefarious things that companies profit from, like dubious political ads.Just as deregulation of financial institutions was sold as an opportunity for innovation, but ended in increased concentration of wealth and risk, political clout and privilege, and a lack of any real accountability, 'the supposedly decentralized Internet economy has spawned a handful of ruthless oligopolies that have begun to use their power to undermine start-up growth, job creation, and labor markets.' And in a final twist of the knife, the disruption to labor markets and local economies that these firms (and too much business literature) have so lauded over the last decade has created an even greater need for the tax revenue these firms actively avoid providing. When called to hearings before the the world regulatory agencies and elected bodies, Big Tech CEOs (or, more likely, the legal teams and paid representatives they send in their place) like to pretend that this is all too complicated to be understood by us layfolk and our elected representatives, and we just have to trust them as they destroy jobs, get us addicted to their technology, and allow their platforms to be used for misinformation and propaganda campaigns\u2014that it is in fact good for us and humanity to let them do so. Facebook has said that if the government reins them in by, for example, thwarting in any way their attempts to launch their own digital currency, that the Chinese will beat us to it. It is, they propose, a matter of economic competition, of national security and pride. These statements come even as they and other Big Tech firms shift more and more of their profits into offshore tax havens, gutting the government of the resources it needs to fund the kind of innovative research that the entire digital economy is built upon\u2014the kind that their very own companies are built upon.Consider that $1 trillion in wealth has been parked offshore by America's largest, most IP rich firms. A trillion is no small sum. That's an eighteenth of America's annual gross domestic product, much of which was garnered from products and services made possible by core government-funded research and innovators. Yet U.S. citizens have not gotten their fair share of the investment because of tax offshoring.Foroohar doesn't just point out the many transgressions coming out of Silicon Valley, and the challenges the pose to us as a society, she also offers some potential solutions. And the first is the need for some clear, deep thinking on big issues.The shift from a tangible to an intangible economy\u2014one that makes the industrial revolution look relatively minor by comparison\u2014should trigger deep thinking about a host of big topics: digital property rights, trade regulations, privacy laws, antitrust rules, liability rules, free speech, the legality of surveillance, the implications of the algorithmic disruption of work and labor markets, the ethics of artificial intelligence, and the health and well-being of users of digital technology.  She suggests a 'national commission on the future of data and digital technology' to begin a public conversation and bipartisan debate on these very public. She argues that we should have the right to own our own data, and that it should perhaps be held in public institutions with public oversight rather than walled-off in private gardens available only for the richest and most powerful companies to profit off of. Critical to ensuring competition, we should revisit antitrust policy, and consider whether we should allow companies that own such powerful networks to compete directly on them, or whether they should be regulated more akin to a public utility or the railroad companies of the original Gilded Age.The internet is, of course, the railroad of our times\u2014an essential piece of public infrastructure over which much of the world's commerce and communication is now conducted.  One of my favorite ideas is that Big Tech firms should be required to submit their algorithms to an independent audit:I would like to see a digital consumer protection bureau, with tough rules around discrimination by algorithms, and a system for ensuring individuals can access and understand how their personal data is being used, as we can with credit scores today.Every page of Rana Foroohar's Don't Be Evil is a revelation, a reinforcement for the ideas that have made our economy sustainable in the past, and have been largely discarded in the disruption Silicon Valley has spread throughout our economy. 'Consumer welfare,' rather than citizen welfare, is our primary concern. We assume that rising share prices signify something good for the economy as a whole, as opposed to merely increasing wealth for those who own them. In this process, we've moved away from being a market economy to being a 'market society,' obsessed with profit maximization in every aspect of our lives. []Now, with the rise of the surveillance capitalism practiced by Big Tech, we ourselves are maximized for profit. [199]'By giving people the power to share,' says Zuckerberg,' we're making the world more transparent.' First of all, we have always had the power to share in our deliciously visceral, physical world and analog lives, in a way that enriched our lives rather than addicted us to technology. Not only do people hide behind anonymity and false identities online to spread misinformation and propaganda that makes the world decidedly less transparent, the rules are completely unknown. The 'pretty crazy idea,' as Zuckerberg put it, that Russia 'influenced the election in any way' by weaponizing Facebook and other tech platforms in now pretty well proven. As Faroohar notes:Apparently, they have no difficulty tracking every purchase we make, every ad we click on, and every news article we read, but to weed out articles from sketchy conspiracy websites, block anti-Semitic comments, or spot nerarious Russian bots is still too onerous a task.As is, apparently, allowing companies to change their Facebook profiles to their legal name. When trying to change our company name on Facebook after launching our new website and brand on August 19th, it took us three months of constant communication and requests\u2014from us and our customers\u2014to Facebook's algorithms to get it done, and even then we had to settle for the imperfect compromise of Porchlight Books their algorithms allowed rather than our easily verifiable legal name. I fear it's going to take much more than three months, and much more of the public's insistence and involvement, to get Big Tech to truly answer to all of us and meet the diverse interests of a pluralistic society rather than only their shareholders' interests. But, in a world distracted by shiny devices and viral disinformation, Rana Foroohar's Don't Be Evil helps us see more clearly what that could look like.

At the time, one of the things the duo believed to be evil was advertising. There's no reason to doubt their initial sincerity on this matter, but when the slogan was included in the prospectus for their company's flotation in 2004 one began to wonder what they were smoking. Were they really naive enough to believe that one could run a public company on a policy of ethical purity?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem was that purity requires a business model to support it and in 2000 the venture capitalists who had invested in Google pointed out to the boys that they didn't have one. So they invented a model that involved harvesting users' data to enable targeted advertising. And in the four years between that capitulation to reality and the flotation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/02/facebook-google-data-change-our-behaviour-democracy\">Google's revenues increased by nearly 3,590%</url>. That kind of money talks.</p><p>Rana Foroohar has adopted the Google mantra as the title for her masterful critique of the tech giants that now dominate our world. It's an apt choice because it captures one of the leitmotifs in the story of how these corporations came into being and grew to their current monstrous proportions, a journey that takes them from naive (and sometimes libertarian) beginnings to ruthless monopolistic dominance.</p><p>The great thing about her book is that it breaks the mesmerising spell that the tech giants seem to have cast upon governments, mass media and users everywhere. The beginning of wisdom in this matter is to realise that Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Uber et al are just very large corporations that do what corporations have done from time immemorial - exploit resources in order to generate profit. The only differences between them and the corporate giants of old are the nature of the resources they have appropriated and the grotesque profit margins that they obtain.</p><p>Foroohar is well qualified to tackle them. Her day job is that of the Financial Times's global business correspondent, so she occupies an influential perch. But she has also, in her time, worked on the fringes of the tech industry during the first internet bubble, the one that burst in 2000. So she's seen the dynamics of tech exuberance from the inside.</p><p>It is about the essential sociopathy of corporations, even those run by well-intentioned human beings</p><p>Basically, though, she comes across as a level-headed, informed and well-connected journalist: most people in the industry return her calls, even if they make sure to have a PR adviser listening in. Which is prudent, since Foroohar combines a polite manner with a high-powered crap-detector. She even emerged sane after spending several days in the company of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/02/facebook-google-data-change-our-behaviour-democracy\">Travis Kalanick</url>, the founder of Uber and a character whom James Joyce would have described as \"a caution to rattlesnakes\".</p><p>The overarching theme of Don't Be Evil is \"how big tech betrayed its founding principles\". This is a variation on a popular theme: how the people who founded these powerful corporations were basically high-IQ innocents who had their innocence and idealism knocked out of them by the exigencies of running capitalist organisations.</p><p>The \"don't be evil\" mantra is one example. Another is Mark Zuckerberg's tropes about \"connecting the world\" and creating \"communities\". Another is Steve Jobs's metaphor of the personal computer as \"a bicycle for the mind\". And of course there's the pervasive mysticism about using technology \"to change the world\". At no point in these vapourings does one ever find crude intentions of becoming insanely rich.</p><p>There is another way of reading this story, though. It is about the essential sociopathy of corporations, even those run by well-intentioned human beings. The reason some of the tech companies got such an easy ride in the public imagination is that their founders were not middle-aged bastards in homburg hats - think John D Rockefeller and JP Morgan - but young geeks in hoodies. Yet these same geeks supervised the growth of corporations that are as ruthless and socially irresponsible as Standard Oil was.</p><p>Which means that we now find ourselves faced with the same problem as faced the United States in the early 1900s: how to bring these behemoths under democratic control. And one of the most useful things about this book is that it does not fall into the trap of regarding all the tech giants as being the same. They're not and discriminating between them will be the key to regulating them. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/02/facebook-google-data-change-our-behaviour-democracy\">The business model of Facebook</url> and Google, for example, is radically different from those of Apple or Microsoft. And Amazon is a case apart.</p><p>The most startling thought that emerges from Don't Be Evil, though, is that big tech may have already become \"too big to fail\" because the companies have become systemically critical to our economies - for reasons that have little to do with technology. The risk comes from the colossal \"cash\" reserves that they have parked abroad in best tax-avoidance manner. Foroohar says that more than half of those stashes are denominated not in dollars, but in corporate bonds. And if anything should happen to the value of those, then it might be 2008 all over again, but without a safety net. So much for not being evil.</p><p> Don't Be Evil by Rana Foroohar is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320).

Particularly since Sir Nick Clegg, once the shining, soft-haired hope of sensible centrists, now works as a PR man for Facebook. His job is to explain to the unwashed masses why Facebook's refusal to do anything about false political adverts is actually good for democracy.</p><p>Few people believe that any more, but Clegg's sorry purchase as a useful idiot for the techno-disinformation complex is a vivid illustration of the way that, as this excellent book forensically demonstrates, the big Silicon Valley companies have succeeded in regulatory capture of the US branches of government that ought to oversee them, as well as more generally in 'cognitive capture' of the public conversation about the changes they are forcing upon the world.</p><p>Google is the single biggest political lobbyist in the US, but also sprays money at the academics who study internet law and culture, and who - as though coincidentally - come up with theories friendly to Google. Google and its corporate comrades have also, Rana Foroohar shows, succeeded in weakening patent-protection laws, which is good for them - because their business depends on copying the ideas of new startups - but bad for everyone else. Many experts quoted here say the result has been to stifle innovation, not only in the computer industry but in fields such as biotech as well.</p><p>Indeed, though bookshop shelves are groaning with excitable trade books about how the pace of change in modern life is unprecedented, very little has changed technologically in more than a decade. Smartphones are still basically the same devices as the first iPhone in 2007, and Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon are still the entrenched incumbents, while newer tech 'unicorns' are falling by the wayside: witness the abandoned IPO this summer of the office-rental company WeWork.</p><p>The dominance of these few companies, Foroohar shows in her engaging narrative, has been bought with utter ruthlessness and a deep understanding of both the 'network effect' (whereby the more users a service attracts, the more attractive it becomes to even more users), and the psychology of addiction, employing behavioural-science research to keep our mouths clamped to the troll firehose.</p><p>As a global business columnist for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FT</emphasis>, Foroohar is well placed to deepen her account with amusing personal stories and tasty gossip. She was once interviewed for a communications job at Google, which - marvellously - turned out to involve following one of the founders around and turning his thoughts into documents that could be communicated to the rest of the company. And she cites many sources, both named and anonymous, with stories about being screwed over by Big Tech, or about witnessing its leaders' majestically entitled tech-bro behaviour. (Google's co-founder Sergey Brin, when challenged about sleeping with his female engineers, responded: 'Why shouldn't I? They're my employees.') 'Don't be evil', of course, used to be the company motto of Google - until it realised that evil, in the form of relentless surveillance and targeted adverts, makes more money.</p><p>Foroohar has been around long enough to remember the first dot-com bust in 2000, and she makes a fascinating case here that the next global financial crisis - we are, after all, due another one now, more than a decade after 2008 - will be caused by Big Tech itself. Importantly, she points out that the celebrated 'cash piles' the companies are sitting on (Apple's is $200 billion) are actually held in the form of bonds, so the tiny tech oligopoly has tremendous power to move the markets - or crash them, if things start to go south.</p><p>Who, then, shall stand up to these behemoths? In this story, the only entity on the planet with both the power and the will to do so is the European Union, which for that reason is becoming more attractive to new startups in tech and science generally. Foroohar ends her book with some sensible regulatory suggestions, such as taxing tech revenues at source (rather than allowing profits to be repatriated to havens), and perhaps instituting a global 'digital tax'.</p><p>In the meantime, Big Tech's appetite for evil is so impressive that several more scandals have broken since this book went to press. Google has been secretly amassing the detailed health records of millions of Americans, which might especially alarm users of Fitbit fitness trackers, since Google has also announced its intention to buy that company. Meanwhile, it was recently discovered that Facebook has been accused of watching users through their own smartphone cameras while they browse the website - and if you think that was a bug or an accident, then I have some old shares in Pets.com that you might want to invest in.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPECTR-10876121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPECTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRG-C2V1-F0JS-N00S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Spectator Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Spectator</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48251\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 14, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In March footage emerged of a hulking, Amazon-branded zeppelin flying slowly over a Japanese fishing village while disgorging an army of drones that proceeded to swarm menacingly about the sky. Here at last was confirmation of our worst fears about the Darth Vader-ish ambitions of Jeff Bezos (it's impossible to watch the video without hearing the </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                   Imperial March                   </p><p> from</p><p>                    Star Wars                   </p><p> playing in the back of your mind). \"What the last human alive will see,\" one viewer suggested.</p><p>The video turned out to be fake: a CGI mock-up based loosely on the company's (as yet unrealised) plans to develop an \"aerial fulfilment centre\". But it was a believable symbol of the imperial power of Silicon Valley. Rana Foroohar's </p><p>                   Don't Be Evil                    </p><p>is a readable and well-marshalled indictment of the sins of these new corporate empires.</p><p>Previous anti-tech polemics, such as Shoshana Zuboff's </p><p>                   The Age of Surveillance Capitalism                   The Age of Surveillance Capitalism                                      </p><p>or Franklin Foer's </p><p>                   World Without Mind                   World Without Mind                   </p><p>, have looked at the way that Silicon Valley is changing our minds and our culture. If Foroohar's book has a theme, it's the sheer, blimp-like vastness of the great tech monopolies. Google represents 88 per cent of the US search engine market and 95 per cent of all mobile searches.</p><p>But Google is not just a search engine: it makes smartphones, self-driving cars and virtual reality headsets. Google's architects design \"smart cities\" and its engineers have developed the world's first quantum computer. Whenever Facebook feels threatened by a competitor Mark Zuckerberg simply buys it: Instagram, WhatsApp, the virtual reality company Oculus. Google does the same: in the past decade it has purchased 120 companies.</p><p>This is colonial capitalism and Bezos, Amazon's founder, is its Cecil Rhodes. Even the smallest commercial statelets and tribes must be crushed. In the early 2000s an aluminium laptop stand produced by a company called Rain Design became a surprise bestseller on Amazon. Shortly after, Amazon released its own nearly identical stand for half the price. Sales of the Rain Design model crashed. Amazon's critics allege that the company trawls the mass of data generated by its website to predict which products are about to become successful before producing copies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon's fleet of \"thousands of container ships, planes and drones\" is rolling into the territory of mail companies such as UPS and FedEx. Former employees say that the company plans to supplant \"all delivery services\". Already, Amazon has commandeered a third of the cloud's global capacity to keep track of its vast logistics operations.</p><p>The car industry will be the next to succumb to tech imperialism. In self-drive vehicles software and content will be much more important than hardware. Why care about the marque of a car you're not even driving? Flashy Google cars, which will sync your apps and stream music, films, games and news into the vehicle, will be far more desirable than traditional brands. And who wants an operating system designed by Skoda?</p><p>Like the Victorian imperialists of the 1880s, the big-tech philosophy is grab now, explain later. That's why Google Street View cameras can take a picture of your house, match it to your address and, courtesy of the small print, use the data to sell more ads. And it's why Google never bothered to ask publishers if they could smash millions of copyright agreements in their quest to scan every book published and instead relied on fair-use exemptions.</p><p>Resistance is futile. The tech companies colonise minds too - a strategy they politely call \"social and intellectual capture\". In practice this means paying for mountains of sympathetic academic research, including hundreds of papers arguing against regulatory control. Academics on the Google gravy train can earn anywhere from $5,000 to $400,000 in funding. Sometimes almost all the academics in a field are hoovered up by tech companies. Data is the lifeblood of Silicon Valley, but there are no reliable estimates of how much it is worth because Google employs most of the world's top data scientists. By tempting so many of the world's academics into gilded cages, Google has made it difficult to rally an intellectual assault on its business model.</p><p>Big tech lobbyists have helped to bring about an overhaul in the American patent system, which makes patents harder to secure and harder to defend - especially for companies without huge legal and lobbying power. That means that there's less incentive for small tech businesses to innovate and for venture capitalists to invest in them: why bother if a tech giant will immediately muscle in on your idea? The result is a decline in innovation that may prove dangerous to the future of the American economy. That's not to mention the \"dearth of startups, declining job creation, falling demand\" and other consequences of the monopolistic business model.</p><p>Silicon Valley sharks are in danger of accidentally draining the economy in which they swim. Foroohar, a global business columnist at the </p><p>                   Financial Times                   </p><p>, notes that Facebook and Google have destroyed the business model of newspapers so effectively that they find themselves in the ironic position of running out of content to monetise. National newspaper print circulations are in a death spiral and more than 300 local newspapers in the UK have closed since 2007. This self-inflicted crisis means that the companies have to fund some local news out of their own pockets.</p><p>On a grander scale Foroohar believes that tech companies could precipitate the next financial crisis. Apple and Google have vast cash reserves and nothing to spend the money on. So they have started acting like banks, issuing cheap debt and using the money to buy higher-yielding corporate debt - the sort of thing that JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs might do. But the tech world is not nearly as closely regulated as banking. The vast sums of money held overseas by tech companies in the form of corporate bonds could \"if sold or downgraded . . . topple the markets themselves\".</p><p>The world has never witnessed monopolies this powerful or this diverse. Like many commentators, Foroohar has concluded that the tech giants must be broken up, like the rail monopolies of America's Gilded Age. Whether this is possible in the face of the political, commercial, legal and intellectual power of Silicon Valley remains to be seen. I'm not optimistic. Bezos's next ambition is to conquer space.

Since the iPhone in 2007, arguably, the Valley has offered minor tweaks to our digital lives, most of them as irritating as they are useful.</p><p>I may personally find the idea of reverting to 2009 buffering speeds and yellow cab service pretty unpalatable, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/rana-foroohar\"> Rana Foroohar</url>, a columnist and associate editor of the Financial Times, is one of those sceptical about Silicon Valley\u2019s innovation model \u2014 not to mention about its culture, ethics, business practices, and all-powerful engineers, many of whom are \u201cwhite men under forty\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009whose lack of social skills would put them \u2018on the spectrum\u2019.\u201d They have, she argues, taken hostage our economy, our politics and our minds: \u201cI don\u2019t think of the tech executives as criminals,\u201d she says. \u201cI think of them as anti-heroes whose outsized ambitions were tinged with folly, greed and naivet\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>In her previous book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Makers and Takers: How Wall Street Destroyed Main Street</emphasis>, Foroohar blamed banks and financiers for gutting the economy. The balance sheet shenanigans of the \u201ctakers\u201d were robbing the people who ran proper businesses, the \u201cmakers\u201d.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Don\u2019t Be Evil</emphasis>, she compares the moral void in finance that led to the financial crisis to what she now sees in Big Tech. She predicts similar doom. Banks grew without regard for consumers or society, by co-opting politicians and by becoming essentially self-regulated. Big Tech has followed suit. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is now the single largest corporate lobbyist in Washington, and collectively Big Tech is second only to Big Pharma as a lobbying group.</p><p>Foroohar reports that the industry has fought to protect interests that boost its profits but hurt society. They have made it harder to secure patents, to the detriment of small companies and individual inventors. They have defended their right to pay tax in overseas, low-tax jurisdictions, rather than in the markets where they make their money. And platforms such as Google and Facebook have shirked responsibility for the content and actions of their users.</p><p>The result of all this is that monopolies thrive, innovation is strangled, and false information and vicious content befouls the public and political spheres, while the tech groups\u2019 founders, managers and shareholders get richer.</p><p>While today\u2019s tech markets are vastly more evolved than they were in 2000, Foroohar warns that there are similarities. Uber\u2019s poor IPO performance and WeWork\u2019s disastrous attempt to go public may support her case. But the long, sustained boom in tech has created such wealth that it is hard to imagine the ecosystem crashing the way it did in 2001.</p><p>More dangerous may be a political and cultural backlash. Big Tech, Foroohar writes, echoing arguments from the likes of Senator Elizabeth Warren, threatens more jobs than it creates, and widens economic inequality. She cites AI expert Vivienne Ming, who warns that \u201cthe global professional middle class is about to be blindsided.\u201d In a recent test, an AI and human lawyers were given non-disclosure agreements to study. The AI found 95 per cent of the loopholes in 22 seconds; the group of humans just 88 per cent in 90 minutes.</p><p>Foroohar devotes a final chapter to potential solutions to the problem of tech company evil. She proposes a bipartisan national commission on the future of data and digital technology which could report to the US Congress. These wise men and women could consider breaking up the tech groups, to separate their utility-like platforms from their commercial activities. They would try to price the personal data currently harvested for free by tech companies, and look at how they pay tax.</p><p>We are not all built to hustle and disrupt like twenty-something tech titans, and Foroohar would also like to see a Digital New Deal which considers the broad, human costs of artificial intelligence, big data and automation. The screens hurt our eyes, and the ceaseless change runs us ragged.

Recently, however, many discussions about Buffett have centred around a single question: \"Has Warren lost his touch?\" Where do these doubts come from? Well, Berkshire Hathaway, like many \"value investors,\" has slightly underperformed the S&amp;;P 500 on a total-return basis over the past decade. In particular, the critics point out, the stock's performance this year has been lacklustre. Berkshire shares are down more than 14 per cent so far in 2020, wiping out more than US$80 billion in market value, while Big Tech growth names such as Amazon have seen their valuations soar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While it is easy to be blinded by the stock's recent underperformance, it's important to remind ourselves that since 1965, Buffett has produced an average annual return of 20.5 per cent. There are only a handful of investors in the world that have been able to generate such returns. Even more spectacular were the returns of his Buffett Partnership, which compounded at an amazing 29 per cent from 1957 to 1966. Charlie Munger, his partner for decades, ran a partnership from 1962 to 1975 where his investors compounded at almost 19 per cent.</p><p>Unfortunately, I would wager that most uninitiated investors don't have a long-term perspective and likely never will. Berkshire's loudest critics include characters such as Dave Portnoy from Barstool Sports, who slammed Buffett for unloading airline stocks as the coronavirus epidemic exploded on the world scene, calling him a \"washed up investor who's no longer relevant.\"</p><p>My comeback is a quote from Lord Keynes, who said, \"When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?\" The facts for the airlines changed dramatically with the arrival of the coronavirus. No one saw this global pandemic coming, including Buffett. And no one knows what will happen to the airlines in terms of survival. Thus, Buffett changed his mind because he saw nothing but uncertainty going forward. In my opinion, Buffett made a difficult but necessary reversal.</p><p>Shane Parrish from Farnam Street, a value-based investment research firm, summed up Buffett's strategy: \"You have to be willing to look like an idiot in the short term to get the best longterm results. I'd suggest that because the future has become increasingly uncertain, he's preparing for the widest range of possible futures.\"</p><p>People also questioned Buffett's intellect back in the late 1990s when he refused to participate in the tech bubble that finally burst in 2000. I remember being at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings back in the late 1990s with investors trying to pressure Buffett to buy tech stocks.</p><p>After hearing question after question on the topic, framed in slightly different ways, Buffett had a rare moment of frustration - almost anger. But he always delivered the same answer: He had absolutely no interest in playing in that sandbox.</p><p>It should be noted that there are similarities between then and now. Day trading was in full swing; growth stocks went to the moon; value stocks languished. In late 1999, as Berkshire was underperforming the S&amp;;P 500, Barron's magazine published an article entitled \"What's Wrong, Warren?\" and proclaimed that he might have been losing his magic touch. \"To be blunt, Buffett, who turns 70 in 2000, is viewed by an increasing number of investors as too conservative, even pass\u00e9,\" the article said. \"Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and chief executive, may be the world's greatest investor, but he hasn't anticipated or capitalized on the boom in technology stocks in the past few years.\"</p><p>So why do we own this so-called has-been company and its 89-year-old manager? Well, there are a few great reasons.</p><p>First, the company is generating about US$2 billion a month in excess cash, a staggering number.</p><p>Second, the company recently bought Dominion Energy for about US$9.7 billion, expanding its significant energy portfolio. On a simplified basis, this purchase price only amounts to about five months of current cash flow.</p><p>Third, Berkshire has plenty of dry powder remaining. Prior to the purchase earlier this month, the company was sitting on a mountain of cash - around US$137 billion. If you are an indexer and want to buy stocks, this seems crazy. But just like he poured assets into cheap stocks in 1974 and again in 2000 when the market collapsed about 40 per cent, as well as during the 50-per-cent collapse in the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, we believe that cash will be deployed once Buffett is able to find a few large bargains.</p><p>Fourth, the stock is cheap.</p><p>Berkshire is now trading near book value, something we have not seen since the financial crisis. This is likely as cheap as it gets for a company that generated more than US$20 billion of free cash flow in 2019.</p><p>The stock is especially cheap when you factor in that almost the entire gain in the market value of Berkshire since the S&amp;;P 500 bottomed in March can be attributed to the extraordinary gain derived from its Apple Inc. holding. Taking out the appreciation of its Apple shares, the value of BRK is virtually unchanged since mid-March, while the market has rallied nearly 50 per cent.</p><p>Fifth, based on regulatory filings in recent months, it appears that Berkshire has bought back a significant amount of stock in the past two to three months.</p><p>Lastly, the company remains predictable, and focused on capital preservation. Buffett, and those who follow him in managing Berkshire, will continue on the path that Warren and Charlie have laid out: find companies with sustainable competitive advantages, repeatable earnings models, room for growth, significant free cash flow, and great management teams at the helm. And if they can't find such companies at attractive prices, they will wait.</p><p>When the crowd starts thinking that one of the greatest minds in the world has lost it, all you have to do is look back at his historical successes, which include his non-actions, as he waits for exactly what he wants.</p><p>What's required for investors, which Buffett has demonstrated repeatedly, is the virtue of patience. As noted above, every time, that has rewarded shareholders handsomely. We believe he (and us as well) will have that wonderful opportunity.

Recently, however, many discussions about Buffett have centred around a single question: \"Has Warren lost his touch?\" Where do these doubts come from? Well, Berkshire Hathaway, like many \"value investors,\" has slightly underperformed the S&amp;;P 500 on a total-return basis over the past decade. In particular, the critics point out, the stock's performance this year has been lacklustre. Berkshire shares are down more than 14 per cent so far in 2020, wiping out more than US$80 billion in market value, while Big Tech growth names such as Amazon have seen their valuations soar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While it is easy to be blinded by the stock's recent underperformance, it's important to remind ourselves that since 1965, Buffett has produced an average annual return of 20.5 per cent. There are only a handful of investors in the world that have been able to generate such returns. Even more spectacular were the returns of his Buffett Partnership, which compounded at an amazing 29 per cent from 1957 to 1966. Charlie Munger, his partner for decades, ran a partnership from 1962 to 1975 where his investors compounded at almost 19 per cent.</p><p>Unfortunately, I would wager that most uninitiated investors don't have a long-term perspective and likely never will. Berkshire's loudest critics include characters such as Dave Portnoy from Barstool Sports, who slammed Buffett for unloading airline stocks as the coronavirus epidemic exploded on the world scene, calling him a \"washed up investor who's no longer relevant.\"</p><p>My comeback is a quote from Lord Keynes, who said, \"When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?\" The facts for the airlines changed dramatically with the arrival of the coronavirus. No one saw this global pandemic coming, including Buffett. And no one knows what will happen to the airlines in terms of survival. Thus, Buffett changed his mind because he saw nothing but uncertainty going forward. In my opinion, Buffett made a difficult but necessary reversal.</p><p>Shane Parrish from Farnam Street, a value-based investment research firm, summed up Buffett's strategy: \"You have to be willing to look like an idiot in the short term to get the best longterm results. I'd suggest that because the future has become increasingly uncertain, he's preparing for the widest range of possible futures.\"</p><p>People also questioned Buffett's intellect back in the late 1990s when he refused to participate in the tech bubble that finally burst in 2000. I remember being at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings back in the late 1990s with investors trying to pressure Buffett to buy tech stocks.</p><p>After hearing question after question on the topic, framed in slightly different ways, Buffett had a rare moment of frustration - almost anger. But he always delivered the same answer: He had absolutely no interest in playing in that sandbox.</p><p>It should be noted that there are similarities between then and now. Day trading was in full swing; growth stocks went to the moon; value stocks languished. In late 1999, as Berkshire was underperforming the S&amp;;P 500, Barron's magazine published an article entitled \"What's Wrong, Warren?\" and proclaimed that he might have been losing his magic touch. \"To be blunt, Buffett, who turns 70 in 2000, is viewed by an increasing number of investors as too conservative, even pass\u00e9,\" the article said. \"Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and chief executive, may be the world's greatest investor, but he hasn't anticipated or capitalized on the boom in technology stocks in the past few years.\"</p><p>So why do we own this so-called has-been company and its 89-year-old manager? Well, there are a few great reasons.</p><p>First, the company is generating about US$2 billion a month in excess cash, a staggering number.</p><p>Second, the company recently bought Dominion Energy for about US$9.7 billion, expanding its significant energy portfolio. On a simplified basis, this purchase price only amounts to about five months of current cash flow.</p><p>Third, Berkshire has plenty of dry powder remaining. Prior to the purchase earlier this month, the company was sitting on a mountain of cash - around US$137 billion. If you are an indexer and want to buy stocks, this seems crazy. But just like he poured assets into cheap stocks in 1974 and again in 2000 when the market collapsed about 40 per cent, as well as during the 50-per-cent collapse in the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, we believe that cash will be deployed once Buffett is able to find a few large bargains.</p><p>Fourth, the stock is cheap.</p><p>Berkshire is now trading near book value, something we have not seen since the financial crisis. This is likely as cheap as it gets for a company that generated more than US$20 billion of free cash flow in 2019.</p><p>The stock is especially cheap when you factor in that almost the entire gain in the market value of Berkshire since the S&amp;;P 500 bottomed in March can be attributed to the extraordinary gain derived from its Apple Inc. holding. Taking out the appreciation of its Apple shares, the value of BRK is virtually unchanged since mid-March, while the market has rallied nearly 50 per cent.</p><p>Fifth, based on regulatory filings in recent months, it appears that Berkshire has bought back a significant amount of stock in the past two to three months.</p><p>Lastly, the company remains predictable, and focused on capital preservation. Buffett, and those who follow him in managing Berkshire, will continue on the path that Warren and Charlie have laid out: find companies with sustainable competitive advantages, repeatable earnings models, room for growth, significant free cash flow, and great management teams at the helm. And if they can't find such companies at attractive prices, they will wait.</p><p>When the crowd starts thinking that one of the greatest minds in the world has lost it, all you have to do is look back at his historical successes, which include his non-actions, as he waits for exactly what he wants.</p><p>What's required for investors, which Buffett has demonstrated repeatedly, is the virtue of patience. As noted above, every time, that has rewarded shareholders handsomely. We believe he (and us as well) will have that wonderful opportunity.

Recently, however, many discussions about Buffett have centered around a single question: \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Has Warren lost his touch?\" Where do these doubts come from? Well, Berkshire Hathaway, like many \"value investors,\" has slightly underperformed the S&amp;;P 500 on a total-return basis over the past decade. In particular, the critics point out, the stock's performance this year has been lacklustre. Berkshire shares are down more than 14 per cent so far in 2020, wiping out more than US$80 billion in market value, while big tech growth names such as Amazon have seen their valuations soar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While it is easy to be blinded by the stock's recent underperformance, it's important to remind ourselves that since 1965, Buffett has produced an average annual return of 20.5 per cent. There are only a handful of investors in the world that have been able to generate such returns.</p><p>Even more spectacular were the returns of his Buffett Partnership, which compounded at an amazing 29 per cent from 1957 to 1966. Charlie Munger, his partner for decades, ran a partnership from 1962 to 1975 where his investors compounded at almost 19 per cent.</p><p>Unfortunately, I would wager that most uninitiated investors don't have a long-term perspective and likely never will. Berkshire's loudest critics include characters such as Dave Portnoy from Barstool Sports, who slammed Buffett for unloading airline stocks as the coronavirus epidemic exploded on the world scene.</p><p>My comeback is a quote from Lord Keynes, who said, \"When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?\" The facts for the airlines changed dramatically with the arrival of the coronavirus. No one saw this global pandemic coming, including Buffett. And no one knows what will happen to the airlines in terms of survival. Thus, Buffett changed his mind because he saw nothing but uncertainty going forward. In my opinion, Buffett made a difficult but necessary reversal.</p><p>Shane Parrish from Farnam Street, a value-based investment research firm, summed up Buffett's strategy: \"You have to be willing to look like an idiot in the short term to get the best longterm results. I'd suggest that because the future has become increasingly uncertain, he's preparing for the widest range of possible futures.\"</p><p>People also questioned Buffett's intellect back in the late 1990s when he refused to participate in the tech bubble that finally burst in 2000.</p><p>I remember being at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings back in the late 1990s with investors trying to pressure Buffett to buy tech stocks.</p><p>After hearing question after question on the topic, framed in slightly different ways, Buffett had a rare moment of frustration - almost anger. But he always delivered the same answer: he had absolutely no interest in playing in that sandbox.</p><p>It should be noted that there are similarities between then and now. Day trading was in full swing; growth stocks went to the moon; value stocks languished. In late 1999, as Berkshire was underperforming the S&amp;;P 500, Barron's magazine published an article entitled \"What's Wrong, Warren?\" and proclaimed that he might have been losing his magic touch. \"To be blunt, Buffett, who turns 70 in 2000, is viewed by an increasing number of investors as too conservative, even pass\u00e9,\" the article said. \"Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and chief executive, may be the world's greatest investor, but he hasn't anticipated or capitalized on the boom in technology stocks in the past few years.\"</p><p>So why do we own this so-called has-been company and its 89-yearold manager? Well there are a few great reasons.</p><p>First, the company is generating about US$2 billion a month in excess cash, a staggering number.</p><p>Second, the company recently bought Dominion Energy for about US$9.7 billion, expanding its significant energy portfolio. On a simplified basis, this purchase price only amounts to about five months of current cash flow.</p><p>Third, Berkshire has plenty of dry powder remaining. Prior to the purchase earlier this month, the company was sitting on a mountain of cash-around US$137 billion. If you are an indexer and want to buy stocks, this seems crazy. But just like he poured assets into cheap stocks in 1974 and again in 2000 when the market collapsed about 40 per cent, as well as during the 50 per cent collapse in the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, we believe that cash will be deployed once Buffett is able to find a few large bargains.</p><p>Fourth, the stock is cheap.</p><p>Berkshire is now trading near book value, something we have not seen since the financial crisis. This is likely as cheap as it gets for a company which generated more than US$20 Billion of free cash flow in 2019.</p><p>The stock is especially cheap when you factor in that almost the entire gain in the market value of Berkshire since the S&amp;;P 500 bottomed in March can be attributed to the extraordinary gain derived from its Apple Inc. holding. Taking out the appreciation of its Apple shares, the value of BRK is virtually unchanged since mid-March, while the market has rallied nearly 50 per cent.</p><p>Fifth, based on regulatory filings in recent months, it appears that Berkshire has bought back a significant amount of stock in the past two to three months.</p><p>Lastly, the company remains predictable, and focused on capital preservation. Buffett, and those that follow him in managing Berkshire, will continue on the path that Warren and Charlie have laid out: find companies with sustainable competitive advantages, repeatable earnings models, room for growth, significant free cash flow, and great management teams at the helm. And if they can't find such companies at attractive prices, they will wait.</p><p>When the crowd starts thinking that one of the greatest minds in the world has lost it, all you have to do is look back at his historical successes, which include his nonactions, as he waits for exactly what he wants.</p><p>What's required for investors, which Buffett has demonstrated repeatedly, is the virtue of patience. As noted above, every time, that has rewarded shareholders handsomely. We believe he (and us as well) will have that wonderful opportunity.</p><p>Larry Sarbit is a portfolio manager at Value Partners Investments in Winnipeg. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lsarbit@vpinvestments.ca\">lsarbit@vpinvestments.ca</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Congress is investigating whetherantitrust violations were committed by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The probe took on new gravity in September when the House Judiciary Committee asked the companies to turn over[2] sensitive documents including financial data and executive discussions on potential merger targets. The Justice Department had already begun a major antitrust investigation[3], along with the House's 'top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.' Amazon is facing closer inspection[4] by the Federal Trade Commission, the Progressive-era agency assigned to police anti-competitive practices and monopolies. </p><p>From the standpoint of the companies, the worst outcome would be a government-ordered breakup. That's unlikely but not impossible. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren promises to break up Big Tech[5], saying the giants hurt innovation and small business. The Washington Post, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is a particularly effective thorn in President Donald Trump's side. That could put the bullseye on Amazon. From the standpoint of Seattle, attention should be paid. Serious damage to Amazon would affect the metropolitan area in unpredictable and mostly unfavorable ways. AdvertisingMicrosoft survived a historic antitrust case mostly intact. Now it's an admired corporation. But between the lawsuit itself and a consent decree, the company spent 21 years fighting[6] the federal government. It was a near-run thing: The federal court initially ordered Microsoft broken into two separate units. And the battle contributed to the infamous 'lost decade' and, some say, Bill Gates' decision to step down as chief executive. Amazon might not get off so easy. It's made enemies beyond Trump, such as the mom-and-pop retailers it vaporized and the big rivals it terrifies. Microsoft mostly had enemies in D.C. and Silicon Valley \u2014 average Americans were happy with the software. Will enough average Americans stand by Amazon, even if they shop there? These are highly uncertain times. The nightmare scenario isn't what happened to Microsoft but the fate of Ma Bell. The old American Telephone and Telegraph (later AT...aka the Bell System) controlled phone service through most of the United States before the feds went after it in 1974 as a monopoly. The government had actually filed two previous suits, in 1913 and 1949, but AT...ame through with relatively minor concessions. Ma Bell seemed unassailable. And most of us alive back then had no complaints. We had the best phone service in the world. But Ma Bell's luck ran out. The Bell System was broken up in 1982, losing local phone service to independent regional operating companies (US West here, absorbing Pacific Northwest Bell which was headquartered in Seattle). It also lost the Yellow Pages (essential and lucrative before the internet), and half of Bell Labs, once a world-class generator of innovation. AT... Western Electric was no longer monopoly equipment supplier to America's telephone system, either. AdvertisingToday's AT...s a bulked-up Baby Bell, SBC Communications, finally acquiring its Ma, so to speak, in 2005 and taking the name. Amazon could face a similar fate. The parts are as evident as a Thanksgiving turkey: Amazon Web Services, Whole Foods, Alexa and other hardware and software, entertainment, and Amazon Air. All could be spun off as independent companies. The e-commerce marketplace could be broken into smaller, competing companies, too. It would be almost too easy, at least on paper. The Ama-geddon scenario would only benefit the economy, however, if it were applied to other giants with anti-competitive market power: the rest of Big Tech, big banks, the airline cartel, Walmart, media, defense contractors and more.And would the pieces remain headquartered in Seattle? Amazon Web Services would likely use HQ2 in Virginia. Other spinoffs might move elsewhere. For all the local carping about Amazon, its headquarters here \u2014 achieved without any incentives \u2014 has been a unique asset and mostly for the good, not least in filling city coffers. Even without a breakup, years of fighting an antitrust action would distract Amazon management from the biggest things driving its stock price: growth and innovation. Even an eventual triumph would be a lost decade on steroids. Hiring would slow and could even reverse. Again, the worst is unlikely. Brave faces are being worn. According to Politico[7], at a summer tech conference Amazon Web Services chief Andy Jassy said, 'We don't spend a lot of time talking about it.'The story continued: 'Bezos and others in Amazon's inner circle aren't preoccupied by a potential forced restructuring at government hands. Far more front of mind, (Jassy) said, are Google and Microsoft gaining ground into the cloud computing business AWS has long dominated.' Writing in Bloomberg, Harvard Law's Noah Feldman[8] argued that the interpretation of antitrust for the past 40 years, seeded by Robert Bork and Richard Posner, would work in Big Tech's favor. 'The essence of the theory is that we should measure the presence of anticompetitive behavior by determining whether consumers are being harmed,' he wrote. 'Instead of protecting a company's competitors, the law should protect consumers. If consumers are not being harmed, or are even being helped, the conduct should be deemed lawful.Most Read Business Stories 'You can see why this theory has enjoyed such success. It's simple and elegant, and resonates with the philosophy of utilitarianism. The consumer-oriented theory is supposed to embody the goal of providing the greatest welfare for the greatest number of people. The implicit idea is that competing companies don't have legal interests \u2014 people do.' And don't forget the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which holds that political spending is a form of protected free speech by corporations and unions. This allows them to essentially spend unlimited sums on political causes. Still, uneasy rests the crown. Old theories and political axioms are more fluid than anytime in decades. Big Tech might be in for a rough ride, and that would give Amazon and Seattle less to smile about.

This answer did not satisfy Senator Lindsey Graham (R \u2013 S.C.), who pushed back: \u201cIf I buy a Ford, and it doesn\u2019t work well, and I don\u2019t like it, I can buy a Chevy. If I\u2019m upset with Facebook, what\u2019s the equivalent product I can go sign up for?\u201d    There was no need for another winding response. The answer was simple: none.    Facebook rose to power by maximizing the commoditization of data. The platform has since jealously guarded its dominance by absorbing burgeoning competitors and consolidating more user data.    Through the acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook gained data that unlocked access to new communities, their interests, networks, and personal information. This generated profitable insights on targeting ads to a greater population, and created valuable feedback data for Facebook\u2019s services and technologies. Basically, more data created more possibilities for monetization. Deals made by Google, Amazon, and Apple all share this common motivation. When regulators failed to block these acquisitions for over a decade, the tech market divided into the haves and the have-nots: incumbents with an exclusive, far-reaching vantage point built on data, and the outsiders that lack the information capital to enter the arena.    Graham\u2019s intuitive query, direct enough to warrant a one-word answer, unraveled an ugly truth: Big Tech faces no meaningful competition. And they never will, unless their access to data is democratized to enliven competition and collective innovation.    The unrelenting market dominance of a few giants has generated overlapping regulatory concerns on competition and privacy. With default opt-in settings and unnegotiable privacy policies, user data is acquired at virtually no cost to tech companies but is widely capitalized as a commodity. Powerful incumbents and regulators alike are incorrectly pitting privacy and competition as dichotomous goals, arguing that expanding access to Big Tech\u2019s data would violate user privacy. An overview of privacy-preserving data-sharing mechanisms proves this view is outdated\u2014and ready to be questioned.    As the prospect of antitrust charges against Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) looms larger, regulators should champion the remedy that upholds competition and privacy as intricately connected values in the marketplace of information. It is time to challenge the proprietary concentration of data that has too long been weaponized as absolute bargaining power. Balancing this goal with privacy will require both legal and technological solutions. The two interests \u2013 privacy and competition \u2013 are not as contradictory as industry leaders would like them to seem. Smart regulation can advance both.    Data Portability vs. Data-Sharing Mandates    Following Facebook\u2019s testimony to the FTC last month, policy discussions have focused on data portability as a potential remedy for anticompetitive platforms. Data portability offers users the choice to migrate their photos and information to a different platform. The idea is to let consumers take their user-generated data to other platforms to try out new products and services. Companies like Facebook and Google proudly tout their \u201cDownload Your Information\u201d tools as proof that they can remain competitive without regulatory intervention.    This proposal is but a necessary baseline. Data portability alone cannot address the root of Big Tech\u2019s power\u2014which derives not only from the individual user\u2019s messages, photos, and ad preferences, but also the exclusive market insights and third-party data that can be analyzed to edge out the competition. Data portability only makes accessible the first category of user-generated information.    An alternative proposal for a \u201c data-sharing mandate \u201d takes a more comprehensive approach, requiring technology companies above a certain market cap to share a representative subset of their data with their competitors. This more systematic approach is necessary to achieve genuine competition. Tech giants that emerged from an unregulated era continue to benefit from the data they freely collected before policymakers began to question the monopolistic consequences. Revisiting this issue in 2020, regulators should understand that telling consumers \u201cyou have a choice to leave\u201d is meaningless in the status quo. This sense of agency is illusory if a few tech giants can keep dominating with an abundance of competitive intelligence to undercut their rivals and leverage exclusivity.    Even with data portability, Facebook can track your web activity on apps that use Facebook\u2019s services and technologies. Amazon sets the rulebook for online retailers but violates its own policies to gather seller data to price-cut competing shops . And Google restricts customer data interoperability to maintain negotiating power over AdTech competitors. Nothing will change until we challenge Big Tech\u2019s monopolistic control of information.    A key difference between the regulatory models of data portability and data-sharing mandates is whether the consumers or businesses should carry the burden of opening up the market to more players. While data portability puts the burden on consumers to shop around for a service that offers the best options for both privacy and performance; data-sharing mandates rightfully place the onus on Big Tech companies to open-source insights that competitors can use to offer a comparable service to consumers.    Data-sharing mandates advance a compelling mission. To combat monopolistic power derived from data, Big Tech should share what they know\u2014and make this information widely usable for current and potential competitors. This pragmatic approach is supported by the European Commission , which has proposed a \u2018 fair and equal data-sharing \u2019 mandate to remedy market distortions introduced by information monopolies. This idea has been openly supported by both political and academic communities.    The competition commissioner of the European Union (EU), Margrethe Vestager, has stated that data \u201ccan foreclose the market\u201d and \u201cgive the parties that have them immense business opportunities that are not available to others.\u201d Oxford Internet governance professor Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger has called for a progressive mandate for technology companies to make more data available to the public as their market share increases: \u201c[the mandate] would kick in once a company\u2019s market share reaches an initial threshold \u2013 say, 10 percent. It would then have to share a randomly chosen portion of its feedback data with every other player in the market that requests it. How much data it must make available would depend on the market share captured by the company. The closer a company is to domination, the more data it would have to share with its competitors.\u201d    Data-sharing presents a direct path to correcting a heavily top-concentrated market . Additionally, this approach can widen economic activity on data without unduly constraining incumbents and impacting consumers, as breaking up Big Tech would.    As regulators navigate how to put the idea into practice, they should think outside the box of doctrinal law. Anticompetitive data concentration is an interdisciplinary issue that requires a technical solution supported by policy principles. Advanced privacy-enhancing technologies are rapidly scaling to enable progressive data-sharing without compromising consumer privacy. Adopted with technical safeguards to anonymize personal information, data-sharing mandates can be achieved without a privacy tradeoff.    Privacy or Competition: A False Choice    It threatens both competition and privacy that information asymmetries insulate big platforms from transparency in their dealings with consumers, advertisers, and third-party sellers. Yet, legislative discussions continue to contrast the goals of competition against privacy. The companies seeking to avoid regulation encourage this false dilemma.    During the July 29, 2020 House antitrust hearing , Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R \u2013 N.D.) asked Google CEO Sundar Pichai about the company\u2019s decision to require third-parties to purchase Google\u2019s ad-buying tools to advertise on YouTube. Pichai cited user privacy as a justification, and Armstrong questioned if privacy is serving as a shield for anticompetitive behavior.    Armstrong\u2019s serious bipartisan investigation of Big Tech\u2019s harmful practices is commendable, but his misguided conclusion is alarming. Describing the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\u2014the most advanced data protection regime in the world\u2014he said, \u201cthe consequences of [the] GDPR have been to further entrench large established actors like Google, leading to regulatory capture that exacerbates competition concerns.\u201d This statement dangerously misrepresents the intent, impact, and opportunities created by global privacy laws.    It should raise concerns that a legislator is suggesting that privacy law is an enabler of monopolies.    The GDPR systematizes accountability in the processing of personal data. The intent is to keep companies vigilant about what data they are collecting, how the data is being processed and held, and why. This means minimizing the collection of personal data, and finding ways to engineer for better privacy. It was in the absence of these rules that Big Tech grew unsustainably powerful.    Despite political narratives that pit privacy and competition as conflicting ideas, privacy regulations are built on fair information principles that reject monopolistic data-hoarding practices.    The policy objective of the GDPR is not to enable companies to gatekeep data with privacy policies and contractual clauses. It is to disrupt the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d complacency by requiring companies to review and update their business models\u2014both operationally and technologically\u2014to comport with the letter and the spirit of data protection laws. This protects consumers by challenging organizations to mindfully invest in privacy safeguards (such as anonymization techniques) for essential data processing needs, while eliminating superfluous and risky data practices.    Data-sharing mandates have become an essential prerequisite for competition and innovation to thrive. They can be securely enforced through privacy-enhancing technologies, so that competition policies can be achieved within the framework of consumer protection and privacy regulations.    Democratizing Data with Privacy-Enhancing Technologies    A key provision of the GDPR is privacy-by-design , which encourages innovative technical safeguards to limit the transfer of personally identifying information. If there is a privacy risk to sharing personal information with outsiders, the GDPR requires companies to develop and design processes that can facilitate this collaboration with regard to the \u2018state of the art\u2019 technology in de-identifying the data.    As a result, privacy-enhancing technologies have become widely available as tools to internalize the principles of \u2018 data protection by default \u2019\u2014namely, minimizing the collection, transmission, and disclosure of personal information. Responding to the wave of substantive reforms on international privacy laws, these techniques have quickly scaled from academic research to commercial deployment; emerging as a pragmatic solution to deriving utility from data without creating a central repository of personal information.    In particular, stricter privacy requirements around the world created the need for decentralized computing\u2014or privacy-preserving cryptography\u2014to enable multiple parties to collaborate and perform analytics without sharing or revealing the underlying personal data they individually hold. These cryptographic techniques are based on homomorphic encryption (or encryption in-use), and secure multi-party computation.    Even though they sound complex, the concept is simple.    Current mainstream encryption methods are encryption at-rest (protecting information stored in your phone), and encryption in-transit (protecting emails and texts while they are being sent). Privacy-preserving cryptography builds on the third pillar of encryption: encryption in-use . This is the ability to perform analytics on someone else\u2019s data in encrypted format, so that you can extract the insight you need without seeing the private data inputs. In the data-sharing context, this capacity would enable Big Tech to allow competitors to compute on its data without exposing any personal user information in the process. (Full disclosure: My company, Inpher , provides secure multi-party computation services, including products that perform the functions recommended herein.)    Data, when securely shared, becomes more accurate, usable, and diverse. Techniques like secure multi-party computation have been applied by private companies to overcome competitive and confidential barriers to data collaboration: facilitating bank-to-bank information sharing on anti-money laundering investigations , pooling training data to improve machine-learning systems, and even supporting the public interest of identifying gender wage gaps . Cryptographic privacy safeguards have established proof of concept in these critical sectors, and are being further developed in healthcare to preserve privacy in data-sharing programs for COVID-19 tracing efforts.    When deployed to actualize data-sharing mandates, privacy-enhancing technologies have the power to lift the veil on companies that have hoarded data for their own gain.    This extra technical layer of privacy and security will be necessary to protect consumers in data-sharing programs. Without the push for technical firewalls, companies would rely solely on complex legal agreements to share data with competitors.    This is dangerous, because contractual clauses and privacy policies are mere legal instruments which cannot actively protect data from malicious third parties or negligent actors. These \u2018paper safeguards\u2019 can assign liability to the foreseeable recipients who may misuse the data. But the scope of these data-sharing programs will require a technical failsafe to prevent these risks ex ante by cryptographically securing the data from leaking into the wrong hands.    Policy Recommendations    Policymakers thus need to take the next step in adopting privacy-enhancing technologies that make data widely usable for collaborators without multiplying privacy risks. Notable intergovernmental bodies including the United Nations (UN) , Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) , World Economic Forum (WEF) , and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) have all promoted the implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies to protect data against preventable risks. Industry and academic groups, including the Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Alliance \u2013of which my company is a member\u2014have also formed to develop applied research for privacy-preserving techniques and to collectively advocate for their adoption.    Regulatory efforts in the United States should follow suit in examining the viability of privacy-enhancing technologies to resolve the anticompetitive effects of Big Tech\u2019s proprietary hold on data. It is manifestly unfair that Big Tech is using privacy as an excuse to wall off vital information to engineer an imbalance of market power\u2014when they have the resources to explore technical solutions to democratize access to their data.    We do not need any more well-manicured CEO testimonies in discordant Congressional hearings.    To move forward, we need privacy and competition authorities to work together on a coherent policy to regulate Big Tech and its control of data. We need regulators to engage diverse stakeholders to discuss technological and policy solutions for information monopolies\u2014which have imposed an insurmountable barrier to entry for competitors and insulated systemic privacy issues from consumers.    Opening up Big Tech\u2019s exclusive troves of data can level the playing field in a very skewed market, and also provide competitors with incredible tools for innovation. Regulators just need to know that these alternative solutions exist, beyond the current legal and political gridlocks.

And when you look at what happened in 2010 in terms of the effect that austerity has had on families, it's clear that there is a link between, for example, poverty and poor mental health.</p><p>\"And also we've lost things in the school system, things that we know have a therapeutic value. In the state sector, things like art, music, drama and sport have been systematically squeezed out.</p><p>\"So when you put that all together, you create an environment, I think, where it's difficult for young people to enjoy a good level of mental health, even before you take social media into account.\"</p><p>Devon was speaking alongside the children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, who argued that social media was unlikely to cause problems by itself, but said communications platforms could exacerbate problems such as bullying that already existed in a pre-digital age.</p><p>\"Again, it hasn't caused it. There's been bullying forever,\" Longfield said, \"but what cyberbullying does is allow individuals to track that person. You can never get away. There's a sense that, back in the day, we'd go home from school, things would settle, you'd be in your home and you'd come back, and it would be another day.</p><p>\"Well, what young people talk to me about is that constancy: throughout the evening, into the early morning, and it can get to you in your hand, as you're falling asleep, and beep away throughout the night. So unless we take preventative action to stop some of those things happening - blocking, and turning off the thing, and all those things - then there's a direct nature of cyberbullying. Bullying in any sense is awful, and eats away at your confidence and sense of self, but cyberbullying gets you wherever you are and I think that is particularly dangerous.\"</p><p>Longfield had harsh words for big tech companies such as Facebook, which operates three of the most popular social networks among young people, and Google, whose YouTube video site is as popular as broadcast TV with 12- to 15-year-olds, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/108182/children-parents-media-use-attitudes-2017.pdf\">according to the regulator Ofcom</url>.</p><p>\"I've been pushing the tech companies for a couple of years now, with I'd still say limited success, around them taking more responsibility for their platforms being a positive environment. There has been a change of tone, there has been some movement, but in my view not adequate enough.</p><p>\"We should remember that this is one of those areas where the internet absolutely wasn't designed for children, but they're one of the biggest groups within it, so we need to make sure that there's protection around them as a vulnerable group in their own right. I would like ... a duty of care for those companies.\"</p><p>Longfield, formerly the chief executive of the 4Children charity <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/108182/children-parents-media-use-attitudes-2017.pdf\">before she became the children's commissioner for England</url>, also argued that the biggest single change her office needed was the power to request data from technology companies. The children's commissioner can request information from any \"public\" body, she said, but the legislation had not caught up with the fact that the digital world represents a public space operated by private companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-49184784</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR2-0471-F021-623Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"594\"/><timeReceived>4:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Yiu has also held senior roles in a number of public, private and third sector organizations including SCVO, Policy Exchange, McKinsey &amp; Co., HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office.</p><p><br/> The internet turned the world on its head. It's time to apply the same audacious ambition to rethinking regulation<br/> The political weather has been slowly turning against big tech for a while, but the last few weeks have thrown the storm clouds into sharp relief. Much of the responsibility for the growing backlash falls on the tech industry; inclusion has failed to keep pace with innovation and neutrality has been used as an excuse to side-step difficult conversations.<br/> But politicians and policymakers are complicit too: all businesses operate within a legal and political framework, and successive governments have looked the other way or sought quick fixes rather than doing the hard work of starting over for the internet age.<br/> This policy failure matters because conventional wisdom is a poor match for the complexity of the modern world. Contrary to the dominant narrative, most tech companies aren't selling your data. The common refrain that \"if you're not paying, then you're the product\" is particularly unhelpful, simultaneously implying that companies don't care about users, and that apps are primarily a veneer for exploitation. While it makes for a good sound bite, this doesn't hold water: internet businesses live or die depending on whether they can retain users, and the apps we take for granted would have been unimaginable a generation ago.<br/> Nevertheless, the situation we now find ourselves in is undeniably overshadowed by a huge imbalance of power. Worse still, we're facing it at a perilous time for political nuance.<br/> Across the Western world, the swell of populism, which offers outrage but no real answers, threatens to drown all before it. Globalisation has borne the brunt thus far, but populist movements are searching for a new scapegoat: the left seeks one that puts profit before morality, the right one that puts liberalism before tradition. Big tech, with its reverence for disruption and its West Coast elites, is a perfect foil for both.<br/> This makes getting perspective hard, and yet for any solution to last we will need to resolve some knotty tradeoffs. Three in particular have no obvious answers:<br/> First, competing demands for stronger data controls and for increased competition. In Europe, the GDPR goes a long way to upgrading outmoded data protection rules. But it explicitly prevents individuals from exporting their social graph - the map of who they are connected to - from one platform to another. This sort of bootstrapping was essential for many of today's big apps to get started, and the competition this fueled kept everyone on their toes. The irony now is that locking data down too far may make the current incumbents unassailable.<br/> Second, distaste both for targeted advertising and for the homogenisation of culture. The black box of digital advertising can feel invasive, particularly when ads follow you around the web. But it's also enabled countless new businesses to get in front of customers they would never otherwise have found. This is about more than cheap razors and avocado toast; for example, after decades of stasis, innovative new menstrual products are finally viable because their creators have been able to go direct to consumers.<br/> Third, an aversion to platform operators either exercising editorial control or trying to remain impartial. For those concerned about the power of newspaper editors and TV networks, the idea of platform operators as editors is far more horrifying. Yet in the face of outcomes we may disagree with (Exhibit A: Brexit; Exhibit B: Trump), we can be quick to pin the blame on tech executives for failing to use their power to make a stand. Regulation designed for print and broadcast media can't help us square this because the internet isn't just the same but bigger; a world in which everyone produces content as well as consuming it is fundamentally different.<br/> The truth is the internet has changed everything, and not in the way people usually mean. Yes, it manifests in the astonishing devices in our pockets and the apps we use, but it's the economics that really matter. Technology has driven marginal costs, distribution costs and transaction costs close to zero and made massive multi-sided markets possible, which means the incentives and business models for internet companies are utterly unlike their old-world predecessors.<br/> The resulting quest for scale is at the root of the challenges outlined above. It's not a priori a bad thing - but it does result in different behaviours and powerful dynamics that yesterday's regulation is not even remotely equipped to deal with. Failing to grasp this has left policy in disarray and all of us at risk from hot takes that do more harm than good.<br/> So just as the internet has turned things on their head, we need to start over with a new set of rules. Two core principles can help us get this right.<br/> First, radical transparency. This means global standards and easy-to-understand information on what data is being held and how it is being used, and what actions were taken when things went wrong (by all parties, including governments), as well as stronger rights to export data and audit public content. This is the best way to foster competition and create a robust incentive for companies to be good custodians of our data, for the destruction of trust is the surest way for platforms to flip from growth to decline.<br/> Second, reasserting the public interest. The go-to framework for regulation is usually antitrust, but if the internet has an inherent tendency for winner-takes-all consolidation then regulation by breaking up may be both a Sisyphean task and a counterproductive destruction of value. Far better to broaden the class of things we care about - from consumer welfare and competition to things like mental health, democratic participation and the public finances - and explicitly require systemically important firms to take them into account.<br/> Crucially, translating these principles into policy prescriptions must be more than an exercise in finding the acceptable minimum. Scrutiny and sanctions will be essential, but the bigger prize is opening up a progressive dialogue through which partnerships and education can realise the transformational potential of technology to deliver positive change.<br/> This is a big ask, and will require both technology leaders and policymakers to think very differently and sell difficult compromises to their constituents. But neither side can find a solution on their own - policymakers need to understand the future that new technologies are unfolding, and technology leaders need a clear articulation of what society expects of them as pioneers and corporate citizens.<br/> We let policy fall a long way behind as the internet revolution got underway. Let's not make the same mistake as a new wave of innovation breaks.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10460500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S35-SFM1-DYDW-72GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1195\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002F32</classCode><className>MCKINSEY &amp; CO INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009ERN</classCode><className>TREASURY DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009ERN</classCode><className>TREASURY DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000D4VG</classCode><className>DATA SECURITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE0009UHP</classCode><className>TONY BLAIR</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Yiu has also held senior roles in a number of public, private and third sector organizations including SCVO, Policy Exchange, McKinsey &amp; Co., HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office.</p><p><br/> The internet turned the world on its head. It\u2019s time to apply the same audacious ambition to rethinking regulation<br/> The political weather has been slowly turning against big tech for a while, but the last few weeks have thrown the storm clouds into sharp relief. Much of the responsibility for the growing backlash falls on the tech industry; inclusion has failed to keep pace with innovation and neutrality has been used as an excuse to side-step difficult conversations.<br/> But politicians and policymakers are complicit too: all businesses operate within a legal and political framework, and successive governments have looked the other way or sought quick fixes rather than doing the hard work of starting over for the internet age.<br/> This policy failure matters because conventional wisdom is a poor match for the complexity of the modern world. Contrary to the dominant narrative, most tech companies aren\u2019t selling your data. The common refrain that \u201cif you\u2019re not paying, then you\u2019re the product\u201d is particularly unhelpful, simultaneously implying that companies don\u2019t care about users, and that apps are primarily a veneer for exploitation. While it makes for a good sound bite, this doesn\u2019t hold water: internet businesses live or die depending on whether they can retain users, and the apps we take for granted would have been unimaginable a generation ago.<br/> Nevertheless, the situation we now find ourselves in is undeniably overshadowed by a huge imbalance of power. Worse still, we\u2019re facing it at a perilous time for political nuance.<br/> Across the Western world, the swell of populism, which offers outrage but no real answers, threatens to drown all before it. Globalisation has borne the brunt thus far, but populist movements are searching for a new scapegoat: the left seeks one that puts profit before morality, the right one that puts liberalism before tradition. Big tech, with its reverence for disruption and its West Coast elites, is a perfect foil for both.First, competing demands for stronger data controls and for increased competition. In Europe, the GDPR goes a long way to upgrading outmoded data protection rules. But it explicitly prevents individuals from exporting their social graph \u2014 the map of who they are connected to \u2014 from one platform to another. This sort of bootstrapping was essential for many of today\u2019s big apps to get started, and the competition this fueled kept everyone on their toes. The irony now is that locking data down too far may make the current incumbents unassailable.<br/> Second, distaste both for targeted advertising and for the homogenisation of culture. The black box of digital advertising can feel invasive, particularly when ads follow you around the web. But it\u2019s also enabled countless new businesses to get in front of customers they would never otherwise have found. This is about more than cheap razors and avocado toast; for example, after decades of stasis, innovative new menstrual products are finally viable because their creators have been able to go direct to consumers.<br/> Third, an aversion to platform operators either exercising editorial control or trying to remain impartial. For those concerned about the power of newspaper editors and TV networks, the idea of platform operators as editors is far more horrifying. Yet in the face of outcomes we may disagree with (Exhibit A: Brexit; Exhibit B: Trump), we can be quick to pin the blame on tech executives for failing to use their power to make a stand. Regulation designed for print and broadcast media can\u2019t help us square this because the internet isn\u2019t just the same but bigger; a world in which everyone produces content as well as consuming it is fundamentally different.<br/> The truth is the internet has changed everything, and not in the way people usually mean. Yes, it manifests in the astonishing devices in our pockets and the apps we use, but it\u2019s the economics that really matter. Technology has driven marginal costs, distribution costs and transaction costs close to zero and made massive multi-sided markets possible, which means the incentives and business models for internet companies are utterly unlike their old-world predecessors.<br/> The resulting quest for scale is at the root of the challenges outlined above. It\u2019s not a priori a bad thing \u2013 but it does result in different behaviours and powerful dynamics that yesterday\u2019s regulation is not even remotely equipped to deal with. Failing to grasp this has left policy in disarray and all of us at risk from hot takes that do more harm than good. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN733497920180411</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S34-V4S1-J9XT-P3H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"821\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The more America's Big Tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter have contributed to keeping America's economy afloat during the coronavirus lockdown, the louder the voices get to break them up or to tie them up into regulatory knots.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time that the White House and many conservatives are pushing to \"bring our businesses and manufacturing back home\" from nations such as China, plenty of so-called nationalists see our globally dominant, high-tech firms as the enemy. Do they realize that there is nothing that the communists in Beijing would wish to do more than to knock Amazon, Apple, or Google from their king-of-the-hill status and replace them with state-assisted enterprises such as Huawei or Alibaba? Washington's assault against America's trillion-dollar companies would aid and abet Chinese President Xi Jinping's efforts.</p><p>But it is happening. Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk blasted Amazon for being a \"monopoly\" and tweeted: \"Time to break up Amazon.\" Conservatives piled on. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri has introduced new antitrust legislation against the tech companies. President Trump has threatened to regulate social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook \"strongly.\" Some in Congress want an investigation into Google's search engine algorithms to make sure they aren't discriminating against conservative websites.</p><p>I have been a loud critic of the anti-conservative bias of the big Silicon Valley tech firms, and conservative leaders must keep the pressure on these firms to level the playing field. New polling commissioned by a group I run, the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, and conducted by Remington Research Group, revealed that a majority of conservative activists believe that tech companies engage in censorship or display bias against conservatives.</p><p>When conservatives were asked, \"Do you believe the federal government should be involved in regulating political speech on the internet?\" the results were shockingly one-sided. Seventy-six percent of respondents said no, the government should keep its hands off regulating it, the technology companies, and their platforms. The same poll asked conservatives which issue is most important to them when casting their vote for federal offices such as senator or representative. Just 1% said \"online censorship.\" </p><p>It is reassuring. From the start of the internet age, conservatives such as me and Grover Norquist and many more have argued the best way for America to dominate the digital age of online commerce was to keep the internet tax- and regulation-free. That is what we have mostly done in America, and the rewards have been bountiful. Millions of jobs and the spurt of innovation and entrepreneurship has the top six American tech companies with a higher production capacity than the entire GDP of most other nations in the world. </p><p>We have seen first-hand how the gig economy saved our nation from plunging into a Great Depression over the past three months. These were terrible times, with as many as 40 million people losing their jobs. But thanks to our multitrillion-dollar tech sector, and not just Big Tech but hundreds of new entrepreneurial online services, commerce kept flowing, food was available on the shelves, gas was in the tanks, packages were delivered, and paychecks were processed. They saved America from utter chaos and severe deprivation.</p><p>It was the services, know-how, and infrastructure built by our pioneering tech giants that enabled the tens of thousands of small tech firms to sprout up from nowhere, and these firms will be essential to securing the next phase of recovery. Our construction firms, steel, oil, and gas industries, as well as hospitals, media, food processing, and manufacturers, are all dependent on the kinds of just-in-time inventory and supply chain management made possible by the tech sector. In many ways, the success and the array of business-to-business services provided at little cost (often for free) from companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and the like are what makes the next generation of tech firms possible through free market competition. Innovation stops monopolies, not government lawyers. </p><p>High tech isn't swallowing up small businesses. It is saving them. A new report from the Connected Commerce Council, which analyzed the impact of internet platforms and digital tools on small companies in the COVID-19 crisis, found almost 1 in 3 (31%) business owners said that without digital tools, they would have had to close part or all of their business. Nearly 70% said digital tools have been useful during the COVID crisis. </p><p>There is now a call from both parties for multitrillion-dollar government \"infrastructure bills.\" Wait a minute. Our most critical infrastructure today is the gig economy connectivity through satellites, internet platforms, clouds, fiber optic cables, the sophisticated nationwide electric grid system, and the like that was almost all built out by the very tech and telecommunications companies that are now coming under fire for being too successful and making too much money. </p><p>Conservatives are rightly suspicious of Big Tech's political power and liberal slant. The recent effort by Amazon in refusing to sell a book critical of the coronavirus lockdown is just a recent example of how the tech world seems to go out of its way to appease the Left and to alienate and even silence the Right. </p><p>But the one thing free market conservatives are even warier of is big government. When asked, \"Who do you think should regulate Big Tech companies like Google: the federal government or the free market?\" almost two-thirds answered, \"The free market.\" </p><p>We learned big-time during the coronavirus crisis that tech isn't broke.

Big Tech is about to learn this lesson, if it hasn\u2019t already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elizabeth Warren is out with a headline-grabbing proposal to break up Big Tech companies, the sort of overly ambitious government plan that once would have engendered knee-jerk Republican opposition. Not anymore. Who says we all can\u2019t get along?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When the senator tweeted her (understandable) objection that Facebook had taken down her ads attacking Facebook and other tech companies, Ted Cruz agreed that the companies have too much power.</p><p> Tech is caught in a right-left pincer. Conservatives don\u2019t like these companies because they are owned and operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals subject to the worst sort of groupthink. Progressives don\u2019t like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.</p><p> That\u2019s why there is some chance Washington might get together and, along the lines Warren proposes, effectively outlaw the business models of some of the most successful and iconic American companies.</p><p> Warren\u2019s idea to cleave off the platforms of the tech companies and have them run as \u201cplatform utilities\u201d separate from the rest of their business is unworkable and is justified by a series of errors and misjudgments.</p><p> It\u2019s not true, as Warren asserts, that the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s opened up the space for Google and Facebook to thrive. Microsoft never got the internet and left the space open for Google and Facebook all by itself, as often happens with a large incumbent wedded to its business model.</p><p> She charges that the tech companies use mergers to limit competition and cites Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp. It\u2019s hard to discern the harm here. When the social network bought it, WhatsApp was available for a fee. Now it\u2019s free, and more people use it than ever. What\u2019s the problem?</p><p> She calls out Google for allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It\u2019s not obvious that Google actually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to improve Google\u2019s searches, or is qualified to even try.</p><p> Warren\u2019s proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of consumers, who are the ones who made the tech companies so large.</p><p> Why does Google provide for free a tool without which it\u2019s impossible to imagine contemporary life? Because it can monetize it with advertising. Without the advertising, which Warren insists should be a separate business, Google has no incentive to devote engineers to improving its search engine.</p><p> By the same token, no one will welcome iPhones that no longer come with or sell Apple apps. And would people really appreciate having to go to two different Amazons, one just a platform, one selling Amazon products?</p><p> This is all silly, as are the mergers that Warren pledges to reverse, including Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon doesn\u2019t have anything close to a monopoly in food retail. Rather than taking over the sector, it\u2019s spurring investment and innovation. The nation\u2019s largest supermarket chain, Kroger, was slated to increase its spending on investment 200 percent in 2018.</p><p> The tech giants aren\u2019t stand-pat companies. Amazon alone spent more than $22 billion on investment in 2017. The development of autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and voice recognition wouldn\u2019t be nearly as advanced if it weren\u2019t for the research of the tech companies. The behemoth of yesteryear, General Electric, isn\u2019t making these investments.</p><p> None of this is to deny genuine concerns about tech companies. They need rules for content that honor the spirit of the First Amendment, and perhaps there should be tighter regulations around privacy. But any real offenses should be addressed with fixes directed at specific conduct, rather than with a massive politically imposed reorganization.</p><p> That\u2019s a very bad idea, and if you had any doubt, watch it get a respectful hearing from both sides in Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIN-1724F66A0111D6A5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289BD343493CBF NWBKIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPG-1P51-DXVP-V47S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401917</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bluffton News-Banner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Not anymore. Who says we all can't get along?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the senator tweeted her (understandable) objection that Facebook had taken down her ads attacking Facebook and other tech companies, Ted Cruz agreed that the companies have too much power.</p><p>Tech is caught in a right-left pincer. Conservatives don't like these companies because they are owned and operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals subject to the worst sort of groupthink.</p><p>Progressives don't like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.</p><p>That's why there is some chance Washington might get together and, along the lines Warren proposes, effectively outlaw the business models of some of the most successful and iconic American companies.</p><p>Warren's idea to cleave off the platforms of the tech companies and have them run as \"platform utilities\" separate from the rest of their business is unworkable and is justified by a series of errors and misjudgments.</p><p>It's not true, as Warren asserts, that the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s opened up the space for Google and Facebook to thrive.</p><p>Microsoft never got the internet and left the space open for Google and Facebook all by itself, as often happens with a large incumbent wedded to its business model.</p><p>She charges that the tech companies use mergers to limit competition and cites Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp. It's hard to discern the harm here. When the social network bought it, WhatsApp was available for a fee. Now it's free, and more people use it than ever. What's the problem?</p><p>She calls out Google for allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It's not obvious that Google actually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to improve Google's searches, or is qualified to even try.</p><p>Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of consumers, who are the ones who made the tech companies so large.</p><p>Why does Google provide for free a tool without which it's impossible to imagine contemporary life? Because it can monetize it with advertising. Without the advertising, which Warren insists should be a separate business, Google has no incentive to devote engineers to improving its search engine.</p><p>By the same token, no one will welcome iPhones that no longer come with or sell Apple apps. And would people really appreciate having to go to two different Amazons, one just a platform, one selling Amazon products?</p><p>This is all silly, as are the mergers that Warren pledges to reverse, including Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon doesn't have anything close to a monopoly in food retail. Rather than taking over the sector, it's spurring investment and innovation. The nation's largest supermarket chain, Kroger, was slated to increase its spending on investment 200 percent in 2018. The tech giants aren't stand-pat companies. Amazon alone spent more than $22 billion on investment in 2017. The development of autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and voice recognition wouldn't be nearly as advanced if it weren't for the research of the tech companies. The behemoth of yesteryear, General Electric, isn't making these investments.</p><p>None of this is to deny genuine concerns about tech companies.</p><p>They need rules for content that honor the spirit of the First Amendment, and perhaps there should be tighter regulations around privacy. But any real offenses should be addressed with fixes directed at specific conduct, rather than with a massive politically imposed reorganization.</p><p>That's a very bad idea, and if you had any doubt, watch it get a respectful hearing from both sides in Washington.</p><p>Rich Lowry is editor of the National Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>By Rich Lowry</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-031719D001art1xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897D7163BBD40 NWBKCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNF-HK71-DXVP-V3N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"683\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Record-Journal<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Progressives don't like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.</p><p> That's why there is some chance Washington might get together and, along the lines Warren proposes, effectively outlaw the business models of some of the most successful and iconic American companies.</p><p> Warren's idea to cleave off the platforms of the tech companies and have them run as \"platform utilities\" separate from the rest of their business is unworkable and is justified by a series of errors and misjudgments.</p><p> It's not true, as Warren asserts, that the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s opened up the space for Googleand Facebookto thrive. Microsoft never got the internet and left the space open for Googleand Facebookall by itself, as often happens with a large incumbent wedded to its business model.</p><p> She charges that the tech companies use mergers to limit competition and cites Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp. It's hard to discern the harm here. When the social network bought it, WhatsApp was available for a fee. Now it's free, and more people use it than ever. What's the problem?</p><p> She calls out Googlefor allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It's not obvious that Googleactually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to improve Google's searches, or is qualified to even try.</p><p> Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of consumers, who are the ones who made the tech companies so large.</p><p> Why does Googleprovide for free a tool without which it's impossible to imagine contemporary life? Because it can monetize it with advertising. Without the advertising, which Warren insists should be a separate business, Googlehas no incentive to devote engineers to improving its search engine.</p><p> By the same token, no one will welcome iPhones that no longer come with or sell Apple apps. And would people really appreciate having to go to two different Amazons, one just a platform, one selling Amazon products?</p><p> This is all silly, as are the mergers that Warren pledges to reverse, including Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon doesn't have anything close to a monopoly in food retail. Rather than taking over the sector, it's spurring investment and innovation. The nation's largest supermarket chain, Kroger, was slated to increase its spending on investment 200 percent in 2018.</p><p> The tech giants aren't stand-pat companies. Amazon alone spent more than $22 billion on investment in 2017. The development of autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and voice recognition wouldn't be nearly as advanced if it weren't for the research of the tech companies. The behemoth of yesteryear, General Electric, isn't making these investments.</p><p> None of this is to deny genuine concerns about tech companies. They need rules for content that honor the spirit of the First Amendment.</p><p> , and perhaps there should be tighter regulations around privacy. But any real offenses should be addressed with fixes directed at specific conduct, rather than with a massive politically imposed reorganization.</p><p> That's a very bad idea, and if you had any doubt, watch it get a respectful hearing from both sides in Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-d448810aec8e1d7692d99d1ab97e1a3a657d47</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28979AB88A36F1 NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNG-T9P1-DXVP-V4GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Review, The &amp; Sunday Review, Towanda, PA<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Big Tech is about to learn this lesson, if it hasn't already.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elizabeth Warren is out with a headline-grabbing proposal to break up Big Tech companies, the sort of overly ambitious government plan that once would have engendered knee-jerk Republican opposition. Not anymore. Who says we all can't get along?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the senator tweeted her (understandable) objection that Facebook had taken down her ads attacking Facebook and other tech companies, Ted Cruz - in a retweet heard around the world - agreed that the companies have too much power.</p><p>Tech is caught in a right-left pincer, made all the more powerful by the populist spirit afoot in both parties. Conservatives don't like these companies because they are owned and operated by sanctimonious Silicon Valley liberals subject to the worst sort of groupthink. Progressives don't like them because they are colossal profit-making enterprises.</p><p>That's why there is some chance Washington might get together, and along the lines Warren proposes, effectively outlaw the business models of some of the most successful and iconic American companies. It's the most compelling evidence yet that, yes, we are losing our minds.</p><p>Warren's idea to cleave off the platforms of the tech companies and have them run as \"platform utilities\" separate from the rest of their business is unworkable and is justified by a series of errors and misjudgments.</p><p>It's not true, as Warren asserts, that the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s opened up the space for Google and Facebook to thrive. Microsoft never got the internet, and left the space open for Google and Facebook all by itself, as often happens with a large incumbent wedded to its successful business model (in Microsoft's case, based on physical computers).</p><p>She charges that the tech companies use mergers to limit competition and cites as an example Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp. It's hard to discern the harm here. When the social network bought it, WhatsApp was available for a fee. Now it's free and more people use it than ever before. What's the problem?</p><p>She calls out Google for allegedly killing off its competitors by burying them in its searches. It's not obvious that Google actually does this, although its search business inherently involves constantly making choices to try to best serve what people want to see. No government regulator is going to make Google's searches better, or is qualified to even try.</p><p>Warren's proposal is obviously formulated without taking any account of the interests of users and consumers, who are the ones who made the tech companies so large in the first place.</p><p>Why does Google provide a tool without which it's impossible to imagine contemporary life - and has opened up vast vistas of readily available information - for free? Because it can monetize it with advertising. Without the advertising revenue, which Warren insists should be a separate business, Google has no incentive to devote engineers to constantly improving its search engine.</p><p>By the same token, it's not going to help anyone to have iPhones that no longer come with or sell Apple apps. And would people really appreciate having to go to two different Amazons, one just a platform, one selling Amazon products?</p><p>This is all silly, as are the mergers that Warren pledges to break up, including Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p>Under what theory is something untoward? Amazon doesn't have anything close to a monopoly in food retail. Rather than taking over the sector, it's spurring investment and innovation. The nation's largest supermarket chain, Kroger was founded in 1883. It was slated to increase its spending on investment 200 percent in 2018, developing a self-checkout app and robot delivery, precisely because the space is so competitive.</p><p>We've seen the same effect in retail. Falling behind Amazon, Target invested massively on improving across the board, and in one quarter in 2018, had its best sales growth in more than a decade. This past holiday season it sought to one-up Amazon by offering free two-day shipping. This is the market working, not getting short-circuited.</p><p>The tech giants aren't stand-pat companies. The top five spenders in research and development in 2017 were all tech companies. Amazon alone spent more than $22 billion. The development of autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and voice recognition wouldn't be nearly as advanced as they are now if it weren't for the work of Google and Amazon. The behemoth of yesteryear, General Electric, isn't making these investments.</p><p>None of this is to deny that there are genuine concerns about tech companies. They need rules for content that honor viewpoint-neutrality and the spirit of the First Amendment, and perhaps there should be tighter regulations around privacy. Their business practices aren't above scrutiny. But any real offenses should be addressed with fixes addressing specific conduct, rather than with a massive politically imposed reorganization across the industry.</p><p>That's a very bad idea, and if you had any doubt, watch it win plaudits from both sides in Washington.</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-1219471</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMS-DGD1-JDJ6-K34H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><timeReceived>12:51 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Consumer demand for innovative products and services has allowed these technology giants to realize rapid growth and also market preeminence.</p><p>Recent times have featured populist backlash against the scale and power of these data monopolies, concern over harmful online content or behavior, cybercrime, and political misinformation.</p><p>But breaking up large tech companies, as advocated by Sen. Warren and others, is a flawed solution. It overstates the consequences of being \u201cbig,\u201d politicizes the role of competition regulators, and ultimately will hinder innovation and harm consumers.</p><p>Internationally, too, there is a growing call for government action to curb the strength of the tech giants. Most advanced economies are studying the adequacy of competition law over concerns about increasing market concentration in digital network sectors.</p><p>In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has begun public hearings to examine the need for new antitrust approaches. The FTC recently launched a\u00a0task force\u00a0to monitor technology markets, designed to investigate potential anti-competitive conduct in the digital sector.</p><p>The United Kingdom is also examining the role of competition in the digital economy. One recent\u00a0report by an expert panel, entitled \u201cUnlocking Digital Competition,\u201d recommended, among other things, a code of conduct for tech firms that would include mandated interoperability. Another report, by the House of Lords Committee on Communications, recommends a public-interest test for data mergers.</p><p>The European Commission began its study of competition in tech markets by releasing an expert\u00a0report\u00a0calling for stricter antitrust enforcement.</p><p>In Canada, there have calls for the modernization of competition laws by the senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, Carolyn Wilkins, and by the Commons Committee, in its on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics\u00a0report.</p><p>These calls for action followed last year\u2019s Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal. In\u00a0response, the government notes that the current competition legislation provides important protections while it studies the results of its\u00a0National Digital and Data Consultations.</p><p>In 2018, during my tenure as Canada\u2019s Competition Commissioner, the Competition Bureau published an international, award-winning report entitled, \u201cBig Data and Innovation: Key Themes for Competition Policy in Canada.\u201d The study recognized that the emergence of companies that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement. But at the same time, it confirmed the sufficiency of the current antitrust framework in this space.</p><p>The report clarified that the Competition Bureau will not condemn companies merely because they are \u201cbig\u201d or possess valuable big data. A fundamental principle of antitrust is that business success ought not be condemned or punished, even if that leads to dominant firms and concentrated markets.</p><p>To do otherwise would harm incentives to innovate and deprive markets of important efficiencies like economies of scale and scope. These insights also apply to big data, where efficiencies may relate to network effects.</p><p>Competition enforcement agencies need to apply an evidence-based approach and demonstrate actual economic harm before taking action. Big data holds considerable promise to increase economic efficiency and innovate business practices. It\u2019s important for antitrust regulators to maintain a degree of humility and recognize that far-reaching, populist proposals are ill-advised.</p><p>Antitrust law has limits; it should not be expected to address all social problems. There are other laws and policies to address those. For instance, tax laws are better suited to correct wealth inequality, and privacy laws are better suited to safeguard personal data.</p><p>The proposal to dismantle large technology companies by unwinding already completed mergers and to prohibit platform owners from participating on their own platforms is flawed. A respect for property rights and the freedom of contract are fundamental tenets of a free-market economy. So is competition policy that enables long-term economic growth benefiting businesses and consumers alike.</p><p>Expropriating the property rights of a successful company is a veritable \u201cnuclear option\u201d in antitrust law, especially when less intrusive remedies exist. The more dramatic approach would cause significant damage to the economy if it were to use antitrust law to break up large companies in an effort to remedy broad public-interest concerns.</p><p>Restricting successful companies reduces incentives to innovate, invest, and compete. Competition-enforcement agencies must be empowered to make evidence-based decisions using economic analysis to deal with antitrust issues.</p><p>Theories and the quest for political wins should not drive policymakers to take hasty actions in the shaping of our markets. Let\u2019s exercise care in wielding our regulatory hammers.</p><p>John Pecman is a senior business adviser in the antitrust/competition and marketing group at Canadian law firm Fasken.

In an interview[6] with Bloomberg's Erik Schatzker, Gates discussed global inequality[7], climate change, and the responsibilities of big tech companies. Schatzker brought up the tech industry amid a slew of antitrust probes into Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple. Gates went through his own antitrust lawsuit[8] when the company he co-founded, Microsoft, was sued by the Department of Justice and a coalition of 20 state attorneys general in 1998. Since losing the case, Gates's opinion on government regulation has evolved. Here are his thoughts. Bill Gates says that big tech companies are not breaking the law. ReutersIn June, the Department of Justice announced antitrust reviews of Google and Apple. The Federal Trade Commission, meanwhile, is tackling Amazon and Facebook in antitrust reviews of their own. Both government entities[9] are investigating whether the tech giants have been stifling competition in their respective fields. When Schatzker asked about what obligations corporations have to act ethically and prevent antitrust probes in the first place, Gates started off by saying that none of them were breaking the law. \"The tax rules incent you to structure in a certain way to minimize your taxes,\" Gates told Schatzker. The \"real question,\" he added, is whether those rules need to be changed going forward. Gates may have been referring to Amazon, which paid $0 in federal income tax for 2017 or 2018. Business Insider previously reported[10] that Amazon's tax breaks included stock-based compensation, research-and-development expenses and property and equipment investments.When discussing antitrust law, Gates is speaking from experience. Porter Gifford/Getty ImagesIn May 1998, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Microsoft[11] for monopolizing nearly every arena of computers: hardware, software, and finally, the internet. Microsoft[12] was late in the game when it introduced its internet browser, Internet Explorer, in 1995. By then browser company Netscape had already gained traction. To make sure Internet Explorer was the most-used of the two, Microsoft bundled it in with Windows, so over 90% of computer users would have have it has a default. In a recent look back at the antitrust case, Verge writer Adi Robertson described[13] the practice as \"Microsoft controlling access to the web itself.\" In the end, Microsoft was seen as a tech monopoly bent on crushing its competitors. It lost the case[14], and was sentenced to breaking itself up into smaller entities made up of its various divisions. The US Department of Justice dropped the ruling in 2001, so Microsoft never actually had to split up. But it did relax its barriers to third-party developers, opening the operating system up to competitors[15] like Netscape, Mozilla Firefox, and eventually, Google Chrome. Today, less than 3%[16] of worldwide users surf the web on Internet Explorer. Gates's present-day argument in defense of big tech companies \u2014 that they're merely being innovative, not monopolizing \u2014 is similar to Microsoft's defense back in 1998[17]. Gates told Schatzker, however, that his views have changed in the last two decades. \"I was naive about this, but that was a long time ago, and I didn't realize that as Microsoft gets itself \u2014 that we'd come under scrutiny,\" Gates said. \"And we went through our thing back in the 90s, and that's made us more thoughtful about this kind of activity.\"Gates is a supporter of government regulation. Getty ImagesIn a time when social media influences politics and likely divides people along ideological lines[18], Gates says tech companies shouldn't be relied on to solve the problems they had a hand in creating. While Gates doesn't blame any specific social media companies for these issues, he does think the government should work with tech giants to solve them. \"I do think the government really needs to talk about what those rules should be,\" Gates said. \"It's not, you could say, unbiased, but I see these as well-meaning, highly innovative companies, that it's up to society to make sure that their innovation doesn't have negative side effects.\" See Also: Bill Gates says where you were born is the biggest predictor of your success \u2014 and it's a glaring sign of global inequality[19]Where
